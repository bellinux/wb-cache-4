50|$|Computation-aided {{design has}} also been used to {{engineer}} complex properties of a highly ordered nano-protein assembly. A protein cage, E. coli bacterioferritin (EcBfr), which naturally shows structural instability and an incomplete self-assembly behavior by populating two oligomerization states, is the model protein in this study. Through computational analysis and comparison to its homologs, {{it has been found}} that this protein has a smaller-than-average dimeric interface on its two-fold symmetry axis due mainly to the existence of an interfacial <b>water</b> <b>pocket</b> centered on two water-bridged asparagine residues. To investigate the possibility of engineering EcBfr for modified structural stability, a semi-empirical computational method is used to virtually explore the energy differences of the 480 possible mutants at the dimeric interface relative to the wild type EcBfr. This computational study also converges on the water-bridged asparagines. Replacing these two asparagines with hydrophobic amino acids results in proteins that fold into alpha-helical monomers and assemble into cages as evidenced by circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy. Both thermal and chemical denaturation confirm that, all redesigned proteins, in agreement with the calculations, possess increased stability. One of the three mutations shifts the population in favor of the higher order oligomerization state in solution as shown by both size exclusion chromatography and native gel electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|A {{boreal forest}} wetland (L 979) was flooded in 1993 at the Experimental Lakes Area, Ontario to imitate a {{hydroelectric}} reservoir and {{to study the}} effects of flooding on greenhouse gas production and emission. Flooding initially caused CO&# 8322; and CH 4 emission rates to increase and changed the wetland from a small, natural carbon sink to a large source of carbon. The increased production of greenhouse gases in the peatland also caused the majority of the peat to float to the surface creating floating peat islands, within 4 years of flooding. The floating peat islands are a larger source than the central pond of CH 4 to the atmosphere due to the high water table and small oxidation zone as compared to the earlier undisturbed peatland. The floating peat islands had an average flux of 202 ± 66 mg C-CH 4 /m²/day comparable to rates measured in 1995. Methane flux rates are spatially and temporally variable ranging from ? 117 to 3430 mg C-CH 4 /m²/day. The variability is partly due to episodic releases of gas bubbles and changes in overlying pressure from the water table. The development of floating peat islands created an underlying <b>water</b> <b>pocket.</b> The <b>water</b> <b>pocket</b> increased water movement between the central pond and the peatland and led to increased peat temperatures and methane oxidation, and removal of debris from the <b>water</b> <b>pocket.</b> DIC, CH 4, and O&# 8322; concentrations, and &# 948; 13 C-DIC, &# 948; 13 -CH 4, and &# 948; 18 O-O&# 8322; values in the <b>water</b> <b>pocket</b> were similar to values in the central pond. Before flooding, the &# 948; 13 C-CH 4 values from the peatland ranged between ? 36 and ? 72 ? indicating that about 65 to 90 % of the methane was oxidized before flooding. After flooding, the median &# 948; 13 C-CH 4 value from the floating peat islands was ? 52 ? indicating that about 30 % of the methane was oxidized before it was emitted to the atmosphere. Since the floating islands are now vegetated, photosynthesis and transport via plants allow the movement of oxygen into the peat islands Methane oxidation in the central pond was similar in 2001 and 2002. DIC and CH 4 isotope mass budgets from June 3 to September 23, 2002 indicate that inputs were smaller than outputs at L 979. Calculated net DIC and CH 4 production in the central pond was 8490 and 432 kg C, with &# 948; 13 C-DIC of - 18. 5 ? and &# 948; 13 C-CH 4 of - 32. 5 ?. Decomposition of peat was the source of DIC and CH 4. O&# 8322; saturation levels indicate that the pond is always undersaturated and that respiration dominates the system; however, the &# 948; 18 O-O&# 8322; also indicates that photosynthesis is an important process in the central pond of L 979. The peat islands contributed about 90 % of the total CH 4 flux, whereas the open water areas contributed 10 %. This indicates that formation of peat islands in a hydroelectric area can significantly affect the greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. The average flux of CH 4 from the entire wetland in 2002 was 202 ± 77 mg C-CH 4 /m²/day, equivalent to 44 ± 17 g C-CH 4 /m²/year (year = 220 days). This is higher than preflood values of 0. 5 g C-CH 4 /m²/year in 1992, and the early post-flood value of 8. 9 g C-CH 4 /m²/year in 1993 / 1994. The wetland continues to emit methane after ten years of flooding at higher than preflood rates...|$|E

Essential oils (EOs), plant extracts, possess the required antimicrobial activities and thus their usage stands out as a feasible approach for controlling the undesirable bacterial growth in food systems. However, EOs are highly volatile and lose their activity upon exposure to environmental conditions. In this regard, their encapsulation in Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) matrices such as food grade polysaccharides especially iota-carrageenan {{could be one of}} the viable alternatives. Iota-carrageenan, sulfated polysaccharide from marine algae, is being used in food, pharmaceutical and medical application as a gelling and thickening agent. Ordered networks composed of <b>water</b> <b>pockets</b> of the dimensions of EOs could be created by stretching the oriented fibers of iota-carrageenan. These <b>water</b> <b>pockets</b> readily encapsulate the EOs, protect from external stresses, e. g. heat, light, moisture, and release in a controlled manner. Herein, two EOs, carvacrol and eugenol mixed in ethanol and Tween 80 were encapsulated in sodium salt form of iota-carrageenan fibers. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Listeria innocua F 4248, Listeria monocytogenes F 4244, Salmonella Enteritidis ENT 1344, Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg 513, Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7 ATCC 43295, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 using the disc diffusion and macro brothdilution assay. Results reveal that the complexes dissolve in the deionized water and EO release in about 40 mins. The complexing, indeed, have inhibitory effect on the growth of the microorganisms, especially in significantly reducing the proliferation of L. monocytogenes and L. innocua. Overall, the intrinsic functionality of essential oils could be preserved by encapsulating them in the ordered polysaccharide matrices for inhibiting the growth of spoilage microorganisms in food systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of {{the small size of}} a water molecule as contributing to the hydrophobic effect is examined from simulations of n-dodecane in different solvents. The earlier observations of the origin of hydrophobicity, derived from cavity formations by Pratt and Pohorille (1992, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 89 : 2995 - 2999) and Madan and Lee (1994, Biophys.

40|$|We {{characterize}} the water repartition within the partially saturated (two-phase) zone (PSZ) during evaporation out of mixed wettable porous media by controlling the wettability of glass beads, their sizes, {{and as well}} the surrounding relative humidity. Here, Capillary numbers are low and under these conditions, the percolating front is stabilized by gravity.

Results also reveal that the extent (height) of the PSZ, as well as water saturation in the PSZ, both increase with wettability. We also numerically calculate the saturation exclusively contained in connected liquid films and results show that values are less than the expected PSZ saturation. These results strongly reflect that the two-phase zone is not solely made up of connected capillary networks, but also made of disconnected <b>water</b> clusters or <b>pockets.</b> Moreover, we also find that global saturation (PSZ + full wet zone) decreases with wettability, confirming that greater quantity of water is lost via evaporation with increasing hydrophilicity.

40|$|International audienceHolocene glaciers {{have contributed}} to an {{abundance}} of unstable sediments in mountainous environments. In permafrostenvironments, these sediments can contain ground ice and are subject to rapid geomorphic activity and evolution undercondition of a warming climate. To understand the influence of ground ice distribution on this activity since the Little Ice Age(LIA), we have investigated the Pierre Ronde and Rognes proglacial areas, two cirque glacier systems located in the periglacial beltof the Mont Blanc massif. For the first time, electrical resistivity tomography, temperature data loggers and differential global positioningsystems (dGPS) are combined with historical documents and glaciological data analysis to produce a complete study of evolutionin time and space of these small landsystems since the LIA. This approach allows to explain spatial heterogeneity of current internalstructure and dynamics. The studied sites are a complex assemblage of debris-covered glacier, ice-rich frozen debris and unfrozendebris. Ground ice distribution is related to former glacier thermal regime, isolating effect of debris cover, water supply to specificzones, and topography. In relation with this internal structure, present dynamics are dominated by rapid ice melt in the debriscoveredupper slopes, slow creep processes in marginal glacigenic rock glaciers, and weak, superficial reworking in deglaciatedmoraines. Since the LIA, geomorphic activity is mainly spatially restricted within the proglacial areas. Sediment exportation hasoccurred in a limited part of the former Rognes Glacier and through <b>water</b> <b>pocket</b> outburst flood and debris flows in Pierre Ronde. Both sites contributed little sediment supply to the downslope geomorphic system, rather by episodic events than by constant supply.

However, the detailed mechanism of neutralization remains unclear. We conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations {{to study the}} interactions between Ig- 2 D 1 and the HAs from the 1918 pandemic flu (A/South Carolina/ 1 / 1918, 18 HA), the 2009 pandemic flu (A/California/ 04 / 2009, 09 HA), a 2009 pandemic flu mutant (A/California/ 04 / 2009, 09 HA_mut), and the 2006 seasonal flu (A/Solomon Islands/ 3 / 2006, 06 HA). MM-PBSA analyses suggest the approximate free energy of binding (ΔG) between Ig- 2 D 1 and 18 HA is − 74. 4  kcal/mol. In comparison with 18 HA, 09 HA and 06 HA bind Ig- 2 D 1 ∼ 6  kcal/mol (ΔΔG) weaker, and the 09 HA_mut bind Ig- 2 D 1 only half as strong. We also analyzed the contributions of individual epitope residues using the free-energy decomposition method. Two important salt bridges are found between the HAs and Ig- 2 D 1. In 09 HA, a serine-to-asparagine mutation coincided with a salt bridge destabilization, hydrogen bond losses, and a <b>water</b> <b>pocket</b> formation between 09 HA and Ig- 2 D 1. In 09 HA_mut, a lysine-to-glutamic-acid mutation leads {{to the loss of}} both salt bridges and destabilizes interactions with Ig- 2 D 1. Even though 06 HA has a similar ΔG to 09 HA, it is not recognized by Ig- 2 D 1 in vivo.

Optical and infrared measurements probe at most the top few cm of the surface layer and indicate the presence of layered volcanics and sediments, but {{it is likely that}} permafrost, hydrothermal deposits, and transient liquid <b>water</b> <b>pockets</b> occur at depths of meters to kilometers within the crust. An orbital synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide constraints on surface roughness, the depth of fine-grained aeolian or volcanic deposits, and the presence of strongly absorbing near-surface deposits such as carbonates. This information is crucial to the successful landing and operation of any rover designed to search for subsurface water. A rover-based ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can reveal layering in the upper crust, the presence of erosional or other subsurface horizons, depth to a permafrost layer, and direct detection of near-surface transient liquid water. We detail here the radar design parameters likely to provide the best information for Mars, based on experience with SAR and GPR in analogous terrestrial or planetary environments...|$|R
