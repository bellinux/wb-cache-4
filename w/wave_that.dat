5|$|A {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> crossed Central America {{organized and}} {{developed into a}} tropical depression on June 27. Contrary to forecasts, the depression did not strengthen further because of strong wind shear. By June 29, the depression had become a remnant low, which was observed as a swirl of clouds {{for a few more}} days before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong force, {{as well as by}} degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus. When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a shock <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> propagates outward. The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core. This reduces the energy of the shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Charley {{began as}} a {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa in early August 2004. Tracking westward, the system gradually organized and was declared a tropical depression on August9 while located roughly 115mi (185km) south-southeast of Barbados. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Charley after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea. Quickly tracking northwest, the small storm intensified.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Georges {{began as}} a {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> moved {{off the coast of}} Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. The storm reached its peak intensity on September20 with winds of 155mph (250km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Michelle {{developed}} from a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> {{moved across the}} Atlantic, and formed into a tropical depression on October 29. Convection increased, and the system formed into Tropical Storm Michelle on November 1. It strengthened further, reaching its peak strength as a Category 4. One of only four November Category 4 hurricanes, Michelle made landfall on south-central Cuba with winds of 140mph (225km/h), the strongest Cuban landfall since Hurricane Fox in the 1952 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Rick's {{ultimate}} origin was {{a tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> left Africa on October 15. While crossing the Atlantic, the wave was mainly tracked by continuity {{due to its}} lack or organization. After entering the Pacific, part of it developed cloudiness on November 5 when it was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Organization and a circulation developed, and satellite tracking began on November 6. The disturbance became better organized and formed into Tropical Depression Nineteen-E on November 7.|$|E
5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, a few {{individuals}} accelerate and change direction, which initiates an escape <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools.|$|E
5|$|Nora formed {{early on}} September 16, 1997, while located 290miles (460km) {{southwest}} of the Mexican port of Acapulco, Guerrero, from the same tropical <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> had earlier created Hurricane Erika. Due to favorable conditions associated with El Niño, the tropical disturbance quickly achieved deep convection and became well-organized. By 6 a.m. UTC, the U.S. National Hurricane Center had designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression Sixteen-E. Half a day later, it had gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Nora.|$|E

5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18. Some sources state that the area of convection was joined by a low-level vortex that entered the area, eventually forming a depression. Others believe that the origins of Becky can be tracked back to a tropical <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on July 9.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the same}} {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> formed Tropical Storm Danny in the Atlantic crossed over the Isthmus of Panama and became a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during mid to late September. On September 20 the cloud pattern had increased in organization and the system was designated a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Bonnie {{were in a}} {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> emerged from the coast of Africa on July 29 and entered the Atlantic Ocean. It moved westward, attaining convection and a mid-level circulation. Convection steadily increased, and, upon {{the development of a}} low-level circulation center, the system organized into Tropical Depression Two on August 3 while 415miles (670km) east of Barbados. It moved rapidly westward at speeds of up to 23mph (37km/h); after crossing through the Lesser Antilles on August 4, it degenerated back into a tropical wave.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Fausto {{were from a}} {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> emerged into the eastern Atlantic Ocean from {{the west coast of}} Africa on August11. It crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean uneventfully. The tropical wave ultimately entered the Eastern Pacific Basin on August 17. Rapidly organizing, the system was classified using the Dvorak technique at 1800UTC on August18. Although a broad closed circulation was present on August19, the system became less organized and thus was not immediately classified as a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Florence {{were from a}} {{tropical}} <b>wave</b> <b>that</b> moved through the Lesser Antilles into the eastern Caribbean on September21. The wave tracked generally westward, and spawned a tropical storm on September23 about 100mi (160km) southeast of Jamaica. Given the name Florence, the storm steadily intensified after developing, although a well-defined circulation was not observed until September24. That day, Florence attained hurricane status in the Yucatán Channel between the Yucatán Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba.|$|E
