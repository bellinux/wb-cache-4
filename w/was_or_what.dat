25|$|Thomas D'Arcy McGee, an Irish-Montreal journalist, {{became a}} Father of Confederation in 1867. An Irish Republican {{in his early}} years, he would {{moderate}} his view in later years and become a passionate advocate of Confederation. He was instrumental in enshrining educational rights for Catholics as a minority group in the Canadian Constitution. In 1868, he was assassinated in Ottawa. Historians are not sure who the murderer <b>was,</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> were his motivations. One theory is that a Fenian, Gaylord O'Neiel Whelan, was the assassin, attacking McGee for his recent anti-Raid statements. Others argue that Whelan {{was used as a}} scapegoat.|$|E
500|$|Following the divorce, Jackson {{would go}} on to have a third child. Prince Michael II was born on February 21, 2002, to an unnamed {{surrogate}} mother. Rowe denied being the biological mother of Prince Michael II, who is nicknamed [...] "Blanket". Jackson stated that the baby was produced through artificial insemination using his own sperm cells. He further claimed {{that he did not know}} the mother, and she did not know him. The pop star added that in asking for a surrogate mother, he did not care how old she <b>was</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> race she was. It did, however, matter to him that she was intelligent, healthy, and had uncorrected eyesight.|$|E

500|$|The {{image was}} shot by {{photographer}} Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot ("we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover <b>was</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> time we took it," [...] said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane spotted a dealer friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title {{on one of the}} road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.|$|E
500|$|Nonetheless {{for all of}} {{his wealth}} and {{innovation}} Little's ignominious end ensured he was quickly forgotten, and by the time Edwin Lefèvre published his now-classic Reminiscences of a Stock Operator in 1923 he was virtually unknown. To demonstrate this Lefèvre details asking nine seasoned members of the NYSE whether or not they had ever heard of Jacob Little before; only three of them did, and none could name who he <b>was</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> he had done, only knowing of his existence from having heard his name before. Lefèvre provided for this fact by saying [...] "what happened to Jacob was no more than what happens to thousands every year. The difference in degree does not make it more memorable." [...] Though it had once been that [...] "on change his tread was that of a king", today Little has been relegated to obscurity, and survives only as a footnote in histories of the stock market.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he <b>was</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> he was going to do next ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's going to do next, who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the male}} islanders {{utilised}} {{their knowledge of the}} Firth's currents to hire themselves out to passing vessels as maritime pilots. Their expertise was the product of a lifetime's experience on the waters of the Firth; as it was said, they had been [...] "dabbling in salt water from their childhood upwards". Indeed, the whole island was drenched in salt water thrown up by the powerful tides and storms to which it was subjected, particularly in the winter. The Statistical Account of Scotland noted that during a storm the sea level on the west of the island was more than two fathoms [...] higher than on the east side, and that the spray was thrown so high that it washed over the cliff tops [...] "and falls in such profusion as to run in rills to the opposite shore". The islanders took advantage of this phenomenon by capturing the water in a reservoir to power a watermill which ground their grain in the winter months. It is not now known exactly where the mill <b>was</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> happened to it. Although it is described in the Statistical Account, written in the 1790s, and a Robert Miller is listed in the 1851 census as its miller, by 1861 he had moved to farm a five-acre croft and no further mention is made of the mill in contemporary accounts.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to several}} accounts, Captain Marr {{challenged}} the riders, asking something like [...] "What cavalry is that?" [...] These {{would have been}} his last words. Scattered shots were fired as the Union cavalry rode through and Captain Marr fell dead. Some other accounts say he was killed while scouting out a better position for his men a little distance away from their line and do not mention {{a challenge to the}} Union horsemen. Whether he had moved up to challenge the Union riders or to scout out a better position for his company as some accounts suggest, Marr was not in the immediate presence or line of sight of any of his men on the very dark night when he fell in the dense field. Soon, no one knew where he <b>was</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> may have happened to him. His body was found in the clover field later in the morning.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an account}} first {{published}} in 1999 by the widely cited newsletter Taylorology, on October 21, 1964, while still living in Hollywood, Gibson suffered a heart attack. Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibson—a recently converted Roman Catholic—asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor <b>was</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> she was talking about. As a result, he could not remember many further details about what Gibson said as she lay dying on the kitchen floor of her small house. The witness did recall Gibson also said she had been [...] "nearly caught" [...] and had [...] "fled the country".|$|E
2500|$|Ron Froman {{was later}} elected Chief, {{by which time}} his views on the Chief Illiniwek symbol had changed. His {{opinions}} shifted following meetings with American Indian students attending the University. In April 2000, the tribal council, with Chief Froman's support, passed by the margin of 3 to 2 a resolution requesting [...] "the leadership of the University of Illinois to recognize the demeaning nature of the characterization of Chief Illiniwek, and cease use of this mascots [...] ". Froman said, [...] "I don't know what the origination <b>was,</b> <b>or</b> <b>what</b> the reason was for the university to create Chief Illiniwek. I don't think it was to honor us, because, hell, they ran our (butts) out of Illinois." [...] This puts Chief Illiniwek in a position {{different from that of}} the mascots of other schools such as Florida State University, whose American Indian mascots are not opposed by the leadership of the corresponding tribes. In 2005, a new Chief, John P. Froman, when asked his position by the NCAA, indicated that [...] "the Chief was not representative of our tribe and culture, mainly because the costume is Sioux." [...] In 2006, in response to a widely published column by journalist George Will in support of the symbol's use, he wrote a letter reiterating the Peoria Tribe's opposition to the symbol and decrying that the [...] "University of Illinois has ignored the tribe's request for nearly five years." ...|$|E
