Friedrich Wilhelm starts from Berlin, with the opening Year, on his long march; the Horse-troops first, Foot to follow at their swiftest; he himself (his Wife, his ever-true [...] "Louisa," [...] accompanying, as her wont was) travels, towards the end, at the rate of [...] "sixty miles a day." [...] He gets in still in time, finds Konigsberg unscathed. Nay it is even said, the Swedes are extensively falling sick; having, after a long famine, found infinite [...] "pigs, near Insterburg," [...] in those remote regions, and indulged in the fresh pork overmuch.|$|R

40|$|The new Companies Act 71 of 2008 {{came into}} effect on 1 May 2011 {{repealing}} the Companies Act of 1973. The 2008 Companies Act retained provisions {{relating to the}} <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> insolvent companies, in particular Chapter 14. It is submitted {{that even though the}} 1973 Companies Act has been repealed and only Chapter 14 has been retained for the <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> insolvent companies, Chapter 14 cannot be applied in isolation without considering the provisions relating to the <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> insolvent companies that fall outside the ambit of Chapter 14 of the 1973 Companies Act. This research proposes a unification of provisions relating the <b>winding-up</b> <b>of</b> both solvent and insolvent companies in a single piece of legislation. Chapter 1 introduces the dissertation. Chapter 2 consists of a brief overview of the development of corporate law in South Africa. Chapter 3 will focus on a descriptive and comparative approach illustrating between single and dual systems, specifically those in between the USA and England, as well as discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the systems. Chapter 4 contains a discussion on the relationship between the 1973 and 2008 Companies Acts in view of their respective liquidation proceedings of insolvent companies. Chapter 5 consists of an analysis of the Draft Bill Proposals in context of a unified bill and corporate legislation. Lastly, Chapter 6 will draw conclusions.
