500|$|Meanwhile, {{prolonged}} operations {{outside of}} Phuoc Tuy {{during the first}} half of 1968 had placed considerable strain on the Australian logistic system. Australian logistic resupply arrangements for Operation Toan Thang I had been modelled on the experience of Operation Coburg, and again required the Vung Tau-based 1 ALSG to be split in order to provide a forward logistic element at the US base at Long Binh. A forward task force maintenance area had also been established, first at Bearcat and then later at FSB Coral. Re-supply by road had continued daily from Long Binh to Bearcat, while following the move to Coral re-supply was primarily by air due to the threat of possible interdiction. Movement from unit echelons in the forward maintenance area was also undertaken by helicopter. Units in the field received one fresh meal each day, with the other two meals based half on the American C ration and half on the Australian combat ration. Although the supply of fuel and ammunition was generally satisfactory, stocks had run dangerously low on one occasion during heavy fighting at FSB Coral due to the calculation of usage rates based on previous operations, requiring an emergency night-time resupply by Chinook while the base was under attack. Re-supply of water had also been particularly difficult due to unavailability of a permanent <b>water</b> <b>point.</b> Ultimately water had to be delivered by air from Long Binh at a rate of [...] per day using rubber fuel bladders.|$|E

Kangaroo densities were not significantly related to water proximity and did not significantly differ between open and closed <b>watering</b> <b>points.</b> Infrared sensors detected and counted kangaroo movements to and from artificial <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> and these were positively correlated with temperature. However, line transect counts did not reveal a shift in kangaroo distributions to water-proximate areas in warmer seasons.

Vegetation surveys, using a wheel point device, revealed that the biomass of Atriplex spp. decreased significantly with increased proximity to artificial <b>watering</b> <b>points,</b> but the biomass of Poaceae spp. and numerous forbs did not. Vegetative diversity was unrelated to water proximity. Low vegetation biomass near artificial <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> in Sturt National Park may be more correctly attributed to the effects from past sheep-grazing pressure, than to any current grazing pressure.

A trench, [...] "knee-deep in certain stretches and waist-deep in others" [...] defined the base's perimeter and connected the base's twenty-two bunkers. Like any typical late-war FSB, most of Mary Ann's bunkers were made from converted metal shipping containers known as conexes. In addition to the conex bunkers, Mary Ann had over thirty assorted structures (hootches, sandbagged bunkers, and other makeshift structures). The southeast end of FSB Mary Ann housed the Battalion Tactical Operations Center (B-TOC) and Company Command Post (CP), both located next to a small VIP helipad. The base's mess halls, a communication center, the Battalion aid station, ammunition bunkers, storage for general supplies, and two artillery firing positions were also located at this end of the FSB. The northwest end of the base housed a second artillery position with two 155mm howitzers, the fire direction center and the artillery command post. The saddle between the two ends of the FSB served as the resupply helipad.

40|$|Many {{national}} parks in Australian rangelands were formerly grazing properties. Even after domestic stock has been removed, the landscapes, especially those near artificial <b>watering</b> <b>points,</b> remained degraded {{with little or}} no regeneration of native plants. Congregating large macropods have often been blamed for impeding regeneration of plant communities and rehabilitation of these degraded landscapes. Following a severe drought which reduced densities of large macropods very significantly in Idalia National Park, central-western Queensland, I investigated whether closure of <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> would hamper their recolonisation and influence their grazing distribution and forage selection in the park. I also determined the spatial and temporal pattern of degradation around the <b>watering</b> <b>points,</b> using a suite of indicators. A BACI (Before After Control Impact) type experiment was conducted using two replicate <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> each for impact (fenced) and control (unfenced) treatments. Two <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> were fenced off behind a kangaroo-proof fence in August and December 2002, respectively, in the deepening drought. Walked 4 km line transects were used to estimate densities of red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) and wallaroos (M. robustus) in areas within a 4 km radius of each <b>watering</b> <b>point.</b> The accumulation of dung pellets was used to estimate the grazing distribution of large macropods around water. Abundance and composition of vegetation were monitored on fixed transects using a 0. 5 * 0. 5 m quadrat 0. 5 to 4 km from each <b>watering</b> <b>point.</b> Herbivore offtake was monitored using a movable cage technique. Measures of landscape function (stability, infiltration and nutrient rating) and ant composition were monitored at various distances from each <b>watering</b> <b>point.</b> Monitoring was commenced two to six months before the closure of <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> and completed 21 and 25 months following the closure, every two to five monthly to follow changes in large macropod densities and vegetation communities. Prior to the drought, densities up to 130 large macropods km- 2 were recorded in the park. The average density of wallaroos declined by 97. 7 % during the drought whereas that of red kangaroos declined by 83. 8 %. The first substantial rain fell in January 2003, but rainfall throughout the study period continued to be much lower than the long-term median, except for January 2004 when more than half the average annual rainfall fell, causing major flooding. Closure of <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> coincident with the drought inhibited red kangaroo recolonisation by 40 % in the areas surrounding fenced <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> for up to 21 months following the closure, with distances to alternative <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> being 3. 8 - 6. 6 km. Red kangaroos in an area surrounding one of the unfenced <b>watering</b> <b>point</b> recovered to the pre-drought average density. The grazing distribution of large macropods within 4 km from the <b>watering</b> <b>points,</b> however, was determined primarily by where plentiful food resources were, not by the location of water. Large macropods in the areas without access to water did not select forage with higher water contents, compared to those in the areas with water access. Differences in their forage preference between the two areas appeared to reflect the difference in vegetation composition between the areas. Sida filiformis, Cynodon dactylon and Tragus australianus, were identified as grazing sensitive plant species. In some cases, closing <b>watering</b> <b>points</b> helped these plants to increase their abundance following the drought. Most indicators (the percentage of bare soil, biomasses of perennial grasses and round-leaved chenopods, ant functional groups and the measures of landscape function) showed that the exclusion of mammalian grazing {{for more than a decade}} from long-term exclosures had facilitated regeneration of perennial grasses and landscape rehabilitation at least at some sites. At one long-term exclosure, where topsoil and seed bank had presumably been lost already, no regeneration occurred. When several indicators were used to determine land conditions around <b>watering</b> <b>points,</b> their responses were not always consistent. Nevertheless, the overall spatial patterns of degradation did not match the spatial pattern of grazing distribution by large macropods around water. Therefore, the current degradation appears to be a legacy of the livestock overgrazing that had continued for more than 100 years prior to the park establishment. The large drought-induced reduction in the large macropod densities did not result in any conspicuous reversal of the patterns of degradation around the <b>watering</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R
