Since the IAU XXIV {{meeting in}} 2000, the CMB {{anisotropy}} has matured from {{being one of}} a number of cosmological probes to forming the bedrock foundation for what is now the standard model of cosmology. The large advances over the past three years have come from making better and better maps of the cosmos. We review the state of measurements of the anisotropy and outline some of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>learned</b> since 2000. The recent advancements may be placed roughly into three categories: 1) <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> from the CMB with minimal input from other cosmic measurements such as the Hubble constant; 2) <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> from the CMB in combination with other probes of large scale structure; and 3) <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> by using the CMB as a back light.

[...] said James, the mutineer; {{and knocked}} down a hand which the infuriated Baronet raised against him, with an arm that was twice {{as strong as}} Barnes's own. This man and maid {{followed}} their mistress in the sad journey upon which she was bent. They treated her with unalterable respect. They never could be got to see that her conduct was wrong.

6000|$|That Mr. Howells gave unequivocal {{indications}} of possessing this fine quality interested {{us in his}} modest preludings. Marked, as they no doubt were, by some uncertainty of aim and indefiniteness of thought, that [...] "stinting," [...] as Chaucer calls it, of the nightingale [...] "ere he beginneth sing," [...] {{there was nothing in}} them of the presumption and extravagance which young authors are so apt to mistake for originality and vigor. Sentiment predominated over reflection, as was fitting in youth; but there was a refinement, an instinctive reserve of phrase, and a felicity of epithet, only too rare in modern, and especially in American writing. He was evidently a man more eager to make something good than to make a sensation,--one of those authors more rare than ever in our day of hand-to-mouth cleverness, who has a conscious ideal of excellence, and, as we hope, the patience that will at length reach it. We made occasion to find out something about him, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> served to increase our interest. This delicacy, it appeared, was a product of the rough-and-ready West, this finish the natural gift of a young man with no advantage of college-training, who, passing from the compositor's desk to the editorship of a local newspaper, had been his own faculty of the humanities. But there are some men who are born cultivated. A singular fruit, we thought, of our shaggy democracy,--as interesting a phenomenon in that regard as it has been our fortune to encounter. Where is the rudeness of a new community, the pushing vulgarity of an imperfect civilization, the licentious contempt of forms that marks our unchartered freedom, and all the other terrible things which have so long been the bugaboos of European refinement? Here was a natural product, as perfectly natural as the deliberate attempt of [...] "Walt Whitman" [...] to answer the demand of native and foreign misconception was perfectly artificial. Our institutions do not, then, irretrievably doom us to coarseness and to impatience of that restraining precedent which alone makes true culture possible and true art attainable. Unless we are mistaken, there is something in such an example as that of Mr. Howells which is a better argument for the American social and political system than any empirical theories that can be constructed against it.|$|E

"Why," [...] said Eeldrop, [...] "was {{that fat}} Spaniard, who {{sat at the}} table with us this evening, and listened to our {{conversation}} with occasional curiosity, why was he himself for a moment an object of interest to us? He wore his napkin tucked into his chin, he made unpleasant noises while eating, and while not eating, his way of crumbling bread between fat fingers made me extremely nervous: he wore a waistcoat cafe au lait, and black boots with brown tops. He was oppressively gross and vulgar; he belonged to a type, he could easily be classified in any town of provincial Spain. Yet under the circumstances--when we had been discussing marriage, and he suddenly leaned forward and exclaimed: 'I was married once myself'--we were able to detach him from his classification and regard him for a moment as an unique being, a soul, however insignificant, with a history of its own, once for all. It is these moments which we prize, and which alone are revealing. For any vital truth is incapable of being applied to another case: the essential is unique. Perhaps that is why it is so neglected: because it is useless. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> about that Spaniard is incapable of being applied to any other Spaniard, or even recalled in words. With the decline of orthodox theology and its admirable theory of the soul, the unique importance of events has vanished. A man is only important as he is classed. Hence there is no tragedy, or no appreciation of tragedy, which is the same thing. We had been talking of young Bistwick, who three months ago married his mother's housemaid and now is aware of the fact. Who appreciates the truth of the matter? Not the relatives, for they are only moved by affection, by regard for Bistwick's interests, and chiefly by their collective feeling of family disgrace. Not the generous minded and thoughtful outsider, who regards it merely as evidence for the necessity of divorce law reform. Bistwick is classed among the unhappily married. But what Bistwick feels when he wakes up in the morning, which is the great important fact, no detached outsider conceives. The awful importance of the ruin of a life is overlooked. Men are only allowed to be happy or miserable in classes. In Gopsum Street a man murders his mistress. The important fact is that for the man the act is eternal, and that for the brief space he has to live, he is already dead. He is already in a different world from ours. He has crossed the frontier. The important fact is that something is done which can not be undone--a possibility which none of us realize until we face it ourselves. For the man's neighbors the important fact is what the man killed her with? And at precisely what time? And who found the body? For the 'enlightened public' the case is merely evidence for the Drink question, or Unemployment, or some other category of things to be reformed. But the mediaeval world, insisting on the eternity of punishment, expressed something nearer the truth." ...|$|E
