500|$|In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong {{offensive}} numbers, {{finishing with}} a [...]325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of newly acquired fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two {{punch in the}} middle of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with pharyngitis, but got into hot water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Ramirez and Wilson both maintained that Manny <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> to his friend in that setting, and not actually drinking or partying as the media speculated. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a result. Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martínez had hit Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.|$|E
2500|$|Quarterback Kerry Collins led the Giants {{to victory}} by {{throwing}} for 381 yards and five {{touchdowns in the}} most lopsided game in NFC Championship Game history and the second most lopsided conference title game ever (after the 1990 AFC Championship Game). Meanwhile, the Giants shut out the Vikings by limiting them to only 114 offensive yards, sacking quarterback Daunte Culpepper four times, and forcing five turnovers, and handing the Vikings their first shutout and worst loss in their postseason history. New York wide receiver Ike Hilliard had 10 receptions for 155 yards and two touchdowns. The Minnesota sports community sometimes refers to this as [...] "41–doughnut" [...] after a post game comment from Randy Moss: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> to Daunte, and 41-to-doughnut, I think that's the worst defeat I've ever been in my life." [...] Culpepper completed only 13 of 28 passes for 78 yards, with three interceptions, while Moss caught only two passes for 18 yards.|$|E
2500|$|... "Attack" [...] {{had been}} around for a while and the band was unconvinced of its worth. The song proved to be {{somewhat}} problematic, and was nearly excluded from the album. During an interview in 2005, Jared Leto said [...] "'Attack' was a song that wasn't scheduled to be recorded at all. I'd been playing it – I'd play it in the desert in Morocco, I was playing it in Thailand – I was playing it everywhere." [...] When Jared tried performing the song {{with the rest of the}} band, something was wrong. [...] "On acoustic it was great; but when we played it as a band, it just fell flat on its face." [...] "As soon as the bass got in there…" [...] Matt Wachter continued. [...] "Yeah, so it was either replace Matt or throw the song out." [...] Jared played it acoustically for Josh Abraham; [...] "I was playing it outside of the studio one night on acoustic guitar and Josh walked out and, as a joke, I said 'Hey, you wanna hear a hit song?' I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking.</b> I started playing the verse and went into the chorus and he stopped me on the first chorus and said 'It's the best song you have. You have to record it'. So we all got in a circle and something about it changed. Something about us changed. And it became the first song on the record and the first single off our album. So he did a great job on encouraging us to do that song. And now I really love it." [...] Jared told Josh Abraham that night [...] "This song deserves to be a hit just so we can tell this story." ...|$|E

On the stout seaman’s face was the look of one who sees a vision many miles off; on the stout seaman’s head was a high hat of antique pattern which had suffered in the brushing. To avoid the mate’s eye he folded his arms and, leaning over the side, gazed across the river. Words trembled on the mate’s lips, but they died away in a squeak as a little top-hatted procession of three issued coyly from the forecastle and, ranging itself beside Mr. Jones, helped him to look across the river.|$|E
6000|$|Well, when I {{make up my}} mind to hit a man, I don't plan out a love-tap; no, that isn't my way; as long as I'm {{going to}} hit him at all, I'm going to hit him a lifter.
