5000|$|The 123rd Infantry {{landed at}} Lingayen Gulf on 10 February 1945, {{and moved to}} the front lines three days later. They {{relieved}} the 158th Regimental Combat Team of the Arizona Army National Guard. The first shots fired by the 33rd Division on Luzon were by the 123rd's Regimental Cannon Company, which fired 105mm M3 howitzers in a direct-fire role, and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese in the operations that followed. The first company to send out a patrol was B Company, 1-123. This patrol started out on 18 February and returned on the 24th. Strong enemy positions were encountered, and the patrol bypassed these areas to reach its objective. The first man to kill a Japanese soldier on Luzon was PFC Fay [...] "Tex" [...] Hough, a medic who was attached to C Company. He was attending a wounded man on the front when an enemy soldier popped up a short distance away. Hough finished him off and then completed his aid work. [...] Unlike in Europe, it was common for aid-men to carry weapons in the Pacific Theater because the Japanese did not follow the Geneva Conventions and often killed Allied medics with indiscretion. [...] 1-123 advanced on Rosario and from there moved along a highway to the foothills of Twin Peaks on the Kennon Road. Assigned with capturing these rugged peaks, two companies advanced up the slopes. As they approached the top, fierce opposition was encountered from well-concealed Japanese emplacements and the companies were forced to hold their positions. The Japanese were making a valiant defense of this area as it controlled the last water points on the routes leading to Baguio. [...] The Americans were soon relieved by a substantially larger force and the enemy retreated over the mountains. Intelligence reports later disclosed that an entire Japanese battalion had been operating against A Company. Moving by night, 1-123 arrived at San Luis near Pugo. B Company had already sent a patrol to secure the town. An interesting incident occurred here. LT Merle Fleenor was assigned with laying telephone wire as soon as the town had been secured. He and his crew arrived and found nobody there. He thought that the patrol had gone through the village and was continuing the advance. Once he installed his phones, he called back to headquarters when the patrol arrived. Fleenor and his two <b>wire</b> <b>section</b> men had arrived ahead of the patrol and had taken over. 1-123 captured three more peaks the following day without the loss of a single man. 2nd Battalion (2-123) advanced up the other flank of Pugo in order to seize the high ground between Damortis and Rosario. The day that 1-123 took the three peaks, 2-123 captured strategic high ground just beyond Pugo. The RCP (Regimental Command Post) was moved to Pugo. The Third Battalion (3-123) operated along the coast towards San Fernando. 2-123 advanced toward Mount Calugong and Mount Santo Tomas through difficult terrain, and bulldozers followed them to clear the way for support troops. After 30 days of fighting, the regiment advanced 13 miles, but still had 7 miles to go before they reached Baguio. [...] 3-123 relieved 2-123 and began the main effort. During the fighting in the mountains, units of 2-123 executed a brilliant night operation to capture strategic points on the route of advance. This night attack was so well undertaken that the Japanese were unaware that their strong emplacements had been occupied, and at daybreak the enemy was mowed down in great numbers as they emerged from their caves on the reverse side of the hill to man their positions. [...] In the fight to the highest point of terrain, K Company 3-123 launched a well-coordinated attack after first having an artillery barrage laid down less than a hundred yards to the front. Timed to perfection, the assault, which immediately followed the lifting of the barrage, caught the Japanese in their foxholes and the victory was achieved without any casualties. [...] 1-123, which was in I Corps reserve, rejoined the fight and attacked near Galiano. After numerous attacks on the enemy controlled high ground, the 123rd finally dislodged the Japanese from their strongpoints and the [...] "race to Baguio" [...] entered its final phase. F and G Companies of 2-123 performed admirably and were given awards after the mountain fighting. The 33rd Infantry Division and the 37th Infantry Division from the Ohio Army National Guard reached the outskirts of Baguio and the 123rd moved out of the mountains and into the valley near Tuba. G Company, sent to protect the regiment's left flank, annihilated two enemy companies as 3-123 neared the city limits. 3-123 nicknamed the brushy area near Baguio [...] "Times Square" [...] due to the heavy activity of enemy vehicles, including tanks. In the race for Baguio, it was rumored that the 33rd and the 37th Divisions erected road blocks to slow up the progress of the other: A patrol of C Company of 1-123 was the first to enter Baguio, but the final glory of taking the Summer Capital of the Philippines was divided between the two beleaguered divisions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This work {{focuses on}} {{analysis}} of optical transmittance images, which are captured {{at the end}} of the <b>wire</b> <b>section</b> of a pilot paper machine. The first priority is to evaluate the capability to estimate formation and floc size on the basis of optical transmittance and secondly analyse how process conditions affect them. Basis weight is one of the most important quality parameters in paper manufacturing. Optical transmittance seems to provide information about basis weight. Reliable evaluation of basis weight on the basis of image data would probably mean a new level of CD and MD profile controls. Formation means small-scale basis weight variation. Good formation e. g. improves the tensile strength and printability of produced paper. Camera unit located above and light source under the paper web {{at the end of}} the <b>wire</b> <b>section</b> to capture transmittance images, which were used to calculate several image features. Process and laboratory data were combined with image features for data based analysis. An increase in the basis weight, ash content and the dryness of the paper web seem to reduce the value of optical transmittance. On-line measured image features of optical transmittance were rather congruent with off-line defined reference values, especially the illumination corrected standard deviation of optical transmittance, which is connected to paper formation. Increased flow of headbox and lower consistency of pulp seemed to cause better formation as fewer flocs are formed. However, on the basis of analysis it is difficult to determine process conditions which provide with good formation and small floc size, because of the numerous interactions of process variables, the basis weight varied during experiments and it was difficult to keep other variables except the studied one constant...|$|E

40|$|A {{modification}} of the PaulâStraubel trap previously described by us may profitably be operated in a PaulâStraubelâKingdon (PSK) mode during the initial loading of an individual ion into the trap. Thereby the coating of the trap ring electrode by the atomic beam directed upon it in earlier experiments is eliminated, as is the ionization of an already trapped ion. Coating created serious problems as it spot-wise changed the work function of the ring electrode, which caused large, uncontrolled dc fields in the trap center that prevented zero-point confinement. Operating the PaulâStraubel trap with a small negative bias on the ring electrode wire {{is all that is}} required to realize the PSK mode.
