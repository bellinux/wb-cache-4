50|$|AMBER lamp: OVERLAP. Status ‘On’ {{indicates}} that {{the bow of the}} overtaking yacht is overlapping the stern of the leading yacht and there is no restriction on the leeward yacht to steer a direct course for the next mark. The leeward yacht may point higher than the direct course to the next mark causing the <b>windward</b> <b>yacht</b> to either tack or sail higher than needed to the next mark.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{tests in}} this tank, Tank 1, {{were focused on}} how to {{properly}} model <b>windward</b> performance of <b>yachts.</b> There were two main goals from these test: to determine {{the relationship between the}} wind speed and the force on the sails, and determine the lift/drag ratio of the rig. Davidson released his results from these test in his 1936 paper [...] "Some Experimental Studies of the Sailing Yacht". Not all of the work in Tank 1 was done on yachts. They did some tests on a steamship, which showed they had confidence in their methods. In April 1936, Davidson began testing the Ranger for the America's Cup. The yacht was designed and tested in the tank and Davidson navigated the Ranger to victory in the America's Cup. The success of this and other tests brought recognition to Davidson and his team. By 1939 they started to test many different types of boats. Davidson was then approached in 1939 to run tests on the turning of boats. Since his tank was not able to deal with turns {{he went back to the}} Stevens pool after hours. Since the pool was not suitable enough, Davidson contacted Columbia where they let him use their pool on the weekends.|$|R
50|$|In 1790, ice {{yachting}} was {{in vogue}} on the Hudson River, its headquarters being at Poughkeepsie, New York. The type was a square box on three runners, the two forward, ones being {{nailed to the}} box and the third acting as a rudder operated by a tiller. The sail was a flatheaded sprit. This primitive style was in general use until 1853, when triangular frames with boxes for the crew aft and jib and mainsail rig were introduced. A heavy, hard-riding type soon developed, with short gaffs, low sails, large jibs and booms extending far over the stern. It was over-canvassed and the mast was stepped directly over the runner plank, bringing the centre of sail-balance so far aft that the boats were apt to run away, and the over-canvassing frequently caused the windward runner to swing {{up into the air}} to a dangerous height. The largest and fastest example of this type, which prevailed until 1879, was Commodore J. A. Roosevelt's first Icicle, which measured 69 ft overall and carried 1070 sq ft of canvas. In 1879, H. Relyea built the Robert Scott, which had a single backbone and guy wires, and it became the model for all Hudson River ice yachts. Masts were now stepped farther forward, jibs were shortened, booms were cut down, and the center of sail-balance was brought more inboard and higher up, causing the centers of effort and resistance to come more in harmony. The shallow steering-box became elliptical. In 1881 occurred the first race for the American Challenge Pennant, which represents the championship of the Hudson River; the clubs that competed included the Hudson River, North Shrewsbury, Orange Lake, Newburgh and Carthage Ice Yacht Clubs. The races are usually sailed five times round a triangle of which each leg measures one mile, {{at least two of the}} legs being to <b>windward.</b> Ice <b>yachts</b> are divided into four classes, carrying respectively 600 sq ft of canvas or more, between 450 and 600, between 300 and 450, and less than 300 sq ft. Ice yachting is very popular on the Great Lakes, both in the United States and Canada, the Kingston, Ontario Club having a fleet of over 25 sail. Other important centers of the sport are the Lake Geneva, Wisconsin area, with an average of twenty-five sailing days a season for the last five years, Lakes Minnetonka and White Bear in Minnesota, Lakes Winnebago and Pepin in Wisconsin, Bar Harbor Lake in Maine, the St. Lawrence River, Quinte Bay and Lake Champlain.|$|R
