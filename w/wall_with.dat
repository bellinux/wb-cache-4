5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a rocky outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} <b>wall,</b> <b>with</b> ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower outer wall, enclosing a broad outer courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where {{the outline of a}} fish pond can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{proximity}} of the Roman road, entrenchments and relics it seems that the earliest settlement at Northallerton was some form of Roman military station. There is evidence that the Romans had a signal station on Castle Hills just {{to the west of the}} town as part of the imperial Roman postal system and a path connecting Hadrian's <b>Wall</b> <b>with</b> Eboracum (York) ran through what is now the neighbouring village of Brompton.|$|E
5|$|For 32 {{years there}} was no {{permanent}} memorial to the victims. Funding was obtained for a memorial in 2009, through a two-year effort by the 6th grade class of Decatur Classical School in Chicago. The memorial, a -high concave <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> interlocking bricks displaying {{the names of the}} crash victims, was formally dedicated in a ceremony on October 15, 2011. The memorial is located at Lake Park at the northwest corner of Lee and Touhy Avenues, two miles east of the crash site.|$|E

5|$|On 29 June 626, {{a coordinated}} {{assault on the}} walls began. Inside the walls, some 12,000 well-trained Byzantine cavalry troops (presumably dismounted) defended the city {{against the forces of}} some 80,000 Avars and Slavs. Despite {{continuous}} bombardment for a month, morale was high inside the walls of Constantinople because of Patriarch Sergius' religious fervor and his processions along the <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> the icon of the Virgin Mary, inspiring the belief that the Byzantines were under divine protection.|$|E

5|$|Sometime before 1623, a funerary {{monument}} {{was erected}} {{in his memory}} on the north <b>wall,</b> <b>with</b> a half-effigy {{of him in the}} act of writing.

5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{comprises}} {{a rectangular}} courtyard {{surrounded by a}} curtain <b>wall,</b> <b>with</b> a tower house, or keep, at one corner, and the round Glassin Tower projecting from the opposite corner.

Of the outer court, only an earth bank shows the position of the walls, with fragmentary remains of a bakehouse the only visible structures.|$|E

5|$|A mid-term poll by CRA in November 2009 {{showed that}} 77 percent of decided voters backed Williams' Progressive Conservatives. His {{popularity}} {{had been in}} the seventies according to polls conducted by the CRA earlier in 2009. Two other polls conducted in late 2009 showed similar results, the first of which was by Global News and Ipsos and the second was by Angus Reid. The Angus Reid poll surveyed Canadians in nine provinces and found that Williams was by far the most popular premier in Canada. 78 percent of respondents in the province approved of Williams' performance, the only other premier to receive the support of more than half of respondents in their province was Saskatchewan Premier Brad <b>Wall</b> <b>with</b> 58 percent.|$|E

After a few more jump cuts in which they turn to the right and back again, the figure stands still, then looks to its left slowly. The figure looks down to where a box with various triangular sections appears, then to their right as the image seems to fragment briefly. For the remainder of the video, the cloaked figure stands still with its back to the <b>wall,</b> <b>with</b> the camera apparently handheld again and occasional video effects briefly doubling the image.|$|E
5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is a small hill where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development. The demolition {{of most of the}} fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with the construction of an electric tramway. The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> its so-called 'water gate' were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.|$|E
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a <b>wall</b> <b>with</b> openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} series of shake table tests on the seismic {{responses}} of geosynthetically reinforced <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> tire derived aggregates (TDA) and lightweight aggregates (LWA) as backfills, respectively. A section of reduced- scale mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) wall was built in a box that was anchored on a one-dimensional shake table. The Loma Prieta and the Northridge earthquake excitations and sinusoidal frequency sweep motions (0. 2 to 6 Hz) were replicated by the shake table. Two commonly-used seismic design methodologies by FHWA (2001) and by Bathurst and Cai (1995) {{were used in the}} design and evaluation of the internal stability of the MSE wall. The wrap-around MSE <b>wall</b> was instrumented <b>with</b> accelerometers, linear variable differential transformers (LVDT), linear potentiometers, and dynamic soil stress gauges. The model MSE <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> TDA and LWA backfills, respectively, withstood the simulated Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquake motions without failure. However, only the <b>walls</b> backfilled <b>with</b> TDA were able to withstand the effects of the sinusoidal sweep motions. The MSE <b>walls</b> backfilled <b>with</b> LWA showed drastic failure during sinusoidal sweep motions. The FHWA dynamic internal stability design of MSE <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> conventional granular backfill may be used for the MSE <b>walls</b> <b>with</b> TDA and LWA backfills...|$|R
