50|$|The {{quality of}} food for common people was not always {{particularly}} high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>flour</b> — probably both wheat and rye - but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included.

Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages. The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age inevitably left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt rock) in the flour and when eaten later on, these small stones wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains of that period.|$|E

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty eight middle aged obese female volunteers suffering from metabolic syndrome were divided into two groups. During the first period, group (A) consumed a low caloric diet and nutritional supplement consisting of doum flour biscuits, while group (B) consumed <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> wheat <b>flour</b> biscuit with the same instructions. During the second period, both supplements were omitted. Assessment of blood pressure, relevant anthropometric parameters, lipid accumulation product, fasting blood glucose, uric acid, 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 (OH) D), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were performed. RESULTS: Data showed that although both supplements improved the MetS criteria and the bone health parameters, the supplement containing the doum flour proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the benefit of doum in improving bone health parameter [25 (OH) D/PTH axis] in the MetS patients, beside the MetS criteria.

Furthermore, the contribution of genotype and environment to this variability was estimated. The levels of total DF (TDF), total nonstarch polysaccharide (TOTNSP), water-extractable nonstarch polysaccharide (WENSP), total arabinoxylan (TOTAX), lignin, and beta-glucan in <b>whole</b> <b>meal,</b> <b>flour,</b> and/or bran varied similar to 1. 8 -fold. The highest variability was observed for the water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) level in flour and bran (similar to 3. 7 -fold). Genotype and environment contributed to a similar extent to the variability in TDF, TOTNSP, and TOTAX content in wheat. The observed relatively high impact of genotype-environment interaction suggests that the levels of these constituents are weak breeding parameters. The WENSP level is a more stable parameter as the effect of the interaction term was much less than the impact of genotype. For TOTAX and WEAX in flour, WEAX in bran, beta-glucan in whole meal, and extract viscosity, wheat genotype determined similar to 50 % or higher of the variation observed, whereas the impact of the genotype environment interaction was relatively low. These findings suggest that the health-related and technological functionality of wheat can be directed to a certain extent by selection of appropriate wheat varieties. status: publishe...|$|E

In this regard, was determined to investigate the structure formation processes of bread depending on the dispersity of the particles of flour. For this I have chosen two parties coarse <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>flour</b> from wheat grains with different grain size, select different modes humidity test and the experiment in the mixing-whipping-forming installation. The results of the experiment were obtained graphs showing the dependence of the current strength of the drive and volume weight on the duration of the process of churning the dough.

At the stage of churning Pro-comes a saturation test the air, thus decreasing its viscosity and current drive. Properties of dough and bread from different batches were compared. The dough obtained from flour II party, i. e., low dispersion, has a small viscosity, and the bread is slightly moist to the touch.. Thus, the results of the experiment showed that the physic-chemical and colloidal processes in structure formation of dough and bread is higher, the higher dispersity particles of flour, and, consequently, improves the quality of "whipped" bread...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hard {{wheat flour}} and durum of {{different}} extraction level (<b>whole</b> <b>meal,</b> 82 % and 72 %) and their pasta products {{were evaluated by}} the ordinary methods in parallel with FT-IR spectroscopy. Chemically, there was considerable difference between hard wheat flour and durum in protein and crude fiber contents. Durum <b>whole</b> <b>meal,</b> hard wheat <b>flour</b> (72 %) and durum adulterated with hard wheat flour 72 % (1 : 1) were used to prepare high quality pasta and adulterated pasta, respectively. Color analysis showed that, addition of hard wheat to durum increased the lightness values but decreased the redness and yellowness values. Also, pasta processed from these raw materials had the same character except lightness. Cooked pasta had {{no significant differences in}} lightness and redness values while there were significant differences in yellowness values of the cooked pasta. Sensory evaluation of pasta made from durum and hard wheat and their mixture showed that, there were significant differences between them in all sensory properties. Cooking quality of pasta revealed that, the weight of hard wheat pasta increased more than durum pasta, while, the volume of durum pasta was higher than hard wheat pasta. Cooking loss was very lower in durum pasta than hard wheat pasta. Since, wheat and their products contain different polar functional groups such as lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, FT-IR spectroscopy was used as a beneficial tool for detecting adulteration of pasta. The FT-IR results showed that hard wheat (72 %) was recognized from durum (72 %) by presence of two specific bands at 1420 and 1375 cm- 1 which are nearly disappeared in durum, while durum was characterized by tw...|$|R

40|$|A {{project of}} a Germplasm Bank {{has been carried}} out at the Interdepartmental Research Centre for Agri- Food Biological Resources Improvement and Valorization (Biogest-Siteia, UNIMORE), aimed to wheat longterm conservation, {{valorization}} and exploitation. Nowadays, the Germplasm Bank keeps more than 150 accessions, including ten ancient cultivars, which have been all morphologically characterized, according to “Descriptor List for Wheat” (1). Identification of the secondary metabolites responsible for end-use quality of wheat may be considered a key-factor for all stake-holders, i. e. breeders, producers, grain handlers, millers, bakers and final consumers (2, 3, 4). Recent studies have focused on phenolic content of whole wheat, due to their antioxidant, antiinflammatory, anti-carcinogenic properties (3, 5, 6), highlighting furthermore that important differences in metabolic profile occur among cultivated varieties. The intense breeding programs developed since the 50 s years of the last century, resulted in the selection of new wheat cultivars with high yield, less subjected to crop lodging and able to provide high strength flour, with a high aptitude to withstand mechanical processing. This resulted, in turn, in the replacement of local varieties and mostly in the decrease of the genetic variability. Notwithstanding, there has been recently a renewal of interest in the so-called “ancient grains”, cultivars with a distinct regional connotation, used in the last century or even earlier. In the present study, nine ancient varieties of wheat: Autonomia, Gentil rosso, Grano del miracolo, Inallettabile, Leone aristato, Mentana, Poulard di Ciano, Risciola, and Terminillo were compared with some modern cultivars. Extracts of <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>flour</b> were subjected to separation by LC-ESI-MS-TQ and phenolic compounds, i. e. hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, flavones, and vanillin, were determined. Total phenolic content, expressed as gallic acid equivalents, of each sample was determined using the Folin–Ciocâlteu procedure. The ancient cultivars of wheat showed a phenolic content significantly higher in comparison with the modern cultivars. The ancient variety Poulard di Ciano (also known as Turgido Reggiano) was widely cultivated in the northern Italy and in Emilia Romagna region {{in the first years of}} XX century and can be considered the real autochthonous wheat of Reggio Emilia province. It showed the highest total phenolic content, followed by Risciola, Grano del Miracolo, Terminillo, and Leone Aristato (ranging between 0. 95 and 0. 70 mg/g, expressed as gallic acid equivalents). The lowest value was recorded for the modern cultivar Zanzibar (0. 33 mg/g, as gallic acid equivalents). Many differences among cultivars emerged when quali-quantitative analysis were carried out. Terminillo showed statistically highest concentration of ferulic acid, followed by Risciola, Grano del Miracolo, Gentil Rosso, Poulard di Ciano, and Leone Aristato, while Blasco (taken as reference for modern cultivars) had the lowest concentration. Syringic acid presented the highest value for Risciola, Leone Aristato, and Mentana. Poulard di Ciano showed very high concentrations of sinapinic acid, while Blasco had the lowest content. Vanillin and vanillic acid, two biochemically correlated 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl- derivates, are very liked flavoring agents. They were found in Grano del Miracolo at the highest concentrations. Risciola, as well, showed high content of vanillin, followed by Inallettabile, while vanillic acid was present in high concentration in Gentil rosso, Terminillo, and Leone aristato. Blasco, also in this case, did not show high concentration of these metabolites. A complete comparison with all the cultivars stored in the Germplasm Bank is currently in progress. In the light of these first results the nutritional characteristics of the caryopsis, rich in micronutrients and compounds with nutraceutical activity, and the opportunity of increasing a more sustainable model of agriculture, make the ancient varieties of wheat an invaluable heritage to safeguard...|$|E
40|$|Variability {{of quality}} {{parameters}} between Australian wheat varieties grown in different locations and seasons causes difficulties in delivering uniform grains with consistent quality to {{local and international}} markets and in predicting functional performance in food processing and human nutrition. The objective of this thesis is to assess the relative contributions of genotype (cultivar), environment and their interactions to variability of quality traits such as test weight, grain protein content, β-glucan, fructans, total starch content, total arabinoxylans (T-AX), water extractable arabinoxylans (WE-AX), water un-extractable arabinoxylans (WU-AX), free, conjugated, bound and total phenolic acids. Three commercial Australian wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties (Gregory, Janz and Peake) grown in 13 different geographic regions of Australia were used to examine wheat whole meal quality parameters. The grain samples {{were obtained from the}} National Variety Trials (NVT) conducted by the Australian Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC). Total starch, fructans, β-glucan and total T-AX were determined using Megazyme assay kits (Spectrophotometric analysis), arabinoxylan fractions were analysed using a spectrophotometric technique based on the orcinol-HCl method. Phenolic acid fractions were extracted using liquid nitrogen and analysed using a spectrophotometric technique based on Folin-Ciocalteau reagent and by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with measurements being made for individual phenolic acids in each fraction. Grain protein content and test weight were provided by NVT. The functionality of hard, soft and waxy wheat starch varieties, with and without the additions of WE-AX, was studied by a series of tests including thermal properties using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and pasting properties using the Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA). All parameters measured and meteorological factors before and after flowering (temperature, rainfall and daily solar exposure) were analysed by statistical methods to deduce which factors influenced grain quality characteristics. The soil characteristics and fertilizers used were not available for all the locations, and because of the large number of missing values which could potentially bias the results of the correlation and regression analysis, these factors {{were not included in the}} analysis. Variability of the quality traits and starch functionality was described in terms of the influence of genotype, environmental factors and their interactions. This study showed that genotype contributed significantly to variability of all the traits tested. Genotype strongly influenced T-AX and WU-AX. Arabinoxylans levels were shown to vary among wheat genotypes. The average ratio of arabinose to xylose was 0. 6 for each of the three varieties and this might indicate similarities of the substitution pattern of the xylose backbone by arabinose residues of the three cultivars. Growth environment was the main contributor to the variability of total starch, grain protein, WE-AX, β-glucan and test weight. Growing conditions had strong significant correlations (α = 0. 01 and α = 0. 001) with wheat grain protein, total starch, WE-AX, fructans and test weight. Growth conditions had moderately significant correlations (α = 0. 05) with T-AX and WU-AX, while variability in WE-AX had an inverse and stronger correlations (α = 0. 01 or α = 0. 001) with the growing conditions compared to total AX and WU-AX. Arabinoxylan fractions (WE-AX and WU-AX) differed in solubility and in their variability due to environmental factors. These differences might be related to their different molecular weights, the incomplete cross-linking of WE-AX with other components, and to the loose binding of WE-AX to the cell wall surface. Genotype influenced all of the pasting properties of Gregory, Janz and Peake starches. The effects of growth conditions on starch pasting properties were significant on peak, breakdown and setback viscosities and pasting temperatures. Environmental temperature (minimum temperature days at < 0 ̊C) had negative correlations with pasting viscosities whereas total rainfall and average rainfall after flowering had positive correlations with setback viscosity. With regards to the addition of WE-AX to several wheat starches (Kukri, QAL 2000 and QA-WX- 83), the RVA pasting viscosities (peak, trough, final and setback) were decreased, whereas the DSC onset and peak temperatures were increased, but the change in enthalpy was decreased. The pasting and the thermal profiles of Kukri, QAL 2000, and QA-WX- 83 with WE-AX, have shown that WE-AX compete with starch granules for water. This study showed that phenolic acids are very variable compounds. The contents of free, conjugated, bound and total phenolic acids of <b>whole</b> <b>meal</b> <b>flour</b> from the same cultivar (Gregory, Janz and Peake) were different between locations and seasons. Cultivar was the main factor influencing free and bound phenolics of Gregory, Janz and Peake samples, which were grown in the 2010 season. Interactions between the genotype and the environment contributed strongly to conjugated and total phenolics. However, when two seasons were involved (2010 and 2012), genotype and all environmental factors had significant contributions to variability of soluble, conjugated, bound and total phenolic acids of Gregory and Janz samples (Peake was not planted in the 2012 season). Gregory cultivar had the highest amount of total phenolics in 2010 and 2012 seasons and its pattern did not change over the two seasons (the mean free phenolic concentrations tended to be consistently higher than bound and conjugated phenolics). Weather conditions in the 2010 season (average temperature before flowering, rainfall and solar exposure before and after flowering) influenced strongly conjugated and total phenolics. Weather conditions influenced all of the phenolic acids in the two seasons involved, 2010 and 2012. Benzoic acid derivatives (C 6 -C 1) and cinnamic acid derivatives (C 6 -C 3) followed different trends. The conjugated, bound, and free forms of 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid, syringic acid and sinapic acid all followed a similar trend with respect to growth location. The concentrations were highest in the conjugated form, less in the bound form, and least in the free form at all seven locations. On the other hand, the conjugated, bound, and free forms of p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid and ferulic acid followed a consistently different trend to the other four phenolic acids with respect to location. The concentrations were highest in the bound form, less in the conjugated form, and least in the free form at all seven locations. In conclusion, this study showed that genotype, environment and their interactions influenced grain quality parameters. Both genotype and environmental factors influenced pasting properties of starch. Genotype was the main influencing factor to the variability of T-AX and WU-AX. WE-AX competed with Kukri, QAL 2000 and QA-WX- 83 starches for water and influenced RVA and DSC parameters. Genotype and all environmental factors contributed significantly to the variability of phenolic acids in wholemeal flour...|$|E

Analysis of Feijoada <b>whole</b> <b>meal,</b> composed by black beans, rice, kale, cassava flour, and orange showed that black beans are the main provider of phytochemicals and antioxidant activity, with the highest values for phenolics, tannins, and anthocyanins. For flavonoids, kale was the main source. Phenolic acids were mainly observed in black beans and were identified as mainly protocatechuic, chlorogenic, caffeic and ferulic acids. The antioxidant activity, as for the bioactive compounds analyzed, was progressively reduced during processing.

A squid meal, a spray dried herring solubles meal and two fish off-fall meals were of decidedly poorer protein quality than the herring meals. Rennet casein was of about the same protein value as the herring meals, whereas the reference protein source, spray dried egg albumin, was better {{than all the other}} protein sources tested. Acetone dried samples of herring fillets and whole herring were of moderately better protein value than commercial herring meals. Acetone dried male herring was of poorer protein value than a corresponding sample of female herring. Acetone dried herring roe was of good protein value whereas the corresponding sample of herring milt was of poor protein value...|$|R

Cassava <b>Flour</b> <b>Meal</b> was used to substitute maize at 0, 20 and 40 % level. It was discovered that the weekly intake of 75. 96 mg / 100 g and 225. 31 mg/ 100 g of Hydrocyanic Acid (HCN) significantly (p< 0. 05) led to an increase in cooking losses and a corresponding decrease in the cooking yield of meat obtained from birds fed HCN. The intake of HCN also affected (p< 0. 05) tenderness, juiciness and palatability in birds fed cassava <b>flour</b> <b>meal</b> based diets. It was concluded that the intake of HCN had a negative effect on the sensory parameters measured and that this effect is most felt in birds fed above 124. 23 mg / 100 g of HCN...|$|R
