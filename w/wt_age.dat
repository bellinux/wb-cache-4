40|$|Purpose: Nitric oxide mediates {{urethral}} {{smooth muscle}} relaxation {{and may also}} be involved in detrusor activity control. Mice with mutation in the Immp 2 l gene have high superoxide ion levels and a consequent decrease in the bioavailable amount of nitric oxide. We studied bladder function in this mouse model. Material and Methods: Young male mutants at ages 4 to 6 months, old female mutants at age 18 months and healthy <b>WT</b> <b>age</b> matched controls were used. the detrusor contractile response to carbachol and electrical field stimulation was tested in isolated detrusor strips in organ baths. in vivo bladder function was evaluated by cystometry in conscious animals. Results: Young male mutants had significantly lower micturition and higher post-void residual volume than WT controls. They had pronounced voiding difficulty and strained when initiating micturition. Detrusor contractile responses to carbachol and electrical field stimulation were similar in mutant and WT mice. Old female mutant mice had lower bladder capacity and micturition volume, and higher micturition frequency and bladder-to-body weight ratio than WT controls. in the in vitro study detrusor strips from mutants showed a lower maximum response to carbachol. Conclusions: Mice with mutation in the Immp 2 l gene have bladder dysfunction, mainly characterized by emptying abnormalities in young males and increased detrusor activity in old females. Detrusor function was preserved in young males and impaired in old females. These animals are a natural model of oxidative stress with low bioavailable nitric oxide. Thus, they are interesting tools in which to evaluate the role of these conditions on bladder dysfunction.

40|$|As mean fibre {{diameter}} (MFD) is {{the primary}} determinant of mohair price we aimed to quantify the lifetime changes in mohair MFDas Angora goats aged and grew. Measurements were made over 12 shearing periods on a population of Angora goats representing the current range and diversity of genetic origins including South African, Texan and interbred admixtures of these and Australian sources. Records of sire, dam, birthweight, birth parity, liveweight, fleece growth and fleece quality were taken for does and castrated males (wethers) (n = 267 animals). Fleece-free liveweights (FFL wt) were determined for each goat at shearing time by subtracting the greasy fleece weight from the liveweight recorded immediately before shearing. A restricted maximum likelihood growth curve model was developed for relating MFD to FFL <b>wt,</b> <b>age</b> and other measurements. Asimple way of describing the results is:MFD= k (FFL wt) b E; where k is a parameter that can vary in a systematic way with shearing(age), breed, weaning weight, sire, dam and individual; b is a parameter {{that is the same}} for nearly the whole study; and E are independent errors from a log-normal distribution. The analysis shows that ^b = 0. 34, with s. e. (^b) = 0. 021. Thus, mohair MFD was allometrically related to the cube root of FFLwt over the lifetime of Angora goats. However, the allometric proportionality constant differed in a systematic way with age at shearing, genetic strain, weaning weight, sire, dam and individual. For Texan-breed goats, MFD decreased as weaning weight increased (P = 0. 00016). The findings indicate that management factors that affect liveweight and weaning weight have lifetime effects on mohair fibre diameter and therefore the value of mohair and the profitability of the mohair enterprise. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Oxidative {{stress and}} {{oxidative}} damage of cerebral vasculature and neuronal cells {{have been found}} {{to play an important role}} in ageing-related neurodegenerative behaviour disorders. Although several enzymatic sources are involved in brain ROS generation, recently NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox 2) has been suggested as a major source of ROS generation in ageing-related vascular dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we used age-matched littermates of wild-type (WT) and Nox 2 knockout (Nox 2 (-/-)) mice on a C 57 BL/ 6 background at young (3 - 4 month old) and old age (18 - 21 month old) to investigate the relationship between Nox 2 -derived ROS production, cerebral vascular damage and the loss of locomotor activity in ageing. There was no significant difference in locomotor activity between WT and Nox 2 (-/-) young mice as measured digitally using laser-beam motility chambers over a 42 h period. Compared to young mice, <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> mice (but not Nox 2 (-/-) ageing mice) had a significant decrease in horizontal activity (p < 0. 05) and total activity in the dark period. We then examined the levels of ROS production in brain homogenates by lucigenin (5 µM) -chemiluminescence and in brain sections by DHE fluorescence. Compared to WT young mouse brains, there were significant increases in the levels of ROS production in <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> brains and this was accompanied with an average 2 -fold reduction in the numbers of CD 31 -positive vessels (all p < 0. 05) as revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy and vessel number counting. Compared to <b>WT</b> <b>ageing</b> mice, knockout of Nox 2 completely inhibited the age-related increase in brain ROS production and preserved the cerebral microvasculature density and the locomotor activity. In conclusion, Nox 2 -derived ROS plays an important role in oxidative damage of cerebral vasculature and the loss of locomotor activity at old age...|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} study was to assess the tolerance and compliance of an intended population of infants to a new formulation of a hypoallergenic eHF. Methods: A non-random, single-group, multicenter study was conducted. Infants with suspected food protein allergy, persistent feeding intolerance, or presenting conditions where an eHF was deemed appropriate were enrolled in a 15 -day feeding trial. Intake, stool patterns, weight (wt), length, and questionnaires were collected. The primary outcome was maintenance of <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score during the study. Results: 25 infants (85 + 8. 9 d of age) were enrolled; 7 were> 4 months; 4 were preterm. At entry, 12 had symptoms of allergic colitis or food protein allergy/intolerance, 12 had persistent formula intolerance, 11 had hematochezia/heme positive stools, and 1 was recovering from necrotizing enterocolitis. Mean <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score was- 0. 62 + 0. 19 at entry and- 0. 41 + 0. 16 at exit. Mean change in <b>wt</b> for <b>age</b> Z-score was 0. 21 + 0. 10.

Atrial electrophysiological properties in isolated Langendorff-perfused hearts from 3 - and 12 -month-old wild type (WT), and Scn 5 a+/∆KPQ mice were assessed using programmed electrical stimulation and their Nav 1. 5 expression assessed by Western blot. Cardiac conduction properties were assessed electrocardiographically in intact anesthetized animals. Monophasic action potential recordings demonstrated increased atrial arrhythmogenicity specifically in aged Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ hearts. These showed greater action potential duration/refractory period ratios but lower atrial Nav 1. 5 expression levels than <b>aged</b> <b>WT</b> mice. Atrial Nav 1. 5 levels were higher in young Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ than young WT. These levels increased with <b>age</b> in <b>WT</b> but not Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ. Both young and aged Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ mice showed lower heart rates and longer PR intervals than their WT counterparts.

Aged murine Scn 5 a+/ΔKPQ hearts thus exhibit an increased atrial arrhythmogenicity.

40|$|Pituitary {{adenylate cyclase}} {{activating}} polypetide (PACAP) constitutes a neuropeptide that is widely {{distributed in the}} host exerting essential cytoprotective properties, whereas PACAP−/− mice display increased susceptibility to distinct immunopathological conditions. The orchestrated interplay between the gut microbiota and the host is pivotal in immune homeostasis and resistance to disease. Potential pertubations of the intestinal microbiota in PACAP−/− mice, however, have not been addressed so far. For the first time, we performed a comprehensive survey of the intestinal microbiota composition in PACAP−/− and wildtype (WT) mice starting 2 weeks postpartum until 18 months of age applying quantitative culture-independent techniques. Fecal enterobacteria and enterococci were lower in PACAP−/− than <b>WT</b> mice <b>aged</b> 1 month and ≥ 6 months, respectively. Whereas mouse intestinal Bacteroides were slightly higher in PACAP−/− versus <b>WT</b> mice <b>aged</b> 1 and 6 months, this later in life held true for Bacteroides/Prevotella spp. (≥ 12 months) and lactobacilli (> 15 months of age). Strikingly, health-beneficial bifidobacteria were virtually absent in the intestines of PACAP−/− mice, even when still breastfed. In conclusion, PACAP deficiency is accompanied by distinct changes in fecal microbiota composition with virtually absent bifidobacteria as a major hallmark that might be linked to increased susceptibility to disease...|$|R

However, the mechanism of Nox 2 activation in normal aging remains unclear. In this study, we used age-matched wild-type (WT) and Nox 2 knockout (KO) mice at 3 – 4 months (young); 11 – 12 months (middle-aged) and 21 – 22 months (aging) to investigate age-related metabolic disorders, Nox 2 activation and endothelial dysfunction. Compared to young mice, middle-aged and <b>aging</b> <b>WT</b> mice had significant hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, increased systemic oxidative stress and higher blood pressure. Endothelium-dependent vessel relaxation to acetylcholine was significantly impaired in <b>WT</b> <b>aging</b> aortas, and this was accompanied by increased Nox 2 and ICAM- 1 expressions, MAPK activation and decreased insulin receptor expression and signaling. However, these aging-associated disorders were significantly reduced or absent in Nox 2 KO aging mice. The effect of metabolic disorder on Nox 2 activation and endothelial dysfunction was further confirmed using high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in middle-aged WT mice treated with apocynin (a Nox 2 inhibitor). In vitro experiments showed that in response to high glucose plus high insulin challenge, WT coronary microvascular endothelial cells increased significantly the levels of Nox 2 expression, activation of stress signaling pathways and the cells were senescent, e. g. increased p 53 and β–galactosidase activity. However,these changes were absent in Nox 2 KO cells. In conclusion, Nox 2 activation in response to aging-associated hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia {{plays a key role in}} the oxidative damage of vascular function. Inhibition or knockout of Nox 2 preserves endothelial function and improves global metabolism in old age...|$|R

However, the effect of repeated endurance exercise during biologic <b>aging</b> (<b>WT)</b> characterized by an inherent deterioration in Nrf 2 signaling and pathological aging (pronounced oxidative susceptibility—Nrf 2 absence) in the myocardium remains elusive. Thus, the purpose of our {{study was to determine}} the effect of chronic endurance exercise-induced cardiac adaptation in aged mice with and without Nrf 2. Age-matched WT and Nrf 2 -null mice (Nrf 2 −/−) (> 22 months) were subjected to 6 weeks chronic endurance exercise (25 meter/min, 12 % grade). The myocardial redox status was assessed by expression of antioxidant defense genes and proteins along with immunochemical detection of DMPO-radical adduct, GSH-NEM, and total ubiquitination. Cardiac functions were assessed by echocardiography and electrocardiogram. At sedentary state, loss of Nrf 2 resulted in significant downregulation of antioxidant gene expression (Nqo 1, Ho 1, Gclm, Cat, and Gst-α) with decreased GSH-NEM immuno-fluorescence signals. While Nrf 2 −/− mice subjected to CEE showed an either similar or more pronounced reduction in the transcript levels of Gclc, Nqo 1, Gsr, and Gst-α in relation to WT littermates. In addition, the hearts of Nrf 2 −/− on CEE showed a substantial reduction in specific antioxidant proteins, G 6 PD and CAT along with decreased GSH, a pronounced increase in DMPO-adduct and the total ubiquitination levels. Further, CEE resulted in a significant upregulation of hypertrophy genes (Anf, Bnf, and β-Mhc) (p < 0. 05) in the Nrf 2 −/− hearts in relation to WT mice. Moreover, the aged Nrf 2 −/− mice exhibited a higher degree of cardiac remodeling in association with a significant decrease in fractional shortening, pronounced ST segment, and J wave elevation upon CEE compared to age-matched WT littermates. In conclusion, our findings indicate that while the <b>aged</b> <b>WT</b> and Nrf 2 knockout animals both exhibit hypertrophy after CEE, the older Nrf 2 knockouts showed ventricular remodeling coupled with profound cardiac functional abnormalities and diastolic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionAging is {{associated}} with an endothelial dysfunction, characterized by a decrease of nitric oxide (NO) production, which is a risk factor of development of cardiovascular diseases. However, the direct link between endothelial dysfunction and aggravation of cardiac function in aging is not established. We reported previously a new potent therapeutic approach of cardiovascular disease, based on inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP 1 B), which both increases NO production (via restored PI 3 K/Akt/eNOS signaling) and reduces cardiac dysfunction in both post-ischemic heart failure and aging, however the exact role of endothelial PTP 1 B in this setting is unknown. To evaluate the endothelial and cardiac consequences of endothelial PTP 1 B deficiency (endoPTP 1 B-/-) in a mouse model of aging. Material and methodsEndoPTP 1 B-/- mice were developed by crossing LOX-P PTP 1 B mice with mice expressing CRE {{under the control of}} the endothelial promoter Tie 2, or wild-type (WT). The evolution of cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography at different time points and the vascular function was evaluated ex vivo at 24 months. ResultsCompared to young (3 month-old), <b>WT</b> mice <b>aged</b> (24 month-old) showed a markedly impaired flow-mediated dilatation of isolated mesenteric arteries (3 months: 40 ± 4 %; 24 months: 1 ± 1 %; p< 0. 001), which was improved in endoPTP 1 B-/- mice (17 ± 3 %; p< 0. 001 vs. WT 24 months). This restored response in aged endoPTP 1 B-/- mice was abolished by a NO-synthase inhibitor, suggesting a restored NO production. In <b>WT</b> mice, <b>aging</b> decreased stroke volume (3 months: 0, 070 ± 0, 002 %; 24 months: 0, 065 ± 0, 005 %; p< 0. 001) and cardiac output (3 months: 37 ± 1 %; 24 months: 29 ± 2 %; p< 0. 001) and these parameters were improved in endoPTP 1 B-/- mice (24 months: 0. 081 ± 0, 011 % and 34 ± 2 %; respectively, p< 0. 05).

To test this, we performed BMT in APPswe/PS 1 DE 9 double transgenic mice using green fluorescent protein expressing wild type (wt) mice as marrow donors. We first examined retinas from control, non-transplanted, aged AD mice and found a two-fold increase in microglia compared with wt mice, prominent inner retinal Ab and paired helical filament-tau, and decreased retinal ganglion cell layer neurons. BMT resulted in near complete replacement of host retinal microglia with BMT-derived cells and normalized total AD retinal microglia to non-transplanted wt levels.

Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) rise with aging and have been correlated with the incidence of myocardial infarction. We therefore sought to determine whether genetic variation in the TNF receptor- 1 gene (TNFR 1) contributes to aging-related atherosclerosis in humans and whether Tnfr 1 expression aggravates aging-related atherosclerosis in mice. With 1330 subjects from a coronary angiography database, we performed a case–control association study of coronary artery disease (CAD) with 16 TNFR 1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two TNFR 1 SNPs significantly associated with CAD in subjects > 55 years old, and this association was supported by analysis of a set of 759 independent CAD cases. In multiple linear regression analysis, accounting for TNFR 1 SNP rs 4149573 significantly altered the relationship between aging and CAD index among 1811 subjects from the coronary angiography database. To confirm that TNFR 1 contributes to aging-dependent atherosclerosis, we grafted carotid arteries from 18 - and 2 -month-old wild-type (WT) and Tnfr 1 −/− mice into congenic apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe−/−) mice and harvested grafts from 1 to 7 weeks post-operatively. <b>Aged</b> <b>WT</b> arteries developed accelerated atherosclerosis associated with enhanced TNFR 1 expression, enhanced macrophage recruitment, reduced smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen content, augmented apoptosis and plaque hemorrhage.

The prediction of BMC obtained from LTM and FM (R(2) (adj) = 0. 46, p < 0. 0001) was only slightly better than that obtained from Wt. After the effects of <b>age,</b> <b>Wt</b> and height (Ht) on BMC were taken into account by multiple regression, the contribution of LTM and FM to BMC was just one-fifth of that of Wt (R(2) (adj) for full models < or = 0. 56, p < 0. 0001). After a further correction for bone area (BA), the contribution of LTM and FM to BMC was just one-tenth of that of BA and not {{different from that of}} Wt and Ht on practical grounds (R(2) (adj) for full models = 0. 84, p < 0. 0001). Thus, after inter-individual differences in <b>age,</b> <b>Wt,</b> Ht (and bone size) are taken into account, {{the relationship between}} body composition and BMC is substantially weakened. CONCLUSIONS: In Caucasian women, (1) LTM is a stronger predictor of BMC than FM, but (2) Wt is a better predictor of BMC than body composition for practical purposes, and (3) Wt and body composition are not able to explain more than 46 % of BMC variance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Obesity is a {{hallmark}} of aging in many Western societies, and is a precursor to numerous serious age-related diseases. Ghrelin (Ghrl), via its receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R), is shown to stimulate GH secretion and appetite. Surprisingly, our previous studies showed that Ghrl-/- mice have impaired thermoregulatory responses to cold and fasting stresses, while Ghsr-/- mice are adaptive. Methodology/Principal Findings: To elucidate the mechanism, we analyzed the complete metabolic profiles of younger (3 – 4 months) and older (10 – 12 months) Ghrl-/- and Ghsr-/- mice. Food intake and locomotor activity were comparable for both null mice and their wild-type (WT) counterparts, regardless of age. There was also no difference in body composition between younger null mice and their WT counterparts. As the <b>WT</b> mice <b>aged,</b> as expected, the fat/lean ratio increased and energy expenditure (EE) decreased. Remarkably, however, older Ghsr-/- mice exhibited reduced fat/lean ratio and increased EE when compared to older WT mice, thus retaining a youthful lean and high EE phenotype; in comparison, {{there was no significant}} difference with EE in Ghrl-/- mice. In line with the EE data, the thermogenic regulator, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1), was significantly up-regulated in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of Ghsr-/- mice, but not in Ghrl-/- mice. Conclusions: Our data therefore suggest that GHS-R ablation activates adaptive thermogenic function(s) in BAT an...|$|R

40|$|Here, {{we studied}} in vitro {{cytokine}} production by splenic macrophages obtained from young and aged BALB/c wild type (WT) and IL- 6 knockout (IL- 6 KO) mice. Relative to macrophages obtained from young WT mice given lipopolysaccharide (LPS), those from <b>aged</b> <b>WT</b> mice had decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines.

In the hippocampus, 11 β-HSD 1 messenger RNA increases with aging. Here, we report significantly greater increases in intrahippocampal corticosterone (CORT) levels in <b>aged</b> wild-type (<b>WT)</b> mice during the acquisition and retrieval trials in a Y-maze than age-matched 11 β-HSD 1 −/− mice, corresponding to impaired and intact spatial memory, respectively.

Pharmacologic inhibition of 11 β-HSD 1 abolished increases in intrahippocampal CORT levels during the Y-maze trials and prevented spatial memory impairments in <b>aged</b> <b>WT</b> mice. These data provide the first in vivo evidence that dynamic increases in hippocampal 11 β-HSD 1 regenerated CORT levels during learning and retrieval {{play a key role in}} age- and stress-associated impairments of spatial memory...|$|R

40|$|Background: Amyloid β (Aβ) {{deposits}} and the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) are both well {{established in the}} development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanism and role of Aβ-induced ERS in AD-associated pathological progression remain to be elucidated. Methods: The five familial AD (5 ×FAD) mice and wild-type (<b>WT)</b> mice <b>aged</b> 2, 7, and 12 months were used in the present study. Morris water maze test was used to evaluate their cognitive performance. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses were used to examine the dynamic changes of pro-apoptotic (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein [CHOP] and cleaved caspase- 12) and anti-apoptotic factors (chaperone glucose-regulated protein [GRP] 78 and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation-associated ubiquitin ligase synovial apoptosis inhibitor 1 [SYVN 1]) in the ERS-associated unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Results: Compared with age-matched WT mice, 5 ×FAD mice showed higher cleaved caspase- 3, lower neuron-positive staining at the age of 12 months, but earlier cognitive deficit at the age of 7 months (all P < 0. 05). Interestingly, for 2 -month-old 5 ×FAD mice, the related proteins involved in the ERS-associated UPR pathway, including CHOP, cleaved caspase- 12, GRP 78, and SYVN 1, were significantly increased when compared with those in age-matched WT mice (all P < 0. 05). Moreover, ERS occurred mainly in neurons, not in astrocytes. Conclusions: These findings suggest that compared with those of age-matched WT mice, ERS-associated pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins are upregulated in 2 -month-old 5 ×FAD mice, consistent with intracellular Aβ aggregation in neurons...|$|R
40|$|Background: TGF-b is a {{pleiotropic}} cytokine {{that can}} have pro- or anti-inflammatory effects depending on the context. Elevated levels of bioactive TGF-b 1 in tears and elevated TGF-b 1 mRNA transcripts in conjunctiva and minor salivary glands of human Sjögren’s Syndrome patients has also been reported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the response to desiccating stress (DS), an experimental model of dry eye, in dominant-negative TGF-b type II receptor (CD 4 -DNTGFbRII) mice. These mice have a truncated TGF-b receptor in CD 4 + T cells, rendering them unresponsive to TGF-b. Methodology/Principal Findings: DS was induced by subcutaneous injection of scopolamine and exposure to a drafty low humidity environment in CD 4 -DNTGFbRII and wild-type (<b>WT)</b> mice, <b>aged</b> 14 weeks, for 5 days. Nonstressed (NS) mice served as controls. Parameters of ocular surface disease included corneal smoothness, corneal barrier function and conjunctival goblet cell density. NS CD 4 -DNTGFbRII at 14 weeks of age mice exhibited a spontaneous dry eye phenotype; however, DS improved their corneal barrier function and corneal surface irregularity, increased their number of PAS+ GC, and lowered CD 4 + T cell infiltration in conjunctiva. In contrast to WT, CD 4 -DNTGFbRII mice did not generate a Th- 17 and Th- 1 response, and they failed to upregulate MMP- 9, IL- 23, IL- 17 A, RORcT, IFN-c and T-bet mRNA transcripts in conjunctiva.

40|$|Aging is {{characterized}} by renal functional and structural abnormalities resembling those observed in diabetes. These changes have been related to the progressive accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and cumulative oxidative stress occurring in both conditions. We previously reported that galectin- 3 ablation is associated with increased susceptibility to diabetes- and AGE-induced glomerulopathy, thus indicating a protective role of galectin- 3 as an AGE receptor. To investigate {{the role of the}} AGE/AGE receptor pathway in the pathogenesis of age-related renal disease, we evaluated the development of glomerular lesions in aging galectin- 3 knockout (KO) vs. wild-type (WT) mice and their relation to the increased AGE levels and oxidative stress characterizing the aging process. KO mice showed significantly more pronounced age-dependent increases in proteinuria, albuminuria, glomerular sclerosis, and glomerular and mesangial areas, starting at 18 mo, as well as renal extracellular matrix mRNA and protein expression, starting at 12 mo vs. age-matched WT mice. Circulating and renal AGEs, plasma isoprostane 8 -epi-PGF 2 ? levels, glomerular content of the glycoxidation and lipoxidation products N?-carboxymethyllysine and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -nonenal, and renal nuclear factor-?B activity also increased more markedly with age in KO than <b>WT</b> mice. <b>AGE</b> levels correlated significantly with renal functional and structural parameters. These data indicate that aging galectin- 3 KO mice develop more pronounced changes in renal function and structure than coeval WT mice, in parallel with a more marked degree of AGE accumulation, oxidative stress, and associated low-grade inflammation, thus supporting the concept that the AGE/AGE receptor pathway is implicated in age-related renal disease...|$|R
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{has been identified}} as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). An impairment of insulin signaling as well as a desensitization of its receptor has been found in AD brains. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) normalises insulin signaling by facilitating insulin release. GIP directly modulates neurotransmitter release, LTP formation, and protects synapses from the detrimental effects of beta-amyloid fragments on LTP formation, and cell proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus. Here we investigate the potential therapeutic property of the new long lasting incretin hormone analogue D-Ala 2 GIP on key symptoms found in a mouse model of Alzheimer' disease (APPswe/PS 1 detaE 9). METHODS: D-Ala 2 GIP was injected for 21 days at 25 nmol/kg ip once daily in APP/PS 1 male mice and wild type (<b>WT)</b> littermates <b>aged</b> 6 or 12 months of age. Amyloid plaque load, inflammation biomarkers, synaptic plasticity in the brain (LTP), and memory were measured. RESULTS: D-Ala 2 GIP improved memory in WT mice and rescued the cognitive decline of 12 months old APP/PS 1 mice in two different memory tasks. Furthermore, deterioration of synaptic function in the dentate gyrus and cortex was prevented in 12 months old APP/PS 1 mice. D-Ala 2 GIP facilitated synaptic plasticity in APP/PS 1 and WT mice and reduced the number of amyloid plaques in the cortex of D-Ala 2 GIP injected APP/PS 1 mice. The inflammatory response in microglia was also reduced. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that D-Ala 2 GIP has neuroprotective properties on key hallmarks found in AD. This finding shows that novel GIP analogues have the potential as a novel therapeutic for AD...|$|R
40|$|Bioenergetics differ {{between males}} and females of many species. Human females {{apportion}} a substantial proportion of energy resources towards gynoid fat storage, to support the energetic burden of reproduction. Similarly, axial calcium accrual is favoured in females compared with males. Nutritional status is a prognostic indicator in cystic fibrosis (CF), but girls and young women are at greater risk of death despite equivalent nutritional status to males. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare fat (energy) and calcium stores (bone density) in males and females with CF over a spectrum of disease severity. Methods: Fat as % body weight (fat%) and lumbar spine (LS) and total body (TB) bone mineral density (BMD) were measured using dual absorption X-ray photometry in 127 (59 M) control and 101 (54 M) CF subjects, aged 9 – 25 years. An equation for predicted age at death had been determined using survival data and history of pulmonary function for the whole clinic, based on a trivariate normal model using maximum likelihood methods (1). For the CF group, a disease severity index (predicted age at death) was calculated from the derived equations according to each subjects history of pulmonary function, current age, and gender. Disease severity was classified according to percentile of predicted age at death (‘mild’ ≥ 75 th, ‘moderate’ 25 th– 75 th, ‘severe’ ≤ 25 th percentile). <b>Wt</b> for <b>age</b> z-score was calculated. Serum testosterone and oestrogen were measured in males and females respectively. Fat% and LSBMD were compared between the groups using ANOVA.

40|$|Aging causes {{profound}} {{effects on}} the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool, including an altered output of mature progeny and enhanced self-propagation of repopulating-defective HSCs. An important outstanding question is whether HSCs can be protected from aging. The signal adaptor protein LNK negatively regulates hematopoiesis at several cellular stages. It has remained unclear how the enhanced sensitivity to cytokine signaling caused by LNK deficiency affects hematopoiesis upon aging. Our findings demonstrate that aged LNK(-/-) HSCs displayed a robust overall reconstitution potential and {{gave rise to a}} hematopoietic system with a balanced lineage distribution. Although aged LNK(-/-) HSCs displayed a distinct molecular profile in which reduced proliferation was central, little or no difference in the proliferation of aged LNK(-/-) HSCs was observed after transplantation when compared to <b>aged</b> <b>WT</b> HSCs. This coincided with equal telomere maintenance in WT and LNK(-/-) HSCs. Collectively, our studies suggest that enhanced cytokine signaling can counteract functional age-related HSC decline. © 2012 The Authors Aging Cell © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland...|$|R
