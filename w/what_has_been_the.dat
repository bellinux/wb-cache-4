5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{political}} affiliation in the Senate {{in the most}} recent era is distinct in several key respects from <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case historically. Since November 4, 2015, there has been no government caucus in the Senate because the Senate Liberal Caucus is not affiliated with the governing Liberal Party of Canada. On December 6, 2016, {{for the first time in}} Canadian history the number of senators without a partisan affiliation exceeded that of the largest caucus of senators with a partisan affiliation.|$|E

Finally, on December 27, President Corazon Aquino, who fought to delay the pullout to cushion the country's battered economy, issued a formal notice for the U.S. to leave <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> U.S.'s largest overseas defense facility after Clark Air Base was closed, {{by the end of}} 1992.|$|E

500|$|The {{location}} of the near-surface contact between the Crescent Formation and the pre-Cenozoic metamorphic basement of the continent — <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> termed the Coast Range Boundary Fault (CRBF) — is largely uncertain. The Leech River Fault extends southeast past Victoria, B.C. to cross the Strait of Juan de Fuca, possibly connecting with the southeast striking Southern Whidbey Island Fault (SWIF). This extends to the Rattlesnake Mountain Fault Zone (RMFZ), some 25 kilometers east of Seattle, which {{is believed to be}} the western edge of the pre-Cenozoic basement. [...] However, gravity data indicates that at this latitude the Crescent Formation (at least near the surface) extends no further east than Seattle.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Herald {{published}} {{an interview with}} Kellogg where she supported women's suffrage, emphasizing Iroquois women's equality of civic powers with the men.

[...] "It is a cause of astonishment to us that you white women are only now, in this twentieth century, claiming <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Indian woman's privilege {{as far back as}} history traces." [...] The Iroquois had a communal system of land distribution and the tribe gave tracts to clans for further distribution among households for cultivation. Clan Mothers decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used. Since land tracts were the concern of the women, it was the women's job to cultivate food and not the men, [...] The Clan Mothers' Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans. Food from such lands, called kěndiǔ"gwǎ'ge' hodi'yěn'tho, would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.|$|E

2500|$|Wolfe had {{continued}} playing baseball as a pitcher and {{had begun to}} play semi-professionally while still in college. In 1952 he earned a tryout with the New York Giants but was cut after three days, which Wolfe blamed on his inability to throw good fastballs. Wolfe abandoned baseball and instead followed his professor Fishwick's example, enrolling in Yale University's American studies doctoral program. His PhD thesis was titled The League of American Writers: Communist Organizational Activity Among American Writers, 1929–1942. In {{the course of his}} research, Wolfe interviewed many writers, including Malcolm Cowley, Archibald MacLeish, and James T. Farrell. A biographer remarked on the thesis: [...] "Reading it, one sees <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> most baleful influence of graduate education on many who have suffered through it: it deadens all sense of style." [...] His thesis was originally rejected but it was finally accepted after he rewrote it in an objective rather than a subjective style. Upon leaving Yale, he wrote a friend explaining through expletives his personal opinions about his thesis.|$|E
