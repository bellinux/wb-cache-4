5000|$|Many {{users of}} ibogaine report {{experiencing}} visual phenomena during a <b>waking</b> <b>dream</b> <b>state,</b> such as instructive replays of life {{events that led}} to their addiction, while others report therapeutic shamanic visions that help them conquer the fears and negative emotions that might drive their addiction. It is proposed that intensive counseling, therapy and aftercare during the interruption period following treatment is of significant value. Some individuals require a second or third treatment session with ibogaine {{over the course of the}} next 12 to 18 months. A minority of individuals relapse completely into opiate addiction within days or weeks. A comprehensive article (Lotsof 1995) on the subject of ibogaine therapy detailing the procedure, effects and aftereffects is found in [...] "Ibogaine in the Treatment of Chemical Dependence Disorders: Clinical Perspectives". Ibogaine has also been reported in multiple small-study cohorts to reduce cravings for methamphetamine.|$|E

50|$|The text posits {{the same}} four states of {{consciousness}} or avasthas as found in Mandukya Upanishad and Buddhist texts. It defines the four states as Jāgraṭa (<b>waking</b> <b>state),</b> Svapna (<b>dreaming</b> <b>state),</b> Sushupṭi (dreamless sleeping state), and Turiya (pure consciousness). The text then attempts to link its physiology theory to explain these four {{states of consciousness}} as follows: in the Jāgraṭa state the 14 organs of the body which come into play are five organs of sense, five organs of action, and the four internal organs. Svapna or <b>dreaming</b> <b>state</b> shuts off all ten external organs, and only the four internal organs are operative states the Upanishad. In Sushupṭi, everything is silent, except chiṭṭa or mind only. Ṭuriya avastha is exclusively about jiva (life force, soul immersed in itself).|$|R

Buddhi with its organs of {{knowledge}} and its actions having the characteristics of an agent is the Vijnanakosha, the cause of samsara. It has the power of reflection of the chaitanya which it accompanies as a modification of Prakrti (avidya) and characterised by knowledge and action and always identified with the body, organs etc. This kosha is endowed with jnana and to it belong the <b>waking</b> and <b>dream</b> <b>states</b> and the experiences of joy and sorrow. Being very luminous in close proximity of the Paramatman deluded by which upadhi it is subject to samsara, this atman which is compacted of vijnana and shining in the heart near the pranas being immutable becomes a doer and enjoyer {{in the midst of}} the upadhis. Its [...] "jivabhava-existential-character" [...] i.e. Jivahood, persists so long as there is delusion as it is born of mithyajnana. Though avidya is beginningless it is not eternal.|$|R
5000|$|In Advaita, this causal {{logic is}} used for {{distinguishing}} the atman from the 'non-atman' or [...] anatman , for confirming the Śruti sayings about the atman because it works against {{the concept of the}} invariable presence of the witness of all cognitive acts, acts to the possible absence of its objects. Shankara holds that immediately after the hearing of a sacred scripture (shravana) from his Guru the disciple can rely in his own ascent on the four values that prepare the ground for the arousal of the 'desire to know Brahman'. The all-pervasiveness of the Absolute is anvaya which is the invariable factor that has to be differentiated from the causal body or the five sheaths enveloped in which (subjected to avidya) the self forgets its real nature and becomes subjected to transmigration. Therefore, Vidyaranya in his Panchadasi (I.37) explains that by differentiating the Atman from the causal body or the five sheaths through the method of distinguishing between the variable presence of the Self (when the Self persisting in all states but the subtle body is not perceived in deep sleep), and the invariable presence (anvaya) of the Self (pure consciousness persisting in both the <b>waking</b> and <b>dream</b> <b>states),</b> one can draw out one’s own Atman from the five sheaths and attain the supreme Brahman, and that:- ...|$|R
5000|$|Many reviewers believe Kaufman's {{writing is}} {{influenced}} by Jungian psychology. Carl Jung wrote that the <b>waking</b> and <b>dream</b> <b>states</b> are both necessary {{in the quest for}} meaning. Caden often appears to exist in a combination of the two. Kaufman has said, [...] "I think the difference is that a movie that tries to be a dream has a punchline and the punchline is: it was a dream." [...] Another concept in Jungian psychology is the four steps to self-realization: becoming conscious of the shadow (recognizing the constructive and destructive sides), becoming conscious of the anima and animus (where a man becomes conscious of his female component and a woman becomes conscious of her male component), becoming conscious of the archetypal spirit (where humans take on their mana personalities), and finally self-realization, where a person is fully aware of the ego and the self. Caden seems to go through all four of these stages. When he hires Sammy, he learns of his true personality and becomes more aware of himself. He shows awareness of his anima when replacing himself with Ellen and telling Tammy that his persona would have made him more adept in womanhood than in manhood. In taking on the role of Ellen, he becomes conscious of the archetypal spirit and finally realizes truths about his life and about love.|$|R
50|$|Gaudapada {{points out}} that the {{unchangeable}} reality is the witness behind the three <b>states</b> of consciousness, <b>waking,</b> <b>dreaming,</b> and dreamless sleep, in all these states the Self is ever-present, and though remaining unknown is the unaffected 'experiencer' of all actions and thoughts in these three states. In deep sleep the mind is withdrawn and does not know anything, but it is disciplined and not withdrawn in turiya, existent and all-seeing. When the individual self, sleeping under the influence of maya ('ignorance'), is awakened, it then realizes non-duality which is beginning-less and endless; {{this is the way to}} illumination within one’s own soul to realize supreme bliss. Gaudapada insists that the mind should not be allowed to enjoy the bliss that arises out of the condition of absorption. It should be freed from attachment to such happiness through the exercise of discrimination. When the mind does not lose itself in inactivity and oblivion, or is not distracted by desires, when the mind achieves quietness and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes Brahman. The <b>waking</b> and the <b>dreaming</b> <b>states</b> are equally real and equally unreal, real only in relative sense and unreal as compared with the transcendental in which there is identification with Reality, the unchangeable Self. There is no absolute reality of creation, the one infinite Existence appears to be the manifold universe which universe is not a reality but something superimposed upon the Atman. Bondage and liberation, the individual soul and the world, are all unreal. The supreme bliss is the very nature of the Atman, an absolute reality which persists.|$|R
50|$|Avidya ('ignorance') is beginningless, {{it is an}} Upadhi ('the {{limiting}} adjunct'). 'Chidabhasa' is {{the reflection}} of Consciousness in buddhi ('ego'), the effect of avidya, which is inseparably united with buddhi.Jiva is the imperfect form of Consciousness and is an unreality. The Nirguna Brahman causes Chidabhasa to appear as real consciousness and operate in the Vyavaharika world as the doer, the enjoyer, sufferer and so forth. Chidabhasa constitutes Ishvaratva and is almost an exact likeness of true consciousness on account of its being associated with Prakrti in equilibrium and consequently unperturbed by the gunas in action.Jiva, the enjoyer and the sufferer, is neither the immutable Kutastha nor Chidabhasa (on account of which the intellect grasps the things that come within its range) but {{a combination of the}} two. The Jiva not realizing the reality of Kutastha considers all individual and collective enjoyments and sufferings to be real; the Jiva projects and superimposes on the Self the qualities of doership etc.; and assumes many forms in the <b>waking</b> and the <b>dream</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Desoille's first {{writings}} in the 1930s {{built on}} the work of Freud, Pierre Janet, and Roland Dalbiez. He studied the relationship between symbolism, invention, and memory in his early works, underscoring the applicability of the directed <b>waking</b> <b>dream</b> method in exploring sublimation. In the 1940s, Desoille referenced Jung's collective unconscious and presented his own conception of the mind based on Freud's three instances. The transference identified by Freud, Desoille believed, could be expressed and resolved in the directed <b>waking</b> <b>dream.</b> Finally in the 1950s and 1960s, concomitant to his political affiliations, Desoille held to a Pavlovian conception of neurosis, based on reflexes, in what was termed a [...] "rational psychotherapy". Those reflexes that are poorly adapted could be dissolved through the directed <b>waking</b> <b>dream</b> method, according to Desoille, and, starting in the imagination, new dynamic stereotypes could be formed. Desoille died at age 76 in Paris.|$|R

40|$|Despite the advancements in {{the study}} of sleep, many doubts still remain with regard to the phenomenal aspects of dreaming. Sleep mentation seems to lack a solid {{evolutionary}} explanation and we have no precise mapping of the phenomenal aspects of dreaming onto the neural activity of the sleeping brain. In order to address these issues, we propose to adopt Predictive Processing (PP), an emerging theoretical framework for cognitive science that aims to unify perception, action and cognition under a single mechanism (Clark 2013, in press; Hohwy 2013). The core idea is that brains are predictive machines with a hierarchical structure, continuously in the business of predicting their own sensory inputs. Applied to the study of dreaming (Hobson & Friston 2012, Hobson, Hong & Friston 2014), PP highlights the continuity and the differences of <b>dreaming</b> with other <b>waking</b> mental states, grounding them on the very same cognitive architecture. However, PP doesn't precisely account for the phenomenological aspects and how we come to experience anything in the first place (the “hard problem” of consciousness). We argue that if a second theory proves to be efficient in explaining the phenomenal aspect of dreaming, then PP could be integrated with it for a more comprehensive explanation of cognition. Our theory of choice is Integrated Information Theory (IIT) (Tononi 2012, Oizumi, Albantakis & Tononi 2014). According to IIT the quantity of consciousness of a system is equal to the amount of integrated information generated by its elements, while the quality of experience is defined in relation to maximally irreducible conceptual structures (MICS), i. e. constellation of concepts in the “qualia space”. Phenomenal consciousness is hence defined {{on the basis of the}} informational relationships generated by the system's repertoire of internal states, which characterizes conscious experience in both the <b>waking</b> and <b>dreaming</b> <b>state.</b> After the introduction on PP, IIT and the specific issues surrounding dreaming, we procede to explain how PP and IIT can be merged in order to explain the cognitive mechanism behind the emergence of dream phenomenology, focusing on the conceptual similarity between the two theories' vocabularies. Finally, we illustrate a few critical points and some implications of a more general merging of the theories...|$|R
