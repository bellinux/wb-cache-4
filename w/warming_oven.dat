500|$|KFC's {{core product}} {{offering}} is pressure fried, on-the-bone chicken pieces seasoned with Colonel Harland Sanders' [...] "Original Recipe" [...] of 11 herbs and spices. The product is typically available in either {{two or three}} piece individual servings, or in a family size cardboard bucket, typically holding between 6 and 16 chicken pieces. Poultry is divided into 9 different cuts (2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, 2 wings, 1 keel, and a backbone-based breast cut divided into 2 pieces). The product is hand-breaded at individual KFC outlets with wheat flour mixed with seasoning in a two- to four-minute process. It is then pressure fried for between seven and ten minutes (the timing differs between countries) in oil at 185 degrees Celsius. Following this, the chicken is left to stand for 5 minutes in order for it to sufficiently cool before it {{is placed in the}} <b>warming</b> <b>oven.</b> It is KFC policy to discard chicken if it has not been sold within 90 minutes, in order to ensure freshness. The frying oil varies regionally, and versions used include sunflower, soybean, rapeseed and palm oil. A KFC executive stated that the taste of the chicken will vary between regions depending on the oil variety used, and whether the chicken has been corn-fed or wheat-fed.|$|E

50|$|Chicken marsala is an Italian-American dish {{made from}} chicken cutlets, mushrooms, and Marsala wine. It is a {{variation}} of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, {{of which there are}} many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala wine is produced. The chicken is coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a <b>warming</b> <b>oven,</b> and served immediately.|$|E

The three stones create a shield around the open fire and also serve as pot holders. The fire is started at the center of the three stones and it is usually allowed to burn uncontrolled, leading to incomplete combustion [1]. 1. 2 Improved Chepkube stove The Chepkube stove was developed by women of the Kalenjin tribe and is considered a wood-saving stove. It is made out of bricks, stones and mud and has two or three burners (Figure S 2). The stove also has an opening which serves as a <b>warming</b> <b>oven.</b> There are various models of the stove and they vary according to the design women prefer. According to local information, the stove is also known as “kuni mbili ” (two pieces of wood) because a woman can cook an entire meal with only two pieces of wood. 1. 3 Pyrolysis stove The pyrolysis stove is an anila-type stove developed by U.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{selection}} of surface treatment binders in service is currently based on specifications that only {{account for the}} penetration and ductility of emulsion residues or the penetration and viscosity of hot-applied asphalt cements. These specifications consider neither {{the entire range of}} temperatures that the binders may be subjected to during production and in service, nor long-term aging behavior. A surface performance-graded (SPG) specification for the selection of surface treatment binders was developed as part of previous Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) and National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) projects. The work performed under the TxDOT Project 0 - 6616 was the basis for this thesis. In this project, the SPG specification, which is performance-based and takes into account the physical properties of the binder at the temperature ranges in which the material will be used, was further validated. This was accomplished by standardizing the emulsion residue recovery method through the evaluation of two <b>warm</b> <b>oven</b> methods, exploring the exclusive use of the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) for determining performance-based properties, and further field validating the thresholds for these properties. The laboratory and field results were used to revise the SPG specification for surface treatment binders in service. Binder samples collected from chip seal projects constructed on selected highway sections in Texas in summer 2011 were tested and graded according to the existing SPG specification developed in previous research projects. Two <b>warm</b> <b>oven</b> emulsion residue recovery methods were used and compared. New DSR tests, including the multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) test and the frequency sweep test were evaluated for developing additional criteria in the SPG specification. The SPG grades of the surface binder samples evaluated from laboratory tests were compared with the actual field performance of the highway sections one year after construction. The SPG specification was found to be functional in terms of enabling the selection of binders to ensure adequate surface treatment performance. Moreover, the results obtained from the MSCR and DSR frequency sweep tests were compared with field performance to develop additional criteria in the specification. Further validation is recommended to investigate the effects of construction and quality control processes, as this study is limited to producing a revised SPG specification for properties that address stiffness and aggregate retention in service...|$|R

60|$|Another cast {{of their}} {{politics}} {{was that of}} endeavouring to impeach an innocent l[a]dy, for no reason imaginable, but her faithful and diligent service to the Q[ueen],[14] and the favour her M[ajesty] bore to her upon that account, when others had acted contrary in so shameful a manner. What else was the crime? Had she treated her royal mistress with insolence or neglect? Had she enriched herself by a long practice of bribery, and obtaining exorbitant grants?

5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in <b>warm</b> <b>ovens,</b> cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} {{arrangement}} of construction for Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements was to place {{most of the}} buildings in a circular pattern surrounding a central structure; some examples of this arrangements were found at Târpeşti, Ioblona, Berezivka, Onoprievka, and Răşcani. The earliest villages consisted of ten to fifteen wattle-and-daub households. In their heyday, settlements expanded to include several hundred large huts, sometimes with two stories. These houses were typically <b>warmed</b> by an <b>oven,</b> and had round windows.

30|$|The likely {{effect of}} this {{information}} is to influence the priorities of tasks or the scheduling among appliances, favouring {{the ones that are}} most needed to meet the user comfort if he/she is coming home, and – conversely – perform the most annoying tasks when he or she is at work or at school. Examples range from controlling the home temperature to the preferred level when a given user is coming home, to <b>warming</b> the <b>oven</b> if the chef lady is coming home and likes to cook a cake or a pizza, scheduling the washing machine when nobody’s at home provided that there’s enough time for it before dinner time, etc. However, no specific intelligence – intended as the ability to reason and anticipate possible user wishes – is considered to be present at this stage: decisions are driven only by the rules embedded in the coordination layer during the configuration stage. Thus, systems in this category are substantially the same as above, with a “+ 4 ” layer in their architecture description.|$|R
