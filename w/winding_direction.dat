40|$|Derivation of {{sea surface}} <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> {{is a key}} step of sea surface wind {{retrieval}} from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. This technical note describes an implementation of the Local Gradient (LG) method to derive sea surface <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> at a scale of a few kilometers from X-band spaceborne SAR TerraSAR-X (TS-X) data in wide swath mode. The 180 ° ambiguity in the derived sea surface <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> is automatically eliminated using a single reference <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> from external data sources. Several typical cases acquired in the North Sea were presented to demonstrate the derivation of sea surface <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> under different <b>wind</b> situations using this method. The derived sea surface <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> were further compared to atmospheric model prediction results. In addition, a practical method is introduced to address ambiguity in the derived sea surface <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> using the LG method in a typhoon case with rotating surface wind structure. By interpolating the derived <b>wind</b> <b>directions</b> at a scale of kilometers, sea surface wind speeds with a spatial resolution of 500 m are subsequently retrieved using the X-band SAR sea surface wind Geophysical Model Function (GMF).

When this <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> signal is removed the rms difference between the SSM/I and buoy winds reduces to 1. 3 m/s.

5000|$|The {{direction}} of voltage induced across a coil by the moving string depends {{on both the}} coil <b>winding</b> <b>direction</b> and the polarity of the fixed magnet. On the other hand, the {{direction of}} current induced by external fields is only dependent on the direction of winding. Therefore, a humbucker has two coils wound {{in such a way}} to cancel hum and maximize signal when they are connected. By convention humbucker coils are both wound counterclockwise, however typically the outside ends of the coils are connected together so that the coil starts are out of phase. The magnet in the two coils is arranged with opposite polarity so that the string motion induces voltages across both coils that become additive when the coils are wired in this manner. Electromagnetic interference induces the same voltage across both coils. When the signals from both coils are summed together, the two noise voltages cancel while the signal voltages add. This dramatically improves the signal-to-noise ratio. The technique has something in common with what electrical engineers call [...] "common-mode rejection," [...] and is also found in the balanced lines used in audio equipment.|$|E
50|$|This type of winding {{structure}} {{creates an}} optimal fill factor (90.7%) for round wires. In {{order to do}} so, the windings of the upper layer need to be placed into the grooves, provided by the lower layer. If the circles are superposed, it can be seen, that the most compact design {{can be achieved by}} using an arrangement with a 60 degree angle. The ratio of provided space to the part of the circle can be determined mathematically.The best spatial use can be achieved if the winding is parallel to the coil flange for most of its circumference, in order to fulfill the stated requirement. When the winding has been placed around the coil body it will meet with the previous positioned wire and needs to make a step with the size of the wire gauge. This movement is called winding step. The winding step can occupy an area of up to 60 degree of the coil circumference for round coil bobbins and takes one side of rectangular coil bobbins. The area of the winding step is dependent on the wire gauge and coil bobbin geometry. If the winding step cannot be executed properly then the self-guiding ability of the wire is lost and a wild winding is produced. Overall, the first intruding wire mainly determines the location and quality of the winding step. It should be recognized that the wire needs to enter in a possibly flat angle into the winding space. That way an unnecessary bending of the wire is being avoided and the needs space for the second winding step is minimized. For orthocyclic wound coils, the winding step areas is always located at the area of wire entering the winding space and is being continued in helical form against the <b>winding</b> <b>direction.</b> As a consequence a bigger winding width of the coil, leads to a bigger winding step area along the circumference of the coil. The created offset leads to a different position of the layer step, from the first to the second layer, in comparison to the wire entry. This behavior repeats itself with every layer which leads to a spiral shaped crossover section {{at the side of the}} winding.Due to the fact that wires are crossing within the crossover section the resulting winding height is increased. As a result, orthocyclic wound coils with a round coil ground are never circular in the cross over section, but the radial moving winding and layer step creates a hump shape. Experience has shown that, depending on the winding width, coil and wire diameter, the crossover section is about 5 to 10 percent higher than the regular winding height.|$|E

30|$|The {{importance}} {{measure for}} <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> {{was not a}} strong driver of model behavior.

The relationship of <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> to the orientation of the topography could therefore be more influential than these results would indicate. <b>Wind</b> <b>direction</b> was also held constant for the simulations and was restricted to the northeast quadrant.

50|$|Modern large wind {{turbines}} are typically actively controlled {{to face the}} <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> measured by a wind vane situated {{on the back of}} the nacelle. By minimizing the yaw angle (the misalignment between wind and turbine pointing direction), the power output is maximized and non-symmetrical loads minimized. However, since the <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> varies quickly the turbine will not strictly follow the direction and will have a small yaw angle on average. The power output losses can simply be approximated to fall with (cos(yaw angle))3. Particularly at low-to-medium wind speeds, yawing can make a significant reduction in turbine output, with <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> variations of ±30° being quite common and long response times of the turbines to changes in <b>wind</b> <b>direction.</b> At high <b>wind</b> speeds, the <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> is less variable.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the lower}} {{efficiency}} and the larger <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> error of traditional algorithms, a novel integrated wind retrieval algorithm is proposed for conically scanning scatterometers. The proposed algorithm has the dual advantages of less computational cost and higher <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> retrieval accuracy by integrating the wind speed standard deviation (WSSD) algorithm and the <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> interval retrieval (DIR) algorithm. It adopts wind speed standard deviation as a criterion for searching possible wind vector solutions and retrieving a potential <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> interval based on the change rate of the wind speed standard deviation.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigated}} the peak current limiting {{characteristics of the}} flux-lock type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) with two magnetically coupled circuits. The flux-lock type SFCL with two magnetically coupled circuits has the similar fault current limiting characteristics to the flux-lock type SFCL using its third winding. The current limiting operation of the SFCL is performed by the generation of the magnetic flux between two coils when a fault happens and the fault current limiting characteristics of the SFCL are dependent on the <b>winding</b> <b>direction</b> of two coils. To confirm it, the peak current limiting characteristics of this SFCL were analyzed based on its electrical equivalent circuit and the fault limiting characteristics of this SFCL were investigated through the fault current limiting experiment.

40|$|The Galaxy Zoo 1 catalog {{displays}} a bias towards the S-wise <b>winding</b> <b>direction</b> in spiral galaxies which {{has yet to}} be explained. The lack of an explanation confounds our attempts to verify the Cosmological Principle, and has spurred some debate as to whether a bias exists in the real universe. The bias manifests not only in the obvious case of trying to decide if the universe as a whole has a winding bias, but also in the more insidious case of selecting which galaxies to include in a <b>winding</b> <b>direction</b> survey. While the former bias has been accounted for in a previous image-mirroring study, the latter has not. Furthermore, the bias has never been corrected in the GZ 1 catalog, as only a small sample of the GZ 1 catalog was re-examined during the mirror study. We show that the existing bias is a human selection effect rather than a human chirality bias. In effect, the excess S-wise votes are spuriously "stolen" from the elliptical and edge-on-disk categories, not the Z-wise category. Thus, when selecting a set of spiral galaxies by imposing a threshold T so that (P_S,P_Z) > T or P_S+P_Z>T, we spuriously select more S-wise than Z-wise galaxies. We show that when a provably unbiased machine selects which galaxies are spirals independent of their chirality, the S-wise surplus vanishes, even if humans are still used to determine the chirality. Thus, when viewed across the entire GZ 1 sample (and by implication, the Sloan catalog), the <b>winding</b> <b>direction</b> of arms in spiral galaxies as viewed from Earth is consistent with the flip of a fair coin.

40|$|Abstract: The superconducting {{fault current}} limiter (SFCL) can quickly limit the fault current {{shortly after the}} short circuit occurs and recover the superconducting state after the fault removes and {{plays a role in}} {{compensating}} the voltage sag of the sound feeder adjacent to the fault feeder as well as the fault current limiting operation of the fault feeder. Especially, the flux-lock type SFCL with an isolated transformer, which consists of two parallel connected coils on an iron core and the isolated transformer connected in series with one of two coils, has different voltage sag compensating and current limiting characteristics due to the <b>winding</b> <b>direction</b> and the inductance ratio of two coils. The current limiting and the voltage sag compensating characteristics of a SFCL using a transformer winding were analyzed. Through the analysis on the short-circuit tests results considering the <b>winding</b> <b>direction</b> of two coils, the SFCL designed with the additive polarity winding has shown the higher limited fault current than the SFCL designed with the subtractive polarity winding. It could be confirmed that the higher fault current limitation of the SFCL could be contributed to the higher load voltage sag compensation...|$|E

40|$|The {{forces on}} a turbine at extreme wind {{conditions}} when the turbine is parked {{is one of}} the most important design cases for the survivability of a turbine. In this work, the forces on a blade and its support arms have been measured on a 12 kW straight-bladed vertical axis wind turbine at an open site. Two cases are tested: one during electrical braking of the turbine, which allows it to rotate slowly, and one with the turbine mechanically fixed with the leading edge of the blade facing the main <b>wind</b> <b>direction.</b> The force variations with respect to <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> are investigated, and it is seen that significant variations in forces depend on the <b>wind</b> <b>direction.</b> The measurements show that for the fixed case, when subjected to the same wind speed, the forces are lower when the blade faces the <b>wind</b> <b>direction.</b> The results also show that due to the lower forces at this particular <b>wind</b> <b>direction,</b> the average forces for the fixed blade are notably lower. Hence, it is possible to reduce the forces on a turbine blade, simply by taking the dominating <b>wind</b> <b>direction</b> into account when the turbine is parked.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a system that, given approximately-centered images of spiral galaxies, produces quantitative descriptions of spiral galaxy structure {{without the need}} for per-image human input. This structure information consists of a list of spiral arm segments, each associated with a fitted logarithmic spiral arc and a pixel region. This list-of-arcs representation allows description of arbitrary spiral galaxy structure: the arms {{do not need to be}} symmetric, may have forks or bends, and, more generally, may be arranged in any manner with a consistent spiral-pattern center (non-merging galaxies have a sufficiently well-defined center). Such flexibility is important in order to accommodate the myriad structure variations observed in spiral galaxies. From the arcs produced from our method it is possible to calculate measures of spiral galaxy structure such as <b>winding</b> <b>direction,</b> winding tightness, arm counts, asymmetry, or other values of interest (including user-defined measures). In addition to providing information about the spiral arm "skeleton" of each galaxy, our method can enable analyses of brightness within individual spiral arms, since we provide the pixel regions associated with each spiral arm segment. For <b>winding</b> <b>direction,</b> arm tightness, and arm count, comparable information is available (to various extents) from previous efforts; to the extent that such information is available, we find strong correspondence with our output. We also characterize the changes to (and invariances in) our output as a function of modifications to important algorithm parameters. By enabling generation of extensive data about spiral galaxy structure from large-scale sky surveys, our method will enable new discoveries and tests regarding the nature of galaxies and the universe, and will facilitate subsequent work to automatically fit detailed brightness models of spiral galaxies...|$|E
