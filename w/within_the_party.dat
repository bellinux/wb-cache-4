5|$|Although the DPP {{passed a}} {{resolution}} to ban all factions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> in 2006, the dissent between former members of different factions was still present and {{was thought to be}} one of the factors that led to DPP's loss in the presidential election. Chai, along with Koo Kwang-ming emphasized the importance of consolidating the party's policy on independence, while Tsai Ing-wen focused on the cooperation of former factions and expansion of the party's support base.|$|E
5|$|Dubček's reforms {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} the press, and political commentary was allowed {{for the first time}} in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček's reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. <b>Within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party,</b> there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.|$|E

5|$|Factionalism {{returned}} {{in full force}} as the Progressive Conservatives fell from power in 1963, and while Diefenbaker's performance as Opposition Leader was heralded, his second loss at the polls prompted opponents <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> force him to a leadership convention in 1967. Diefenbaker stood for re-election as party leader at the last moment, but only attracted minimal support and withdrew. He remained an MP {{until his death in}} 1979, two months after Joe Clark became the first Tory Prime Minister since Diefenbaker.|$|E
5|$|If {{the leader}} of the {{opposition}} party is not a Member of Parliament, then a sitting MP takes the role of acting Leader of the Opposition until the party leader can obtain a seat.

5|$|In Bhutto's {{political}} will, she had designated Zardari her successor {{as party}} leader. However, their nineteen-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, became Chairman of the PPP because Zardari favoured Bilawal to represent Bhutto's legacy, {{in part to}} avoid division <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> due to his own unpopularity. He did, however, serve as Co-Chairman of the PPP {{for at least three}} years until Bilawal completed his studies overseas.|$|E
50|$|Negoiţă {{started his}} {{political}} career in 2004 when he joined <b>the</b> Social Democratic <b>Party.</b> In 2004 he became {{the vice president of}} the Social Democratic Youth (TSD; PSD’s youth organization) and an important figure <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party’s</b> organization.|$|R
50|$|Myles, however, quickly {{fell out}} with the {{leadership}} of <b>the</b> National <b>Party</b> (that had simultaneously become the Government) due to <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> own swing toward privatisation and the slashing of the Government's expenditure on social policy enthusiastically implemented by Finance Minister Ruth Richardson (see Ruthanasia). His disgust with the continuation of these reforms by Prime Minister Jim Bolger led to his identification with <b>the</b> rebels <b>within</b> <b>the</b> National <b>Party,</b> like Michael Laws and Winston Peters, who together had major confrontations with <b>the</b> dominant neo-liberals <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party's</b> relatively gargantuan caucus.|$|R

5|$|Mandela {{stepped down}} as ANC President at the party's December 1997 conference. He hoped that Ramaphosa would succeed him, believing Mbeki to be too {{inflexible}} and intolerant of criticism, but the ANC elected Mbeki regardless. Mandela and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party,</b> although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September 1929, Bormann married 19-year-old Gerda Buch, whose father, Major Walter Buch, {{served as}} a {{chairman}} of the Untersuchung und Schlichtungs-Ausschuss (USCHLA; Investigation and Settlement Committee), which was responsible for settling disputes <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> Hitler was a frequent visitor to the Buch house, and {{it was here that}} Bormann met him.

5|$|Rudd {{initially}} {{said that}} he would challenge Gillard, but it soon became apparent {{that he did not have}} enough support <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party</b> to survive in his position. Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.|$|E

5|$|Speer {{joined the}} Nazi Party in 1931, {{launching}} {{himself on a}} political and governmental career which lasted fourteen years. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Party</b> and he {{became a member of}} Hitler's inner circle. Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancellery and the Zeppelinfeld stadium in Nuremberg where Party rallies were held. Speer also made plans to reconstruct Berlin on a grand scale, with huge buildings, wide boulevards, and a reorganized transportation system.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher was {{challenged}} for {{the leadership of}} the Conservative Party by the little-known backbench MP Sir Anthony Meyer in the 1989 leadership election.

Her supporters in the party viewed the result as a success, and rejected suggestions that there was discontent <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E
5|$|The BJP's {{economic}} policy has changed considerably since its founding. There {{is a significant}} range of economic ideologies <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> In the 1980s, like the Jana Sangh, it reflected the thinking of the RSS and its affiliates. It supported swadeshi (the promotion of indigenous industries and products) and a protectionist export policy. However, it supported internal economic liberalisation, and opposed the state-driven industrialisation favoured by the Congress.|$|E

5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent of democratization which took place <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party.</b> The role of the Central Committee in decision-making was strengthened, {{and the role of the}} Politburo as a supreme organ was weakened. Inner-party accountability was strengthened. The Eighth Five-Year Plan of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam was approved at the congress, renewed its Marxist–Leninist credentials and emphasized the need to continue to improve the socialist-oriented market economy.|$|E
5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>party,</b> as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E
