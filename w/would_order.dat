5|$|On 19 July 2012, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond {{indicated}} {{in a speech}} in the United States that the UK <b>would</b> <b>order</b> an initial 48 F-35B aircraft to be operated jointly by the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm. In November 2015, the government announced its commitment to a full order of 138 F-35 aircraft, with 24 available for carrier duties by 2023.|$|E
5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was finally reached {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans <b>would</b> <b>order</b> food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
50|$|An <b>order</b> <b>would</b> {{not exist}} without a product {{and a person}} to create the order, {{so it could be}} argued that an <b>order</b> <b>would</b> be {{described}} as a weak entity and that products <b>ordered</b> <b>would</b> be a multivalue attribute of the order.|$|R
5000|$|The two kings {{prepared}} a Crusade to the Holy Land {{and for this}} knighthood there would be not less than one hundred thousand knights to be counted and in the literature the biggest order of all time.

5000|$|Traditional Chinese law {{strictly}} prohibited practicing gu-sorcery. For instance, {{during the reign}} of Tang Empress Wu Zetian, Schafer (1967:103) says,the possession of ku poison, like the casting of horoscopes, was cause for official suspicion and action: At that time many tyrannical office holders <b>would</b> <b>orders</b> robbers to bury ku or to leave prophecies in a man's household by night. Then, after the passage of a month, they would secretly confiscate it.|$|R
5|$|Following the 2006 {{decision}} {{to convert the}} Kolsås Line to metro standard, Akershus County Council announced they <b>would</b> <b>order</b> five units. In November 2006, the city government proposed that {{the maintenance of the}} new trains be privatized. This resulted in protests from the employees, who campaigned by refusing to work overtime. As a result, after a few weeks, the company lacked 57 trains to provide adequate service. The issue was solved when the socialist opposition parties along with the Liberal Party agreed to postpone the matter until after all the new trains were delivered in 2009. As part of the agreement, a new limited company, Oslo Vognselskap, wholly owned by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, would take ownership of all metro trains and trams used by the operating companies Oslo T-banedrift and Oslo Sporvognsdrift, the latter being the operator of the tramway. Responsibility for the debt accumulated for buying the trains is to be managed by Oslo Vognselskap, while operation and management of the maintenance contracts was transferred to Oslo T-banedrift.|$|E
5|$|For the US Navy, the Battle of Savo Island would {{institute}} many changes. Virtually every cruiser {{would be}} retrofitted with emergency diesel electric generators. The fire mains {{of the ships}} would be changed to a verticle loop design that could be broken many times and still function. Fires were set at Savo which were attributed to aviation facilities filled with gas, oil, and planes. Motorboats were filled with gasoline and also caught fire. In some cases, these facilities were dead amidships presenting a perfect target for enemy ships at night. Ready service lockers added to the destruction and {{it was noted that}} these lockers were never close to being depleted. The Commander in Chief <b>would</b> <b>order</b> sweeping changes be made before ships entered surface combat in the future.|$|E
5|$|No {{work was}} done to the ship over the {{following}} two years. On 18 January 1904, Ottoman negotiators began {{a new round of}} talks with Krupp, demanding a reduction in the cost of the modernization from 282,000lira to 65,000lira; this amount does not cover the preparatory work that had been initially carried out, let alone the reconstruction. In return, the Ottoman government <b>would</b> <b>order</b> a pair of torpedo cruisers—the —from Germaniawerft. With the armament contract still under negotiation, Krupp was forced to concede, despite the significant financial loss the reconstruction deal represented. By April, the armament contract was signed, and so work began slowly on Asar-i Tevfik. Work was completed by late 1906. The reconstructed ship departed Kiel on 19 November, and arrived in Constantinople on 4 January 1907.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April 2008 East Timor {{signed a}} {{contract}} for two new Chinese-built 43-metre Type-62 class patrol boats. These ships were to replace the Albatroz-class vessels and {{to be used to}} protect East Timor's fisheries. The contract for the ships also involved 30 to 40 East Timorese personnel being trained in China. The two new patrol boats arrived from China in June 2010, and were commissioned as the Jaco-class on the eleventh of the month. In November 2010 it was reported that East Timor <b>would</b> <b>order</b> a further two patrol boats from South Korea. In the event, three ex-Republic of Korea Navy Chamsuri class patrol boats were donated, and these entered service with the naval component on 26 September 2011. The East Timorese government also ordered two fast patrol boats from the Indonesian company PT Pal in March 2011 for the price of $US40million.|$|E
5|$|On 22 September, {{with about}} 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} of the 16th and 19th Divisions, von Oppen was moving northwards from Tubas towards Beisan when he learned {{it had already been}} captured. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders <b>would</b> <b>order</b> a strong rearguard action; however, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army, ordered him to cross the Jordan instead. Von Oppen successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across the Jordan River, before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked, capturing those who failed to cross the river.|$|E
5|$|The Eighth Army {{headquarters}} at Nablus was abandoned at 15:00 on 21 September, when Jevad join the Seventh Army headquarters, {{accompanied by his}} chief of staff and some staff officers. This move signalled the end of the Ottoman Eighth Army. The 20th and 21st Regiments existed only until the afternoon. All surviving remnants were in retreat and threatened with encirclement, including the Asia Corps. Von Oppen with 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman soldiers of the 16th and 19th Divisions, was retreating northwards towards Beisan when he learned it had fallen. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders <b>would</b> <b>order</b> a rearguard action. However, Jevad, (also known as Jevat Pasa and Cevat Pasa) the commander of the Eighth Army ordered him to cross the Jordan River.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{the shop}} passed to Christina in 1945. It was under her that the shop stagnated, with little {{investment}} and poorly paid staff who could be fired on a whim. She also refused to install any modern conveniences such as electronic tills or calculators; nor <b>would</b> <b>orders</b> be taken by phone. However, the shop excelled in other fields: expensive books ordered from as far off as Germany were sent with a bill without prepayment.|$|R

5|$|The {{service was}} a success, and NSB {{received}} a 112% increase in ridership the first year. This {{resulted in the}} company introducing a similar service between Trondheim and Innherred, the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, in 1993. In 1993, NSB won Statens Byggeskikkpris, among other things for the new sheds on the Jæren Line. By 1995, ridership was up 150% from before the service started. In 1997, NSB announced that they <b>would</b> <b>order</b> 36 new electric multiple units, which would among other things replace the aging trains on the Jæren Commuter Rail. The new Class 72 trains were put into service on 8 August 2002, several years behind schedule. In April 2004, the rail administration opened Jåttå Station, which was located close to Viking Stadion, the new home ground of Tippeligaen side Viking FK.|$|E
5|$|Von Oppen {{was moving}} northwards from Tubas towards Beisan the next day, with about 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} of the 16th and 19th Divisions, when he learned {{it had already been}} captured. He decided to advance during the night of 22 September to Samakh, where he correctly guessed Liman von Sanders <b>would</b> <b>order</b> the establishment of a strong rearguard. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army, ordered him to cross the Jordan instead; he successfully got all the Germans and some of the Ottoman soldiers across before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attack, which closed the last Jordan River gaps.

However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army which included Asia Corps, ordered von Oppen to move eastwards across the Jordan River. Von Oppen got all the German and some of his Ottoman soldiers across the Jordan River before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and closed that line of retreat during fighting to close the Jordan River gaps. All those who had not crossed the river were captured.|$|E

5|$|Given a {{classical}} name for Japan, Fusō was {{built at the}} Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. Japanese sources universally give the date for Kongōs keel-laying as 24 September 1875the same as that for the awarding of the contractbut historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard <b>would</b> <b>order</b> enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Fusō was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko, wife of the Japanese consul, cut the retaining rope with a hammer and chisel. Completed in January 1878, the ship sailed for Japan before 22 March {{under the command of}} a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. While transiting the Suez Canal, she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April. She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June. She was classified as a second-class warship while still in transit. She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. Beginning on 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the work}} to {{establish}} a financing package for new investments in public transport in Akershus and Oslo started. Oslo Package 2 was passed in 2001 and allowed municipal and state grants to be supplemented by increased fare and toll road revenue to finance, among other things, new trains for the metro. The initial order by Oslo Sporveier in 2003 from Siemens was for 33 units (99 cars), plus options for further orders. In 2005, the city council voted to replace all existing T1000 and T1300 stock with the MX3000, increasing the quantity by another 30 units. Two test units were delivered in October 2005, with the first serial deliveries in April 2007. With the delivery of the new white and gray trains, Oslo Sporveier received criticism {{that they had been}} disloyal to the old red color of the metro, and that they did not follow up on their former design concept from the 1960s through the 1980s. Following the 2006 decision to convert the Kolsås Line to metro standard, Akershus County Municipality announced they <b>would</b> <b>order</b> five units.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} find a {{replacement}} for the 2 BAe 146s, Drukair management fielded submissions from Airbus, Boeing and Embraer to determine their products' suitability to meet Drukair's stringent operational requirements. Bombardier was also invited by management to demonstrate the CRJ900 regional jet, however, the airline was advised by Bombardier the aircraft would be unsuited for operations at Paro. In February 2002, the Airbus A319 became the largest aircraft to ever land at Paro Airport, when Airbus demonstrated the aircraft to the airline. By October, Boeing had withdrawn from the competition due to {{not being able to}} source an aircraft to demonstrate to the airline. With the Embraer E-190 yet to fly, it was expected that Drukair <b>would</b> <b>order</b> the A319. However, the government had concerns regarding financing for the purchase, and in October the final decision was delayed. After a short period of time, the government instructed management to begin evaluations once again, and a Boeing 737–700 conducted eleven test flights at Paro Airport in February 2003, in which it was demonstrated it met the requirements of the airline for operation into Paro.|$|E
