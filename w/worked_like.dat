5|$|American {{inventor}} John Wesley Hyatt {{together with}} his brother Isaiah, Hyatt patented the first injection moulding machine in 1872. This machine was relatively simple compared to machines in use today: it <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a large hypodermic needle, using a plunger to inject plastic through a heated cylinder into a mould. The industry progressed slowly over the years, producing products such as collar stays, buttons, and hair combs.|$|E

25|$|The bracteates {{were usually}} called back regularly, about {{once or twice}} a year, and could be {{exchanged}} for new coins with a deduction (Renovatio Monetae). This system <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a demurrage: People wouldn't hoard their coins, because they lost their value. So this money was used more as a medium of exchange than for storing value. This increased the velocity of money and stimulated the economy.|$|E

A WS (write S) control signal moved the address from the write bus into the S register.|$|E
25|$|Like Ireland, France became {{well known}} for its butter, {{particularly}} in Normandy and Brittany. By the 1860s, butter had become so in demand in France that Emperor Napoleon III offered prize money for an inexpensive substitute to supplement France's inadequate butter supplies. A French chemist claimed the prize with the invention of margarine in 1869. The first margarine was beef tallow flavored with milk and <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> butter; vegetable margarine followed after the development of hydrogenated oils around 1900.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{improvement}} was the split-anode magnetron, {{also known as}} a negative-resistance magnetron. As the name implies, this design used an anode that was split in two — one {{at each end of the}} tube — creating two half-cylinders. When both were charged to the same voltage the system <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> the original model. But by slightly altering the voltage of the two plates, the electron's trajectory could be modified so that they would naturally travel towards the lower voltage side. The plates were connected to an oscillator that reversed the relative voltage of the two plates at a given frequency.|$|E

25|$|Slavery is {{more common}} when the labour done is {{relatively}} simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop. It {{is much more difficult}} and costly to check that slaves are doing their best and with good quality when they are doing complex tasks. Therefore, slavery was seen as the most efficient method of production for large-scale crops like sugar and cotton, whose output was based on economies of scale. This enabled a gang system of labour to be prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. Each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that not only assigned every member of the gang to a precise task but simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. The hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. The plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. Thus, the gang system <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> an early version of the assembly line later to be found in factories.|$|E

500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> crazy these past twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because I wanted to leave Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
500|$|Among {{the visual}} changes during Homicides second season were {{brighter}} colors. While colorist Drexel Williams previously drained footage of color value {{to create a}} gritty style, cinematographer Jean de Segonzac directed Williams to make the colors less muted and more lively. Segonzac also sought a more restrained visual style, as he believed the previous cinematographer Wayne Ewing tended to [...] "get a little too wild, and someone could complain they got a little dizzy". Levinson praised {{what he described as}} a subtler and more effective style under Segonzac. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was originally meant to serve as the second season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from Williams' guest appearance. The scenes with Williams were filmed over three days; Fontana said of the shooting, [...] " [...] <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us. It's very intense." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} over Bird's endorsement {{of a machine}} invented by one I. L. Pulvermacher that became known as Pulvermacher's chain. [...] The main market for this device was the very quack practitioners that Bird so detested, but it did actually work as a generator. [...] Bird was given a sample of this machine in 1851 and was impressed enough to give Pulvermacher a testimonial stating that the machine was a useful source of electricity. [...] Bird thought {{that it could be}} used by physicians as a portable device. [...] Electrically, the machine <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a voltaic pile, but was constructed differently. [...] It consisted of a number of wooden dowels, each with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc coils. [...] Each winding was connected to the next dowel by means of metal hooks and eyes, which also provided the electrical connection. [...] The electrolyte was provided by soaking the dowels in vinegar.Lardner, pp. 288–289 ...|$|E

500|$|Cyberpunk pioneer William Gibson {{credits the}} film as an {{influence}} on his novel Neuromancer. [...] "I was intrigued by the exchange {{in one of the}} opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot." [...] Popular videogame director Hideo Kojima has referred to the movie frequently as an influence on his work, in particular the Metal Gear series. Solid Snake is partially influenced by Snake Plissken. In Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Snake actually uses the alias [...] "Pliskin" [...] to hide his real identity during most of the game. J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film Cloverfield, mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for Escape from New York. Empire magazine ranked Snake Plissken #29 in their [...] "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" [...] poll.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, the First Continental Congress was {{convened in}} {{response}} to the passage of the Intolerable Acts. Adams agreed to attend, despite an emotional plea from his friend Jonathan Sewall to do otherwise. At the Congress, Adams renewed his push for the right to a jury trial, stating [...] "Representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty. Without them, we have no other fortification against being ridden like horses, fleeced like sheep, <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> cattle, and fed and clothed like swines and hounds.” Adams did not generally like the other delegates to the Congress. He complained of what he considered to be their pretentiousness, writing to Abigail, [...] "I believe if it was moved and seconded that We should come to a Resolution that Three and two make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History, Politicks and Mathematicks, concerning the Subject for two whole Days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the Affirmative." [...] The Congress disbanded in October after sending a letter of grievances to King George III.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{objected to}} Kenney's {{suggestion}} that the bombers conduct attacks from low level with bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker to try the instantaneous fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued the use of the instantaneous fuses. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck; but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, and bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. [...] "Ken was okay," [...] Kenney later recalled. [...] "He was stubborn, over-sensitive, and a prima donna, but he <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a dog all the time. His gang liked him a lot but he tended to get a staff of 'yes-men'. He did not like to delegate authority. I was afraid that Ken was not durable enough to last very long under the high tension of this show." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] was {{originally}} meant {{to serve as}} the second season finale, but NBC decided to make it the season premiere with the hopes of getting increased ratings from a guest appearance by Robin Williams. Williams portrayed Robert Ellison, the husband of a slain woman tourist. Several news sources indicated Williams took on the role as a favor to Homicide executive producer Barry Levinson, who directed Williams in the films Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Toys (1992). But Fontana said Williams agreed to take the part based on the actor's positive impression of both the show in general and the [...] "Bop Gun" [...] script in particular. Fontana said of Williams, [...] "He read the script, responded instantly and said, 'When do you want me there?'. He {{could not have been more}} prepared or more of a gentleman to everyone, and he worked his tail off. That whole experience was a joy." [...] Williams himself said of the show, [...] "Visually, it was just so different from anything else on television." [...] Although Williams was primarily known for his comedic work, the Homicide producers and Williams himself consciously decided to remain true to the original script, rejecting the idea of adding humor or jokes to the episode. Williams' scenes were filmed over three days, and the actors found the part emotionally draining. Fontana said, [...] " [...] <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a dog. It was quite a special event for all of us. It's very intense." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Iwata, {{he was surprised}} about the game's reception outside Japan, which retrogamers have named {{it as one of}} their favorite and most memorable 8-bit titles. He said: [...] "It’s kind of funny that the first time I ever really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office said something to me like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, but he said it was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E
500|$|The Alouette {{was then}} hit and, {{although}} only lightly damaged, forced to withdraw, leaving the ground troops without covering MAG fire. Now {{covered by the}} Rhodesian ground troops and Frantans dropped by Percival Provosts, the South Africans made several unsuccessful attempts to pull back from {{the banks of the}} gully throughout the afternoon which led to two injuries and the death of Constable du Toit. The SAP men were eventually able to withdraw under cover of darkness, while Rhodesian and South African injured were uplifted by helicopter in an action described by Southey as [...] "sheer brilliance". [...] "Norman Walsh and Peter Nicholls [...] faced great difficulty because of steep mountainsides and the blackness of the night in conditions of thick haze," [...] writes Peter Petter-Bowyer, then an RRAF flight lieutenant. [...] "Visual contact with [...] ground [...] impossible until dangerously low and close." [...] Flying at such low altitude, each pilot was blinded by the reflection of his own landing light when he looked towards the ground. Walsh noticed that he could clearly see the ground beneath the other helicopter's light, and so instructed Nicholls to turn off his landing light and allow him to illuminate the landing site for him. [...] "This <b>worked</b> <b>like</b> a charm," [...] says Petter-Bowyer. Guided by Walsh's landing light, Nicholls safely landed and collected some of the casualties, then did the same for Walsh as he picked up the rest. Flares were dropped during the night to help the ground troops search for guerrilla movement but none was seen.|$|E
