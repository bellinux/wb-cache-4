At the BBC, there was no political dimension in their popular drama whatsoever. And I was really depressed about it, as indeed were other writers that I knew. And so, I said to my closest colleagues: 'The only thing one can do is actually write stuff that one knows {{is not going to}} get made, but at least we'll get it out of our system.' And that's how I started to <b>write</b> <b>Edge</b> Of Darkness. I didn't really think that it stood much of a chance of being produced.|$|R
