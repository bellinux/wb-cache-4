Erie became an international port after the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Jemima {{tells her}} life story to Maria and Darnford, {{explaining}} {{that she was}} born a bastard. Jemima's mother died {{while she was still}} an infant, making her already precarious social position worse. She was therefore forced to become a servant in her father's house and later bound out as an apprentice to a master who beat her, starved her, and raped her. When the man's wife discovers that Jemima is pregnant with his child, she is thrown out of the house. Unable to support herself, she aborts her child and becomes a prostitute. She becomes the kept woman of a man of some wealth who seems obsessed <b>with</b> <b>pleasure</b> of every kind: food, love, etc. After the death of the gentleman keeping her, she becomes an attendant at the asylum where Maria is imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1971, the Drain {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} {{there was ever a}} right of navigation, or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, <b>with</b> <b>pleasure</b> boating not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association.|$|E

5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches <b>with</b> <b>pleasure</b> as Beyoncé {{continues}} the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
5|$|Merchants {{organised}} {{themselves into}} powerful guilds that transcended political divisions, allowing their operations {{to be largely}} unaffected by wars and revolutions. Their only threat was the possibility of theft from brigands when their ships and caravans traveled to distant lands. Powerful South Indian merchant guilds included the Manigramam, the Nagarattar and the Anjuvannam. Local guilds were called nagaram, while the Nanadesis were traders from neighbouring kingdoms who perhaps mixed business <b>with</b> <b>pleasure.</b> The wealthiest and most influential and celebrated of all South Indian merchant guilds was the self-styled Ainnurruvar, {{also known as the}} 500 Svamis of Ayyavolepura (Brahmins and Mahajanas of present-day Aihole), who conducted extensive land and sea trade and thereby contributed significantly to the total foreign trade of the empire. It fiercely protected its trade obligations (Vira Bananjudharma or law of the noble merchants) and its members often recorded their achievements in inscriptions (prasasti). Five hundred such excavated Prasasti inscriptions, with their own flag and emblem, the bull, record their pride in their business.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{is popular}} <b>with</b> <b>pleasure</b> boaters, {{as much of}} it is pleasantly rural, with added {{interest}} provided by the city of Chester and Ellesmere Port with its waterways museum. The towpath through Chester provides an attractive route for walkers. The canal is well connected, with links to the Trent and Mersey Canal via the Middlewich Branch to the east, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal via the former Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal to the south, and provides a route to the Llangollen Canal, from which the Montgomeryshire Canal, which is the subject of an ongoing restoration scheme, can be accessed. Boaters can also access the River Dee at Chester, although advance notice must be given, and the river is only accessible for four hours either side of high tide. At Ellesmere Port, the canal has connected to the Manchester Ship Canal since its opening in 1894. For many leisure cruisers, the requirements of the ship canal company for taking small boats onto a large commercial waterway are too daunting, and Ellesmere Port acts as the end of their journey.|$|E

25|$|To {{accommodate}} smoother {{penetration of}} the vagina during sexual intercourse or other sexual activity, vaginal moisture increases during sexual arousal in human females and also in other female mammals. This increase in moisture is vaginal lubrication, which reduces friction. The texture of the vaginal walls creates friction for the penis during sexual intercourse and stimulates it toward ejaculation, enabling fertilization. Along <b>with</b> <b>pleasure</b> and bonding, women's sexual behavior with others (which can include heterosexual or lesbian sexual activity) can result in sexually transmitted infections (STIs), the risk {{of which can be}} reduced by recommended safe sex practices. Other disorders may also affect the human vagina.|$|E

25|$|Solhi al-Wadi's immense overall activity, {{especially}} his administrative, teaching and performing duties, allowed him limited time for composing, but he cherished {{those moments when}} he could satisfy the great urge he had to express himself. He believed that he should contribute {{to the world of}} music by whatever means he was capable of. His works are performed enthusiastically by musicians in Syria and other countries. In addition to that he received throughout his artistic life commissions to compose music for Arabic films, something he accepted and fulfilled <b>with</b> <b>pleasure,</b> but even though incidental music brought him fame all over the Arab world, his compositions for chamber ensembles figure among his finest creative achievements.|$|E
25|$|It {{has further}} been {{suggested}} that John Milton's Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle (1634) is a sequel to Tempe Restored, a masque in which Circe had figured two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is {{a reversal of the}} Greek myth. At the start of the masque, the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by Bacchus, god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll <b>with</b> <b>pleasure</b> in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he stands over her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces the men she meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.|$|E
25|$|The 18th {{century was}} a time of {{enlightenment}} progression occurring in all intellectual fields. However, the English language was deteriorating into a tangled mess. A group of London booksellers commissioned well-known essayist Samuel Johnson to compile a set of rules governing the English Language. After nine years and the help of six assistants the first edition of A Dictionary of the English Language was published in 1755. Johnson's great knowledge of letters, words and literature brought uniqueness to his dictionary. Each word defined in detail, with descriptions of their various uses and numerous literary quotes as illustrations. This was the first dictionary of its kind, containing 40,000 words and nearly 114,000 quotes packed together with Johnson's personal touch. A warm reception greeted Johnson's Dictionary as it was the first dictionary that could be read <b>with</b> <b>pleasure.</b> The definitions full of wit and depth of thought supported by passages from beloved poets and philosophers, which a reader could be content spending an evening poring over its pages. Johnson's choice of structure and format has certainly shaped future English dictionaries and lexicons and the role they play in language development.|$|E

Jackson Pollock, a major force in the abstract expressionist movement, was also influenced by El Greco.
