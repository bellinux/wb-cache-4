5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death {{less than}} a month after her {{daughter}} Mary was born, Mary was raised by Godwin, who was able to provide his daughter with a rich, if informal, education, encouraging her to adhere to his own liberal political theories. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> was four, her father married a neighbour, with whom, as her stepmother, Mary came to have a troubled relationship.|$|E

60|$|Suddenly Fan {{raised her}} eyes, wet with tears, and looked fixedly at the other's face; {{nor did she}} drop them <b>when</b> <b>Mary's</b> eyes, opening wide and expressing a little {{surprise}} at the girl's courage, and a little resentment, returned the look.|$|R
5|$|The True Directions {{kids are}} {{encouraged}} to rebel against Mary by two of her former students, ex-ex-gays Larry and Lloyd (Richard Moll and Wesley Mann), who take the campers to a local gay bar where Graham and Megan's relationship develops into a romance. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> discovers the trip, she makes them all picket Larry and Lloyd's house, carrying placards and shouting homophobic abuse. Megan and Graham sneak away one night to have sex and begin to fall in love. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> finds out, Megan, now at ease with her sexual identity, is unrepentant. She is made to leave True Directions and, now homeless, goes to stay with Larry and Lloyd. Graham, afraid to defy her father, remains at the camp.

5|$|Back at the dance, Harry's {{group are}} outside {{and take the}} {{assumption}} {{that they have been}} abandoned by Harry because he has not showed up. In actuality, Harry is hiding at the wall near them and takes another drink of the vial of formula before walking off. Soon after, Peter returns to find the dance almost abandoned except for Mary Jane, who is dancing with another boy. Downtrodden, he is reassured <b>when</b> <b>Mary</b> Jane walks up to him and tells him that she saved the last dance for him.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 1565 <b>when</b> <b>Mary</b> married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, {{some of the}} Protestant nobles, {{including}} James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, rose up in rebellion. Knox {{revealed his}} own objection while preaching {{in the presence of}} the new King Consort on 19 August 1565. He made passing allusions on ungodly rulers which caused Darnley to walk out. Knox was summoned and prohibited from preaching while the court was in Edinburgh.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{come out}} to the {{graveyard}} and tell us about yourself," [...] ordered Faith, <b>when</b> <b>Mary's</b> appetite showed signs of failing her. Mary was now nothing loath. Food had restored her natural vivacity and unloosed her by no means reluctant tongue.|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>Mary's</b> parents died, she {{distributed}} the farmland she inherited among her sisters and the orphans of the community. She left Volissos {{and returned to}} Katavasis. Her food was simple and brought to her by one of her sisters. After three years she left Katavasis {{and went to the}} capital of the island, where there were many women's monasteries.|$|R
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> I {{came to the}} throne, she had Bucer and Fagius tried posthumously for heresy as part of {{her efforts}} to restore Catholicism in England. Their caskets were disinterred and their remains burned, along with copies of their books. On 22 July 1560, Elizabeth I {{formally}} rehabilitated both reformers. A brass plaque on the floor of Great St Mary's marks the original location of Bucer's grave.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of King Edward VI on 6July 1553, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who had led the young King's {{government}} {{for the last three}} and a half years, tried to install his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey on the English throne; she was the King's Protestant cousin to whom Edward had willed the Crown, bypassing his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> Tudor asserted her right to the throne, an expedition against her base in East Anglia became inevitable. Northumberland marched on 14July, accompanied by his eldest sons, John and Ambrose. Five days later the Privy Council changed sides; on hearing this on 20July, Northumberland, who had been staying at Cambridge, gave up and was arrested with his party the next day.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th century, {{the castle}} became {{increasingly}} valued for its hunting facilities {{rather than its}} military defences. It fell into disrepair and, despite {{the construction of new}} living quarters and service facilities, {{by the middle of the}} 16th century it was derelict. Henry VIII sold the property to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, and most of the castle buildings were demolished. It was not until the 19th century, <b>when</b> <b>Mary</b> and Fulke Greville Howard inherited the property, that the castle was renovated and restored. Victorian scholars examined the site, and it was opened to the public. In 1958 the castle passed into the custody of the state, which carried out further stabilisation work and a programme of archaeological investigation. In 1998 English Heritage passed the management of the site back to its current owner, Baron Howard of Rising, who continues to operate the castle as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5000|$|According to Hortus Veitchii, [...] "Maries had enthusiasm, but lacked [...] "staying" [...] power: he was musical, much to {{the delight}} of the Japanese peasants, and doubtless this must often have helped the work: he was a skilled shot, as the bucks on the domains of the Maharajah Scindia learnt to their cost <b>when</b> <b>Maries</b> was living in the country of the Mahrattas." ...|$|R

5|$|Elizabeth {{was still}} {{attached}} to her old friend <b>when</b> <b>Mary</b> Dudley left the court in July 1579because of bad health, or out of solidarity with her brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, who was in disgrace for having married. She joined her husband at Ludlow in 1582, where he was serving his third turn as President of the Council of Wales. A year later her health {{was in such a}} state that Henry Sidney believed he would soon have the opportunity to take a second wife. Mary Dudley died on 9August 1586, three months after her husband, in whose elaborate funeral she had participated. She was buried by his side at Penshurst.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's first {{policy toward}} Scotland was {{to oppose the}} French {{presence}} there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put Mary, Queen of Scots, who was {{considered by many to}} be the heir to the English crown, on the throne. Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> returned to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused to ratify the treaty.|$|E
5|$|For most of Edward's reign, Mary {{remained}} {{on her own}} estates and rarely attended court. A plan between May and July 1550 to smuggle her out of England {{to the safety of}} the European mainland came to nothing. Religious differences between Mary and Edward continued. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> was in her thirties, she attended a reunion with Edward and Elizabeth for Christmas 1550, where 13-year-old Edward embarrassed Mary, and reduced both her and himself to tears in front of the court, by publicly reproving her for ignoring his laws regarding worship. Mary repeatedly refused Edward's demands that she abandon Catholicism, and Edward persistently refused to drop his demands.|$|E
50|$|The Valley of Decision (1945) {{is a film}} set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA in {{the late}} 19th century. It {{tells the story of}} a young Irish house maid who falls in love with the son of her employer, a local steel mill owner. The romance between Paul and <b>Mary</b> is {{endangered}} <b>when</b> <b>Mary's</b> family and friends, all steel mill workers, go on strike against Paul's father.|$|R
50|$|Her family {{reached the}} zenith of their {{influence}} {{during the reign}} of Henry VIII, <b>when</b> <b>Mary's</b> grandparents, Sir John Shelton and Anne Boleyn were entrusted with the custody of the future Mary I and Elizabeth I. This was partly as Anne was the aunt of Queen Anne Boleyn and Mary's aunt, poet Mary Shelton, was the King's mistress. She married a gentleman usher, Sir John Scudamore.|$|R
5000|$|The {{situation}} gets complicated {{when the}} couple accidentally meet outside their apartment, not knowing who the other is, and begin to fall in love. Matters get worse <b>when</b> <b>Mary's</b> boss, lecherous H.

5|$|The 3rd Duke of Norfolk, {{also called}} Thomas, made far less {{use of the}} castle, using first Stoke-by-Nayland and then Kenninghall as his {{principal}} residence. Thomas was attainted in 1547 {{for his part in}} supporting the claim of Mary to the throne; Henry VIII died the day before Thomas was due to be executed at the Tower, and his successor, Mary's half-brother Edward VI, reprieved Thomas but kept him in the Tower, giving Framlingham to Mary. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> seized power in 1553 she collected her forces at Framlingham Castle before successfully marching on London. Thomas was released from the Tower by Mary as a reward for his loyalty, but retired to Kenninghall rather than Framlingham. The castle was leased out but when the 4th Duke, another Thomas, was executed for treason by Elizabeth I in 1572 the castle passed back to the Crown.|$|E
5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. <b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Mary</b> died of {{smallpox}} in 1694, William continued to reign alone. Anne became his heir apparent, since any children {{he might have}} by another wife were assigned to a lower place {{in the line of}} succession, and the two reconciled publicly. He restored her previous honours, allowed her to reside in St James's Palace, and gave her Mary's jewels, but excluded her from government and refrained from appointing her regent during his absences abroad. Three months later, William restored Marlborough to his offices. With Anne's restoration at court, Berkeley House became a social centre for courtiers who had previously avoided contact with Anne and her husband.|$|E

50|$|Bennett {{became a}} head coach {{for the first time}} in 2001 <b>when</b> Saint <b>Mary's</b> College of California hired him. Inheriting a team that won only two games the {{previous}} season, Bennett improved his team's win-loss totals every season until 2004-05, <b>when</b> Saint <b>Mary's</b> went 25-9 with a berth in the NCAA Tournament. Bennett has led Saint Mary's to the NCAA Tournament in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013 and National Invitation Tournament in 2009, 2011, 2014, 2015 and 2016.|$|R
5|$|Word of Merrimacks {{reconstruction}} and conversion was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 <b>when</b> <b>Mary</b> Louveste of Norfolk, a freed slave {{who worked as}} a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on Merrimack, made her way through Confederate lines with news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship. Concealed in her dress was a message from a Union sympathizer who worked in the Navy Yard warning that the former Merrimack, renamed Virginia by the Confederates, was nearing completion. Upon her arrival in Washington Mary managed to meet with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and informed him that the Confederates were nearing the completion of their ironclad, which surprised Welles. Convinced by the papers Mary was carrying he had production of Monitor sped up. Welles later recorded in his memoirs that Mrs. Louveste encountered no small risk in bringing this information...|$|E
5|$|Aberdour Castle was {{reserved}} to his mother-in-law, Countess Katherine, until 1564, <b>when</b> <b>Mary,</b> Queen of Scots, confirmed Morton's {{right to the}} whole barony of Dalkeith and Aberdour. In 1566, Morton was involved in planning a rebellion against the Queen, {{which resulted in the}} murder of Queen Mary's secretary, David Riccio, but failed to gain further momentum, and Morton was forced to flee to England. However, {{by the end of the}} year he had returned, and by July the following year, Mary was imprisoned and had been forced to abdicate by the Scottish noblemen. Morton was appointed Regent of Scotland, for the child King James VI in 1572. He undertook extensions to the castle in the 1570s, rebuilding the south block of c. 1500, and extending it further south to form the present central range. He also drew inspiration from contemporary gardens in England, such as Hampton Court, in laying out the terraced gardens. The Privy Council met at Aberdour Castle in August 1576, but Morton's regency came to an end in 1578. He was later implicated in the 1567 murder of Queen Mary's husband, Lord Darnley, and executed in 1581 on the orders of the young King.|$|E
5|$|James Winchester {{arrived in}} Gibraltar on January 15, to inquire <b>when</b> <b>Mary</b> Celeste might be {{released}} to deliver its cargo. Flood demanded a surety of $15,000, money Winchester did not have. He became aware that Flood thought he might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers, as part of some conspiracy. On January 29, during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood, Winchester testified to Briggs's high character, and insisted {{that he would not}} have abandoned the ship except in extremity. Flood's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt's view the marks on the bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship's timbers.|$|E
50|$|At the Bethlehem Inn, {{the innkeeper}} (Moe) tells Mary and Joseph {{that he has}} plenty of rooms {{available}} with brand new carpeting. However, <b>when</b> <b>Mary's</b> water breaks, he forces them {{to stay in the}} barn. Mary successfully gives birth to the baby, and the three wise men, along with the two shepherds (Lenny and Carl) come to see Jesus. Joseph is upset because he is not Jesus's father, and when he drinks some wine, the baby turns it into water.|$|R
50|$|She later {{wakes up}} in {{hospital}} {{and the man who}} saved her is revealed to be the local pediatrician, Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey). <b>When</b> <b>Mary's</b> friend and colleague Penny (Judy Greer) arrives, she persuades Steve to attend an outdoor movie screening with them at the park, only to make up an excuse to leave the pair alone.
