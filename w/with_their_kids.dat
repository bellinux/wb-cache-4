25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, fashion had {{moved away from}} the unkempt hippie look and overdressed disco style of the late 1970s. Athletic clothes were more popular than jeans during this period, as were more subdued colors. Popular colors were black, white, indigo, forest green, burgundy, and {{different}} shades of browns, tans, and oranges. Velour, velvet, and polyester were popular fabrics used in clothes, especially button-up and v-neck shirts. Looser pants remained popular during this time, being fairly wide but straight, and tighter shirts were especially popular. The general public, at this time, wanted to wear low-maintenance clothing with more basic colors, as the global recession going on at the time kept extravagant clothes out of reach. Also worn were striped tube socks sometimes worn with the top folded over worn with shorts. It was not uncommon to see parents especially fathers wearing these along <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>kids.</b>|$|E

500|$|Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News praised Kim Possible as [...] "an {{entertaining}} {{show that}} should indeed appeal to tweens, younger kids {{and even their}} parents" [...] that [...] "plays with the superhero format {{in a way that}} doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't play down to the viewers." [...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need to watch tv (sic) <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>kids.</b> But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the kind of girl who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E
500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times called Ratatouille [...] "a nearly {{flawless}} {{piece of}} popular art, {{as well as}} one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film"; echoing the character Anton Ego in the film, he ended his review with a simple [...] "thank you" [...] to the creators of the film. Wally Hammond of Time Out gave the film five out of five stars, saying [...] "A test for tiny tots, a mite nostalgic and as male-dominated as a modern kitchen it may be, but these are mere quibbles about this delightful addition to the Pixar pantheon." [...] Andrea Gronvall of the Chicago Reader gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Brad Bird's second collaboration with Pixar is more ambitious and meditative than his Oscar-winning The Incredibles." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Ratatouille such a hilarious and heartfelt wonder is the way Bird contrives to let it sneak up on you. And get a load of that score from Michael Giacchino, a perfect compliment to a delicious meal." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "For parents looking to spend time in a theater <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> or adults who want something lighter and less testosterone-oriented than the usual summer fare, Ratatouille offers a savory main course." [...] Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Ratatouille is free of the kind of gratuitous pop-culture references that plague so many movies of the genre; it tells a story, it's very much of our world but it never goes for the cheap, easy gag." [...] Justin Chang of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients – abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication – to produce a warm and irresistible concoction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, a {{storyboard}} writer, {{says that}} writers of Rocko's Modern Life targeted children and adults. He cites Rocky and Bullwinkle {{as an example}} of another series that contains references indecipherable by children and understood by adults. Aiming for a similar goal, Marsh described the process as [...] "a hard job". According to him, when censors questioned proposed material, sometimes the team disagreed with the opinions of the censors and sometimes the team agreed with the rationale of the censors. He says that [...] "many people" [...] told him that the team [...] "succeeded in this endeavor" [...] and that [...] "many parents I know really enjoyed watching the show <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> for just this reason". John Pacenti said the series [...] "seems very much aimed at adults" [...] "for a children's cartoon". Marsh believes that the material written by Doug Lawrence stands {{as an example of}} a [...] "unique sense of humor". For instance, Marsh credits Lawrence with the [...] "pineapple references" [...] adding that Lawrence believed that pineapples seemed humorous. The staff drew upon Looney Tunes and the Fleischer cartoons to appeal to a wide demographic: having a certain adult sensibility but also enjoyed by kids.|$|E
