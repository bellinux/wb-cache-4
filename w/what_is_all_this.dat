Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding [...] "I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels.

2500|$|Some of Anderson's men {{managed to}} get across the creek and {{momentarily}} threaten Reynolds's position, however he was reinforced by Meade's brigade and two regiments from Morell's division. The three Confederate brigades were driven back with substantial casualties. Arriving {{on the field and}} realizing what was happening, Robert E. Lee hastily summoned Longstreet's and D.H. Hill's divisions. As Lee surveyed the futile attacks, Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet rode up to him. Davis asked him [...] "General, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> army and what is it doing here?" [...] Lee replied sarcastically [...] "I don't know, Mr. President. It is not my army and this is no place for it." [...] William D. Pender's brigade then attacked the Union left flank at Ellerson's Mill, held by Seymour's brigade. Once again, the well-entrenched infantry and massed artillery proved too much for the Confederates and Pender was forced to retreat. Just then, Roswell Ripley's brigade of D.H. Hill's division arrived on the field and was ordered next to assault the Union left. Ripley charged head-on into the Union entrenchments and suffered the very worst of all with over 600 casualties, the largest percentage of them coming from the 44th Georgia, which lost 335 men and most of its officers (out of a total of 514), including its colonel Robert A. Smith, a roughly 65% casualty rate. The 1st North Carolina suffered 50% casualties (133 men killed, wounded, or captured) and also lost its commander, Col. Montford Stokes. General Ripley himself survived unscathed, but came within inches of being decapitated by an artillery shell. Ripley's other two regiments, the 3rd North Carolina and 48th Georgia, were {{to the rear of the}} 1st North Carolina and 44th Georgia; their losses were lighter. Union casualties around Ellerson's Mill were small, only 40 men total were killed or wounded in the 7th Pennsylvania Reserves and 12th Pennsylvania Reserves, which were defending this sector of the battlefield. The 13th Pennsylvania Reserves lost 75 men, the highest total number of any Union outfit. Some 20 years after the battle, D.H. Hill wrote [...] "The attacks on the Beaver Dam entrenchments, on the heights of Malvern Hill, at Gettysburg, were all grand, but of exactly the kind of grandeur the South could not afford." ...|$|E

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, there was talk of a new world order holding the promise of international justice and peace. However, the Balkan Wars of the 1990 s gave rise to the concept of “new wars” that in the wake of the terror attacks of 9 / 11 have acquired an iconicity rivalling that of fiction films. The 1990 - 1991 Gulf War was the commercial breakthrough for the around-the-clock news channel CNN, and the war in Afghanistan in 2001 for its competitor al-Jazeera. The 2003 Iraq war saw Internet’s great breakthrough in war journalism with the, at first anonymous, icon Salam Pax belonging to the first generation of war bloggers.

More significant, however, are the omissions; Audin’s book contains too much material for a course of this length, and I have included just enough to accomplish my main goals, which are as follows: • Introduce interesting classes of examples of symplectic manifolds, including partial flag man-ifolds, polygon spaces, and toric varieties. • Prove Delzant’s theorem, which says that the constructive definition of a toric variety (start with a polyhedron and build a space out of it) is equivalent to the abstract definition. • Use Hamiltonian torus actions to understand Betti numbers (via Morse theory) and coho-mology rings (via various equivariant tricks) of symplectic manifolds.
