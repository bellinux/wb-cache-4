5|$|Oskar Gröning (sometimes transliterated as Oscar Groening in English; born 10 June 1921) is a German former SS junior squad {{leader who}} was {{stationed}} at Auschwitz concentration camp. His responsibilities included counting and sorting the money taken from prisoners, {{and he was}} in charge of the personal property prisoners had arrived <b>with.</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> few occasions he witnessed the procedures of mass-killing in the camp. After being transferred from Auschwitz to a combat unit in October 1944, Gröning was captured by the British on 10 June 1945 when his unit surrendered. He was eventually transferred to Britain as a prisoner of war and worked as a forced labourer.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} and cocaine. He {{has said that}} in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals <b>with</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along with colleagues John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully use the X-Files {{office to}} find the Cigarette Smoking Man's real identity, that he is Agent Spender's father, C.G.B. Spender. Their {{unauthorized}} entry at the X-Files office is discovered resulting in both agents' immediate suspension from the FBI. Agent Spender reports to the Cigarette Smoking Man demanding the truth. Scully meets with Mulder, telling him that C.G.B. Spender is likely another alias and that the man is linked with Mulder's father, William, who he had worked <b>with</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> secret state project. The Cigarette Smoking Man decides to give Agent Spender more responsibility by having him kill the alien rebel masquerading as a Syndicate elder. Spender fails in his task, but Krycek comes to his aid and finishes. Krycek reveals to Spender {{that his father was}} responsible for Cassandra's abductions and that his role is to protect his father's stake in the project, facts that upset Agent Spender.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of receptors that neurotransmitters {{interact}} <b>with</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> post-synaptic neuron. The first types of receptors are ligand-gated ion channels or LGICs. LGIC receptors are the fastest types of transduction from chemical signal to electrical signal. Once the neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, it will cause a conformational change that will allow ions to directly flow into the cell. The second types are known as G-protein-coupled receptors or GPCRs. These are much slower than LGICs due to an increase in the amount of biochemical reactions that must take place intracellularly. Once the neurotransmitter binds to the GPCR protein, it causes a cascade of intracellular interactions that can lead to many different types of changes in cellular biochemistry, physiology, and gene expression. Neurotransmitter/receptor interactions in the field of neuropharmacology are extremely important because many drugs that are developed today have to do with disrupting this binding process.|$|E

25|$|Bhumibol {{initially}} received {{general music}} training privately {{while he was}} studying in Switzerland, but his older brother, then King Ananda Mahidol, who had bought a saxophone, sent Bhumibol in his place. King Ananda would later join him on the clarinet. On his permanent return to Thailand in 1950, Bhumibol started a jazz band, Lay Kram, whom he performed <b>with</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> radio station he started at his palace. The band grew, being renamed the Au Sau Wan Suk Band and he would perform with them live on Friday evenings, occasionally taking telephoned requests. Bhumibol also performed with his band at Thai universities, composing anthems for the universities of Chulalongkorn, Thammasat, and Kasetsart. Bhumibol performed with Benny Goodman at the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall, in 1956, and later played at Goodman's home in New York in 1960. Many bands such as Les Brown and His Band of Renown, Claude Bolling Big Band, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band recorded some of Bhumibol's compositions and can still be heard in Thailand. A 1996 documentary, Gitarajan, was made about Bhumibol's music.|$|E
25|$|On the post-field goal kickoff, Martavious Odoms {{returned}} the ball 16 {{yards to the}} Michigan 16-yard line; however, Michigan committed a holding penalty on the play {{and was forced to}} start on its own eight-yard line. Michigan's second drive was more successful than the first, with Denard Robinson completing an 11-yard pass to Kelvin Grady on third down, and Fitzgerald Toussaint rushing for 14 yards on the next play. The drive ended, however, following the Toussaint run as Robinson threw a pass that Kyle Fuller intercepted at Tech's 28-yard line. Tech then embarked on another long drive, with Thomas rushing for 11 yards on second down and finding Boykin for ten yards after a 15-yard illegal block penalty. After a false start penalty made it third-and-ten, Thomas completed a 27-yard pass to Coale. Following a three-yard loss on a Thomas run and an incomplete pass, Tech again converted on third-and-long, this time <b>with</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 13-yard Thomas to Coles pass. Following two short rushes, the time ran out in the first quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Nyasaland {{government}} had imprisoned Banda, not realising {{that he was}} the only African politician they could negotiate <b>with</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> credible constitution for the protectorate. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda, unlike other Congress leaders, was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Had Devlin found there was a murder plot and that Banda had encouraged violence, this would have been very difficult. Despite Lennox-Boyd's rejection of the Devlin Report, once Iain Macleod replaced him at the Colonial Office late in 1959, Devlin was approached by Macleod for advice. The Royal Commission {{on the future of the}} Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (the Monckton Commission) toured the Federation in February 1960. It had been given limited terms of reference and was boycotted by the opposition Labour Party and the African nationalists in Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia. As the Commission's composition seemed weighted towards a continuation of the Federation, its report disappointed the British government. The Monckton Commission reported widespread and sincere opposition to the Federation in the two northern territories. It considered Federation could not survive without at least a major devolution of powers to Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, giving more voting rights to Africans and lessening racial discrimination. Most importantly, it also recommended that Britain should retain the right to allow the secession of either northern territory, recognising that African nationalists would not accept even a modified Federation.|$|E

However, certain media publications have labelled Kapoor a recluse and described him as arrogant and temperamental.

Addressing this image, Kapoor remarked, [...] "I just don’t socialise much, I don’t party too much, I don’t {{know what to say}} to the media if I’m not talking about a film that I am doing, so yeah, maybe I am perceived as a snob." ...|$|E

One section, entitled [...] "Covent Garden", concerned Fielding's position as a magistrate at Bow Street. The column ran in every issue until 27 June 1752, appearing irregularly thereafter.

500|$|The {{underlying}} causes of the riot stemmed from resentment among black residents of Harlem of the disparity between the vaunted values of American democracy and {{the social and economic}} conditions they were forced to live under, including brutality and discriminatory treatment by the mostly white city police force. They resented the segregation of black troops serving with the United States, and wartime shortages created more difficult conditions in Harlem housing and supplies. African Americans suffered discriminatory practices in civil and private employment, and city services, which created tension as they tried to improve their lives. Bandy symbolized the Black soldiers who were segregated in the Army, even as the United States promoted the national fight for 'freedom.' Collins represented the white discrimination and suppression black residents had to deal <b>with</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> daily basis. The riot became a subject of art and literature: it was depicted in the [...] "theatrical climax" [...] of Ralph Ellison's novel Invisible Man, winner of the 1953 National Book Award, and in artist William Johnson's painting Moon Over Harlem.|$|E
