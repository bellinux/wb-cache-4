A common belief is that the Eurasian Economic Union has significant potential {{over the next two}} decades, <b>with</b> <b>experts</b> predicting a 25 percent growth in the member states' GDP by 2030, which equates to over US$600 billion. The agreement will give member state citizens access to employment and education across the union. It will also entail collaborative policies in many sectors, including agriculture, energy, technology and transportation. These collaborative policies are particularly interesting for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E

Principal filming took place starting {{in the fall of}} 1964 and continued through early 1965.

He also met there with fellow-explorers, including Nansen, Shackleton, and Roald Amundsen. His main task, however, was masterminding {{the preparation of the}} SNAE scientific reports. These, at considerable cost and much delay, were published between 1907 and 1920, except for one volume—Bruce's own log—that remained unpublished until 1992, after its rediscovery. Bruce maintained a wide correspondence <b>with</b> <b>experts,</b> including Sir Joseph Hooker, who had travelled to the Antarctic with James Clark Ross in 1839–43, and to whom Bruce dedicated his short book Polar Exploration.|$|E
5|$|Goldsman took on {{the project}} as he admired the second I Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to {{distance}} the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, {{as well as from}} the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted <b>with</b> <b>experts</b> on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{learning}} <b>with</b> <b>expert</b> advice methods {{assume a}} learner is always receiving the outcome (e. g., class labels) of every incoming training instance {{at the end}} of each trial. In real applications, acquiring the outcome from oracle can be costly or time consuming. In this paper, we address a new problem of active learning <b>with</b> <b>expert</b> advice, where the outcome of an instance is disclosed only when it is requested by the online learner. Our goal is to learn an accurate prediction model by asking the oracle the number of questions as small as possible. To address this challenge, we propose a framework of active forecasters for online active learning <b>with</b> <b>expert</b> advice, which attempts to extend two regular forecasters, i. e., Exponentially Weighted Average Forecaster and Greedy Forecaster, to tackle the task of active learning <b>with</b> <b>expert</b> advice. We prove that the proposed algorithms satisfy the Hannan consistency under some proper assumptions, and validate the efficacy of our technique by an extensive set of experiments. ...|$|R
