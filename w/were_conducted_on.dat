5|$|Efforts {{to capture}} weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> trains {{carrying}} {{equipment to the}} front, {{as well as on}} guardhouses and gendarmerie posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Further {{air attacks}} <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 15 June. During the afternoon, {{two groups of}} Avengers {{attacked}} a floating dry dock and several oil tanks. That night six Avengers armed with bombs supported by two flare-dropping Avengers conducted the final British attack on Truk, but {{it is believed that}} most of their bombs landed in the sea. This was the BPF's first large-scale night operation.|$|E
5|$|Grosser Kurfürst {{was ordered}} under the {{provisional}} name Ersatz Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and {{built at the}} AG Vulcan shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 4. Her keel was laid in October 1911 and she was launched on 5 May 1913. At her launching ceremony, Prince Oskar of Prussia christened the ship. Due to the heightening political tensions in Europe in mid-1914, the final construction work was accelerated, so {{the first set of}} dockyard trials <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 15 July, and fitting-out work was completed by the 30th, the day she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet. Grosser Kurfürst cost the Imperial German Government 45 million Goldmarks.|$|E

50|$|The 2010 Elections for the Illinois House of Representatives <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> Tuesday, November 2, 2010.

5|$|On January 6, 2009, Coleman's {{campaign}} {{filed an}} election contest, {{which led to}} a trial before a three-judge panel. The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee ballots were incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> June 1.|$|E
5|$|PNC Park {{has hosted}} various {{evacuation}} and response drills, {{which would be}} used {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Members of the United States Department of Homeland Security laid out the groundwork for the initial drill in February 2004. In May 2005, 5,000volunteers participated in the $1million evacuation drill, which included mock explosions. A goal of the drill was to test the response of 49western Pennsylvania emergency agencies. In April 2006, the Department of Homeland Security worked in conjunction with the United States Coast Guard to develop a plan of response for the 2006 All-Star Game. Similar exercises <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the Allegheny River in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet {{departed}} {{its base}} on 18 August, and launched the first raid against Kaafjord {{on the morning}} of the 22nd. This major attack was unsuccessful, and a small raid that evening inflicted little damage. Two further major strikes <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> 24 and 29 August, but without success. Tirpitz was struck by two bombs during the raid on 24 August, but neither caused significant damage. British losses during Operation Goodwood were 17 aircraft to all causes, and a frigate sunk by a submarine. An escort carrier was also badly damaged. German forces suffered the loss of 12 aircraft and damage to 7 ships.|$|E
50|$|The 2010 {{elections}} for the Illinois Senate <b>was</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> Tuesday, November 2, 2010.

5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
5|$|The ship's crew {{compartments}} {{were arranged}} {{such that the}} officers were accommodated in the forecastle. This arrangement {{was found to be}} unsatisfactory, and not repeated in later classes. Von der Tann was designed to be fitted with a lattice mast, but the ship received standard masts instead. In 1914, spotting posts were attached to the masts in order to observe the fall of artillery fire. In 1915, seaplane trials <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> Von der Tann, and a crane was attached on the aft deck to lift the seaplane aboard the ship. Von der Tann had originally been equipped with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed towards the end of 1916.|$|E
5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E

5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her boilers {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the boilers until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the boilers at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the boilers were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> the same day.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with a significant percentage of the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on the memories of the nations involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} commercially {{available}} FFV {{in the world}} market is the ethanol flexible-fuel vehicle, with about 49 million automobiles, motorcycles and light duty trucks manufactured and sold worldwide by mid 2015, and concentrated in four markets, Brazil (29.5million by mid 2015), the United States (17.4million {{by the end of}} 2014), Canada (1.6million by 2014), and Europe, led by Sweden (243,100). The Brazilian flex fuel fleet includes over 4million flexible-fuel motorcycles produced since 2009 through March 2015. In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with ethanol, in Europe and the US, mainly in California, there have been successful test programs with methanol flex-fuel vehicles, known as M85 flex-fuel vehicles. There have been also successful tests using P-series fuels with E85 flex fuel vehicles, but as of June 2008, this fuel is not yet available to the general public. These successful tests with P-series fuels <b>were</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>on</b> Ford Taurus and Dodge Caravan flexible-fuel vehicles.|$|E
