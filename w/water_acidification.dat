2500|$|Environmental {{impact of}} wind power {{includes}} effect on wildlife. [...] Thousands of birds, including rare species, {{have been killed}} by the blades of wind turbines, though wind turbines contribute relatively insignificantly to anthropogenic avian mortality. For every bird killed by a wind turbine in the US, nearly 500,000 are killed by each of feral cats and buildings.. In comparison, conventional coal fired generators contribute significantly more to bird mortality, by incineration when caught in updrafts of smoke stacks and by poisoning with emissions byproducts (including particulates and heavy metals downwind of flue gases). Further, marine life is affected by water intakes of steam turbine cooling towers (heat exchangers) for nuclear and fossil fuel generators, by coal dust deposits in marine ecosystems (e.g. damaging Australia's Great Barrier Reef) and by <b>water</b> <b>acidification</b> from combustion monoxides.|$|E

40|$|Palaeoecology is an {{important}} branch of ecology that uses the subfossil remains of organisms preserved in lake, ocean and bog sediments to inform on changes in ecosystems and the environment through time. The analogue package contains functions to perform modern analogue technique (MAT) transfer functions, {{which can be used}} to predict past changes in the environment, such as climate or lake-water pH from species data. A related technique is that of analogue matching, which is concerned with identifying modern sites that are floristically and faunistically similar to fossil samples.

Root mean squared error of prediction and maximum bias were estimated for all nine methods based on 10, 000 internal and 10, 000 external cross-validations involving a training-set, an optimisation-set, and a test-set. The results show that WA with a monotonic deshrinking spline equals or slightly outperforms WA with linear inverse deshrinking, especially in external cross-validation. Methods that employ tolerance downweighting are generally uncompetitive, except when combined with monotonic deshrinking. It appears that simple two-way WA extensively used in SWAP cannot be significantly bettered.

40|$|The present work {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the tolerance of Nile tilapia juveniles to highly acidic rearing waters {{and the effects}} of water acidity on the quality of tank effluents. The experimental design consisted of four treatments with different water pH values (4. 12 ± 0. 84; 5. 13 ± 0. 74; 6. 14 ± 0. 64 and 8. 06 ± 0. 48), with five replicates each. No exchange of water was performed throughout the study, only water replenishment to maintain the initial level. Variables of water quality, soil, growth performance, metabolism and effluents were monitored for eight weeks. Despite the lower total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration in the pH 8 tanks, their levels of non-ionized ammonia (NH 3) were the highest ones.

40|$|RATIONALE Stable isotope ratios {{are widely}} used to infer trophic relationships, {{although}} {{a growing number of}} studies show that sample pre-treatments (such as acidification to remove carbonates) can cause changes in isotope ratios. Samples are often rinsed in distilled <b>water</b> after <b>acidification,</b> and we examine the effects of this step in particular on the isotope ratios of marine invertebrate samples. METHODS Samples of whole hermit crabs (Paguridae) were subjected to one of three treatments: acidification using dilute hydrochloric acid without subsequent distilled <b>water</b> rinsing; <b>acidification</b> with rinsing; and rinsing with no acidification. Continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry was used to compare the mean carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of treated and untreated material. RESULTS Acidification (both with and without subsequent distilled water rinsing) resulted in reductions in mean ? 13 C values (1. 939 and 3. 146 ‰, respectively), while rinsing without prior acidification led to a smaller (but still significant) increase. Nitrogen isotope ratios were not affected by acidification, but subsequent rinsing with distilled water caused a decrease of approximately 1 ‰. CONCLUSIONS Acidification of samples is clearly necessary in the presence of carbonates to obtain useful carbon isotope ratio data. However, post-acidification rinsing can result in further (potentially undesirable) changes to both carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. Ideally, rinsing should be avoided, but the impacts are small enough to be of little concern in many studies. Rinsing (or not) should be considered carefully {{on the basis of the}} aims of a study...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe dynamic hydro-chemical Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) {{was used}} to predict the {{response}} of 163 Finnish lake catchments to future acidic deposition and climatic change scenarios. Future deposition was assumed to follow current European emission reduction policies and a scenario based on maximum (technologically) feasible reductions (MFR). Future climate (temperature and precipitation) {{was derived from the}} HadAM 3 and ECHAM 4 /OPYC 3 general circulation models under two global scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC: A 2 and B 2). The combinations resulting in the widest range of future changes were used for simulations, i. e., the A 2 scenario results from ECHAM 4 /OPYC 3 (highest predicted change) and B 2 results from HadAM 3 (lowest predicted change). Future scenarios for catchment runoff were obtained from the Finnish watershed simulation and forecasting system. The potential influence of future changes in surface water organic carbon concentrations was also explored using simple empirical relationships based on temperature and sulphate deposition. Surprisingly, current emission reduction policies hardly show any future recovery; however, significant chemical recovery of soil and surface <b>water</b> from <b>acidification</b> was predicted under the MFR emission scenario. The direct influence of climate change (temperate and precipitation) on recovery was negligible, as runoff hardly changed; greater precipitation is offset by increased evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures.
