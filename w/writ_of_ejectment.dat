It is true, the methods were not many, being limited chiefly to that form of popular facetiae known as practical joking; and even this had assumed the seriousness of a business-pursuit. Tommy Roy, who had spent two hours in digging a ditch {{in front of his}} own door, into which a few friends casually dropped during the evening, looked ennuye and dissatisfied. The four prominent citizens, who, disguised as foot-pads, had stopped the county treasurer on the Wingdam road, were jaded from their playful efforts next morning.

Even the editor of [...] "The Monte Flat Monitor," [...] who had that morning written a glowing account of a battle with the Wipneck Indians, for the benefit of Eastern readers,--even HE looked grave and worn. When, at last, Abner Dean of Angel's, who had been on a visit to San Francisco, walked into the room, he was, of course, victimized in the usual way by one or two apparently honest questions, which ended in his answering them, and then falling into the trap of asking another, to his utter and complete shame and mortification; but that was all.

Once the rent notices went out, the farmers organized and held public meetings in protest. Van Rensselaer refused to meet with a committee of anti-renters and turned down their written request for a reduction of rents or any other settlement. His refusal infuriated the farmers and on July 4, 1839, a meeting was called at Berne for a declaration of independence from landlord rule. Van Rensselaer and the other heirs secured <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>ejectment</b> in suits against tenants in arrears. There were crowds of angry tenants that turned into a posse of 500 men.

50|$|Obviously, a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> {{habeas corpus}} is a writ issued {{by a court}} and has binding effect. The right to request a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> habeas corpus origins from the {{principle}} of presumption <b>of</b> innocence.
