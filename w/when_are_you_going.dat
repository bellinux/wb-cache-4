500|$|Cooper {{described}} himself as [...] "a truly terrible public speaker" [...] and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during {{his career in the}} Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him [...] "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? <b>When</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to start voting with us?" [...] Cooper responded, [...] "If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, and I intend to vote as I think best." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band's {{publicist}} Ida Langsam {{agreed that}} the members and record company all {{felt the need to}} keep a strict budget on recording, production, and promotion of the Ramones' music. She pointed out that just because much of their album process was done [...] "cut-rate," [...] it did not mean that there performance on the album was not done well, but rather they were trying to find people and places who could do things cheaper, which was the reason the were recording at Intergalactic Studios as they did in their previous album, Animal Boy. Langsam {{went on to say that}} the Ramones were [...] "never afforded the respect a band of their caliber should have," [...] insisting that other bands who were [...] "much less worthy had more respect afforded them" [...] were often rewarded with more respect. [...] "Everybody thought of them as the local band," [...] she continued, [...] "everybody's friends—'when are you going to break, <b>when</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to get big, <b>when</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to reach stardom?'" [...] Rey claimed that the band was very impatient during the album process, and noted that members, especially Johnny and Joey, weren't getting along. [...] "John was fast in the studio," [...] recalls George Tabb, who was recording with his band the False Prophets at Intergalactic Studios at the same time as the Ramones recorded Halfway to Sanity. He called it humorous, [...] "because John would be going, 'Enough, enough, it sounds right.' And Joey, the artist, would go, 'I gotta do my vocals, I gotta do my vocals,' and the drummer's going, 'But my drums!' Johnny was like, 'Fuck it. It's the Ramones. It is what it is and comes out like that.' And he was right. It was the Ramones. He was a good businessman about it." ...|$|E

I {{want to know how}} you can dedicate yourself to your forthcoming positions in the musical world, when you can't dedicate yourself right now to what you're doing in a simple little march. ... The world is full of people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right—most of the time.

To me, just about right is terrible! ... Now, nobody's killed when you play a half-note as a dotted quarter. But you might, from learning to play a half-note a full half-note, make the {{difference in the lives of}} 50,000 little kids. ... You don't piddle with music—it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's ‘Stars and Stripes,’ ‘The Victors’ or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know—a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is—they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.” ...|$|E
