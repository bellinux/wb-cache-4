Initially housed in the thermal hospital, the {{refugees}} were transferred to the park pavilions {{at the onset of}} the bathing season. Some rented rooms in town, marveling at the low rates.|$|E

He decides to avoid state protection. He meets a Romani caravan, an extended family of 20 men, <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> decide to adopt him.

5|$|Under the {{protection}} of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, {{a substantial portion of the}} troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{engagement}} at Wisconsin Heights, the militia {{decided to wait}} until the following day to pursue Black Hawk. They heard, but did not understand, Neapope's speech during the night, and to their surprise, when morning arrived their enemy had disappeared. The battle, though militarily devastating for the British Band, had allowed much of the group to escape to temporary safety across the Wisconsin River. The reprieve was short-lived for many – a group of Fox <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> attempted to escape down the Wisconsin following the battle were captured by U.S.-allied tribes or shot by soldiers further downstream. During the night, while the non-combatants escaped in canoes, Black Hawk and the remaining warriors crossed the river near present-day Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin. The band fled west over rugged terrain toward the banks of the Mississippi River, with a week's head start on the militia.|$|E
5|$|She Has a Name is a {{play about}} human {{trafficking}} written by Andrew Kooman in 2009 as a single act and expanded to full length in 2010. It is about the trafficking of children into sexual slavery and {{was inspired by the}} deaths of 54 people in the Ranong human-trafficking incident. Kooman had previously published literature, but this was his first full-length play. The stage premiere of She Has a Name was directed by Stephen Waldschmidt in Calgary, Alberta in February 2011. From May to October 2012, She Has a Name toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A Better World raised money to help <b>women</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. The first performances of She Has a Name in the United States took place in Folsom, California in 2014 under the direction of Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time.|$|E

The Government of the Russian Federation has made significant progress in this area over the past decade, but a report commissioned by the United States Department of State in 2010 concluded that much more needed to be done before Russia could be taken off its Tier 3 watchlist. The Government has not made significant progress and that is why it was moved to the tier 3 list in 2011.|$|R
