It was not formally announced until now for several reasons; foremost being that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> very private people living in the glare of the public media. We both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the distraction of a media circus. I am very much in love with Michael, I dedicate my life to being his wife. I understand and support him. We both look forward to raising a family and living happy, healthy lives together. We hope friends and fans will understand and respect our privacy." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1974 she met feminist {{writer and}} activist John Stoltenberg when they both {{walked out on}} a poetry reading in Greenwich Village over {{misogynist}} material. They became close friends and eventually came to live together. Stoltenberg wrote a series of radical feminist books and articles on masculinity. Although Dworkin publicly wrote [...] "I love John with my heart and soul" [...] and Stoltenberg described Dworkin as [...] "the love of my life", she continued to publicly identify herself as lesbian, and he as gay. Stoltenberg, recounting the perplexity that their relationship seemed to cause people in the press, summarized the relationship by saying, [...] "So I state only the simplest facts publicly: yes, Andrea and I live together and love each other and we are each other's life partner, and yes <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> out." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with her. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the context}} of theistic belief, Stephen Roberts said [...] "I contend <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you {{understand}} why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Kershaw {{documented}} and explored {{the communities of}} Port-au-Prince with overwhelming obstacles. In November 2014 he publicly spoke with community leaders {{in the capital of}} Haiti about launching health campaigns for community leaders to provide clean water. He was recorded saying, “I know the Haitian people because I am the Haitian people, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> human, one and the same, we thirst together and we drink together, we want water that heals instead of steals." [...] He received the nickname 'The Prince of Hope' for his efforts to provide clean water in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Kershaw and Dr. Jennifer Hetzner of California appeared on ABC presenting the impact of dirty water.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{the text}} read that God {{has not made}} us like the nations who [...] "bow down to nothingness and vanity, and pray to an {{impotent}} god." ... In the Middle Ages these words were censored, since the church believed they were an insult to Christianity. Omitting them tends {{to give the impression}} that the Aleinu teaches that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> different and better than others. The actual intent is to say that we are thankful that God has enlightened us so that, unlike the pagans, we worship the true God and not idols. There is no inherent superiority in being Jewish, but we do assert the superiority of monotheistic belief over paganism. Although paganism still exists today, we are no longer the only ones to have a belief in one God.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2013, Ciara {{confirmed}} {{that she would}} be releasing further singles from the album, the first [...] "Where You Go" [...] featuring Future would serve the American market whilst [...] "Overdose" [...] would serve international markets. However, in September 2013, Ciara {{confirmed that}} plans had changed and that [...] "Read My Lips" [...] would now be the album's third single as it was her favourite song, and that [...] "it seems to be a song that my fans really love too, so <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> on the same page.

2500|$|At {{the core}} of Unger's {{philosophy}} are two key conceptions: first the infinity of the individual, and secondly the singularity {{of the world and}} the reality of time. The premise behind the infinity of the individual is that we exist within social contexts but we are more than the roles that these contexts may define for us—we can overcome them. In Unger's terms, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> [...] "context-bound and context-transcending; [...] "we appear as [...] "the embodied spirit;" [...] as [...] "the infinite imprisoned within the finite." [...] For Unger, there is no natural state of the individual and his social being. Rather, we are infinite in spirit and unbound in what we can become. As such, no social institution or convention can contain us. While institutions do exist and shape our beings and our interactions, we can change both their structure and the extent to which they imprison us.|$|E
2500|$|Initially Davies and {{director}} Giacomo Campiotti clashed {{about how to}} present the material. Davies recalled, [...] "The first couple of weeks after Giacomo joined this project were horrendous for me because Zhivago {{has always been one}} of his very favorite books. He has always dreamed about filming it and has his own interpretation in his head. I can actually remember thinking after one long, long day, where we just didn't agree about a single thing, that it wasn't going to work—it's either got to be him or me. Somehow, we arrived at a compromise and I have almost forgotten what we were arguing about now, as now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> very pleased with the script. I always knew that he would make it look beautiful because he has got a poet's vision and now, having seen the rushes and some cut footage, I feel like he is my favourite director of all time. Everything is delightful now... Giacomo Campiotti's direction makes it extraordinary." ...|$|E

[...] "It Wasn't Me" [...] was originally never intended to be released as a single.|$|R

2500|$|The Michigan Alumnus {{published}} {{a letter from}} another Michigan athlete, Cecil F. Cross, recalling memories of football in Ann Arbor:"The autumn is approaching here. The days are getting shorter {{and there is a}} chill in the air ... It seems to bring back the old feeling which is experienced where the smell of football is in the air, the first cold days of autumn and it makes me homesick, though only slightly. Ralph Henning, of Bay City, is here, and though we come from different parts of Michigan and attended different schools, he being the captain of the Michigan Aggies' football team in 1916, we quite frequently talk over the old scenes with which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> familiar. He, too, has mentioned the feeling of football in the air. If they were to train an army of football players and throw them into the lines, the last weeks of October, with Coach Yost to address them just before the battle, we would score a touchdown the first half, and before Thanksgiving we would have pushed the Germans under their own goal posts and eat dinner in Berlin." ...|$|E
