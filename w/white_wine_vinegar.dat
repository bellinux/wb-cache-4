2500|$|Béarnaise sauce ( [...] ; [...] ) is a sauce made of {{clarified}} butter emulsified in egg yolks and <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> <b>vinegar</b> and flavored with herbs. [...] It {{is considered to}} be a [...] "child" [...] of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in the French haute cuisine repertoire. The difference is only in the flavoring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorns, gherkin and tarragon in a reduction of vinegar and wine, while Hollandaise is more stripped down, using a reduction of lemon juice or white wine and peppercorns. (One means of preparing Béarnaise, see below, is to start with Hollandaise and add the other ingredients.) Its name is related to the province of Béarn, France.|$|E
2500|$|Hollandaise sauce ( [...] or [...] ), also {{referred}} to as Dutch sauce, is an emulsion of egg yolk, liquid butter, water and lemon juice (or a <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> or <b>vinegar</b> reduction), whisked together over the low heat of a double boiler.

25|$|By the 19th century, sauces {{had been}} {{classified}} into four distinct categories by Chef Marie-Antoine Carême.

Auguste Escoffier updated that list in the early 20th century by replacing allemande with Hollandaise sauce {{as part of his}} family of five mother sauces of Haute cuisine. While many believe that a true Hollandaise sauce should only contain the basic ingredients of eggs, butter and lemon, Prosper Montagne suggested using either a <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> or <b>vinegar</b> reduction, similar to a Béarnaise sauce, to help improve the taste.|$|R

40|$|Rocío Fernández-Pérez [...] . et al. The aim of {{the present}} study was to search for a rapid and {{reliable}} method to enumerate viable acetic acid bacteria (AAB) and to identify to genera and species level AAB isolates from vinegars in full acetic fermentation elaborated by the submerged method from cider, wine and spirit ethanol in industrial bioreactors. Results showed that the rapid epifluorescence staining method using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit and direct counts in Neubauer chamber rendered consistent and reliable data for viable cell counts of bacteria in all the studied vinegars. A linear correlation was shown between viable cell counts and fermentation rates. The highest fermentation rates and viable cell counts were found in cider vinegars, whereas spirit vinegars showed the lowest values for both parameters. Eighty-four AAB pure isolates were recovered from 41 different vinegar samples and were submitted to DNA extraction. PCR amplification of the 16 S– 23 S intergenic spacer region of rDNA and subsequent sequencing were carried out to identify isolates to species level. Results showed that Gluconacetobacter europaeus was the predominant cultivable species, appearing in 79 % of the total isolates. This was the unique species found in spirit vinegars, and this is the first time that AAB from spirit vinegars are taxonomically identified. Ga. europaeus was as well the predominant cultivable species in <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> <b>vinegars.</b> Cider vinegars presented the highest variability of species: Ga. europaeus (35. 3 % appearance among cultivable isolates), Ga. xylinus (35. 3 %), Acetobacter pasteurianus (17. 6 %) and Ga. hansenii (11. 8 %). Red <b>wine</b> <b>vinegars</b> showed cultivable isolates of the species Ga. xylinus (71. 4 %) and Ga. europaeus (28. 6 %). Summarising, both described methods for AAB enumeration and taxonomical identification proved to be fast and reliable methods, and results revealed Ga. europaeus as the cultivable major species in vinegars in full fermentation conducted by the submerged method, suggesting that Ga. europaeus strains can constitute excellent starter cultures for the elaboration of vinegars by the submerged method. his work was supported by grant OTEM 070621 by the company Vinagrerías Riojanas S.

5000|$|It is {{prepared}} {{at least a}} day or more in advance by braising or simmering a piece of veal from the back leg called Eye Round, which is then cut into thin, individual servings.

For the mayonnaise a variety of seasonings can be used, including anchovies, cayenne pepper and lemon juice.

50|$|Goulash can be {{prepared}} from beef, veal, pork, or lamb. Typical cuts include the shank, shin, or shoulder; as a result, goulash derives its thickness from tough, well-exercised muscles rich in collagen, which is converted to gelatin during the cooking process. Meat is cut into chunks, seasoned with salt, and then browned with sliced onion in a pot with oil or lard. Paprika is added, along with water or stock, and the goulash is left to simmer. After cooking a while, garlic, whole or ground caraway seed, or soup vegetables like carrot, parsley root, peppers (green or bell pepper) and celery may be added. Other herbs and spices could also be added, especially chili pepper, bay leaf and thyme. Diced potatoes may be added, since they provide starch as they cook, which makes the goulash thicker and smoother. However, chili peppers and potatoes are modern additions, totally unknown in the original recipe. A small amount of <b>white</b> <b>wine</b> or <b>wine</b> <b>vinegar</b> may also be added {{near the end of}} cooking to round the taste.

40|$|A simple, {{selective}} {{and sensitive}} method for {{the determination of}} carboxylic acids has been developed. A mixture of formic, acetic, propionic, valeric, isovaleric, isobutyric, and isocaproic acids has been separated on a polymethacrylate-based weak acidic cation-exchange resin (TSK gel OA pak-A) based on an ion-exclusion chromatographic mechanism with detection using UV-photodiode array, conductivity and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). A mobile phase consisting of 0. 85 mM benzoic acid in 10 % aqueous methanol (pH 3. 89) was used to separate the above carboxylic acids in about 40 min. For LC–MS, the APCI interface {{was used in the}} negative ionization mode. Linear plots of peak area versus concentration were obtained over the range 1 – 30 mM (r 2 = 0. 9982) and 1 – 30 mM (r 2 = 0. 9958) for conductimetric and MS detection, respectively. The detection limits of the target carboxylic acids calculated at S/N= 3 ranged from 0. 078 to 2. 3 μM for conductimetric and photometric detection and from 0. 66 to 3. 82 μM for ion-exclusion chromatography–APCI-MS. The reproducibility of retention times was 0. 12 – 0. 16 % relative standard deviation for ion-exclusion chromatography and 1. 21 – 2. 5 % for ion-exclusion chromatography–APCI-MS. The method was applied to the determination of carboxylic acids in red <b>wine,</b> <b>white</b> <b>wine,</b> apple <b>vinegar,</b> and Japanese rice wine...|$|R
