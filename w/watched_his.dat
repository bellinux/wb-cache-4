5|$|Garnering a {{great degree}} of {{attention}} from the Mighty Ducks' fanbase, Kariya's first public practice at Arrowhead Pond drew an attendance of 9,000, while 16,000 fans <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> first exhibition game. Due to the NHL lockout, resulting from a dispute between players and owners, his regular season debut was delayed until January 1995 and the campaign was shortened to 48 games. During the suspension, Kariya participated in a charity tournament held in Hamilton, Ontario, sponsored by the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA).|$|E

5|$|This {{surge in}} {{interest}} for Emerson's knives soon became overwhelming. Although {{he had been}} making knives full-time since 1994, Emerson was still manufacturing these knives in his home garage workshop three years later. As Emerson <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> customers' wait time expand from two years to seven, {{he realized that the}} demand for his handmade blades was far outpacing his ability to produce them. The first method to bridge this gap between supply and demand would be through factory collaborations with established cutlery companies.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Oliphant {{returned}} to Australia {{as the first}} Director of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering at the new Australian National University, where he initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 megajoule) homopolar generator. He retired in 1976, but was appointed Governor of South Australia {{on the advice of}} Premier, Don Dunstan. He assisted in the founding of the Australian Democrats political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in Melbourne in 1977 at which the party was launched. Late in life he <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. He died in Canberra in 2000.|$|E
5|$|At the gallows, Beauchamp {{assured the}} {{assembled}} clergy {{that he had}} a salvation experience on July 6. Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while the noose was tied around his neck. At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow while 5,000 spectators <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were placed in an embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Bloomfield, Kentucky. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.|$|E

5|$|From Chicago, Bundy {{traveled}} by train to Ann Arbor, Michigan. There, on January 2 {{in a local}} tavern, he <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> alma mater UW defeat Michigan in the Rose Bowl. Five days later he stole a car and drove to Atlanta, where he boarded a bus and arrived in Tallahassee, Florida, {{on the morning of}} January 8. He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone job application, at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{were the}} NL champions in 1961, {{and with the}} {{addition}} of Sisler, Dave Hillman, and Moe Drabowsky to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the World Series. Sisler, who was expected {{to be used as a}} relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother Dick, who was their first base coach. His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was relieved that his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a home run. The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA. On June19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> son pitch as an opponent. Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September23, his final major league appearance. His totals for the season included a 4–3record, a 3.92ERA, and one save in 43⅔innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe {{is widely}} popular in Asia, {{particularly}} Japan. In 2000, TV Asahi {{identified him as}} the swimmer {{likely to be the}} most successful at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, so they selected him as the event's marketing figurehead. In the lead-up, Thorpe visited Japan to promote Asahi in a series of television events, and upon returning for the competition, he was mobbed at the airport by youthful crowds 25m deep; hundreds camped outside the Australian team's hotel. He was also praised by older sections of Japanese society as a role model for youth, due to what they interpreted as his humility and work ethic. It was estimated that more than 80% of the Japanese public <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> races on television. In 2002, {{in the wake of a}} tourism slump after 11 September terrorist attacks, Thorpe agreed to be an ambassador for the Australian Tourism Commission in Japan. The high-profile campaign included a meeting with the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The marketing drive resulted in an upturn in Japanese tourism to Australia, which was credited to Thorpe. In 2005, Yakult released a 'Thorpedo' energy drink—which featured a picture of the swimmer on the bottle—in Japan. This was part of an equity deal with the So Natural food group, in which Thorpe was given a 5% stake in the company—at the time worth A$1.1m—in return for the use of his name and image on their products. The 15-year deal covers East and Southeast Asia and Thorpe's share in the venture could increase to 50% depending on its success.|$|E

25|$|I <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> face, {{and it was}} as {{grave and}} serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was the very {{embodiment}} of tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There was not a single trace of nervousness or haste.|$|E
25|$|Jeffrey Rignall, who {{had been}} {{assaulted}} and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant {{that at one point}} during his abuse and torture, a young man with brown hair, kneeling before him, <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> abuse.

25|$|In December, the Glazers allowed McKay {{to leave}} the Bucs {{before the end of}} the regular season, and he {{promptly}} joined the Falcons as president and general manager.

The Bucs suffered a sluggish start and finished the season 7–9. With the Raiders' dismal 4–12 performance, neither Super Bowl team reached the playoffs that year.|$|E

25|$|Nii Lamptey {{was born}} in Tema, but {{grew up in the}} two biggest Ghanaian cities, Accra and Kumasi. He had a miserable childhood, as his parents abused and {{neglected}} him. His father was an alcoholic who often beat and lashed him and sometimes burnt his body with cigarettes. Lamptey often refused to spend the nights home and frequently skipped school, only finding refuge in football. Soon, he began to excel in this sport, despite his alcoholic father heckling him and hurling verbal abuse from the sidelines whenever he <b>watched</b> <b>his</b> son play football.|$|E
25|$|In Wallingford, Mark Pitman died on December 3, 1905. Until 1908 Sumner Blakemore was titular headmaster, but {{the school}} was {{effectively}} {{the domain of the}} three Pitman sisters.

Then Judge Choate introduced the man who would assume the headmastership in the fall, George St. John, and his wife, Clara Seymour St. John. She was a Bryn Mawr alumna, member of a well-connected Connecticut family, sister of future (1937–1951) Yale president Charles Seymour, and descendant of Yale president (1740–1766) Thomas Clap.|$|E

He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E
