2500|$|After a {{young boy}} or girl went through the proper [...] "coming-of-age" [...] rituals, or had reached puberty, {{they were ready to}} become adults. [...] For young people around this age, {{marriage}} would be a priority. [...] A young man would search out a prospective bride from another village or sometimes a neighboring nation. [...] He would travel to the house of the prospective bride, sit outside the doorway with a blanket wrapped around him, and wait. [...] He would <b>wait</b> <b>here,</b> not eating any foods or eating any liquids during this time, usually lasting up to 4 days. [...] While this occurred, the girl's family would take no notice of him. [...] If acceptable to the parents, the mother of the prospective wife would approach a neighbor to inform the young man that the girl's parents are willing to accept him as their son-in-law.|$|E
