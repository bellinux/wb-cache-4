The two shook hands and Joyce gave the pitcher {{a pat on the}} shoulder, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> {{reception}} from the audience. Joyce's accountability and regret, and Galarraga's sportsmanship were widely praised for turning the unfortunate situation into a positive.|$|E

5|$|Several notable Tyrannosaurus remains {{have been}} found in the Hell Creek Formation. During the Maastrichtian this area was subtropical, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> and humid climate. The flora {{consisted}} mostly of angiosperms, but also included trees like dawn redwood (Metasequoia) and Araucaria. Tyrannosaurus shared this ecosystem with Triceratops, related ceratopsians Nedoceratops, Tatankaceratops and Torosaurus, the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens and possibly a species of Parasaurolophus, the armored dinosaurs Denversaurus, Edmontonia and Ankylosaurus, the dome headed dinosaurs Pachycephalosaurus, Stygimoloch, Sphaerotholus, and Dracorex, the hypsilophodont Thescelosaurus, and the theropods Ornithomimus, Struthiomimus, Orcomimus, Acheroraptor, Dakotaraptor, Richardoestesia, Paronychodon, Pectinodon, and Troodon.|$|E
5|$|After {{making its}} final Florida landfall, Allison rapidly weakened. Tropical storm force winds {{continued}} over the eastern Florida Panhandle until late that afternoon, {{as the storm}} moved northward into Georgia. It weakened to a tropical depression {{on the evening of}} June 5 over southern Georgia. Early on June 6, Allison began to transition into an extratropical storm as it interacted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> front to the northeast while tracking across the Carolinas. The remnant low emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Hatteras that evening. It then raced across the western Atlantic, crossing the easternmost part of Nova Scotia on June 8 and Newfoundland on June 9. It continued northward across the Labrador Sea, dissipating on June 11.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, {{this time for}} being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of their beauty while stationed in Malacca.|$|E

5|$|Near the Ellipse, {{and within}} sight of the White House, the hearse halted and Reagan's body was {{transferred}} to a horse-drawn caisson for the procession down Constitution Avenue to Capitol Hill. Nancy Reagan stepped out of her limousine to witness the body's transfer; she was met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> greeting, including applause. The cortege began the 45-minute journey just after 6:00pm EST, with the Reagan family following in limousines. Military units escorted the caisson as it made its way to the sounds of muffled drums. Behind the caisson was a riderless horse named Sergeant York, carrying Reagan's riding boots reversed in the stirrups. The caisson paused at 4th Street and Constitution Avenue, where 21 Air Force F-15's from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, flew over in missing man formation.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Iskandar is {{reputed to}} have been a staunch disciplinarian, with {{willingness}} to occasionally voice personal opinions on governmental issues. On the personal side, subjects who have personally approached the Sultan in his later years described him as a person <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> and generous personality. However, past critics had also argued that Sultan Iskandar was a person with a turbulent temper. These claims were made by citing records of past notorious incidents, which include an experience of being disinherited from being the Tunku Mahkota of Johor (or Crown Prince in English) by his father, in 1961, as well as a series of alleged criminal acts occurring between the 1970s and the 1990s which were published in the press and provoked widespread moral outrage within the Malaysian public.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{system that}} caused the tornado had {{produced}} severe weather, including two weak tornadoes, in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey that morning. This was an unusual setup for a significant tornado, associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> front near a low-pressure center. A thunderstorm cell formed south of Long Island around 10:20 am, and became a supercell sometime later after interacting with a surface low-pressure center. It turned north as a left-moving supercell, meaning it moved left {{with respect to the}} mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn {{to the right of the}} mean flow. It is unknown whether this leftward movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Milroy's eyes {{questioned}} her daughter's face {{as they had}} never questioned it yet.

5000|$|Terrestrial {{ecosystems}} and biodiversity: <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>warming</b> of 3 °C, relative to 1990 levels, {{it is likely}} that global terrestrial vegetation would become a net source of carbon (Schneider et al, 2007:792). With high confidence, Schneider et al. (2007:788) concluded that a global mean temperature increase of around 4 °C (above the 1990-2000 level) by 2100 would lead to major extinctions around the globe.|$|R

25|$|The {{constant}} {{theme in}} Jahović's music and lyrics is love, {{although she has}} written on other subjects including grief. Considering her vocal agility and endurance, Emina's voice {{is likely to be}} classified as mezzo-soprano <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> lower register and an agile high register. Emina Jahović's distinct style of singing has been praised by her colleague Jelena Karleuša whose husband, Duško Tošić, also lives in Turkey.|$|E

When Madame Bovary appeared in book form, it met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> reception.|$|E

As of April 2015, the album has sold 208,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
