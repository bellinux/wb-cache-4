40|$|The {{integration}} of local knowledge and science represents {{an opportunity to}} enhance the understanding of interrelations among climate, hydrology, and socioeconomic systems while providing mutual benefits to scientists and rural communities. Insight from rural Alaskans helped to identify a social-ecological threshold used to model potential driftwood harvest from the Yukon River. Information from residents of Tanana, Alaska, was combined with scientific data to model driftwood harvest rates. Modeling results estimated that between 1980 and 2010, hydrologic factors alone were responsible for a 29 % decrease in the annual wood harvest, which approximately balanced a 23 % reduction in wood demand because of a decline in number of households. The community's installation of <b>wood-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> in 2007 created a threshold increase (76 %) in wood demand that is not met by driftwood harvest. Modeling analyses of numerous climatic scenarios illustrated that increases in hydrologic variability would decrease the reliability of future driftwood harvest.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Cogeneration is the {{simultaneous}} generation {{and use of}} both electricity (or mechanical power) and thermal energy from a single fuel source. It is a technology {{that has been used}} for years by industries, commercial institutions, and municipalities that need both heat and electrical power. An analytical approach has been developed to determine cogeneration feasibility. The analysis is designed to estimate economic feasibility based on the performance characteristics of different types of equipment, including <b>wood-fired</b> <b>boilers.</b> It can be used to compare several options for cogeneration systems. The economic analysis is based on simple payback. A microcomputer spreadsheet application program performs the technical analysis. The program offers many features that are designed to improve and simplify prediction of cogeneration system performance: 1) Available energy calculation for wood fuel based on species and moisture content. Also uses natural gas and fuel oils. 2) Hourly steam and electrical load profiles for up to 6 typical operating days per year. 3) Three steam turbine types: Condensing, Backpres sure, Autoextraction. 4) Full and part load performance modelling. 5) Three operating modes: Thermal load following, Electrical load following, Constant load operation. 6) Steam enthalpy calculation for any operating conditions. 7) User-defined utility rate structure. 8) Independent value for excess electricity sold. Our approach is to compare the annual cost of providing thermal and electrical power separately and independently (i. e., electric utility power and a steam boiler) to that of producing the required power simultaneously (cogeneration). This requires an understanding of the power requirements, the utility rate structures, fuel costs, operation and maintenance costs, and available technology for power production.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 In this dissertation, {{interdisciplinary}} research methods {{were used to}} examine how changes in hydrology associated with climate affect Alaskans. Partnerships were established with residents of Fairbanks and Tanana to develop scientific investigations relevant to rural Alaskans. In chapter 2, local knowledge was incorporated into scientific models to identify a socialecological threshold used to model potential driftwood harvest from the Yukon River. Anecdotal evidence and subsistence calendar records were combined with scientific data to model the harvest rates of driftwood. Modeling results estimate that between 1980 and 2010 hydrologic factors alone were responsible for a 29 % decrease in the annual wood harvest, which approximately balanced a 23 % reduction in wood demand due {{to a decline in}} number of households. The community's installation of <b>wood-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> in 2007 created a threshold increase (76 %) in wood demand that is not met by driftwood harvest. Modeling of climatic scenarios illustrates that increased hydrologic variability decreases driftwood harvest and increases the financial or temporal costs for subsistence users. In chapter 3, increased groundwater flow related to permafrost degradation was hypothesized to be affect river ice thickness in sloughs of the Tanana River. A physically-based, numerical model was developed to examine the importance of permafrost degradation in explaining unfrozen river conditions in the winter. Results indicated that ice melt is amplified by increasing groundwater upwelling rates, groundwater temperatures, and snowfall. Modeling results also suggest that permafrost degradation could be a valid explanation of the phenomenon, but does not address the potential drivers (e. g. warming climate, forest fire, etc.) of the permafrost warming. In chapter 4, remote sensing techniques were hypothesized to be useful for mapping dangerous ice conditions on the Tanana River in interior Alaska. Unsupervised classification of high-resolution satellite imagery was used to identify and map open water and degraded ice conditions on the Tanana River. Ninety-five percent of the total river channel surface was classified as "safe" for river travel, while 4 % of the channel was mapped as having degraded ice and 0. 6 % of the channel was classified as open water (overall accuracy of 73 %). This research demonstrates that the classification of high-resolution satellite images can be useful for mapping hazardous ice for recreational, transportation, or industrial applications in northern climates. These results are applicable to communities throughout the North. For people that rely upon subsistence activities, increased variability in climate cycles can have substantial financial, cultural, recreational, or even mortal consequences. This research demonstrates how collaborations between scientists and local stakeholders can create tools that help to assess the impacts of increased environmental variability (such as flooding) or to detect or predict unsafe conditions (such as thin or unpredictable ice cover). Based upon this research, I conclude that regional-scale adaptations and technological advances (such as modeling and remote sensing tools) may help to alleviate the effects of environmental variability associated by climate...|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{this project}} was to {{determine}} new emission factors and the actual emission load of particulate matter from combustion appliances for solid and liquid fuels used by households and the small consumer sector in Germany. A difference for the emissions of particles was made between the total quantity of emitted particles and the particle fractions PM_ 1, PM_ 2 _,_ 5, and PM_ 1 _ 0. For the investigation, particle measurements were taken at commercial stoves, boilers and applicances on the test rig and at installed appliances of the small consumer sector. As a supplement, previously carried-out in-house investigations were utilised and data from literature evaluated. Additionally the emission behaviour and the emissions of particulate matter from boilers with oil burners were investigated on the test rig {{for the use of}} light fuel oils with differing sulphur contents and applying a ferrocene-containing additive. In the investigations, both the filterable and the condensable particle fractions of the emissions were ascertained for the substances concerned. It was the case for instance with combustion appliances for solid fuels when the exhausts contained higher concentrations of organic compounds. In the same way, the measurements at the oil-fired appliances besides the filtrable particles comprised the condensable emission fraction in the form of sulphuric acid. The emission load of particles in the year 2000 for the household and small consumer section is substantially determined by the combustion of solid fuels in combustion appliances within the scope of the 1 "s"t BImSchV (Ordinance on Small Furnaces). About 94 % of the calculated particle matter load originate from these firing systems. In the case of oil burners, the particle fractions PM_ 1 and PM_ 1 _ 0 amount to between 88 and 100 % of the total particulate matter emission. For solid fuels, the particle fractions PM_ 1 and PM_ 1 _ 0 range between 64 and 99 %. In the case of stoves the amount of the particle fractions depend on the utilised fuel above all and only little on the combustion conditions and the appliance construction. The percentrages of the particle fractions for oil-fired appliances depend on the sulphur content of the fuel and hence the sulphuric acid concentration in the exhaust gas, which also has a substantial impact on the total particule emission level. In the case of manually and mechanically charged <b>wood-fired</b> <b>boilers</b> not only the fuel but also the heat output and the exhaust gas cleaning installations (e. g. fabric filter) affect the particle distribution. By installing a fabric filter in a modern underfeed firing system operating with waste wood a particle reduction of more than 90 % could be achieved. The reduction of the sulphur content to 0. 1 % by mass in light fuel oil results in a reduced emission of particles in the order of magnitude of 30 % through lower sulphuric acid concentrations in the exhaust gas.

40|$|For a long {{heat and}} power {{production}} by combustion of solid fuels has time been an established technique. Environmental concern of emissions for NOx, SOx and other harmful species has caused an increasingly stricter legislation on the emission {{levels of the}} boilers. The rapidly growing awareness of climate changes due {{to the release of}} greenhouse-gases from the use of fossil fuels has resulted in additional challenges. To meet the emerging demands {{there is a need for}} further development of existing and new combustion techniques. The costs involved in building and development of boilers are large, and this makes tools supporting experience and test facilities extremely valuable for design and optimization of the equipment. One of these tools that have received attention the last decades is numerical simulation. Numerical modelling is intended to describe the physical mechanisms of the process and can give a fundamental understanding of the conversion in a boiler. To carry out the modelling a number of phenomena have to be considered: heat transfer, fluid dynamics, chemical reactions, and several other processes, dependent on application. As the computational cost often imposes a problem, approximations are introduced, and the related simplifications create uncertainties in the results. To obtain more reliable models, useful for quantitative predictions, more work is needed to evaluate the validity of model approximations. In this thesis, models in two areas, related to conversion of solid fuels, are investigated: fixed bed combustion and gaseous radiation. Combustion in fixed beds is of importance in grate furnaces and <b>wood-fired</b> domestic <b>boilers.</b> Modelling of combustion in fixed beds has here been examined with a one-dimensional model. The main aspect studied is the influence of gradients within individual fuel particles. The results show that these gradients only have a small effect on the ignition rate and maximum temperatures, while the effect on the distribution of the release of volatiles in the bed is more significant. Also the sensitivity of the bed model to a number of parameters related to heat transfer and reaction rates has been investigated, showing some sensitivity of the model to heat- and mass-transfer coefficients and the mixing rate of gaseous species. The work on gas radiation includes a theoretical and numerical investigation of various types of models accounting for spectral properties of gases and their relation to the solution of the radiative transfer equation. Further, spectral models have been examined for oxy-fired conditions, i. e. combustion in pure oxygen and recycled flue gas, a proposed method in relation to CO 2 capture. Gas radiation modelling has been applied in propane and lignite flames as a tool to evaluate measured data...|$|R

Particularly, the focus was to apply the concept to the expanding hotel industry, for covering the thermal energy demand of a medium scale hotel. Solar modules utilize the rooftop area of the building to a valuable application. Linear Fresnel type of solar concentrator is selected considering the requirement of the application and the simplicity of fabrication and installation compared to other technologies. Subsequently, a <b>wood-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> is deployed as the steam generator {{as well as the}} balancing power source to recover the effects due to the seasonal variations in solar energy. Bioenergy, so far being the largest primary energy supply in the country, has a good potential for further growth in industrial applications like small hotels.   When a hotel with about 200 -guests capacity and annual average occupancy of 65 % is considered, the total annual CO 2 saving is accounted as 207 tons compared with an entirely fossil fuel (diesel) fired boiler system. The annual operational cost saving is around $ 40, 000 and the simple payback period is within 3 - 4 years. The proposed hybrid system can generate additional 26 employment opportunities in the proximity of the site location area.   This solar-biomass hybrid concept mitigates the weaknesses associated with these renewable technologies when employed separately. The system has been designed {{in such a way that}} the total heat demand of hot water and process steam supply is managed by renewable energy alone.

Significant potential may also exist for development of bio-energy resources within the next decade. Pawnee Nation representatives should closely monitor market developments in the bio-energy industry, establish contacts with research institutions with which the tribe could potentially partner in grant-funded research initiatives. In addition, a substantial effort by the Kaw and Cherokee tribes is underway to pursue wind development at the Chilocco School Site in northern Oklahoma where Pawnee is a joint landowner. Pawnee Nation representatives should become actively involved in these development discussions and should explore the potential for joint investment in wind development at the Chilocco site. Financial incentives for project development are generally structured to provide tribes with access to conventional financing mechanisms. Grant funding for project construction is currently difficult to obtain. Substantial new opportunities for bio-fuel development may exist {{in the next few years}} with passage of the 2007 Farm Bill, and through opportunities made available through Oklahoma’s new Bio-energy Center. A review of potential alternatives to Pawnee Nation’s current electricity supply scenario revealed that a range of options could be viable. These include the following scenarios: business as usual, alternative supply, negotiate lower rates with City of Pawnee, focus on reducing energy usage, develop electric utility organization. Under any circumstances, Pawnee Nation should purse strategies to reduce energy usage, as this is the simplest means of reducing electric costs and environmental impacts. The research team also recommends that Pawnee Nation initiate some focused discussions with the City of Pawnee, with GRDA, and with IEC to discuss its wholesale supply purchase options. These discussions will better inform the Pawnee Energy Team of the specific pros and cons of its wholesale power supply options, and will assist the Team’s broader decision-making on utility-related issues. The ultimate path chosen by Pawnee Nation will depend on further consideration of priorities and potential barriers by Pawnee Nation’s Energy Team...|$|E
40|$|In 2003, the Pawnee Nation {{leadership}} {{identified the}} need for the tribe to comprehensively address its energy issues. During a strategic energy planning workshop a general framework was laid out and the Pawnee Nation Energy Task Force was created to work toward further development of the tribe’s energy vision. The overarching goals of the “first steps” project were to identify the most appropriate focus for its strategic energy initiatives going forward, and to provide information necessary to take the next steps in pursuit of the “best fit” energy options. Based on the request of Pawnee Nation’s Energy Task Force the research team, consisting Tribal personnel and Summit Blue Consulting, focused on a review of renewable energy resource development potential, funding sources and utility organizational along with energy savings options. Elements of the energy demand forecasting and characterization and demand side options review remained in the scope of work, but were only addressed at a high level. Description of Activities Performed Renewable Energy Resource Development Potential The research team reviewed existing data pertaining to the availability of biomass (focusing on woody biomass, agricultural biomass/bio-energy crops, and methane capture), solar, wind and hydropower resources on the Pawnee-owned lands. Using these data, combined with assumptions about costs and revenue streams, the research team performed preliminary feasibility assessments for each resource category. The research team also reviewed available funding resources and made recommendations to Pawnee Nation highlighting those resources with the greatest potential for financially-viable development, both in the near-term and over a longer time horizon. Energy Efficiency Options While this was not a major focus of the project, the research team highlighted common strategies for reducing energy use in buildings. The team also discussed the benefits of adopting a building energy code and introduced two model energy codes Pawnee Nation should consider for adoption. Summary of Current and Expected Future Electricity Usage The research team provided a summary overview of electricity usage patterns in current buildings and included discussion of known plans for new construction. Utility Options Review Pawnee Nation electric utility options were analyzed through a four-phase process, which included: 1) summarizing the relevant utility background information; 2) gathering relevant utility assessment data; 3) developing a set of realistic Pawnee electric utility service options, and 4) analyzing the various Pawnee electric utility service options for the Pawnee Energy Team’s consideration. III. Findings and Recommendations Due to a lack of financial incentives for renewable energy, particularly at the state level, combined mediocre renewable energy resources, renewable energy development opportunities are limited for Pawnee Nation. However, near-term potential exists for development of solar hot water at the gym, and an exterior <b>wood-fired</b> <b>boiler</b> system at the tribe’s main administrative building.
