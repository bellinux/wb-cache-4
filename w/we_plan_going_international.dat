Purpose: The aim of this thesis is to investigate the real life processes and strategies that companies adopt in <b>going</b> <b>international</b> and compare it to generic and taught internationalization models and theories. Method: Information was gathered from interviews, books and online data bases. Conclusions: From the analysis it was concluded that new business startups use the generic business models in the process of <b>going</b> <b>international.</b> In most instances they do this unknowingly. They combine two or more models in different ways to achieve their aim of <b>going</b> <b>international.</b> There were also instances when it is necessary for firms to combine two conflicting ideas to achieve what they want to achieve.

40|$|Based on a {{literature}} survey, {{we aim to}} answer our main question: “How should <b>we</b> <b>plan</b> and execute logistics in supply chains that aim to meet today’s requirements, and how can <b>we</b> support such <b>planning</b> and execution using IT?” Today’s requirements in supply chains include inter-organizational collaboration and more responsive and tailored supply to meet specific demand. Enterprise systems fall short in meeting these requirements The focus of planning and execution systems should move towards an inter-enterprise and event-driven mode. Inter-organizational systems may support <b>planning</b> <b>going</b> from supporting information exchange and henceforth enable synchronized planning within the organizations towards the capability to do network planning based on available information throughout the network. We {{provide a framework for}} planning systems, constituting a rich landscape of possible configurations, where the centralized and fully decentralized approaches are two extremes. We define and discuss agent based systems and in particular multi agent systems (MAS). We emphasize the issue of the role of MAS coordination architectures, and then explain that transportation is, next to production, an important domain in which MAS can and actually are applied. However, implementation is not widespread and some implementation issues are explored. In this manner, <b>we</b> conclude that <b>planning</b> problems in transportation have characteristics that comply with the specific capabilities of agent systems. In particular, these systems are capable to deal with inter-organizational and event-driven planning settings, hence meeting today’s requirements in supply chain planning and execution...|$|R

40|$|Background: IT Service Management (ITSM) is {{the set of}} {{processes}} that allow planning, organizing, directing and controlling the provisioning of IT services. Among the concerns of ITSM, namely within the service level management process, are the requirements for services availability, performance, accuracy, capacity and security, which are specified in terms of service-level agreements (SLA). Research problems: SLA definition and monitoring are open issues within the ITSM domain. In this research <b>plan</b> <b>we</b> are <b>going</b> to focus on three specific problems in this context: (1) SLAs {{in the context of}} ITSM are informally specified in natural language; (2) SLAs specifications are not grounded on models of ITSM processes; (3) SLAs compliance verification in IT services is not performed at the same level of abstraction as service design. Research goals: Our main goals on this research work are to mitigate the above problems by proposing a model-based approach to IT services SLA specification and compliance verification. The specification part will be accomplished by proposing a SLA language- a domain specific language (DSL) for defining quality attributes as non functional requirements (NFRs) in the context of ITSM. Its metamodel will be an extension of the meta-model of the adopted process modeling language. A...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} inward aspects of internationalization in two Portuguese companies from distinct industries: automation engineering (services) and metallomechanics (industry). The goal is to gain a perspective about how buying abroad (products or services) can represent a major role {{that acts as a}} trigger to both companies to go international. To achieve this goal, this case-study focuses on the relationship both companies have had with international markets (prior to <b>going</b> <b>international)</b> through their suppliers, wich represented clear motivations to <b>going</b> <b>international.</b> This is a case-study research of ARUM (software industry) and SONAFI (methalomechanics industry). Inward activities should contribute to outward involvement, especially {{in the early stages of}} internationalization (Welch and Luostarinen, 1993), and both companies support this statement. In fact, inward activities (such as procurement) were the main push to both companies <b>going</b> <b>international.</b> Only two companies here were objects of study, and many more should be also examined. More in-depth studies should occur, from multiple and distinct activity sectors, in a way that enables a wider range of representation and replication in the future. These findings allow firms to understand that the paths to international markets can also come from within the company itself, its suppliers, its relationship networks, etc. This study attemps to act as a wake up call in regards to inward internationalization as a real trigger in pushing companies abroad and understanding the importance of the knowledge that surrounds a seller-buyer relationship for the company when it comes to start thinking operating abroad...|$|R
