The landing <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem.</b> On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased {{operations}} at midnight on 1 April 1996, {{and local government}} was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially {{different from those of}} the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire had continued to be held at the Ruthin branch, so there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> in segregating the records.|$|E

25|$|In 1906 Union Minière du Haut Katanga {{was formed}} to exploit the Katanga mines. King Leopold favoured a railway route entirely in Congolese territory, linked to the Congo River. An Angolan railway from Lobito Bay to Katanga was also proposed, but in 1908, the BSAC agreed with Leopold to {{continuing}} the Rhodesian railway to Elizabethville and the mines. Between 1912, when full-scale copper production began, until 1928 when a Congolese line was completed, almost all of Katanga's copper was shipped over the Rhodesian network to Beira. Even after the Congo route was opened, up {{to a third of}} Katanga's copper went to Beira, and the mine's the supply of coal and coke mostly came from Wankie, the cheapest available source. This railway's revenue from Katanga enabled it to carry agricultural produce at low rates. Large-scale development of the Copperbelt only began in the late 1920s, with an increasing world market for copper. Transport <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> as only short branches had to be built to connect the Copperbelt to the main line. The Beira route was well established and the BSAC wanted to prevent the Copperbelt companies taking advantage of other routes it did not control. The Benguela Railway to Angola, completed in 1931, provided the shortest, most direct route for copper from both Katanga and Northern Rhodesia, but it was never used to full capacity because both the Congo and the Rhodesias restricted its traffic in favour of their own lines.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand's batting effort started quietly, with Irfan Pathan {{using the}} hint of swing to bowl a maiden to captain Fleming first up. But {{inaccurate}} line and length {{in the next five}} overs allowed New Zealand to plunder 62, Fleming hitting five fours from the 5th over, and the run rate raced along. By the end of 15 power play overs, New Zealand had made 112 for no loss, Fleming having made a 51-ball half-century while Astle was on 45. Ganguly turned to his spinners, banking on Virender Sehwag to give him a few tight overs, and he complied. The first over conceded four runs, and in his second he held a return catch as Fleming went for 61. Four balls later, Hamish Marshall was out for 3, and India were in with a small shout. However, well-timed innings from Scott Styris, who made 37, and Craig McMillan with 13, and the occasional awful over – JP Yadav's only contribution to the match was a 14-run over – left New Zealand with 72 in 12.3 overs with six wickets in hand. With Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle in good hitting form – they took 17 off a Harbhajan over as Astle brought up his 100 with his first six of the match – this <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem,</b> and Vincent won New Zealand the game by hitting Agarkar for four with 11 balls to spare.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start {{at the rear of}} the field due to unapproved body modifications, but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an {{untimely}} caution while Harvick was on pit road, because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. He never got back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick's third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to go. Next week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken trackbar and would have to go to the garage but he was already locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings, and would be in a must win situation to make the round of 8, but that <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth, until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick would get back the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami.|$|E
500|$|One flaw in Peale's medal {{business}} was {{his need to}} acquire gold and silver bullion within the Mint. [...] This was paid for once the medal sold, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> while the Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint was Peale's friend Jonas R. McClintock. [...] But in 1846, McClintock resigned {{and was replaced by}} Richard Sears McCulloh. [...] At first, McCulloh gave Peale whatever gold and silver he needed without question, but came to object to doing so. [...] Peale and McCulloh made a deal whereby the struck medal would remain in McCulloh's custody until Peale had replaced the bullion, but Peale objected that the procedure was [...] "inconvenient". [...] Beginning in August 1849, McCulloh refused further requests from Peale for bullion, and Peale instead gained it from the Mint's Treasurer.|$|E
500|$|On 22 April 1983, just as Waller and Maxwell {{were about}} to officially {{announce}} the merger, Tranter's solicitors handed Waller a High Court injunction temporarily blocking sale of the disputed stock. Three days later, the High Court imposed a further injunction preventing any dealing in Reading shares until a further hearing on 3 May. Maxwell insisted that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem,</b> calling the legal challenge a [...] "side show"; he made a fresh bid to all of Reading's shareholders. On 1 May, the Oxford chairman told the press {{that he and his}} supporters at Reading controlled 40% of the shares. Meanwhile, Oxford City Council offered Oxford United a new [...] "£6million sports complex" [...] in the western suburb of Botley. Maxwell said that he was still pursuing the merger with Reading, but would look into the Botley proposal.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several {{references to}} war films. Several lines of dialogue, Bart slapping {{one of his}} soldiers for [...] "being a disgrace", and the music was lifted directly from the film Patton from 1970 composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Fox owned the rights to this film, so it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>problem</b> to use the soundtrack. The marching sequence and the silhouettes of the children climbing the jungle gym against the setting sun are a nod to Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. The Longest Day from 1962 is also referenced. The episode parodies the famous sailor kissing a girl in Times Square photograph taken on V-J Day, where a random boy in a sailor suit kisses Lisa, before she slaps him in the face. Bart concludes the episode by stating that the only [...] "good wars" [...] are the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars trilogy.|$|E

These statements were widely criticized in the media and by experts since they were made {{at a time when it}} was impossible to know so quickly what happened without being able to properly assess the situation or know the facts.|$|E

[...] Diplomats from the two countries addressed the common ground of anti-capitalism and anti-democracy, stating [...] "there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies," [...] "neither we nor Italy have anything in common with the capitalist west" [...] and [...] "it seems to us rather unnatural that a socialist state would stand {{on the side of the}} western democracies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Based on {{the success}} of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another {{crossover}} was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Diana Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing. A large proportion of the crossover was filmed in a road tunnel in Caernarfon, Wales. Watson commented: [...] "It {{was the only one that}} we could hire for two weeks without causing huge traffic jams. The whole shoot was five weeks long. Staging stunts like car accidents is difficult and stressful at the best of times, but doing all that in a tunnel doubled it.
