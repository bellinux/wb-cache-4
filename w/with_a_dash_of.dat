It involves multiple agents interacting in such a way that a glimpse of structure may appear.|$|E

Franklin also included the occasional mathematical exercise, and the Almanack from 1750 features an early example of demographics. It is chiefly remembered, however, for being a repository of Franklin's aphorisms and proverbs, many of which live on in American English. These maxims typically counsel thrift and courtesy, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> cynicism.|$|E

500|$|Despite its popularity, a few music critics {{including}} Robert Copsey from Digital Spy {{criticized the}} song for being monotonous. Cospey wrote that [...] "you could slap an LMFAO tag {{on the cover}} and few would know the difference" [...] and Paul Lester of The Guardian similarly labelled it as [...] "generic ravey Euro dance with guitars". Lester described the song as [...] "Pump Up the Jam meets the Macarena <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Cotton Eye Joe" [...] while Robert Myers of The Village Voice dismissed [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] as an [...] "inspired piece of silliness".|$|E

The synth sounds remind him a little of Ray Lynch. [...] Parsons details this as [...] "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements". [...] Debbage writes that [...] "the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph’s uncanny ability to compose elegant and emotive ballads. Back track to 'Secrets Of The Sun' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on 'The Edge Of My Heart'.|$|E

The best groove {{so far this}} year is from Scotland and it shows London and New York exactly how it should be done, a one-sided, one-track 12inch (it doesn't need any dub or instrumentals). 'All You Need Is Love' by The Jamms is more than rife with a bit of The Beatles (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> MC5 and Samantha Fox). It seems to be anti-AIDS, but as I know nothing about the band it could easily be a piss take.

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Christopher Frost in 1874 as Boletus salmonicolor, based on specimens he {{collected in the}} New England area of the United States. In a 1983 publication, mycologist Roy Halling declared Boletus subluteus (described by Charles Horton Peck in 1887; Ixocomus subluteus is a later combination based on this name) and Suillus pinorigidus (described by Wally Snell and Esther A. Dick in 1956) to be synonymous. Halling also reexamined Frost's type specimen of B.salmonicolor, and considered the taxon better placed in Suillus because of its glutinous cap, dotted stem, and ring; he formally transferred it to that genus, resulting in the combination Suillus salmonicolor. The specific epithet salmonicolor is a Latin color term meaning [...] "pink <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> yellow". The mushroom {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "slippery Jill".|$|E
500|$|The Toronto Suns Steve Tilley, who {{believed}} that Remedy did a [...] "killer job" [...] on Max Payne 2, felt that the company kept what was great about the previous game, [...] "while everything else has been tweaked, overhauled and juiced up". He was {{a fan of the}} Bullet Time from the first game, and therefore appreciated seeing it return in the sequel, with [...] "even more impressive" [...] visuals. Tilley found that the game's [...] "lifelike physics engine" [...] was easily its best aspect, and noted that while playing the game, he threw a grenade across a room, which resulted in an explosion that sent enemies flying through the air in a realistic fashion. In addition, Tilley applauded Remedy for listening to fan complaints and resolving issues from the previous game, including improved dream sequences in Max Payne 2. He was, however, disappointed with the general linearity of the game, and noted that players who are not interested in film noir themes will not enjoy them in Max Payne 2. Concluding, Tilley commented that the game [...] "has enough polish, cinematic flair and outright mayhem to thrill those who like their Sopranos <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> John Woo and a touch of Frank Miller." ...|$|E
500|$|Salander is a {{computer}} hacker who has survived severe emotional and sexual abuse. The character was a [...] "vulnerable victim-turned-vigilante with the [...] "take-no-prisoners" [...] attitude of Lara Croft and the [...] "cool, unsentimental intellect" [...] of Spock. Fincher felt that Salander's eccentric persona was enthralling, and stated, [...] "there's a kind of wish fulfillment {{to her in the}} way that she takes care of things, the way she will only put up with so much, but there are other sides to her as well." [...] Casting was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as Natalie Portman, Ellen Page, Kristen Stewart, Emily Browning, Jennifer Lawrence, Keira Knightley, Anne Hathaway, Olivia Thirlby, Scarlett Johansson, and Emma Watson. Despite the hype, some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay. Mara had worked with Fincher in his 2010 film The Social Network. Fincher, while fond of the actress' youthful appearance, found it difficult at first to mold her to match Salander's antisocial demeanor, which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the submissive Erica. Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander. Her hair was dyed black and cut into various jagged points, giving the appearance that she cut it herself. In addition to her transgressive appearance, which was described as a [...] "mash-up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> S temptress" [...] by Lynn Hirschberg of W, Mara participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in Los Angeles in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice.|$|E
50|$|Some of the turbans {{have been}} of {{ordinary}} dyed muslin cloth mostly <b>of</b> saffron color <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dashing</b> <b>of</b> green sometimes, where as some represent very exquisite and fashionable headgear. Most of the politicians in Kashmir have given up {{the use of a}} turban which used to be the symbol of dignity and honor, except for ceremonial use. The Karakul caps are the present rage amongst most of the mainstream politicians. It is quite common for a Kashmiri groom to remove the traditional turban and replace it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Karakul Cap as he waits at his in-laws house for his bride to accompany him home. In the Kashmiri Muslim diaspora the Karakul cap is now only worn at important moments.|$|R

500|$|The LM's {{policies}} were generally progressive, and Hall himself stated that [...] "we had no major {{differences with the}} written philosophies of the LCL". The LM's colour, purple, was described by observers as [...] "LCL blue <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Labor red", signifying the faction's location on the political spectrum. The LM was less concerned with creating differing policy as it was taking over and reforming the LCL; however, on the electoral reform front, the LM started by calling for the Legislative Council to be devoid of ministers. Worried by the LM, conservatives in the LCL tried to change the party rules to prevent members from criticising the organisation in public, and enforce discipline. This backfired as the LM exploited it to portray the conservatives as repressive, and the media also viewed it negatively, and the move was put on hold. The non-Labor forces, in their disunity, were in a poor position to challenge the dominance of charismatic Premier Dunstan. The LM itself contained two poorly defined internal groups: moderates, concerned with the inequalities of the electoral systems and the LCL's aging image; and radicals, who espoused the aforementioned {{in addition to the}} desire for wide-ranging social reform. Some of the latter felt Hall was the most progressive option available, but not progressive enough. Nevertheless, the LM had generated a large amount of campaign funds and had great name recognition; Hall was also favoured in opinions as a better leader than Eastick by a threefold factor. They cited such figures to portray themselves as the main threat to Labor and justify why they were the direction the LCL needed to take. Late in the year the LM received another boost when Wilson regained the seat of Sturt for the Liberal Party at the 1972 federal election, making much of his LM membership.|$|E
500|$|Claudia Puig of USA Today {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "The animation is stunningly rendered. But {{the story is}} always the critical element in Pixar movies, and Cars' story is heartfelt with a clear and unabashed moral." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Like the Toy Story films, Cars is a state-of-the-computer-art plea on behalf of outmoded, wholesome fifties technology, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Zen by way of George Lucas." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "It's beautiful to look at. The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says." ...|$|E

[...] Huddleston criticized Cage's performance but praised Perlman's. The critic concluded, [...] "Season of the Witch is not for everyone: it’s creaky, predictable and frequently idiotic.

2500|$|There {{are several}} current bands that are broadly tagged under {{suburban}} {{but are not}} easy to categorize: Arbol is arguably the most talented of them: their albums can go from hardcore to balladry, and from hard rock to folk and reggae. Los Tipitos and Villanos present a more melodic style of suburban. Los Tipitos show a tendency to mature pop-rock; Villanos's sound is cheery and shows more buoyancy, and at times slides towards the sound of Argentine [...] "sonic" [...] rock <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> punk. And Intoxicados has been burning the rock charts throughout 2006, their latest effort Otro Dia en en Planeta Tierra (2005) digging hit after charting hit. A diverse album stylistically with lyrics whose content seem not to match the music, it features the suburban blueprint sound but it is used more as a foundation than a showcase. [...] One could also include Smitten (band). Romapagana, a punk-inspired band, now commands great respect in certain circles. Formed by Luca Prodan's younger brother, Andrea, it points to a new urban sound with guerrilla-like intensity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{received a}} range of critical reaction, from competently done for a budget title to horribly executed. The gameplay of Deadly Premonition drew comparisons to that of Shenmue the Clock Tower series, and its combat was {{compared to that of}} Resident Evil 4. According to 1UP's Frank Cifaldi, Deadly Premonitions combination of similar gameplay to Shenmue, The Last Express, Resident Evil 4, and the Grand Theft Auto series proved to be [...] "a 'jack of all trades, master of none' scenario." [...] Erik Brudvig of IGN US wrote: [...] "The Twin Peaks meets Resident Evil <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> Grand Theft Auto formula sounds pretty great, but it was well beyond the capabilities of this development team." [...] The controls were criticized as detracting from the game's appeal. The combat sections received mixed reactions. IGN UK's Matt Wales wrote that while the combat was [...] "simplistic", the atmosphere and profiling worked nicely. [...] According to Eurogamer's Chris Shilling, the sudden appearances of the Raincoat Killer made the sections frightening and the profiling made for some unsettling yet [...] "relatively restrained" [...] moments of horror, despite the [...] "over-long and frequently clumsy" [...] combat sequences. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described the supernatural enemies as not particularly aggressive and boss battles as taking too long.|$|E

2500|$|Camilla Pia of The Fly {{magazine}} raved, [...] "Packed full of sparkling pop with a folky {{heart and}} an electronic edge, the debut is ridiculously infectious; swooping choruses and lyrics of all-consuming love and losing it sticking {{in your head}} from first listen." [...] The Independent critic Andy Gill noted that [...] "despite the occasional furtive flourish of acoustic guitar, her work on this debut album is more akin to the retro-synthpop of Little Boots and La Roux, thanks to the thoroughness with which production partner Fin Dow-Smith has smothered her folkie origins under a welter of busily cycling synths and programmed beats." [...] Spins Caryn Ganz referred to the album as [...] "hiny, wholesome dance-pop, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dash</b> <b>of</b> saucy" [...] on which Goulding [...] "glides through blippy anthems , pumping disco , and delicate grooves [...] with a pixie-ish voice that's one notch sweeter than Metric's Emily Haines." [...] Pitchfork Media's Stephen Troussé wrote, [...] "Outside of its immediate context, Lights is a sometimes great, always promising debut. It's an album about leaving home, and it works best when {{the contrast between the}} folk singer and the pop production chimes with the tensions between the pull of home and the allure of the city." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone expressed that Goulding has [...] "a classic British folkie's voice—the kind of tremulous soprano that evokes a wintry day on a fog-swaddled moor. But Lights places her vocals and minor-key melodies against producer Starsmith's club-ready mix of synths and brisk, busy electro rhythms. The results are moody , pretty [...] and uniformly catchy." ...|$|E

40|$|Background Rupture of a distal biceps brachii tendon is an {{uncommon}} injury only occurring in 3 % of cases reported of a biceps tendon rupture. Treatment of distal ruptures usually requires surgical repair. This study evaluates the functional levels {{of patients with}} both acute and chronically treated distal biceps brachii tendon ruptures. Methods Retrospective chart review of patients with the diagnosis of a distal biceps tendon rupture from October 1997 to March 2002 was done. Functional levels were assessed using the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand outcomes (DASH) questionnaire. Results 41 patients were identified and 21 patients were successfully contacted and completed the DASH questionnaire. 14 patients had acute injuries that were surgically repaired using <b>a</b> two-incision approach, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> average <b>DASH</b> score <b>of</b> 26. 21. 6 patients had chronic injuries that were treated non-operatively <b>with</b> <b>an</b> average <b>DASH</b> score <b>of</b> 41. 3. 1 patient had a chronic injury that was treated surgically <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>DASH</b> score <b>of</b> 24. Two complications were reported post-operatively. Conclusion Surgical repair, whether done for acute or chronic distal biceps tendon ruptures yields a higher functional status for individuals than those injuries treated non-operatively...|$|R
