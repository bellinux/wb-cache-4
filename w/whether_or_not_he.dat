5|$|On the November 28 {{episode of}} Raw, Maria interviewed then-Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff, {{and asked him}} <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> {{thought he was going}} to be fired. He then booked her in a match with Kurt Angle out of spite, and Maria was laid out with the Angle Slam. As a result, one week later, Maria testified in the trial against Bischoff, who was being fired because of his {{controversial}} actions as General Manager.|$|E

5000|$|Most of the Imperial leaders {{we see in}} {{the movies}} rule through a {{combination}} of fear and manipulation. I wanted to create something different: a commander who could lead through loyalty. The result was Thrawn, a tactical genius whose troops follow him willingly, and who will fight for him <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he's</b> watching over their shoulders.|$|R

5|$|The {{timing of}} Frederick's {{death and the}} length of his reign are {{important}} topics among historians.

5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to remove him from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to get an answer from Steinmetz about <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> was a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack's (Sean Hayes) {{talk show}} Jack Talk is {{completely}} revamped, after right-wing conservatives {{take over the}} gay network, OutTV.

Besides, he always has the door-key in his pocket, when he doesn't forget it, which is pretty often.

5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> should compare his beloved {{to the summer}} season, and argues {{that he should not}} because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{made this}} {{announcement}} on a Saturday when most Football League clubs, including Oxford and Reading, were playing League fixtures. Oxford were playing away at Doncaster Rovers. Jim Smith {{learned of the}} announcement shortly before kick-off at Doncaster's Belle Vue ground from John Ley, a journalist with the Oxford Mail, who had heard the news from another newsman by telephone. Smith immediately called Maxwell to ask <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would be retained to manage Thames Valley Royals, {{and was told that}} he would be.|$|E

On January 11, 2013, Booker filed papers to form a campaign committee, without announcing <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would run.

50|$|Three years pass, {{during which}} several letters {{go back and}} forth between Bernardo, Pedro, his mother and his grandmother. We then see Bernardo and two of his friends, a boy and girl, at a funeral, and a casket being lowered, {{although}} it is not immediately revealed whose funeral this is. Shortly after, a cab pulls up with Pedro inside, out of the hospital and healthy, and he expresses lament at the passing of Bernardo's grandmother. After a brief conversation, Bernardo returns to his two friends, kisses both, and parts from them, leaving the viewer to wonder <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he's</b> romantically involved with one of them.

Mark is also obsessed with his workmate Sophie (Olivia Colman), who {{is more interested in}} the manly Jeff. Both endure awkward situations: Mark admires his boss, Alan Johnson, and can't work out <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he's</b> sexually attracted to him. Jeremy remembers having oral sex with Super Hans (Matt King) during a drug binge. Mark and Jeremy desperately team up to prank call Sophie and launch a pepper spray attack on Super Hans, who has begun a relationship with Toni.

5|$|Ravenstahl had an {{unstable}} {{relationship with the}} Pittsburgh City Council throughout his term as Mayor, which included disagreements over the city budget. City Councilman Bill Peduto emerged as a political opponent of Ravenstahl's, with Peduto mounting a primary election challenge against Ravenstahl in 2007 before dropping out a short time later. Prior to the 2013 election, Ravenstahl had not held a fundraiser since 2009 and it was uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> would seek another term; however, an undisclosed source indicated to local news outlet KDKA in September 2011 that Ravenstahl would run for re-election in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Several stories also feature knights {{struggling}} {{to stave off}} the advances of voluptuous women, including Yder, the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The Green Knight parallel in these stories is a King testing a knight as to <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> will remain chaste in extreme circumstances. The woman he sends is sometimes his wife (as in Yder), if he knows that she is unfaithful and will tempt other men; in The Knight of the Sword the king sends his beautiful daughter. All characters playing the Green Knight's role kill unfaithful knights who fail their tests.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} general surgeon Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) {{performing}} a special surgery, {{and to her}} dismay, the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) is absent from the operating room. At Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s house, Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) is engaging in sexual activity with Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), while his wife, Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is estranged.

5000|$|A common {{point of}} {{criticism}} of The Fortress of Solitude is the misplaced idea of the magic ring that confers the abilities of flight and invisibility. Though it does tie in with the sporadic comic book theme, it seems a jarring departure from the stark traumatic reality of Dylan’s childhood. [...] Some critics see it as almost a gimmick; the glaring unreality of superhero fantasy is an unforgettable and almost unforgivable trait of the book. On the other hand, the magic powers of the ring only enhance the innocence, idealism and, to a degree, naiveté of Dylan’s childhood. Our main characters soon learn that “doesn’t solve much of anything. A caped crime fighter is powerless against the shape-shifting demons of racism. A white boy might dream of becoming invisible, while a black man, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he's</b> read Ralph Ellison, might worry that he already is.” (A. O. Scott, New York Times) ...|$|R
5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. Evil intent forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> had an intention to commit it.|$|E
5|$|Gjems-Onstad's {{cooperation}} with Hagen was however not to last. In early 1976 Gjems-Onstad voiced his discontent with the ever-ongoing conflicts within the party, {{and he had}} by mid-year not decided <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> wanted to run for re-election. He eventually felt squeezed out of the party, and wanted no part in the intriguing he considered Hagen to represent. He was replaced as parliamentary leader of the party {{at the start of}} October. After he in turn recommended voters to rather vote for the Conservative Party in an interview with Aftenposten, he was finally expelled from the party by a unanimously approved motion put forward by Carl I. Hagen later the same month. Gjems-Onstad finished his term as an independent.|$|E
5|$|Named to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated {{the same}} year. Pope Gregory III {{sent him a}} pallium in 736. He may have been {{appointed}} by Æthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. <b>Whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> owed his appointment to Æthelbald, Nothhelm {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence. He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington. A significant feature of this synod was the fact that no king attended, but yet the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.|$|E

5|$|The stories The Girl {{with the}} Mule (alternately titled The Mule Without a Bridle) and Hunbaut feature Gawain in {{beheading}} game situations. In Hunbaut, Gawain cuts off a man's head and, {{before he can}} replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle {{to stave off the}} advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include Yder, the Lancelot-Grail, Hunbaut, and The Knight of the Sword. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>he</b> will remain chaste in trying circumstances.|$|E

The subsequent trials resulted in 78men being {{convicted and sentenced to}} jail terms ranging between five and twenty years. The arrests severely depleted the VNQDD leadership: most of the Central Committee were captured, though Học and Nhu were among the few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel.|$|E
