25|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} assessment of flood risks caused by the River Don and its tributaries, the River Dearne Improvement Scheme was implemented between 1963 and 1973. It was recognised that simple enlargement of the river channel would not provide a satisfactory solution, as it would just move the problem to the River Don, and therefore a series of washlands were created, which could be progressively flooded if required, without affecting centres of population. Near the mouth of the river, Dearne Mouth <b>washland,</b> which is now known as the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve, was created in 1963, and a manually operated sluice allowed the flow of the river to be diverted through the floodbank and into the <b>washland</b> when there were high levels at the junction with the River Don. The sluice was rebuilt in 1973. Additional washlands were created at Harlington and North Ings, and the river was straightened and realigned.|$|E
25|$|The Ouse Washes are {{an internationally}} {{important}} area for wildlife. Sandwiched between the Old Bedford and New Bedford rivers, they consist of <b>washland</b> {{which is used}} as pasture during the summer but which floods in the winter, and are the largest area of such land in the United Kingdom. They act as breeding grounds for lapwings, redshanks and snipe in spring, and are home to varieties of ducks and swans during the winter months.|$|E
500|$|A new sluice was {{constructed}} at Newbridge, incorporating tidal gates, which effectively prevent tides from passing further up the river. The {{removal of the}} navigation works at Ham proved particularly difficult, and acted as a training exercise for the Territorial Royal Engineers. Men from the 205 (Wessex) Field Squadron RE (TA) used [...] of explosives {{to blow up the}} half-lock and a mud-filled barge which could not be moved. The river banks were raised to give more protection to the villages of Creech St Michael, Ham and Ruishton, but the channel was still only capable of discharging , whereas the channels through Taunton were designed to handle , and were unlikely to overflow until discharges reached [...] Curry Moor is therefore used as a <b>washland,</b> and excess water floods over it, to be pumped out at a later date by the Curry Moor pumping station, situated {{on the banks of the}} river below the railway bridge. The programme began in 1965 and was completed in 1967.|$|E
25|$|Further upriver, a {{flood relief}} channel was built at Bolton upon Dearne, and more <b>washlands</b> were formed between Wath railway bridge and Adwick bridge. The Bolton Ings and Old Moor <b>washlands</b> were next to be created, to be {{followed}} by those at Wombwell Ings, where the River Dove joins the Dearne, Darfield, Houghton and Cudworth. Some of the storage capacity was lost as a result of mining schemes, and a regulator was installed at Bolton in 1972, allowing the flow to be restricted by a sluice gate. During the flooding in 2007, all of the <b>washlands</b> filled to capacity, although the Bolton regulator could not be operated as it had been vandalised. Some damage to the Houghton <b>washlands</b> resulted from the extremely high water levels, which overtopped the banks and caused erosion to take place. Following the floods, a reassessment of the function of the regulators was carried out, and in view of the costs of maintaining them, the Environment Agency intend to remove them once some reconfiguration of the river channel has been completed. This work will ensure that the <b>washlands</b> fill and empty at the appropriate points in a flood cycle.|$|R
50|$|In January 2010 fen skating championships {{took place}} at Earith and on Whittlesey Wash within the Nene <b>Washlands</b> Drainage Commissioners Area.|$|R
25|$|The River Rother {{is managed}} by the Environment Agency to {{mitigate}} flooding in the Catcliffe and Rotherham areas, {{through a series of}} regulators and <b>washlands.</b> The regulators are used to hold back the flow of the river, and the <b>washlands</b> consist of low-lying land adjacent to the river which flood when the flows are held back. This allows flood flows on the River Don to pass through Rotherham before the water from the Rother does so. There are three regulators, at Canklow, Woodhouse Mill and Meadowgate.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{regulator}} to {{be installed}} was at Woodhouse Mill. It is a vertical sluice gate, and is situated at the downstream end of the Woodhouse Mill washlands nature reserve. A railway embankment crosses the nature reserve, and flood arches allow the water to flood {{both sides of the}} tracks. There are no floodbanks between the river and the reserve, which results in it flooding soon after the gate is closed. The mechanism here was manufactured by Ransomes and Rapier in 1956, and the regulator was commissioned in 1959. The Canklow regulator, situated close to the A630 link road from junction 33 on the M1 motorway, is also a vertical sluice gate, which when closed causes progressive flooding of seven <b>washland</b> areas {{on both sides of the}} M1, capable of holding [...] of flood water. It was installed in 1969 as part of a major road-building project, which saw the M1 motorway and the A630 road built across the washlands.|$|E
50|$|Clifton, Rawcliffe and Poppleton ings are {{temporary}} storage area (<b>washland</b> scheme) for water that flows down the River Ouse in York, England.|$|E
50|$|This {{is one of}} many flood {{defenses}} {{that make}} up a scheme. Other projects include River Foss Barrier, Leaky dams, ings, <b>washland</b> storage basin, walls, and embankments.|$|E
25|$|The river {{has been}} the subject of channel engineering, to ease the problem of flooding. A new channel was {{constructed}} for it near its mouth in the 1950s, as the old route had been affected by subsidence. <b>Washlands,</b> which can be progressively flooded as water levels rise, were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. A flood relief channel and a regulator to restrict the flow was built at Bolton upon Dearne. During the 2007 United Kingdom floods, all of the <b>washlands</b> filled to capacity, but the regulator could not be operated as it had been vandalised.|$|R
50|$|A new wetland {{and flood}} storage area, Centenary <b>Washlands,</b> {{has since been}} built by Rotherham Council and the Environment Agency to prevent {{flooding}} in the future. Sheffield Wildlife Trust manages the site as a local nature reserve.|$|R
25|$|The {{river is}} navigable to Bawtry, {{although}} navigation rights were removed in 1972. It {{is also important}} for conservation, with the Idle <b>Washlands</b> {{and some of the}} sand and gravel pits of the Idle Valley being designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest.|$|R
50|$|Fenn <b>Washland</b> is a 4.9 hectare Local Nature Reserve in South Woodham Ferrers in Essex. It {{is owned}} by Essex County Council and managed by the Council {{as a part of}} the nearby Marsh Farm Country Park.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Washland</b> or washes {{are areas}} of land {{adjacent}} to rivers which are deliberately flooded {{at times when}} the rivers are high, to avoid flooding in residential or important agricultural areas. [...] They often provide for overwintering wildfowl, and several include important nature reserves.|$|E
50|$|To {{facilitate}} the drainage of the <b>washland,</b> {{there is a}} third, unembanked river between the two Bedford Rivers, alongside the Old Bedford River and known as the River Delph. It drains into the New Bedford River 2 to 3 km south of Denver Sluice.|$|E
50|$|Derby is {{situated}} in a relatively low-lying area along the lower valley of the River Derwent and lies between the lowlands and valley of the River Trent to the south, and the south east foothills of the Pennines to the north which extend to the Peak District National Park further on. The city is bordered by four national character areas which include the Trent Valley <b>Washlands</b> to the south, the Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire Coalfields in the east, the South Derbyshire Claylands in the west, and the Derbyshire Peak Fringe in the north. Most of the flat plains surrounding Derby lie in the Trent Valley <b>Washlands</b> and South Derbyshire Claylands while the hillier northern {{parts of the city}} lie within the Derbyshire Peak Fringe and the Coalfields.|$|R
50|$|The route {{has signed}} links to Burton Railway Station and runs {{close to the}} Brewery {{buildings}} which dominate the town. The route leaves Burton via Burton & South Derbyshire College over the Trent <b>Washlands</b> via the off-road Victorian Stapenhill Viaduct and recently refurbished Ferry Bridge prior to a climb up out of Burton via side streets onto the A444.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{consists}} {{mainly of}} low-lying wet pasture divided by ditches. It {{is part of}} the Gowy & Mersey <b>Washlands</b> Living Landscape initiative. Before the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal the Gowy would have been tidal in this area and much of the reserve would have consisted of saltmarsh with brackish creeks, whose traces can still be seen in places.|$|R
50|$|This is {{described}} by Natural England as one of Britain's few remaining areas of <b>washland</b> which are vital {{for the survival of}} wildfowl and waders. Wintering wildfowls include wigeons, teals, pintails and Bewick's swans. The rich flora in ditches include uncommon species such as frogbit, water violet and flowering rush.|$|E

50|$|The {{science of}} Fen {{drainage}} {{was not well}} understood when the first enclosure acts were passed, and {{it was thought that}} flooding might be worse if the embankments were placed too close to the river. Consequently, the Dales Head Dyke was constructed, about 1 mi {{to the west of the}} Witham, and the land between it and the river was used as <b>washland,</b> and was flooded for up to nine months each year. By 1797, the process was better understood, and an Act of Parliament authorised the reclaiming of 2800 acre of <b>washland,</b> by moving the banks much closer to the river, and extending the banks at the sides of several fens to join the repositioned flood bank. A drainage engine was to be moved from Blankney Fen to Martin Fen, and the documents were to be stored in a chest in Timberland Church, where they could be viewed on payment of one shilling (5p).|$|E
50|$|Toton <b>Washlands</b> is {{a nature}} reserve {{created by the}} Environment Agency {{to the west of}} Toton Sidings, that serves as flood defence for the River Erewash and sits to the east of the Erewash Canal. Although it is within the {{boundaries}} of Toton, due to the presence of the sidings it is only possible to access the area from neighbouring Long Eaton.|$|R
25|$|There {{are four}} areas of {{grassland}} {{adjacent to the}} lower Idle, which are subject to periodic flooding, and which provide habitat for wintering and breeding birds. They form the Idle <b>Washlands</b> Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Historically, a much greater area would have functioned in this way, but {{much of it is}} now cut off from the river by high flood defence banks. The <b>Washlands</b> SSSI once covered an area of 250 hectares, which was used as grazing pasture during the summer months and was often covered by shallow flooding in the winter, but during the 1980s, further flood defence work and land drainage reduced this area to 88 hectares. Some work has been carried out under the National Environment Programme to ensure that the wildfowl and wader habitat is not lost completely, and the Environment Agency have produced a water level management plan to further protect the SSSI. Parts of the Mother Drain are also a designated SSSI.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Aldwarke" [...] {{refers to}} an area in the Don Valley about 2 miles north of Rotherham, South Yorkshire {{stretching}} {{to the outskirts of}} the village of Kilnhurst. To its west is Parkgate, to its east the villages of Dalton and Thrybergh. The <b>washlands</b> of the River Don (known locally as [...] "The Wash") was crossed by a toll road which was freed of toll in the late 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The New River is a {{drainage}} {{system in the}} South Holland district of Lincolnshire, England. [...] near Crowland it flows very roughly eastwards, following the general line of the River Welland but {{a little to the}} south. It skirts the settlements of Crowland and Cowbit before flowing into the Welland at [...] near Little London.The land enclosed between the Welland and the New River is referred to as <b>Washland,</b> [...] and [...] being the principal areas. <b>Washland</b> was designed to be sacrificially flooded as a relief of high river levels. The current land usage, and the rights of the drainage authorities to flood it can be traced back at least to an act of parliament of George III, and amended in 1847. The arrangement is not theoretical. Cowbit Wash was flooded annually to protect Spalding until the creation of the Coronation Channel allowed excess water to bypass the town. Even now the option to overspill onto the Wash is available.|$|E
50|$|The Ouse Washes are {{an internationally}} {{important}} area for wildlife. Sandwiched between the Old Bedford and New Bedford rivers, they consist of <b>washland</b> {{which is used}} as pasture during the summer but which floods in the winter, and are the largest area of such land in the United Kingdom. They act as breeding grounds for lapwings, redshanks and snipe in spring, and are home to varieties of ducks and swans during the winter months.|$|E
50|$|The Environment Agency {{carried out}} flood {{alleviation}} {{work on the}} New Cut Drain in 2013, {{to reduce the risk}} of properties flooding. The work involved sheet piling of some 770 yd of the drain, and installation of perforated filter drains to collect surface water. A new flood bank between the river and the Willows Estate was constructed, and parts of the existing bank between the New Cut Drain and the Freshney <b>Washland</b> Flood Storage Reservoir were removed, to allow more water to be impounded when river flows are high.|$|E
2500|$|In the Hatfield Level {{drainage}} project {{which started}} in 1626, the Dutch civil engineer Cornelius Vermuyden diverted the Don northwards along Turnbridgedike. He constructed Dikesmarsh bank some distance {{to the east of}} the channel, so that the intervening land could be used as <b>washlands.</b> The main work was completed by 1628, but after flooding in 1629, a [...] "Great Sluice" [...] was constructed at the junction between the river and the Aire, with 17 openings which were , probably by Hugo Spiering, who had assisted Vermuyden on the main project.

Water levels here were between [...] lower than at Turnbridge. This new channel was called the [...] "Dutch River", and was finished in 1635, at a cost of £33,000. It ended in a sluice at Goole, and was never intended to be navigable, as boats could access the Aire at Turnbridge. The sluice was later swept away in a flood and never replaced.|$|R

50|$|The Trust manages 42 nature {{reserves}} covering 630 ha {{throughout the}} county, from flooded gravel pits {{in the south}} to moorland and upland woodland in the north. Fourteen of these are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The Trust also works with schools, local communities, local authorities, landowners and others to promote and protect the natural environment. Environmental education and workshops are provided at the Avenue <b>Washlands</b> Visitor Centre, the Whistlestop Centre, and the Wildlife Discovery Room at Carsington Water.|$|R
50|$|In 1630, King Charles I {{granted a}} {{drainage}} charter to the 4th Earl of Bedford who engaged the Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden {{to construct the}} two Bedford rivers. The purpose of the new rivers was to facilitate drainage of the Great Ouse between Earith and Downham Market. The area between the rivers is 20 mi long and almost a mile wide and acts as <b>washland,</b> i.e. a floodplain during the winter and, increasingly, also in summer. When they are flooded this causes a 30 mi detour for local residents.|$|E
50|$|The area {{targeted}} by the OWLP scheme focuses on the distinctive rural, open and tranquil landscape surrounding the Ouse Washes; this landscape includes important wetland and <b>washland</b> habitats set within productive agricultural land. The project focuses on {{the area around the}} Old Bedford River and New Bedford River in the Cambridgeshire and Norfolk Fens and includes the RSPB nature reserves to its south, near St Ives and Fen Drayton. This unique landscape area includes or abuts a large number of vibrant small settlements and is close to the market towns and cities of Downham Market, Chatteris, March, Littleport, Ely, Cambridge and St. Ives.|$|E
50|$|The A633 Barnsley Road crosses at Aldham Bridge, {{which is}} {{followed}} by another unused railway bridge. Next Stonyford Bridge carries the B6096 road over the river, and Wombwell Ings, an area of low-lying ground and lakes, is located to the south. Wombwell Ings {{is used as a}} <b>washland,</b> which is flooded in a controlled way when the river is unable to discharge into the Dearne because of high water levels, which are themselves often the result of high levels in the River Don. They were engineered to act as washlands in 1973, as part of the River Dearne Improvement Scheme. A little further on, the river joins the River Dearne. The total length of this section, including the Blacker Dike, is 7.2 mi and it has catchment area of 9.73 sq mi.|$|E
25|$|A short {{section of}} the river in Chesterfield was once navigable, and may become so again {{as part of a}} {{development}} project, while there are plans to use the course from Rother Valley Country Park to Rotherham for the Rother Link, which would connect the Chesterfield Canal to the River Don Navigation. The lower river is managed because of flood risk: three regulators can restrict its flow. Their operation normally causes flooding of <b>washlands,</b> rather than of centres of population, which might otherwise be inundated.|$|R
50|$|Two key environments meet in Besthorpe. To {{the north}} and east the East Nottinghamshire Sandlands are an {{increasingly}} rare habitat supporting grass heaths, bracken, gorse and broom with mixed small-scale plantations of birch, oak and Scots pine. The River Fleet and the fields to the west are part of the Trent <b>Washlands</b> which provide the village with its River Meadowlands landscape of meadow and river pastures, extensive grasslands and meandering river channels. More detailed commentary {{can be found on the}} website of our local Newark and Sherwood District Council.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007 the Avenue <b>Washlands</b> Nature Reserve near Chesterfield {{was opened}} and won {{first place in}} the Conservation {{category}} for Restoration Sites in the British Trust for Ornithology’s Business Bird Challenge. In the same year, a Lottery grant allowed the trust to extend its educational programme with Grounds for a Change, transforming Derbyshire school grounds into wildlife havens and outdoor learning spaces. It also took over management of Drakelow Nature Reserve in the south of the county, an important wetland site playing host to over 200 species of birds.|$|R
