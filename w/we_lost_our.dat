500|$|Our Lieutenant-Colonel fell killed {{almost at}} the first; beyond this <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> Major, and indeed all the Officers but three... We had crossed two {{successive}} ditches, which lay in an orchard {{to the left of}} the first houses in Leuthen; and were beginning to form in front of the village. [...] But there was no standing of it. Besides a general cannonade such as can hardly be imagined, there was a rain of case-shot upon this Battalion, of which I, as there was no Colonel left, had to take command.|$|E
500|$|The {{extensive}} use of forest roads through conifer plantations has been another criticism: {{the authors of the}} Lonely Planet guidebook, Walking in Ireland, found, [...] "The Way's one shortcoming is the character of the walking [...] you'll become all too familiar with forest tracks and roads through conifer plantations [...] where they're surrounded by tall, dense forest they're not particularly interesting". Similarly, Paul Gosling, who walked the Way for The Independent, found that, [...] "While the long distance path is, on occasion, very attractive, {{it is not so much}} hazardous as unadventurous. [...] Over the next four and a half days, <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> enthusiasm for conifers [...] The views were restricted and there was little sign of wildlife". In The Irish Times John G. O'Dwyer described them as [...] "gloomy trails through invading armies of monoculture [...] as memorable as a motorway median".|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{first hit}} the trails in Iowa. His {{strategy}} in the state was {{to spend more time}} there than any other candidate, emphasizing that he [...] "intend to win Iowa" [...] because of his midwest roots. He commented on fiscal responsibility at an event in a Des Moines suburb stating that [...] "Republicans went to Washington and <b>we</b> <b>lost</b> <b>our</b> way" [...] because [...] "we tried to spend [...] like Democrats." [...] He introduced a health care platform that emphasized prevention and called for reforms in the current system to ensure that all Americans be covered in the future. In the financial sphere of the campaign, Thompson acknowledged that he could not compete with funds being raised by the upper-tiered candidates, but he stated that he did not intend to do so because his campaign was [...] "different" [...] than the others; according to Thompson, his was more centered around a strong ground organization in Iowa.|$|E
