Mr. Nicholson believes that; and I, who know more of the circumstances than he does, believe also that Mr. James Smith stole away from Darrock Hall in the night under fear of being indicted for bigamy. But if I can't find him--if I can't prove him to be alive--if I can't account for those spots of blood on the night-gown, the accidental circumstances of the case remain unexplained--your mistress's rash language, the bad terms on which she has lived with her husband, and her unlucky disregard of appearances in keeping up her intercourse with Mr. Meeke, all tell dead against us--and the justice has no alternative, in a legal point of view, but to remand you both, as he has now done, for the production of further evidence." ...|$|E

The twelve competing HouseGuests were set to be revealed on July 5, five days before the series premiered. Despite this, Entertainment Weekly leaked the cast the day prior. The HouseGuests entered the house on July 6. On the new cast, Shapiro stated [...] "I don’t want to insult last year’s cast, but this group is gonna make bathing-suit time worth watching ... we have some hot single moms a gay man who is not hairy like Bunky." [...] He later elaborated, stating [...] "I would say, speaking of eye candy, I would say everybody's sweet tooth in America will be more than satiated."

40|$|International audienceThe most {{commonly}} used method for dose-finding, the 3 + 3, has poor performances. New adaptive designs are more efficient. Nevertheless, they have reached a maximum performance level, and further improvement requires either larger sample sizes, or outcomes measures richer than the simplistic severe toxicity measured at cycle 1. Body In this issue of Clinical Cancer Research, Yan et al. (1) propose a new adaptive dose-finding method, termed Keyboard {{as an alternative to}} the 3 + 3 design. The performance of the {{most commonly}} used dose-finding method, the 3 + 3, is disappointing: The chance of finding the correct dose in a phase I trial is no more than 40 % (1). How many active, potentially promising agents are dropped due to incorrect dose selection during development? Few researches address this question (2), but stakeholders acknowledge the limitations of early phase trials (3). The statistical community unanimously agrees that the 3 + 3 is not an efficient method, raising ethical concerns according to NIH guidelines (4) and alternatives should be implemented. Keyboard combines simplicity, performance and flexibility. Simplicity for two reasons: (i) it is based on a natural definition of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), i. e., the dose at which the risk of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is within a predefined range (typically 20 – 35 %), and (ii) the decision rules to (de) escalate are driven by the accumulated observations, and the observed proportion of DLT at a given dose level. The more patients enrolled at a specific dose, the more confident <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> this dose is (close to) the MTD, and the more likely the same dose is recommended for the next patients...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into several proposed ways of increasing the supply of organs for transplantation purposes. It starts from a consideration of two sorts of donors which are already in use: humans declared dead according to brain-based criteria and nonhuman animals. In the first chapter I attempt to provide a theoretical underpinning for the brainstem criterion of brain death. I also criticise certain rival theories. In the second chapter I consider what constraints govern what we may do to the newly dead body - the fact that someone is dead does not mean we may treat their corpse as we please. I consider Professor John Harris' strong `opting out' policy, and argue against it. I briefly discuss other alternatives to the UK's present `opting in' system - `presumed consent' and `required request'. And I consider the problems generated by the proposed use as donors of another category of human cadaver - people declared dead according to cardiorespiratory criteria. The third chapter is {{an investigation into}} xenotransplantation - the use of organs from nonhuman animals. I argue that using animals `just because' they are animals is ethically indefensible. Instead I attempt to justify the killing of (some) animals as organ donors {{on the grounds that}} their interest in continued life is weaker than that of a human. But this has some counterintuitive implications concerning arational members of our species. In the final chapter I discuss the possible use of the `worst off' category of arational humans - the permanently and irreversibly unconscious. I argue that we have moral obligations to these people which do not stem only from a consideration of their interest in life. However, I think that we may use such people as donors under specialised conditions: if we are as certain as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> they are irreversibly unconscious, if their family (and ideally the donor too) have requested it, and so long as it can be done without distress to the public. Under no other circumstances do I think humans ought to be killed for organs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
