25|$|A learned man, Hungerford placed much {{emphasis}} on education.

25|$|Stewart's {{family on}} both sides had deep {{military}} roots, as both grandfathers had fought in the Civil War, {{and his father had}} served during both the Spanish–American War and World War I. Stewart considered his father to be the biggest influence on his life, so it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that, when another war came, he too was willing to serve. Members of his family had previously been in the infantry, but Stewart chose to become a flier.|$|E
25|$|Given his and Nero's relationship, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> when Britannicus died {{just before}} his fourteenth birthday. Britannicus criticized Nero's singing voice, and {{referred}} to his adoptive brother by his original name of Lucius Domitius. In favoring Nero, Claudius sealed the fate of his son, and perhaps his own. Ominously for Agrippina, Seneca and Burrus did not complain: either they had been bought off, or regarded Britannicus' death as inevitable given his relationship with Nero. Instead, they concentrated on growing their influence with Nero.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Obama, McCain did well throughout rural Virginia. He won {{the vast majority}} of its counties. In the part of Virginia protruding out west, Obama ran roughly even with Kerry, even though he comfortably won the election and Kerry lost. This area, save for one county and a few small towns, uniformly supported McCain. In addition, a number of unionized, Appalachian counties located next to Kentucky voted Republican; they had cast strong ballots for Bill Clinton. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as this part of Virginia is a part of Appalachia, a region in which Obama consistently struggled {{during the course of the}} Democratic primary.|$|E

25|$|UPN quietly ceased {{operations}} on Friday, September 15, 2006, with its usual airing of WWE Friday Night SmackDown; in addition, some stations aired the network's usual, but optional, weekend repeat block. The low-key closure <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given that in nine media markets, including the three largest, UPN {{was not available}} because the local affiliates were owned by Fox Television Stations and switched to its new network, MyNetworkTV, on September 5. UPN programs stopped airing on WPWR (channel 50) in Chicago and KUTP (channel 45) in Phoenix on September 1, {{and on the other}} seven Fox-owned stations (including WWOR-TV (channel 9) in New York City and KCOP (channel 13) in Los Angeles) the day before, August 31.|$|E
25|$|On April 5, 2007, Kirk Kerkorian made a $4.58billion {{bid for the}} Chrysler Group, the U.S. arm of Daimler-Chrysler. After Daimler-Chrysler {{announced}} {{they were interested in}} selling the Chrysler division on February 14, large investors such as Cerberus Capital Management, The Blackstone Group and Magna International each announced intentions to bid on the company. Kerkorian's bid, while not expected, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> given his long involvement in the U.S. automobile industry. During the bidding process, he sought the aid of his close associate Jerome York who was a former CFO at both Chrysler and IBM. On May 14, 2007 80% of the Chrysler arm of Daimler-Chrysler was sold to Cerberus for $7.4billion.|$|E
25|$|When she {{was about}} six years old, Edith and her sister Mary were sent to Romsey Abbey, near Southampton in {{southern}} England, where their maternal aunt Cristina was abbess. During her stay at Romsey and, some time before 1093, at Wilton Abbey, both institutions known for learning, the Scottish princess was much sought-after as a bride; refusing proposals from William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey, and Alan Rufus, Lord of Richmond. Hériman of Tournai claimed that William Rufus considered marrying her. Her education went beyond the standard feminine pursuits. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> as {{her mother was a}} great lover of books. Her daughters learned English, French, and some Latin, and were sufficiently literate to read St. Augustine and the Bible.|$|E

25|$|Bader's {{aircraft}} was not found. It {{is likely that}} it came down at Mont Dupil Farm near the French village of Blaringhem, possibly near Desprez sawmill. A French witness, Jacques Taffin, saw the Spitfire disintegrating as it came down. He thought it {{had been hit by}} anti-aircraft fire, but none was active in the area. There were also no Spitfire remains in the area. The lack of any remains <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> owing to the Spitfire breaking up on its descent. Historians have also been misled as to the whereabouts of the Spitfire because of a mistake in the book Reach for the Sky, in which Bader stated his leg had been dug out from the wreckage but was damaged, indicating a definite crash site. Bader's leg had actually been found in an open field.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{mistakes}} of its commanders, Kaunitz {{with no more than}} 25,000 Coalition soldiers was able to defeat a 53,000-strong French army. On the 13th, Charbonnier's divisions baked bread at Fontaine-l'Evêque and stood idle at Mont-Sainte-Geneviève, leaving Desjardin and his 35,000 troops to do all the fighting. Without attempting any maneuver, Desjardin and his generals threw their soldiers, with no shoes, wet powder and shabby uniforms into the assault against enemies well-protected by solid fieldworks. The French troops lacked support from heavy cannons and had to contend with the superior Austrian cavalry, so it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that they were beaten. Around mid-day on 15 May, Kaunitz launched an attack to recapture some positions on the south bank of the Sambre. After three hours of skirmishing and artillery duels, the thwarted Austrian general withdrew his forces.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s {{a strong}} rivalry grew with North Melbourne and {{they met in}} three grand finals with the Hawks {{prevailing}} twice. The 1976 Grand Final team {{was inspired by the}} illness of former Captain Peter Crimmins who died 3 days after the victory from cancer, and by the humiliating defeat of the 1975 Grand Final loss to the North Melbourne Kangaroos. The Hawks greats such as the prolific goal-kicker Michael Moncrieff, rover Leigh Matthews, ruck rover Michael Tuck, ruckman Don Scott, full back Kelvin Moore and centre half-back Peter Knights played through this era. The Hawthorn North Melbourne clash was a close encounter, but injuries to champions such as Keith Greig and Brent Crosswell made North’s chances of winning difficult. However, when Hawthorn looked threatened, they replied quickly and kept their lead intact. The forward line won the day and as a result it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that John Hendrie was voted best on ground by radio and newspapers of the day.|$|E

25|$|In {{the result}} only Hardang was of purely Halethian blood, and some {{wanted him to}} be elected Chieftain after Handir; other great-grandsons of Halmir took pride in their kinship with the House of Hador. By the law of the Folk of Brethil all of Brandir, Hardang, Túrin, Hunthor and Manthor had equal rights to become the Halad, but by {{tradition}} Brandir was chosen as of the eldest male line. After the coming of Turambar and revelation of his true name, fame and power, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that he came to lead the Folk, if unofficially. However, when Brandir, Túrin and Hunthor were all slain in one day, the question of chieftainship arose again. This time Hardang was elected, but Manthor had nearly equal following. The shadow brought by Húrin he used to instigate a revolt, and in the end Hardang was slain. However, Manthor was not elected as Avranc killed him two days after.|$|E
25|$|Yash {{agrees to}} help Nandita on the {{condition}} she leaves Prithvi, but she refuses his help and decides to stay with Prithvi and visit Kalindi {{to find out the}} truth. Prithvi and Nandita spend the night in a guest house, where Nandita is possessed once again. The spirit leads her to a forest where she is repeatedly attacked by paranormal beings. She receives visions of people hanging from trees. She then spots a well and somebody standing near it, and goes towards them. Just as she is about to jump, Prithvi catches her. It is revealed that the 'well' was actually the steep edge of a cliff. They arrive at Kalindi and meet the priest's wife (who is living life as a prostitute) who tells them that it was her husband who was evil and his death <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising,</b> considering the crimes he had committed against innocent people in the name of religion. They decide to go to the police inspectors' house (the same one who investigated David Coopers' suicide), where they find him completely crazy and are unable to prevent him from committing suicide.|$|E
25|$|Street and {{his wife}} Narcissa Vanderlip were from wealthy families. She was the {{daughter}} of Frank and Narcissa Cox Vanderlip, who lived at Beechwood in Briarcliff Manor; Vanderlip was the president of the National City Bank from 1909 to 1919. Narcissa Vanderlip attended the Scarborough School, graduated from Vassar College in 1925, and {{was a member of the}} Junior League; while her husband, Julian Street Jr., graduated from Princeton University in 1925 where he was the editorial chairman for The Daily Princetonian—by 1925, he was on the staff of The New York Herald Tribune. Julian Street Jr. was the son of notable author Julian Street, who wrote such works as Abroad at Home (1914), Mysterious Japan (1921), Rita Coventry (1922), and Where Paris Dines (1929). Street Jr. was working as a scriptwriter for NBC, where he adapted Booth Tarkington's Penrod for broadcasting, the first popular book to be formatted for broadcast purposes. Both Narcissa and Julian Street Jr. were the children of wealthy Gilded Age American families, and it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprising</b> that they later married. Their parents were connected, as Frank Vanderlip, Narcissa's father, knew Julian Street Jr.'s father since the Bank Panic of 1907, when Frank helped Street keep his money safe with National City Bank. The Streets were married in April 1927 in a lavish ceremony at the New Church, a Georgian building on 35th Street in New York City; at their reception, held at the Colony Club, more than 1,500 guests attended, including Goulds, Vanderbilts and Roosevelts. After their marriage, Edward Walker Harden, a Briarcliff Manor estate owner and longtime friend of Frank Vanderlip, gave land on the east side of Sleepy Hollow Road in Briarcliff Manor to the Streets. The Streets, however, preferred the land that was already owned by the Vanderlips on Long Hill Road West, which was more private and secluded, so they sold the land given by Harden. According to a map from October 6, 1937, Street's mother-in-law owned the land on which the Streets' new house, designed by Wallace K. Harrison, was built.|$|E
