5|$|It {{is claimed}} that the word orange has no true rhyme. There are, however, several half rhymes or near-rhymes, {{as well as some}} proper nouns and {{compound}} <b>words</b> <b>or</b> phrases that rhyme with it. This lack of rhymes has inspired many humorous poems and songs.|$|E
5|$|About 1% of school-age {{children}} and adolescents have Tourette's. It was once considered a rare and bizarre syndrome, most often associated with coprolalia (the utterance of obscene <b>words</b> <b>or</b> socially inappropriate and derogatory remarks), but this symptom is present in only {{a small minority of}} people with Tourette's. The condition was named by Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893) on behalf of his resident, Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904), a French physician and neurologist, who published an account of nine patients with Tourette's in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Coprolalia (the {{spontaneous}} utterance {{of socially}} objectionable or taboo <b>words</b> <b>or</b> phrases) {{is the most}} publicized symptom of Tourette's, {{but it is not}} required for a diagnosis of Tourette's and only about 10% of Tourette's patients exhibit it. Echolalia (repeating the words of others) and palilalia (repeating one's own words) occur in a minority of cases, while the most common initial motor and vocal tics are, respectively, eye blinking and throat clearing.|$|E
5000|$|An anagram {{is direct}} <b>word</b> switch <b>or</b> <b>word</b> play, {{the result of}} rearranging the letters of a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase to produce a new <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase, using all the {{original}} letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into [...] "nag a ram".|$|R
5000|$|... "Connotation" [...] {{branches}} into {{a mixture}} of different meanings. These could include the contrast of a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase with its primary, literal meaning (known as a denotation), with what that <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase specifically denotes. The connotation essentially relates to how anything {{may be associated with}} a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase, for example, an implied value judgement or feelings.|$|R
50|$|In {{generative}} linguistics, especially syntax, {{an asterisk}} {{in front of}} a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase indicates that the <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase is not used because it is ungrammatical.|$|R
5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English <b>words</b> <b>or</b> abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other <b>words</b> <b>or</b> morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E
5|$|Many Māori {{place names}} possess either {{historical}} or mythological significance. Their meaning {{is not always}} apparent from literal translations {{and they have been}} passed down through oral tradition. Before European arrival, place names commemorated notable or historical incidents, described features of the location or were derived from traditional Hawaiki names or myths. After European arrival many locations became known as Māori versions of European <b>words</b> <b>or</b> poorly pronounced contractions of the original Māori names.|$|E

50|$|When {{teaching}} self-hypnosis, a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase {{should be}} stated {{to the patient}} for them to repeat. This will not work unless the patient deliberately uses the <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase to hypnotize themselves.|$|R
5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to involve {{some aspect of}} language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processingthe processing of real <b>words),</b> <b>or</b> activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.|$|E
5|$|Poetry uses {{forms and}} {{conventions}} to suggest differential interpretation to <b>words,</b> <b>or</b> to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly figures of speech such as metaphor, simile and metonymy create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Stuttering (alalia syllabaris), {{also known}} as {{stammering}} (alalia literalis or anarthria literalis), is a speech disorder in which the flow of speech is disrupted by involuntary repetitions and prolongations of sounds, syllables, <b>words</b> <b>or</b> phrases, and involuntary silent pauses or blocks during which the person who stutters is unable to produce sounds. The exact etiology of stuttering is unknown; both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute. There are many treatments and speech-language pathology techniques available that may help increase fluency in some stutterers {{to the point where}} an untrained ear cannot identify a problem; however, there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present.|$|E

5|$|The {{output of}} a SGD may be {{digitized}} and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded <b>words</b> <b>or</b> phrases while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits {{the user to}} speak novel messages by typing new words. Today, individuals {{use a combination of}} recorded messages and text-to-speech techniques on their SGDs. However, some devices are limited to only one type of output.|$|E
5|$|These symbols {{describe}} {{the features of}} a language above the level of individual consonants and vowels, such as prosody, tone, length, and stress, which often operate on syllables, <b>words,</b> <b>or</b> phrases: that is, elements such as the intensity, pitch, and gemination of {{the sounds of a}} language, as well as the rhythm and intonation of speech. Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E
5|$|After {{only one}} {{professional}} fight, Woodhouse returned to football in November 2006, signing for Rushden & Diamonds, who were {{playing in the}} Conference National, the highest-tier of non-league football. His boxing licence was suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control, following a conviction for assaulting a police officer whilst drunk and of using threatening, abusive or insulting <b>words</b> <b>or</b> behaviour in April 2006, {{when he was still}} playing for Grimsby Town, and not under the BBBofC's jurisdiction {{at the time of the}} incident. He was ordered to pay £100 compensation to PC Andrew Whitehead and £350 in costs. Woodhouse chose to play for Rushden & Diamonds to fulfil a promise he made to someone who was part of the consortium that took over the Irthlingborough based club. He made his debut against Aldershot Town on 25 November 2006, in a 1–0 defeat. He made five appearances in the Conference National for Rushden, before deciding to leave to concentrate on his boxing career.|$|E

5000|$|In {{some models}} of {{phonology}} {{as well as}} morphophonology {{in the field of}} linguistics, the underlying representation (UR) or underlying form (UF) of a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> morpheme is the abstract form that a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> morpheme is postulated to have before any phonological rules have applied to it. [...] By contrast, a surface representation is the phonetic representation of the <b>word</b> <b>or</b> sound. The concept of an underlying representation is central to generative grammar.|$|R
5|$|He {{was convicted}} of assaulting a police officer and of using threatening, abusive or {{insulting}} <b>words</b> <b>or</b> behaviour in April 2006. As a result, he had his boxing licence suspended for five months by the British Boxing Board of Control, despite the incident happening before he was under the BBBofC's jurisdiction. Woodhouse returned to football in November 2006, joining Rushden & Diamonds in the Conference National before moving to Mansfield Town in January 2009. After leaving them, he moved to Harrogate Town. At the end of February 2010, he joined Sheffield in the Northern Premier League. Before {{the start of the}} 2011–12 football season, he moved up two divisions in the football league system when he joined Conference North outfit Eastwood Town.|$|E
5|$|His {{works on}} Shakespeare were devoted {{not merely to}} Shakespeare, but to {{understanding}} literature as a whole; in his Preface to Shakespeare, Johnson rejects the previous dogma of the classical unities and argues that drama should be faithful to life. However, Johnson did not only defend Shakespeare; he discussed Shakespeare's faults, including his lack of morality, his vulgarity, his carelessness in crafting plots, and his occasional inattentiveness when choosing <b>words</b> <b>or</b> word order. As well as direct literary criticism, Johnson emphasised the need to establish a text that accurately reflects what an author wrote. Shakespeare's plays, in particular, had multiple editions, each of which contained errors caused by the printing process. This problem was compounded by careless editors who deemed difficult words incorrect, and changed them in later editions. Johnson believed that an editor should not alter the text in such a way.|$|E
5|$|On Saint Lucia, wakes {{are held}} on the first and eighth night after a person has died, in {{contrast}} to other Caribbean islands, which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days. Wakes often include music, such as the singing of hymns and drumming. Traditional music for wakes is performed {{both inside and outside}} of the deceased's house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and sankeys (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called kont. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last <b>words</b> <b>or</b> events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélè, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka.|$|E
50|$|Dittography is the accidental, {{erroneous}} act {{of repeating}} a letter, <b>word,</b> phrase <b>or</b> combination of letters by a scribe or copyist. The term {{is used in}} the field of textual criticism. The opposite phenomenon, in which a copyist omits text by skipping from a <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase to a similar <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase further on, is known as haplography.|$|R
50|$|An {{asterisk}} {{before a}} parenthesis {{indicates that the}} lack of the <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase inside is ungrammatical, while an asterisk after the opening bracket of the parenthesis indicates that the existence of the <b>word</b> <b>or</b> phrase inside is ungrammatical.|$|R

5|$|Regulations for the {{performance}} of the national anthem are set forth in the law signed by President Putin on 25 December 2000. While a performance of the anthem may include only music, only <b>words,</b> <b>or</b> a combination of both, the anthem must be performed using the official music and words prescribed by law. Once a performance has been recorded, it may be used for any purpose, such as in a radio or television broadcast. The anthem may be played for solemn or celebratory occasions, such as the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow, or the funerals of heads of state and other significant figures. When asked about playing the anthem during the Victory Day parades, Defense Minister Anatoliy Serdyukov stated that because of the acoustics of the Red Square, only an orchestra would be used because voices would be swallowed by the echo.|$|E
5|$|The four {{canonical}} gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are {{the foremost}} {{sources for the}} life and message of Jesus. However, {{other parts of the}} New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23. Acts of the Apostles (Acts 10:37–38 and Acts 19) refers to the early ministry of Jesus and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1–11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus (also mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16) than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the gospels, the <b>words</b> <b>or</b> instructions of Jesus are cited several times (1 Corinthians 7:10–11, 9:14, 11:23–25, 2 Corinthians 12:9).|$|E
5|$|Following this, {{the player}} is offered {{a choice of}} eight minigames to test their {{knowledge}} of the words given in the lesson. These minigames are Multiple Choice, Hit-A-Word, Word Find, Flash Cards, Fill in the Blank, Memory, Bridge Builder, and Spelltastic. In Multiple Choice, the player must select the correct French or Spanish translation of an English word from four choices in a limited time frame. Hit-A-Word is a Whac-A-Mole game in which the player must hit the most amount of moles with the correct translation of an English word within the allotted time. Word Find is a word search in which the player must find the French or Spanish translations of a set of English <b>words</b> <b>or</b> phrases. In Flash Cards, the player is given a French or Spanish word and must choose the card with the proper English translation. In Memory, the player must select from a set of face-down cards a French or Spanish word and its English translation. Bridge Builder tests sentence structure; the player has to construct a proper sentence from a set of given words. In Spelltastic, the player listens to a French or Spanish word and spells it using a keyboard within the allotted time. For Fill-in-the-Blank, the player selects the proper conjugation of a French or Spanish verb within a sentence.|$|E
