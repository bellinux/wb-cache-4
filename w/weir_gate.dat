50|$|Stoplogs are {{hydraulic}} engineering control {{elements that are}} used in floodgates to adjust the water level or discharge in a river, canal, or reservoir. Stoplogs are sometimes confused with flashboards, as both elements are used in bulkhead or crest gates. Stoplogs are typically long rectangular timber beams or boards that are placed {{on top of each other}} and dropped into premade slots inside a <b>weir,</b> <b>gate,</b> or channel. Present day, the process of adding and removing stoplogs is not manual, but done with hydraulic stop log lifters and hoists. Since the height of the barrier can only be adjusted through the addition and removal of stoplogs, finding a lighter and stronger material other than wood or concrete became a more desirable choice. Other materials, including steel and composites, can be used as stoplogs as well. Stoplogs are designed to cut off or stop flow through a conduit.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Because of {{the fairly}} simple {{equations}} for accurate flow measurement and controlling the water level, weir and gate method is more useful than the separate <b>weir,</b> <b>gate</b> and partial flume methods. Since {{the flowing water}} in the channel always contains sediment particles and floating debris, they are deposited at the gate inlets and behind the weirs which reduces {{the size of the}} channel in the structure range and which reduces some problems such as neighboring land flooding due to overflow of water from the channel banks, threatening the structure stability and reducing the measurement accuracy. Using a combination of weir- gate model, in comparison with other conventional devices, will make it possible to get the actual conditions closer two main hypotheses derived from the relations and accurately measure the discharge coefficient. In this model, the deposited materials are easily passed through the gates and the suspended debris are easily passed over the weirs. One of the combined weir- gate structures is semi cylindrical weir- gate structure. Regarding about the form of the combined weir- gate structures, it has some advantages, including simple design, sediments and floating material flow, high flow discharge coefficient compared with other replaceable structures and its being economic. Semi Cylindrical gate turning around center Axis, for reason of rotation the center becomes Conversion to wire, wire gate with opening with different height. Materials and Methods: The experiments were conducted in a rectangular flume with the length of 8 m, width of 0. 282 m and height of 0. 3 m in Soil Conservation and Watershed Management Research Institute. In this research, PVC pipes were used as semi cylindrical gate structures. The experiments were conducted for three diameters 70, 120 and 160 mm with height of the opening between zeros until radius, angles zero, 30, 45, 60 and 90 degree and differently discharging. Experiments were performed at a discharge limit of 2 - 27 l/s. In order to decrease turbulence of the flow, the gate was installed at the end 4 m of the flume. The ratio of cylindrical structure diameter to channel width (D/B) was in the range of 0. 25 to 0. 57 and the Froude number was in the range of 0. 08 to 0. 55. Results and Discussion: Coefficient discharge of semi cylindrical structure and then dimensionless parameters of [H/P], [a/H], [/H] and [Fr] against the discharge coefficient in the studied gate opening between zero until radius were investigated. According to result with decrease dimensionless parameter of a/H, discharge coefficient increased, So that the maximum Coefficient discharge rate of angle 90 degrees and minimum angle 0 degrees. Also in a constant of a/H for the curvature of the downstream and upstream, with increasing the diameter of semi cylinder, discharge coefficient remains and has no change, shows that changes in diameter of semi cylinder have no significant impact on discharge coefficient. With increasing H/P for both curves upstream and the downstream, discharge coefficient increased. Also in a constant of H/P for the curvature of the downstream and upstream, with increasing the diameter of semi cylinder, discharge coefficient remains. With constant of angles with increasing Freud for all angles, both the curvature of the downstream and upstream, /H decreased. Also in a constant of Freud and angles, with increasing the diameter of semi cylinder, /H remains. According to the result, discharge coefficient of semi cylindrical gates varies, in Experimental limit, from 0. 45 to 1. 45 which is more than that of sluice gates reported by the USBR. One of the reasons, this is ascribed to this is the difference between the amount of entrance, head loss in this structure, because when the flow approaches cylindrical gate, due to curvedness of the wall upstream, a gradual gathering of flow lines gives the aerodynamic method to entrance section, thus decreasing resistance against the flow and entrance head loss and increasing discharge coefficient. However, in sluice gates the vertical wall in entrance section is conducive to fast gathering of flow line, thereby increasing resistance against flow, increasing entrance head loss, and decreasing discharge coefficient relative to a semi cylindrical method. Conclusion: The results showed that increasing Froude coefficient and decreasing the a/H (ratio of gate opening to upstream water depth) dimensionless parameter decrease, respectively increase the discharge coefficient and decrease head loss in all aspects of structural alignment. Within addition by increasing the H/P dimensionless parameter (ratio of upstream water depth to structure diameter) discharge coefficient increased. Results showed that the maximum and minimum values of discharge coefficient are related respectively to 90 degree and 0 degree angle...|$|E
40|$|The Meuse in the Netherlands is {{since the}} 1920 s dammed by 7 weirs, which are located near Borgharen, Linne, Roermond, Belfeld, Sambeek, Grave and Lith. The weirs {{regulate}} the water {{levels in the}} canal sections (=stuwpanden) to provide sufficient depth for navigation. The management of the weirs is regulated by water level measurements at Maastricht St. Pieter (formerly Borgharen). The weirs dam the river for discharges lower than 1200 m 3 /s. For higher discharges the weirs are completely opened. Weir Linne is the oldest weir of the canalized Meuse and {{is part of the}} smallest canal section (=kanaalpand) of the Meuse. The weir consists just like the weirs of Roermond, Belfeld and Sambeek of two parts, a rough discharge regulating Poirée part and a accurate regulating Stoney part. Weir Linne maintains a water level of 20. 80 m +NAP in the upper canal section. The canal section forms a navigable interchange between the Juliana Kanaal, Lateraal Kanaal, Kanaal Wessem-Nederweert and canal section Roermond. The weirs in the Dutch part of the Meuse have been constructed for a period between 80 and 100 years. The weirs are approaching the end of their lifetime in the period between 2020 and 2030. In this situation is not spoken about design lifetime because in the period when the weirs were constructed the design lifetime was not defined. Based on maintenance reports and inspections it is concluded that the weirs are not able to fulfill their functions properly, they need to be replaced or upgraded. The main reasons for replacement or upgrading are technical and functional aging and changing legislations. According to Rijkswaterstaat the weir of Linne has ended its lifespan in the year 2030. Aging of materials and changes in the ARBO legislations are issues of the weir. This conclusions is the result of inspections and analyzes over several years. Besides aging of materials also aging in functionality contributes to the decrease of the weir quality. The functionality of the weirs has been changed in time due to changing conditions, in the RINK project called "new risks". These functional changes can have their causes in changes of design assumptions, maintenance, usability and controllability or law and regulations. The weir of Linne has to deal with the risks of changing discharges, ASR degradation, operability and the weir does not meet the ARBO regulations. This graduation report is focused on the problems of weir of Linne. The aim of this thesis research is to improve the situation of weir Linne for the future situation by replacing of upgrading the weir. The weir should meet the requirements based on discharge and navigational purposes in the future. This report is made up at four scale levels, the problem is approached from a high scale level to lower scale levels. The levels are made up according to the elementary design cycle. The first scale level concerns the canalized Meuse in the Netherlands. Because canal section Linne is relatively small It is investigated if it is possible to remove weir Linne instead of renewing or upgrading of the weir. The second scale level focuses on canal section Linne. In this section the effect of the Maasplassen with respect to the water level changes of the canal section is investigated for high and low discharges. Also the effect of the water level changes to the weir management is investigated to obtain a clear view about the reaction time of weir operations with regard to opening and closure of the weir. The third design level concerns the construction of weir Linne. It is considered if according to the RINK reports the current weir construction should be renewed or upgraded. The chapter proceeds with a rough analysis about the required width and retaining height of the weir to obtain if the discharge capacity of the current weir is sufficient for the future. It is decided to upgrade the Poirée part of the weir, the last part of this design level concerns the determination of a new gate type for the Poirée part of the weir. The lowest design level is focusing on the design of the new <b>weir</b> <b>gate.</b> The gate is designed in high strength concrete. The dimensions of the gate elements are determined and the gate is checked to the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The last section of the lowest design level concerns the way of placing and connecting the new gate to the current construction. The result of the first design level is that abolishing canal section Linne by combining the canal section with the upstream or downstream canal sections is not advisable. Weir and weir section Linne should be maintained in the future. This hold also for the other canal sections of the Meuse corridor except for canal section Lith. Because this canal section is the most downstream section in the Meuse canalization and far away from Linne, interventions to this canal section would have no effect on weir and canal section Linne. However the result holds for the current layout of the Meuse corridor. If a new layout should be proposed for the canalization of the Meuse it should be analyzed if weir Linne should be maintained or removed. The Maasplassen have a damping effect on the water level changes in canal section Linne. The damping effect is the effect of the relation between the changing discharge with respect to the water level changes in the canal section. Due to the Maasplassen the water level changes develop more slowly compared to a situation without the Maasplassen. This {{is the result of the}} storage capacity of the Maasplassen. The damping effect of the Maasplassen is most preferable and effective during low discharges. Navigational dept is maintained for a longer period because the water level decrease proceeds slowly due to the connected lakes. The discharge accuracy of the weir is not sufficient for the small discharges in the future, to maintain the navigable depth during low discharges the discharge accuracy should be increased. The damping has less effect on extreme high discharges compared to low discharges. Because the canal section is relatively small the water level rise will be relatively quick regardless of the damping effect of the Maasplassen. An increase of the storage capacity of the Maasplassen has a minor influence on this effect. However, the banks and retention areas are omitted in the analysis of the effects of the Maasplassen to the water level changes in canal section Linne. The results are not exact however, relative to each other the variants do represent a clear view about the effect of the Maasplassen to the water level changes. The opening procedure shorter than 8 hours is reliable after high discharges are measured at measure point Maastricht St. Pieter. Investigations on running times of flood waves on the Meuse have been done are not valid any more. Due to the Grensmaasproject running times for food waves will change. It is not advisable according to the RINK (=Risico Inventarisatie Natte Kunstwerken) report to replace the total weir of Linne at the moment. It is advised to monitor the condition of the weir until the period 2030 - 2035 and to take after this period a final decision. After this period a decision should be made to replace the or maintain the current weir for a longer period. In this report is concluded to maintain the current weir construction instead constructing a new weir. Due to over dimensioning the concrete super construction is a robust construction. The upgrade of the current weir will be done by the removal of the Poirée gates and constructing a new gate on the old Poirée part. The Poirée gate does not meet the requirements according to the ARBO legislations and the gate is not able to be remote controlled. The new type of weir that is chose to replace the old Poirée gates is the inflatable flap gate. The flap gate is able to retain a the required water level, able to close the old Poirée part without large reconstruction of the weir. The gate fulfills (when properly designed) the ARBO legislations and is able to be remote controlled. The flap gate is designed in concrete class C 90 / 105, this is a high strength concrete. High strength concrete is a durable construction material and requires less maintenance compared to steel constructions, especially in wet environments. The gate will be supported three air filled bladders, the bladders are placed next to each other. The concrete construction meets the requirements according to Eurocode 2. The checks of reinforcement, cracks and moment of failure are done for bending moments and shear resulting of loads perpendicular to the gate. Torsion due to for example failure of bladders is not taken into account. Checks to the concrete gate with regard to moments, cracks and failure due to torsion moments are also not taken into account. The gate will be placed as a prefabricated element. The element contains the gate, bladder, chain and supporting bottom plate. The plate is on upstream side placed at the rotation notches of the former Poirée gates and on the downstream side to the weir bottom. The gate could be further optimized, optimization could be done by for example reducing of the gate weight and curving the gate to increase the discharge capacity.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effects of river and {{floodplain}} engineering projects on flooding, a new self-adaptive hydrodynamic scheme for the simulation of two-dimensional river flows is proposed. The depth-averaged motion equations are solved numerically using a fractional step method, in which the convective terms are calculated using the inverse characteristics method and the remaining terms with an explicit method based on a finite difference method. The integration is performed on a dynamically self-adaptive calculus grid, which allows representation of the movable boundary between wetting and drying regions of the basins to follow the effective developments in time and space, of the expansion phenomenon of flood. The proposed procedure allows the grid's dynamic refinement to avoid coordinate transformation {{or the use of}} unstructured grids. The proposed method is simple and allows the thickening of the grid to accommodate the flooding phenomena on the floodplain and to calculate the velocity in the domain regions in which a higher space resolution is required. Therefore, flows running through structures such as <b>weirs,</b> <b>gates,</b> bridges or culverts can be simulated. In the paper two different-case studies, approached with the proposed self-adaptive calculation scheme, are discussed. The studies concern the analysis of the effects of structures, such as roads or embankments, on flooding phenomena in the Tiber and Tanaro basins respectively.

Built by the Turners in 1789, and rescued from dereliction by Derek Pilkington and Chris Aspin in the 1960s, {{it is now}} managed by Lancashire County Council Museums Service and details the changes made in textile technology {{over the last three}} hundred years through the use of interactive displays. Mill ponds, <b>weirs,</b> sluice <b>gates</b> and an aqueduct are also part of the museum as well as a 19th-century working waterwheel, fulling stocks and other machinery associated with the finishing of woollen cloth, an original Arkwright water frame, and a Hargreaves Spinning Jenny. It also houses a museum and bookshop selling, among other things, books on local textile history.|$|R
40|$|Downstream fish passage {{facilities}} at the Holyoke Project were modified {{to enhance the}} passage of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts. A pier extension was installed adjacent to the Holyoke Dam bascule gate, the opening of an experimental weir inserted in the bascule gate was {{moved closer to the}} Hadley Falls Station intakes, and above-water lighting was added. An intake rack overlay was in place at both Hadley Falls Station units {{during the first half of}} this evaluation; the Unit 2 overlay was removed during the second half. Radiotagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts were released upstream of the Project and downstream passage routes were monitored. All releases were conducted after flashboards had been installed on the crest of the dam, closing that passage route. Overall, 63 % of the radiotagged smolts that approached Hadley Falls Station passed over the bascule <b>gate</b> <b>weir</b> and 37 % passed through the turbines. These results were comparable to results obtained in a 1992 evaluation, when a floating guide wall was present upstream of the intakes. Two-thirds of the radiotagged smolts that passed through the turbines at Hadley Falls Station did so through Unit 1. Removal of the Unit 2 intake rack overlay did not affect the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing through the turbines. Combining data from 1992 and 1995, a statistically significant but weak negative relationship between flow through the station and the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing over the bascule gate/weir was found. The louver/bypass system in the Holyoky Canal passed 91 % of the radiotagged smolts entering the canal back to the Hadley Falls Station tailrace. Above-water lighting installed upstream of the canal gatehouse appeared to have raised the proportion of radiotagged smolts entering the canal. When the results of passage through the bascule <b>gate</b> <b>weir</b> and the louver/bypass system were combined, 74 % of the radiotagged smolts passed through downstream passage facilities. Smolts passing through the louver/bypass system or through the turbines arrived at a location downstream of the dam more quickly than smolts that had passed through the bascule <b>gate</b> <b>weir...</b>|$|R
