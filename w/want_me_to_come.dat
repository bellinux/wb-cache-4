500|$|In May 2001, it was {{revealed}} that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut his stay short to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with you?" [...] In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City, for non-small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was publicised, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.|$|E
500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E
2500|$|Michael {{has neither}} {{encouraged}} nor opposed monarchist agitation in Romania and royalist parties have made little impact in post-communist Romanian politics. He takes {{the view that}} the restoration of the monarchy in Romania can only result from a decision by the Romanian people. [...] "If the people <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back, of course, I will come back," [...] he said in 1990. [...] "Romanians have had enough suffering imposed on them {{to have the right to}} be consulted on their future." [...] King Michael's belief is that there is still a role for, and value in, the monarchy today: [...] "We are trying to make people understand what the Romanian monarchy was, and what it can still do" [...] (for them).|$|E
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} twenty minutes later, {{and we were}} {{standing}} together {{at the edge of}} the woods. She <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> the house to take breakfast with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jo <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> {{and tell}} her how you looked, so I did," [...] {{answered}} Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though he half smiled at her maternal tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Treat <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in {{his tent}} for a minute. Can I go?" [...] he asked, in a timid voice, {{and in such}} a low tone as to render it almost inaudible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mitchell doesn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{round the}} rest of the way with him," [...] she said, despondently. [...] "He says I make him nervous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{a little}} walk or something? Why, {{if you make}} such a point of my coming to Griffin, do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> at all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} perhaps you might <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back again," [...] said Ralph;--"and, if so, I could make arrangements;--perhaps {{for a week}} or ten days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well {{we had a}} right nice time together. I {{gave him}} part of my lunch, an' then he <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back with him; but I told him I'd {{got to get to}} the {{telegraph}} office----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That old Miss Panney!" [...] said Phoebe, with a snap. [...] "She sent <b>me</b> {{out here}} <b>to</b> look after Mike, an' was too stingy even {{to pay my}} hack fare. She <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> day before yesterday, but I couldn't get away 'til to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was wrong! I know I was wrong. Somehow {{it was a}} mistake. I don't {{know how}} it arose. But you love <b>me</b> and you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> love you still. That is all I know. I thought you did not, but you do. If you <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'll not go back. I've no friends," [...] said Fan; {{and then}} she added timidly, [...] "You don't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back here no more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} {{that you do not}} <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> I won't," [...] he said rather bluntly, and next second felt that he had made a mistake.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must have}} been very unmerciful to {{despatch}} him so soon. I thought you must <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to your rescue, but those romantic children wouldn't let me.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{they said}} I couldn't, and got mad. But I didn't care. I knew they'd wait. You see, I've been here twenty-five years, and I know the back trails that lead up the mountain, and Charley and Joe didn't know those trails. That's why they <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless your heart, honey, I didn't. It was {{father who}} <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here. His heart {{was set on}} it--why, I don't know. It seems {{perfectly}} ridiculous <b>to</b> think of <b>me</b> studying for a B.A. degree, doesn't it? Not but what I can do it, all right. I have heaps of brains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{always thought}} it was because you knew I wanted a lodgin', though I confess it has puzzled <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make out why you <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> such an out-o'-the-way part o' the city; and, to tell you the truth, it is rather inconvenient, but your letter was so urgent, Miss Ruth, that I knew you must have some good reason, and as your dear father's {{daughter}} has a right <b>to</b> command <b>me,</b> I obeyed, as you know, without question." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You always <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out! We can't go out here; we are out, {{as much as}} we can be!" [...] Verena laughed. She {{tried to}} turn it off--feeling that {{something}} really impended.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Endicotts <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out again," [...] said Laura to Dave. [...] "They want me {{to bring}} you {{along with some of}} your chums, and they {{want me to}} bring Jessie, too, if her folks will let her come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are lying," [...] {{she said}} quite quietly. [...] "You don't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{down to see}} a window. It is {{something}} else. I warn you we are Evangelicals. We don't believe in prayers for the dead. 'As the tree falls--'" ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{went on to}} say, [...] "My father <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{home and}} I went on a visit. There, a cousin of ours, William Franklin, was on a visit at the time. He was on the {{newspaper}} at Coxsackie, New York. It had a job shop attached. He suggested my going there with him. I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{like my own}} house. They've <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up here often enough, but I'm {{satisfied}} where I am. It's {{quiet down}} there, and, when I get through for the day, I can read. And I like to keep my family together. Cynthy and Frank always sleep at home, and Jombateeste eats with me. You remember Jombateeste?" ...|$|R
60|$|Pretty {{soon after}} that I was sick, and used up, and had {{to go off to}} the Hot Springs. When there, I got a good many letters from commanders saying they <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back. I declined, because I wasn't well enough or strong enough; but I kept still, and kept the {{reputation}} I had made.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] She {{expressed}} in this little sound her disappointment, and as it trembled over the wire he spoke quickly: [...] "Please tell me! Do you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down? Never mind the distance--I can ride it in a few hours." ...|$|E
6000|$|Taylor stiffened. [...] "What is it? There's {{no chance}} it could wait?" [...] The calm gray eyes were {{studying}} him, expressionless, unjudging. [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{down to the}} lab," [...] Taylor grumbled, [...] "I suppose I can. I'll get my uniform--" ...|$|E
6000|$|To which Peter replied inscrutably: [...] "Lord, no, never again. I bade her good-bye yesterday. She {{knows what}} I {{think of her}} form. It's very good, but she carries it a little too far. Besides, she didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> and it's {{therefore}} more discreet to keep away from her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{always the}} talk," [...] said Tip-Top. [...] "I'm {{too big for}} the nest, and I want to see the world. It's full of {{beautiful}} things, I know. Now there's the most lovely creature, with bright eyes, that comes under the tree every day, and <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down in the grass and play with her." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Al's {{daughter}} Amy and Tracy {{had grown}} up together and he asked 'How {{would you have done}} it'. So I wrote it out {{on a piece of paper}} and, some time later, he called and <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> over and look at what he'd done. He had erased the place where I'd taken the sample and had put in Tracy's name, instead.|$|R
6000|$|... "One day, {{about a year}} ago, when I {{was quite}} grown up, I met some ladies who lived here at the palace, and they <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home with them, and I did; and I have lived here ever since, and like it very much. They are all very kind, and if I didn't sleep so much, I should be very happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’m coming, too," [...] said Captain Barber, {{with some}} haste; [...] "there’s {{no need to}} stay and wait for trouble. When {{you go into the}} house, come back as though you’d {{forgotten}} something, and sing out to me that you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> too—hard enough for ’er to hear, mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My fellow knows;--he keeps a book. I've got a letter, sir, ever so long, {{from those}} fellows in Lincoln's Inn. They <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{and see you}} about selling something; so I've come. It's an awful bore, because I don't {{understand}} anything about it. Perhaps there isn't anything to be sold. If so I can go away again, you know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother's had {{an awful}} hard time since father died. We {{had to go}} to keeping boarders, which was hard--very hard for mother." [...] The boy felt a {{sympathetic}} lump in his throat as the girl went on again: [...] "But she doesn't complain, and she didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home from school; but of course I couldn't do anything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only to-day. I {{got away}} sooner than I expected. I went to Lowndes Square, {{and they told}} me I should find you here, so I came away as soon as dinner was over. They were {{dressing}} for some grand affair, and <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with them, but of course I must <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see if you had really achieved bringing bright Phoebe from her orbit.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My father <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{into his}} law firm and dabble in real estate on the side," [...] {{recalled}} Whitman. [...] "There was a family row about boxing but nothing like the battle when I told my father I {{was going to be}} an actor. He said, 'If that's the case you're on your own.' No money from him. And he kept his word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was downright jolly; and I won't tell, if you don't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to.</b> Now, <b>come</b> up and have another," [...] said Tom, heartily.|$|R
