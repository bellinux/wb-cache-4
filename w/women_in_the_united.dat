5|$|Cats {{are common}} pets {{throughout}} the world, and their worldwide population exceeds 500million. Although cat guardianship has commonly {{been associated with}} women, a 2007 Gallup poll reported that men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States of America were equally likely to own a cat.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries. Because it is largely asymptomatic in its earliest stages, more than 50% of women have stage III or higher cancer (spread beyond the ovaries) by the time they are diagnosed, with a consequent poor prognosis.|$|E
5|$|Emily Wilding Davison (11 October 1872– 8 June 1913) was a suffragette {{who fought}} for votes for <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom {{in the early twentieth}} century. A member of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and a militant fighter for her cause, she was arrested on nine occasions, went on hunger strike seven times and was force fed on forty-nine occasions. She died after being hit by King George V's horse Anmer at the 1913 Epsom Derby when she walked onto the track during the race.|$|E

5|$|In 1875 no one {{living outside}} {{of two or}} three back streets of Lynn had heard of Christian Science. Now, the very name is a catch phrase. In those early days the leader and teacher paid out half of her ten dollars a week to hire a hall, {{patching}} out the rest of her living with precarious fees as an instructor in mental healing; now, {{she is one of the}} richest <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. She is more than that—she is the most powerful American woman.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response to intervention and outcome.|$|E
5|$|Mary Brewster Hazelton (November 23, 1868– September 13, 1953) was an American {{portrait}} painter. She {{attended the}} School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, {{where she was}} later an instructor. Among her other achievements, Hazelton {{was the first woman}} to win an award open to both men and <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States when she won the Hallgarten Prize from the National Academy of Design in 1896. Her portrait paintings are in the collections of the Massachusetts State House, Harvard University, Peabody Essex Museum, and Wellesley Historical Society. The professional organizations that Hazelton was affiliated with included the Wellesley Society of Artists, of which she was a founding member, and The Guild of Boston Artists, of which she was a charter member. She lived her adult life with her sisters in the Hazelton family home in Wellesley, Massachusetts.|$|E
