5|$|A beach party {{takes place}} at dusk on Amity Island, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While {{treading}} water, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner ruling the death a shark attack leads to Police Chief Martin Brody closing the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing it will ruin the town's summer economy. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Watkins {{was killed in a}} boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly after. A bounty is then placed on the shark, resulting in an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Watkins' remains and confirms her death was from a shark attack.|$|E
5|$|The ballads are characterised {{by sexual}} {{encounters}} between everyday people and human(-like) beings {{referred to in}} at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but with a happy ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E

25|$|Where an {{individual}} is contracted to perform certain duties, a {{failure to do so}} may result in criminal liability. The principle of liability arising from a mutual agreement arose from the decision of R v Instan, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> was found guilty of manslaughter, after failing to summon medical attention for her aunt, who maintained them both. The decisions of the court suggest that an implied contract of mutual benefit existed, so as to imply a duty upon the defendant to act. As demonstrated by 'R v Pittwood (1902), where a gatekeeper was found criminally liable for failing to perform his duties correctly, this principle may be extended to instances where the injured individual is a third party.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of {{the system}} {{impacting}} Vanuatu, the Vanuatu National Disaster Management Council issued various tropical cyclone alerts to warn residents about the approaching cyclone, which included a red alert for the Maewo, Pentecost and Ambae islands. Because of the upcoming cyclone the national radio station extended its programming to run throughout the night of January 5–6. Vanautu's domestic airline Vanair closed its airfields in the northern islands and cancelled all of its flights except for several direct flights between Santo Island and Port Vila {{the capital city of}} Vanuatu. All ships and small boats were advised to seek refuge due to the high seas and swells that were expected from Susan. However, during January 7, Susan moved south-eastwards and the Fijian islands and spared Vanuatu a direct hit. Despite being spared a direct hit, heavy rain and gale force winds caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan Islands, including on Ambrym Island, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with. After the alerts were cancelled on January 7, by the National Disaster Management Council, most shops and government buildings on Efate island kept their shutters up because Cyclone Katrina was predicted to directly affect the archipelago within a few days.|$|E
25|$|At {{this stage}} as the cyclone was moving towards the {{southwest}} it posed a severe threat to Vanuatu however, during that day Susan recurved towards {{the southeast and}} subsequently spared Vanuatu a direct hit. After sparing Vanuatu a direct hit, Susan started to accelerate towards the southeast and while starting to weaken significantly passed close enough to Fiji during January 7 and 8 to cause gale force winds in Fiji's southern and western islands. While continuing to move towards the southeast, Susan started to interact with Severe Tropical Cyclone Ron during January 8 before it absorbed Ron by 0600UTC {{the next day and}} starting to transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants of the combined systems were then monitored for another day until they were last noted on January 10, bringing an unseasonable cold snap to New Zealand. Despite sparing Vanuatu and Fiji direct hits, heavy rain and gale force winds associated with Susan were reported to have caused minor damage to several Vanuatuan and Fijian islands. These islands included Viti Levu where a possible tornado destroyed the roof of a shopping centre and the Vanuatuan island of Ambrym, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> died after being hit by a falling coconut tree, while gathering supplies to secure her house with.|$|E

25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> who has eggs but no uterus {{and wants}} to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, a woman who has no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational surrogacy arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.|$|E
