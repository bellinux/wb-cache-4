5|$|A {{special unit}} of the Stasi secret police worked covertly within the Grenztruppen, posing as regular border guards, between 1968 and 1985, to <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> {{potential}} defectors. One in ten officers and one in thirty enlisted men {{were said to have}} been recruited by the Stasi as informers. The Stasi regularly interviewed and maintained files on every guard. Stasi operatives were directly responsible for some aspects of security; passport control stations at crossings were manned by Stasi officers wearing Grenztruppen uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Dunbar {{drops out}} of the race due to the {{discovery}} of a meeting she'd had with Goodwin {{a few days before the}} attempt on Underwood's life. Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee, Will Conway (Joel Kinnaman). This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> potential running mates. During the resulting open convention, Underwood intimidates the front-runner, Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), into surrendering her delegates, and uses the public sympathy from Claire's mother's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated.|$|E

Clark was succeeded by Richardson Dilworth, who continued the policies of his predecessor. Dilworth resigned {{to run for governor}} in 1962, and city council president James H. J. Tate was elected as the city's first Irish Catholic mayor. Tate was elected mayor in 1963 and reelected in 1967 despite opposition from reformers who opposed him as an organization insider.|$|E

5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns from the community, recognizing the need to keep this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E

25|$|In July, {{circulation}} of the talonas was stopped and on 1 August 1993, the litas {{became the only}} legal tender. Following the reintroduction of the litas, there {{was an effort to}} <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> U.S. dollars from the market. The talonas was never really trusted by the people and the ruble was very unstable. Thus, people started using U.S. dollars as a stable currency. Another alternative was the German mark, but it was not available in larger quantities. A lot of shops printed prices in several different currencies, including dollars, and the economy was very “dollarized” as it was legal to make trades in foreign currencies.|$|E

25|$|Finances {{probably}} {{recovered in}} the later 14th century and in the following century the abbey was fairly solvent. Revenues from particular estates were earmarked for specific purposes, generating a straightforward budget. The treasurer then had only limited discretion in spending the remainder. This system kept the abbey out of serious trouble for some decades. However, problems had set in again by 1518, when a canonical visitation by Bishop Geoffrey Blythe found debts of 1000 marks, with only 600 marks expected revenue. Blythe also criticised {{the attitude of the}} prior, the abbot's deputy, found that some canons were consorting with women of ill-repute {{and that there was no}} schoolmaster. He advised Abbot Robert Watson to <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> unnecessary staff. This he did and the abbey began to recover financially in its final years.|$|E

Khánh was assisted by Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, who controlled the forces around Saigon, Đỗ Mậu and Nguyễn Chánh Thi.

25|$|As Chief Minister, Kamaraj {{removed the}} family {{vocation}} based Hereditary Education Policy introduced by Rajaji. The State made immense strides {{in education and}} trade. New schools were opened, so that poor rural students had to walk {{no more than three}} kilometers to their nearest school. Better facilities were added to existing ones. No village remained without a primary school and no panchayat without a high school. Kamaraj strove to eradicate illiteracy by introducing free and compulsory education up to the eleventh standard. He introduced the Midday Meal Scheme to provide at least one meal per day to the lakhs of poor school children ((The Mid-day Meal Scheme, was first introduced in 1920 by the Madras Corporation with the approval of the legislative council, as a breakfast scheme in a corporation school at Thousand Lights, Madras {{for the first time in}} the world)) Later it was expanded to four more schools. This was the precursor to the free noon meal schemes introduced by K. Kamaraj in 1960's and expanded by M. G. Ramachandran in the 1980s.. He introduced free school uniforms to <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> caste, creed and class distinctions among young minds.|$|E
25|$|Fascism {{operated}} from a Social Darwinist view {{of human}} relations. Their aim was to promote superior individuals and <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> the weak. In terms of economic practice, this meant promoting the interests of successful businessmen while destroying trade unions and other organizations of the working class. Fascist governments declared the trade union movement illegal, {{and replaced it with}} labor organizations under the direct control of the government, which ensured that workers could not undertake any effective economic action. Membership in these labor organizations was compulsory, their leaders were appointed by the ruling party rather than elected by the members, and they were presented as a new type of unions which would serve to harmonize the interests of workers and businesses. However, in practice, they primarily served the interests of major business owners, who were able to lobby the ruling party to appoint the leaders they desired. In order to maintain and increase the profits of industry, fascist states eliminated the possibility of mass protest and then cut wages either directly or indirectly. Strikes were strictly banned, and prison sentences could be given to employees who stopped working as a group.|$|E

500|$|By {{contemporary}} accounts, d'Hautpoul {{was a big}} man, possibly {{taller than}} Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with broad shoulders and a big voice.

Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to <b>weed</b> <b>out</b> dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, [...] the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to be intimidated. When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: [...] "No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs." [...] Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.|$|E
