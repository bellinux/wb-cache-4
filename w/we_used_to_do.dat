500|$|After the {{unpleasant}} recording sessions {{for the proposed}} Get Back album (ultimately released in 1970 as Let It Be), Paul McCartney suggested to music producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album [...] "the way <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it", free of the conflict that had begun {{following the death of}} Brian Epstein and carried over to the sessions for the White Album. Martin agreed, but on the strict condition that all the group – particularly John Lennon – allow him to produce the record {{in the same manner as}} earlier albums and that discipline would be adhered to.|$|E
500|$|When {{those plans}} fell through, McLaren, Rhodes {{and the band}} began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As {{described}} by Matlock, [...] "Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was if someone had short hair we would stop them {{in the street and}} ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer." [...] Among those they approached was Midge Ure, who was involved with his own band, Slik. Kevin Rowland—who would co-found Dexys Midnight Runners three years later—auditioned, but apart from Matlock, no one was impressed. With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It reminds me of the way <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about.

We describe the process <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this for tightly-scoped and short design exercises [...] with meetings/workshops, iterative bursts of design/prototyping over relatively short periods of time, and workplace-based evaluation [...] illustrating this with examples of our own experience from recent work with bird ecologists...|$|R

Using this formal description, we have mechanically checked the correctness of MC 68020 object code programs for binary search, Hoare's Quick Sort, twenty-one functions from the Berkeley Unix C string library, and other well-known algorithms. The object code for these examples was generated using the Gnu C, the Verdix Ada, and the Gnu Common Lisp compilers.

As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just had a really good time [...] While filming the video, we noticed that we were doing certain stuff that <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as kids. We kinda felt a little goofy for a second, so we stopped. But we just had a good time.". Model Shaun Ross also makes a cameo in the video.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk {{began working on}} new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, [...] "the two of us would go in {{with a lot of}} keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and started to do demos for six, seven months." [...] Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: [...] "We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [...] for four minutes straight." [...] Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the [...] film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: [...] "Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently." [...] Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories: [...] "We wanted to do what <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with machines and samplers, but with people." [...] They avoided the use of samples on the album, {{with the exception of the}} closing track [...] "Contact".|$|E

Deindustrialization and the replacement of smokestack industries by technology have allowed more women to enter the labor force, reducing its emphasis on physical strength.|$|E

40|$|The Wasserstein distance, under a convex cost function, between random {{variables}} on R admits a simple, tractable solution. On the other hand, in higher dimensions, {{and even for}} the quadratic cost, the distance and associated optimal coupling, remains problematic, save for a few special cases. In this paper, we demonstrate that, {{in the case of}} quadratic cost, it is the underlying copula which drives optimal couplings. That is, if one has the optimal coupling between the two copulas of two multivariate {{random variables}}, then one has it between the two multivariate random variables. This motivates looking at optimal couplings between copula and indeed we find such for the class of Archimedean copula. The technique <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this is then developed to find optimal couplings between copulas associated with elliptical distributions. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

40|$|The Pegasus File System (PFS) is a {{file system}} that has been {{designed}} to support a wide variety of (different) workloads.

40|$|The {{concept of}} "cultural identity", {{as a matter}} of anthropological {{consideration}} today – in the sense of its dynamic and relational character, but before that as a means of signifying human groups and simultaneously expressing what the members consider their contextual characteristics – is based on the process of cultural identification, which is the product of the act of division, delineation and classification as culturally cognitive operations arising from the experience of the surrounding reality. The initial anthropological interest in these acts we find in anthropological structuralism and its intention of searching for rules of logic which determine the ways in which we shape our world and the symbols <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.

40|$|Existing {{software}} transactional memory (STM) implementations often exhibit poor scalability, usually {{because of}} nonscalable mechanisms for read sharing, transactional consistency, and privatization; some STMs also have nonscalable centralized commit mechanisms. We describe novel techniques to eliminate bottlenecks {{from all of}} these mechanisms, and present SkySTM, which employs these techniques. SkySTM is the first STM that supports privatization and scales on modern multicore multiprocessors with hundreds of hardware threads on multiple chips. A central theme in this work is avoiding frequent updates to centralized metadata, especially for multi-chip systems, in which the cost of accessing centralized metadata increases dramatically. A key mechanism <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so is a scalable nonzero indicator (SNZI), which was designed for this purpose. A secondary contribution of the paper is a new and simplified SNZI algorithm. Our scalable privatization mechanism imposes only about 4 % overhead in low-contention experiments; when contention is higher, the overhead still reaches only 35 % with over 250 threads. In contrast, prior approaches have been reported as imposing over 100 % overhead in some cases, even with only 8 threads. 1...|$|R
