500|$|In 1939, as the {{occupation}} regime was being established, the Nazis confiscated Polish state property and much private property. Countless art objects were looted {{and taken to}} Germany, in line <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> had been drawn up {{well in advance of}} the invasion. The looting was supervised by experts of the SS-Ahnenerbe, Einsatzgruppen units, who were responsible for art, and by experts of Haupttreuhandstelle Ost, who were responsible for more mundane objects. Notable items plundered by the Nazis included the Altar of Veit Stoss and paintings by Raphael, Rembrandt, Leonardo da Vinci, Canaletto and Bacciarelli. Most of the important art pieces had been [...] "secured" [...] by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that [...] "over 90%" [...] of the art previously in Poland was in their possession. Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned Führermuseum in Linz, while other art became the private property of Nazi officials. Over 516,000individual art pieces were taken, including 2,800paintings by European painters; 11,000works by Polish painters; 1,400sculptures, 75,000manuscripts, 25,000maps, and 90,000books (including over 20,000printed before 1800); as well as hundreds of thousands of other objects of artistic and historic value.

500|$|Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, who {{had signed}} the accord {{on behalf of}} the King, resurrected the idea of a grand {{thoroughfare}} symbolically connecting the Vatican {{to the heart of the}} Italian capital. To fulfil this vision, Mussolini turned to the prominent Fascist architects Marcello Piacentini and Attilio Spaccarelli. Drawing inspiration from a number of the designs submitted by Carlo Fontana, Piacentini came up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>that</b> would preserve the best aspects of both the [...] "open" [...] and [...] "closed" [...] designs [...] a grand boulevard that would nonetheless obscure the majority of the Vatican buildings per Bernini's intentions. The vast colonnaded street would require the [...] placed in between the Basilica and the Castle. Since the facades of the buildings lining this space did not align perfectly, in order to create the illusion of a perfectly straight causeway traffic islands would be erected along both sides, with rows of obelisks leading towards the Square, doubling as lampposts. These were also intended to reduce the effect that the funnel-shaped design would have on perspective when facing the Basilica. The wings of those buildings closest to the square would be preserved to form a propylaea, blocking the greater portion of the Vatican City from approaching visitors and framing the Square and Basilica at the head of a grand open space that would allow for easy vehicular access.|$|E
