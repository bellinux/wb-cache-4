5|$|East Stirlingshire's home colours {{have been}} {{black and white}} hoops {{for most of its}} {{existence}} since 1882. The club's first strip <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> blue and white hoops between 1880 and 1882, before changing to colours similar to the present day. An all-black shirt was introduced between 1960 and 1962, and again between 2008 and 2010, while the club's centenary strip in 1981 was all-white. In 1996–97, the stripes were changed from horizontal to vertical for a full season; a similar design featured for one month in August 1982 before changing back.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} Baldassare Ceola, the police {{commissioner}} of Palermo, {{concluded that the}} crime had probably been carried out by Mafiosi Carlo Costantino and Antonino Passananti under Cascioferro's direction. Evidence <b>was</b> <b>thin,</b> however, and the case was effectively closed when in July 1911 the Palermo Court of Appeals discharged Cascioferro, as well as Costantino and Passananti, due to insufficient evidence {{to send them to}} trial. Petrosino's murder was never solved. Nevertheless, Costantino and Passananti were identified as the most likely assassins. Costantino died in the late 1930s and Passananti, in March 1969. In 2014, more than a century after the assassination, the Italian police overheard a tapped phone conversation in which a sibling claimed that Paolo Palazzotto had been the killer on the orders of Cascioferro. Palazzotto had been arrested after the shooting, but had been released for lack of evidence.|$|E
5|$|Army {{commitments}} intervened {{during the}} 1943 season. Lindwall {{had attempted to}} enlist in the Royal Australian Air Force, but he was rejected because the employees of his firm were exempted from military service. Thus Lindwall resigned his job in order to join the army. As part of his Anti-aircraft and Fortress Signal unit, he was deployed in May 1943 to New Guinea as the Japanese reached the Kokoda Trail close to Port Moresby. Lindwall's unit were bombed while they were ashore and he was lucky not to be killed. In 1945, he returned from the Solomon Islands, where he was believed to have contracted malaria and Dengue fever, although medical tests did not confirm this, he needed injections and atebrin tablets to aid him in recovering from bouts of minor illness for some time afterwards, and he resumed State cricket in 1945–46, despite the rigours of war having reduced him to just 73kg, which <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> for his height of 178cm.|$|E

An irreducible T(χ) -module W is said to <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> if dim Ei∗(χ) W ⩽ 1 for 0 ⩽ i ⩽ d, where Ei∗(χ) is the projection onto the ith subconstituent for Γ with respect to χ. The graph Γ is said to <b>be</b> <b>thin</b> if, for each vertex χ of Γ, very irreducible T(χ) -module <b>is</b> <b>thin.</b> Our main result is the following Theorem: If Γ has two Q-polynomial structures, then Γ <b>is</b> <b>thin...</b>|$|R
5|$|Inside the {{lacrimal}} {{bones were}} depressions {{that may have}} held glands, such as salt glands. Within the maxillae were sinuses that were better developed than those of more basal theropods such as Ceratosaurus and Marshosaurus; {{they may have been}} related to the sense of smell, perhaps holding something like Jacobson's organ. The roof of the braincase <b>was</b> <b>thin,</b> perhaps to improve thermoregulation for the brain. The skull and lower jaws had joints that permitted motion within these units. In the lower jaws, the bones of the front and back halves loosely articulated, permitting the jaws to bow outward and increasing the animal's gape. The braincase and frontals may also have had a joint.|$|E
5|$|On {{his arrival}} in Nuremberg, Hess was {{reluctant}} {{to give up some}} of his possessions, including samples of food he said had been poisoned by the British; he proposed to use these for his defence during the trial. The commandant of the facility, Colonel Burton C. Andrus of the United States Army, advised him that he would be allowed no special treatment; the samples were sealed and confiscated. Hess's diaries indicate that he did not acknowledge the validity of the court and felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. He <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> when he arrived, weighing , and had a poor appetite, but was deemed to be in good health. As one defendant, Robert Ley, had managed to hang himself in his cell on 24 October, the remaining prisoners were monitored around the clock. Because of his previous suicide attempts, Hess was handcuffed to a guard whenever he was out of his cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E

25|$|In {{least one}} version of Russian twin-hose aqualung, the {{regulator}} {{did not have an}} A-clamp but screwed into a large socket on the cylinder manifold; that manifold <b>was</b> <b>thin,</b> and meandered somewhat.

There is suspicion that those Russian aqualungs started as a factory-made improved descendant of an aqualung home-made by British sport divers and obtained unofficially by a Russian and taken to Russia.|$|E

At first, the bow <b>was</b> <b>thin.</b> In later {{variants}} the bow was made of thicker metal or of two pieces of thin wire twisted together. These rounded bow fibulae were first found in the 12th century BC, but lasted in use in some places {{for more than five}} centuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversion}} of Khazars to Judaism is reported by external sources {{and in the}} Khazar Correspondence, though doubts persist. Hebrew documents, whose authenticity was long doubted and challenged, are now widely accepted by specialists as either authentic or as reflecting internal Khazar traditions. Archaeological evidence for conversion, on the other hand, remains elusive, and may reflect either the incompleteness of excavations, or that the stratum of actual adherents <b>was</b> <b>thin.</b> Conversion of steppe or peripheral tribes to a universal religion is a fairly well attested phenomenon, and the Khazar conversion to Judaism, though unusual, {{would not have been}} unique. Other scholars have concluded that the {{conversion of}} the Khazar elite to Judaism never happened. A few scholars, Moshe Gil, recently seconded by Shaul Stampfer, dismiss the conversion as a myth.|$|E

500|$|Philitas <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> and frail, and {{may have}} {{suffered}} and died from a wasting disease. He seems to have died in Cos sometime in the 280sBC. His pupil Hermesianax wrote that a statue of him was erected under a plane tree {{by the people of}} Cos, depicting him as [...] "frail with all the glosses". His contemporary Posidippus wrote that Philadelphus commissioned a bronze of Philitas in old age from the sculptor Hecataeus, which [...] "included nothing from the physique of heroes. No,... he cast the old man full of cares." [...] The 3rd centuryAD Roman author Aelian skeptically passed along a story that Philitas was so thin that he put lead weights in the soles of his shoes to avoid being blown away by a stiff wind.|$|E
500|$|Despite William Plomer's {{original}} {{thought about}} the state of the manuscript, editors Jonathan Cape were concerned enough about the story to pass the manuscript to Kingsley Amis to read on holiday, paying him £35/15 shillings for his thoughts and advice, although Amis' subsequent suggestions were not used by Cape. Cape had taken the step because they thought the novel <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> and [...] "feeble". Raymond Benson has noted that the thinness comes from a lack of the rich detail and descriptions which are normally present in Fleming's work, but which are missing from The Man with the Golden Gun; Benson suggests that these details were normally worked into the second draft by Fleming, but their absence shows that no such additional work was done on this occasion. The Man with the Golden Gun was published posthumously, eight months after its author's death.|$|E

[...] Reiter was unenthusiastic: she acknowledged [...] "Chenoweth's amazing pipes", but added [...] "her character, which <b>was</b> <b>thin</b> to start with, has kind of worn out its welcome". The subplot of Will thinking about going to Broadway with April was roundly criticized: both Meghan Brown of The Atlantic and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle {{said there was no}} tension at all because the viewer knows that he will stay. The A.V.
