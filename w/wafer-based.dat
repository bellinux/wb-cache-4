25|$|Reducing {{the silicon}} wafer {{thickness}} at a minimized efficiency loss represents a mainstream trend in increasing the cost-effectiveness of <b>wafer-based</b> solar cells. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated that, using the advanced light trapping strategy with a properly designed nano-particle architecture, the wafer thickness can be dramatically reduced to only around 1/10 {{of the current}} thickness (180µm) without any solar cell efficiency loss at 18.2%. Nano-particle integrated ultra-thin solar cells with only 3% of the current wafer thickness can potentially achieve 15.3% efficiency combining the absorption enhancement {{with the benefit of}} thinner wafer induced open circuit voltage increase. This represents a 97% material saving with only 15% relative efficiency loss. These results demonstrate the feasibility and prospect of achieving high-efficiency ultra-thin silicon wafer cells with plasmonic light trapping.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{cells can}} be {{classified}} into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells—also called conventional, traditional or <b>wafer-based</b> cells—are made of crystalline silicon, the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as polysilicon and monocrystalline silicon. Second generation cells are thin film solar cells, that include amorphous silicon, CdTe and CIGS cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, building integrated photovoltaics or in small stand-alone power system. The third generation of solar cells includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics—most of them {{have not yet been}} commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often organometallic compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, {{there is a lot of}} research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the {{numerous}} attempts at making better solar cells by using new and exotic materials, {{the reality is}} that the photovoltaics market is still dominated by silicon <b>wafer-based</b> solar cells (first-generation solar cells). This means that most solar cell manufacturers are currently equipped to produce this type of solar cells. Consequently, a large body of research is being done all over the world to manufacture silicon <b>wafer-based</b> solar cells at lower cost and to increase the conversion efficiencies without an exorbitant increase in production cost. The ultimate goal for both <b>wafer-based</b> and alternative photovoltaic concepts is to produce solar electricity at a cost comparable to currently market-dominant coal, natural gas, and nuclear power in order to make it the leading primary energy source. To achieve this it may be necessary to reduce the cost of installed solar systems from currently about US$1.80 (for bulk Si technologies) to about US$0.50 per Watt peak power. Since a major part of the final cost of a traditional bulk silicon module is related to the high cost of solar grade polysilicon feedstock (about US$0.4/Watt peak) there exists substantial drive to make Si solar cells thinner (material savings) or to make solar cells from cheaper upgraded metallurgical silicon (so called [...] "dirty Si").|$|E

Compared to the traditional glass micropipettes FluidFM probes are much more gentle to soft samples such as cells. They can be controlled with pN and nm precision, and handle volumes more precise and consistent due to their <b>wafer-based</b> fabrication process.

Cells must also be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones are available, based on thin-film cells.

In the last 10 years, the efficiency of average commercial <b>wafer-based</b> crystalline silicon modules increased from about 12% to 16% and CdTe module efficiency increased from 9% to 13% during same period. Module output and life degraded by increased temperature. Allowing ambient air to flow over, and if possible behind, PV modules reduces this problem. Effective module lives are typically 25 years or more. The payback period for an investment in a PV solar installation varies greatly and is typically less useful than a calculation of return on investment. While it is typically calculated to be between 10 and 20 years, the financial payback period can be far shorter with incentives.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new device concept for high efficiency, low cost, <b>wafer-based</b> silicon solar cells. To significantly lower the costs of Si photovoltaics, high efficiencies and large reductions {{in the bill of}} materials, especially for metals and silicon, are required. The reduction of the amount of metal in <b>wafer-based</b> silicon modules requires adaptation of the device architecture into low-current devices. Basically, this comes down to reducing cell dimensions in the direction of current flow. The XIS (Crystalline Silicon Interconnected Strips) device concept addresses this significant reduction in the consumption of metals and enables the use of ultra-thin silicon wafers. In combination with a high efficiency back-contact heterojunction device geometry a cost reduction to below 0. 5 /Wp is foreseen. The integrated device and module concept can be realized with standard industrial production processes. The concept relies on the high efficiencies that can be achieved with crystalline silicon wafers, in combination with the high throughput that can be achieved with thin-film manufacturing technology.

30|$|Climate change, {{energy crisis}} and {{increasing}} monetary cost arisen from the nonrenewable fossil fuels have attracted extensive broad public attentions. The demands for developing renewable clean energy resources have been greatly increased {{in recent years}} [1, 2]. Among the various energy projects in progress, photovoltaic (PV) is an almost maintenance-free and truly renewable clean energy and is considered as the most promising candidate for future energy resources [3, 4]. Although many Si-based PV devices have been developed during the past decades, single-crystal Si <b>wafer–based</b> PV modules still show the highest efficiency. However, more than 30 % of incident light is reflected back due to the high reflective index of Si, which greatly reduces the PCE of the photovoltaic device. For traditional Si <b>wafer–based</b> solar cells, the pyramidal or inverted pyramidal structures were generally constructed on Si surface to reduce the reflection loss for incident light [5, 6]. Extra single-layer antireflection coating (SLARC) or double-layer antireflection coating (DLACR), such as Si 3 N 4, MgF 2 and Si 3 N 4 /MgF 2 DLACR, was also needed to further suppress the reflection loss [7]. Unfortunately, these complex processes often make the rigorous requirements for experimental condition and limit the practical application of Si-based solar cells.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{material}} interfaces in nanoscale photovoltaics. Interface properties between the absorbing semiconductor and other employed materials are crucial for an efficient solar cell. While the optical properties are largely unaffected {{by a few}} nanometer thin layer, the electronic properties can change tremendously: electrical passivation of surface defects or contact selectivity can turn a piece of black rock with two metal leads into a highly efficient solar cell. On the nanoscale, highly useful properties emerge compared to <b>wafer-based</b> or even thin-film semiconductors. Most importantly, not only directly incident but also adjacent light can be absorbed by the single nanoscale element. As a result, an array of single nanoscale structures with much empty space in between can absorb as much light as a continuous thin-film. This effect leads to largely reduced material consumption and, depending on the growth method, even to a faster growth process for a fully absorbing layer. While this property is enormously beneficial for photovoltaics, another feature creates a great challenge: by nanostructuring semiconductors, the surface-to-volume ratio becomes much larger compared to thin-film or <b>wafer-based</b> solar cells. Consequently, the influence of surface and interface properties on the overall performance of the nanoscale photovoltaic elements increases substantially. In this thesis, nanowires are therefore chosen as a sensitive platform to study the impact of those interface properties on the overall photovoltaic performance. Based on the findings, device designs for more efficient practical nanowire array solar cells and a highly promising manufacturing process are proposed...|$|E
