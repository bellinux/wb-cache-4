40|$|Gross {{chromosomal}} rearrangements (GCRs) {{are frequently}} observed in cancer cells. Abnormalities in different DNA metabolism including DNA replication, cell cycle checkpoints, chromatin remodeling, telomere maintenance, and DNA recombination and repair cause GCRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Recently, we used genome-wide screening to identify several genes the deletion of which increases GCRs in S. cerevisiae. Elg 1, which was discovered during this screening, functions in DNA replication {{by participating in}} an alternative replication factor complex. Here we further characterize the GCR suppression mechanisms observed in the elg 1 Δ mutant strain in conjunction <b>with</b> the telomere <b>maintenance</b> <b>role</b> of Elg 1. The elg 1 Δ mutation enhanced spontaneous DNA damage and resulted in GCR formation. However, DNA damage due to inactivation of Elg 1 activates the intra-S checkpoints, which suppress further GCR formation. The intra-S checkpoints activated by the elg 1 Δ mutation also suppress GCR formation in strains defective in the DNA replication checkpoint. Lastly, the elg 1 Δ mutation increases telomere size independently of other previously known telomere maintenance proteins such as the telomerase inhibitor Pif 1 or the telomere size regulator Rif 1. The increase in telomere length caused by the elg 1 Δ mutation was suppressed by a defect in the DNA replication checkpoint, which suggests that DNA replication surveillance by Dpb 11 -Mec 1 /Tel 1 -Dun 1 also has {{an important role in}} telomere length regulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{burden of}} disease of Carica papaya L may account for its reduced {{commercial}} value. As much as the fruit is cherished amongst Nigerians its cultivation at commercial scale is limited. There are presently no industries in Nigeria utilizing the fruits {{or part of the}} plant for beverage production or in other industrial processes. This study was carried out to identify those factors that can be modified to extend the shelf-life of the fruit thereby enhancing its industrial value as a commercial crop. A 4 year field and experimental investigations in a monoculture C. papaya model demonstration farm revealed the following. Maturity of fruit and timing harvest are most critical in prolonging and by 25 % shelf- life of healthy harvested fruit. Age of the plant which co-related with susceptibility to disease was evident in stands 2 years and older. Mechanical damage associated with harvesting technique and activities of pests (arthropods, molluscs, millipedes and bird), and farm <b>maintenance</b> played significant <b>roles</b> <b>on</b> the post-harvest quality of the fruit. Adequate understanding of the interplay of these factors and their regulation can be harnessed for extending the shelf-life of C. papaya fruit...|$|R

40|$|Student team {{project work}} in higher {{education}} {{is one of the}} best ways to develop team working skills at the same time as learning about the subject matter. As today’s students require the freedom to learn at times and places that better match their lifestyles, there is a need for any support for team project work to be also available online. Team working requires that the task roles as well as the <b>maintenance</b> <b>roles</b> are taken into consideration, in that social interactions are just as important as carrying out the tasks of the project. The literature indicates that groupware, whilst effective in supporting the task roles, provides limited support for the <b>maintenance</b> <b>roles</b> of team working in the work place. As groupware was not specifically designed for student team working, it provides limited support for <b>maintenance</b> <b>roles</b> in student team projects. Virtual learning environments similarly provide support for completing the task roles. Many researchers have found that students experience difficulties with their team project work that reduce the perceived benefits of working in a team. It is proposed that helping students to agree on ground rules at the start of a project will improve team cohesion. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a prototype system to help students to agree on ground rules as they start their team projects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} variables that facilitate lay caregivers in maintaining dependent elders in the home setting. Specifically, this study: (1) tested a deduced theory designed to explain home maintenance of a dependent elder; (2) examined the relationship between the following variables: Seriousness of an Elder's Illness, Caregiver Overload, Quality of Care, Learning State, Caregivers Maintenance Ability, Acceptance of the <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Role</b> and the Caregiver's Perception of Power; and (3) evaluated the reliability and validity of the instruments that measured the proposed variables. A descriptive correlational design with causal modeling methodology was used to assess a five stage theory. The convenience sample was comprised of 70 English speaking caregivers providing a minimum of five hours of direct care to a dependent elder in the home setting. Reliability and validity of the instruments used to evaluate the theoretical concepts were assessed by Cronbach's alpha, factor analysis and predictive model testing. Multiple regression statistics were used to evaluate the theory and residual analysis was used to assess violations of statistical and causal modeling assumptions. The findings supported two of the predicted relationships: Seriousness of Illness had a direct and positive relationship with Caregiver Overload (B =. 60, R² =. 35) and Learning State had a direct and positive influence on Acceptance of the <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Role</b> (B =. 36, R² =. 18). As the disabilities of the dependent elder became more acute, the caregivers' feelings of being overloaded with the burden of the caregiving responsibilities increased. However, when the caregivers had a positive perception of their abilities to implement prescribed health care instruction as well as felt positively about their caregiving role (Learning State), they spent a greater amount of time giving direct care to the dependent elder (Acceptance of <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Role).</b> Identification of learning needs as they relate to the caregivers' ability to understand and implement health care instruction as well as feel positively about their role, can assist nurses in developing appropriate teaching interventions. The expected outcome of these interventions is direct care provided by the caregiver to the dependent elder...|$|R
