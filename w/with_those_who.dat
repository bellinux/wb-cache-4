40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} factors affecting domestic violence risk behaviors among Thai Muslim married couples in Satun Province. The data were collected from 1, 920 wives as representatives of families, and analyzed using the R program to find out frequencies, percentages, chi-square test, odds ratios, and logistic coefficients. The results revealed that 34. 3 percent of Thai Muslim married couples in Satun Province had domestic violence risk behaviors, and the factors affecting domestic risk behaviors with statistical significance consisted of six variables, namely jealous wives, suspicious wives, drinking husbands, drug abusive husbands, being not ready to have one's own family, and lack of time for discussions. Married couples who had high domestic violence risk behaviors were <b>those</b> <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were regularly jealous, and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were occasionally jealous were 3. 70 times, and 3. 43 times more likely to have risk behaviors than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were never jealous; <b>those</b> <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were regularly suspicious, and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were occasionally suspicious were 3. 19 times, and 1. 76 times more likely to have risk behaviors than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> wives <b>who</b> were never suspicious; <b>those</b> <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> regularly drank, and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> occasionally drank were 2. 14 times, and 1. 41 times more likely to have risk behaviors than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> never drank alcohol; <b>those</b> <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> regularly used drugs, and <b>those</b> <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> occasionally used drugs were 1. 86 times, and 1. 39 times more likely to have risk behaviors than <b>those</b> <b>with</b> husbands <b>who</b> never used drugs; married couples who were not ready, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were moderately ready to have their own families were 1. 79 times, and 1. 44 times more likely to have risk behaviors than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> were very ready to have a family, and married couples who did not have time for discussions, and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> moderately had time for discussions were 1. 72 times, and 1. 47 times more likely to have risk behaviors than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> had a lot of time for discussions...|$|R

The first series was broadcast over seven nights in September 2011, running {{over the course of a}} week, except for the Tuesday night, from Saturday to the following Saturday.

5|$|Malini is an indigent {{woman whose}} father is in poor health. She is persuaded by her friend Sundari, an actress, {{to join her}} theatre company, Kala Mandhiram. Malini soon becomes very {{successful}} and popular. She is later befriended by Sampath, a charlatan, who is regularly involved in dodging creditors. Deaf to all advice, Malini allows herself to be led astray in professional, financial and moral terms. She is put out of Kala Mandhiram and sets up a theatre company of her own where Sampath appoints himself as general manager. She also severs ties <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> previously helped her, including Sundari. At first, the new company prospers, but its resources are soon squandered by Sampath and it falls under a weight of debt and disgrace. Sampath abandons Malini, who falls back to her previous poor condition. However, with Sundari's help, she returns to Kala Mandhiram and begins her life anew.|$|E

5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition watch that commemorated this film.|$|E

At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E
5|$|Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} is a milder form of hypothyroidism {{characterized by}} an elevated serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. This milder form of hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In adults it is diagnosed when TSH levels are greater than 5 mIU/L and less than 10mIU/L. The presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism is variable and classic {{signs and symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may not be observed. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, a proportion will develop overt hypothyroidism each year. In those with detectable antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO), this occurs in 4.3%, while in those with no detectable antibodies, this occurs in 2.6%. Those with subclinical hypothyroidism and detectable anti-TPO antibodies who do not require treatment should have repeat thyroid function tests more frequently (e.g. yearly) compared <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> do not have antibodies.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly was {{strictly}} {{under the control}} of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.|$|E
5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. Some black players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of them because of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that to justify their beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} Henry's coronation, he arrested his father's two most unpopular ministers, Sir Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley. They {{were charged with}} high treason and were {{executed}} in 1510. Historian Ian Crofton has maintained that such executions would become Henry's primary tactic for dealing <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> stood in his way; the two executions were certainly not the last. Henry also returned to the public {{some of the money}} supposedly extorted by the two ministers. By contrast, Henry's view of the House of York – potential rival claimants for the throne – was more moderate than his father's had been. Several who had been imprisoned by his father, including the Marquess of Dorset, were pardoned. Others (most notably Edmund de la Pole) went unreconciled; de la Pole was eventually beheaded in 1513, an execution prompted by his brother Richard siding against the king.|$|E
5|$|Midway through season three, Kate persuades Rousseau to {{help some}} of the {{survivors}} find the Others' home, by informing her that Alex helped her escape from the Others. When they arrive, Rousseau abandons the group and watches from the bushes as Alex walks past. A few days later, Rousseau leads the survivors to the radio tower {{in order for them}} to contact a nearby freighter. En route, they encounter Ben and Alex; Ben explains to Alex who Rousseau is and the mother and daughter are reunited. Season four begins with the survivors dividing into two groups, <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> believe the people from the freighter to be dangerous, including Rousseau and Alex, joining Locke (Terry O'Quinn). After learning of the freighter crew's intentions to kill everyone on the island, Ben directs Rousseau, along with Alex and her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff), to head to the Temple where the rest of the Others are located. On their way, Rousseau and Karl are shot by unseen attackers, and both are killed. The buried bodies of both are discovered by Miles (Ken Leung), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), and Claire after they leave Locke and travel back to the beach.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Kỳ {{disapproved of}} Chuan's {{approach}} and replaced Chuan with Đính. Prime Minister Kỳ felt Đính's aggressive attitude following the Xá Lợi Pagoda raids in 1963 indicated {{a willingness to}} suppress Buddhist dissidents. Moreover, Đính {{was a native of}} central Vietnam and would have been popular <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> thought along parochial lines. Đính arrived in Huế on 15 April and, after a week, announced that he had restored Saigon's authority over the region. He proclaimed that he had regained control of the radio stations in Đà Nẵng and Huế from the dissidents, and that he had convinced the mayor of Đà Nẵng to remain loyal to Saigon. Đính announced a deal whereby the Buddhists would have regular air time in return for relinquishing control of the radio station. This move was interpreted in different ways. Some felt that Đính was attempting to gain favour with the Buddhists in anticipation of Kỳ's fall from power, while Frances FitzGerald felt it was the only sensible government action during the crisis. On 19 April, clashes erupted in Quảng Ngãi between the Buddhists and the VNQDĐ (Vietnamese Nationalist Party), which supported the continuation of the anti-communist war, prompting Đính to forcibly restrain the two groups.|$|E
