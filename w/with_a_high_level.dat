5|$|The Curia of Other Municipalities {{consisted}} of 8764 electors from amongst small-scale rural landowners. There were {{two stages of}} voting for this curia.

These voters elected the electors, who then elected seventy-four deputies to the Diet, each holding a constituency equivalent to a rural district.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the {{predominantly}} mining and agricultural-based economy began a transition towards a more multi-sector economy. Since the 1980s, the industrial sector, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of investment, {{has led the}} country's growth. The economy recovered from the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis earlier than neighbouring countries did, and has since recovered to the levels of the pre-crisis era with a GDP per capita of $14,800. Economic inequalities exist between different ethnic groups. The Chinese make up about one-quarter of the population, but accounts for 70 per cent of the country's market capitalisation.

5|$|To command {{individual}} units, regional ZNG commands {{were established}} in eastern Slavonia, the Banovina–Kordun area, Lika, central and northern Dalmatia, southern Dalmatia and Zagreb in late July and August. Crisis headquarters, which also had command authority of ZNG units, were established down to the municipal level. The command structure was particularly poor, preventing effective coordination between units. Although the many crisis headquarters were entrusted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of authority, they consisted of politicians with little (if any) military training other than JNA service. Multiple units deployed to a single area often had no authority coordinating their activities. TO command systems were reactivated in some places (such as Zagreb), somewhat improving the situation.|$|E

Mothers <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of neu- tralization, compared <b>with</b> mothers <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower level of neutralization, had children <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of avoidance. The study analyzed the associations between the maternal resolution state of mind of the child’s diagnosis, maternal mental representations of the relation with the child, and children’s attachment. The associations made between the maternal resolution state of mind and some mothers’ and children’s variables were also analyzed. The participants were 21 children with high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome (Mage = 7 years 9 months; SD = 2 years 4 months) and their mothers (Mage = 41 years 2 months; SD = 4 years 7 months).

5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed in written law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E

40|$|Emotion {{has been}} shown to be lateralized in the brain. This study {{examines}} the individual differences influencing the patterns of hemispheric asymmetry in the perception of emotional words. This study explores how individuals’ level of depression and anxiety affects how they perceive emotional words varying in valence and arousal. Participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower level of depression demonstrated more hemispheric asymmetry <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bias toward words presented to the left hemisphere, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of depression had no hemispheric differences. Participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower level of depression demonstrated a bias toward positive words, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of depression had no difference in valence. Similarly, participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower level of anxiety had a positivity bias, but participants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> of anxiety had no difference in valence. These findings indicate similarities and differences in emotional perception in depression and anxiety and may represent some of the neurological underpinnings of these disorders.
