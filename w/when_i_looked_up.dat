2500|$|Goforth ministered at Yingkou (Newchwang), {{the final}} resting-place of Scottish missionary William Chalmers Burns. Burnsâ€™ impact {{was still being}} felt 40 years later among the Christian {{community}} of Yingkou. However, {{the same kind of}} repentance and prayer broke out, here as Goforth wrote: [...] "On entering the pulpit, I bowed as usual for a few moments in prayer. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> it seemed to me as if every last man, woman and child in that church was in the throes of judgment. Tears were flowing freely, and all manner of sin was being confessed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon, [...] There was {{in their}} tiny tune A dying fetch like broken words, <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at my love-birds [...] That Sunday afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of that," [...] said Rose; [...] "for sometimes, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> here, and see {{you through}} the branches, with your head bent down, and your hands clasped behind you, treading, treading, treading, always in one way, I wonder whether I am at all in your mind. I don't think, Septimius," [...] added she, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> {{in his face and}} smiling, [...] "that ever a girl had just such a young man for a lover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{see nothing}} at all," [...] said Robin, {{stretching}} his head cautiously forward and gazing down into darkness profound, while he held on tight to a rail. [...] "How curious!--when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> down {{everything in this}} wonderful ship {{seems to have no}} bottom, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> nothing appears to have any top, while, if <b>I</b> <b>look</b> backward or forward things seem to have no end! Ah! I see something now. Coming in from the light prevented me at first. Why, it's like a huge circus!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can never}} {{do as much}} as this <b>when</b> <b>I</b> am your countess," [...] she said to her future lord. [...] "I shall dwell in marble halls, as people say, but I shall never cram a house so full as to be able to see, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> from the stage, {{that there is not a}} place for another man's head; and when my throat gave way the other day I could read all the {{disappointment}} in the public papers. I shall become your wife, my lord." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{room was}} hot, and still {{save for the}} buzzing of the flies. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> I {{discovered}} the eyes of all three upon me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{sent for}} me, Madonna. I am here." [...] There was a pause, and <b>when</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> into her blessed face I saw {{a smile of}} infinite sorrow on her lips, blending oddly with the gladness that shone from her sweet eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am glad to}} hear it,' said Mr Pecksniff. 'Behold {{the wonders}} of the firmament, Mrs Lupin! how glorious is the scene! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at those shining orbs, I think that each of them is winking to the other to take notice of the vanity of men's pursuits. My fellow-men!' cried Mr Pecksniff, shaking his head in pity; 'you are much mistaken; my wormy relatives, you are much deceived! The stars are {{perfectly}} contented (I suppose so) in their several spheres. Why are not you? Oh! do not strive and struggle to enrich yourselves, or to get the better of each other, my deluded friends, but <b>look</b> <b>up</b> there, with me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fear, then, {{no longer}} for your safety--Goisvintha, whom you dread, {{is far from}} us; she knows not that we are here; she cannot track our {{footsteps}} now, to threaten or to harm you! Remember no more how you have suffered and I have sinned! Think only how bitterly I have repented our morning's separation, and how gladly I welcome our meeting of to-night! Oh, Antonina! you are beautiful with a wondrous loveliness, you are young with a perfected and unchildlike youth, your words fall upon my ear with the music of a song of the olden time; {{it is like a}} dream of the spirits that my fathers worshipped, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> and behold you at my side!' ...|$|R
60|$|WISE MAN [in a low, solemn voice]. Just now, {{before you}} came in, some one came to the door, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> I saw an angel {{standing}} there.|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned away}} my head, hesitating, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again I {{saw that her}} {{beautiful}} eyes were full of tears. Naturally that settled the matter, so I only said, ...|$|E
60|$|I noticed {{then the}} broad {{shadow on the}} horizon, {{extinguishing}} the low stars completely, while those overhead, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> seemed to shine down on us through a veil of smoke.|$|E
60|$|I {{was thus}} engaged when the sudden waking of the glen into life {{took me to}} my window. There is seldom silence up here, for if the wind be not {{sweeping}} the heather, the Quharity, that I may not have heard for days, seems to have crept nearer to the school- house in the night, and if both wind and water be out of earshot, there is the crack of a gun, or Waster Lunny's shepherd is on a stone near at hand whistling, or a lamb is scrambling through a fence, and kicking foolishly with its hind legs. These sounds I am unaware of until they stop, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> Such a stillness was broken now by music.|$|R
60|$|If I {{leave all}} for thee, wilt thou {{exchange}} And be all to me? Shall I never miss Home-talk and blessing {{and the common}} kiss That comes to each in turn, nor count it strange, <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> to drop on a new range Of walls and floors, another home than this? Nay, wilt thou fill that place by me which is Filled by dead eyes too tender to know change That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried, To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove, For grief indeed is love and grief beside. Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love. Yet love me--wilt thou? Open thy heart wide, And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.|$|R
60|$|I {{presently}} became {{immersed in}} planning out my route. <b>When</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> Mabane was working steadily. The others had gone. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> round the room.|$|R
60|$|I had {{forgotten}} {{the woman who had}} brought her into the room. She must have delicately left us together after leading Lucilla in. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> she was not to be seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} used to him, papa. He seemed {{exceedingly}} tall to me at first--like a tower <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at him; but, on the whole, I would rather not have him otherwise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; I was {{not even}} {{thinking}} of her. There was none of the wailing, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> from my rummaging, there was her face {{as if in a}} window or mirror on the wall.' ...|$|E
60|$|Doctor Fifanti {{was writing}} busily {{at the table}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> intruded. He <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> {{thrusting}} his horn-rimmed spectacles high upon his peaked forehead.|$|R

6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{after reading}} this letter I saw the postman hastening [...] away across the sands, and I cried out to him, 'Stop! how am I to send [...] the answer? Will you {{not wait for}} it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|My slight impulse of {{irritation}} {{at such a}} description applied {{to one of my}} wedding guests passed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and saw the person to whom Mr. Bundercombe had directed my attention. I recognized the adequacy of the wording." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless {{and reward}} you!" [...] he said, and drew me toward him quickly and kissed my forehead. I was quite overcome, and sank down and hid my {{face on the}} table. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again he was gone.|$|E

5000|$|As a junior, Berry {{rushed for}} a career-high 162 yards against the Florida A&M. Interviewed after the game, Berry gave the credit to his {{offensive}} line: [...] "Everything went great, and, I mean, yeah, that's {{thanks to my}} O-line." [...] He became a fan favorite as Miami supporters [...] "rhythmically chanted" [...] his last name ("Berry, Berry, Berry ...") when he entered games. Asked in November 2009 about whether he lacked the moves to shake defenders, Berry replied:"If you're not a defensive lineman or a legit linebacker, I'm going to run through you. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> and see nothing but one guy (in front of him), I'm going through him. ... They say I can't shake (defenders). I got moves, but why use it when you don't need it? I'm more of a power back. I'd rather run straight through you than try to run around you."During the 2009 season, Berry rushed for 616 yards, averaging 6.6 yards per carry, and led the Hurricanes with eight touchdowns.|$|R
60|$|One morning Tom {{was later}} than usual in getting home. I {{was writing a}} letter when he came in, and did not notice him, yet I was vaguely aware of his {{standing}} over me. <b>When</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>I</b> gathered from his expression that something serious had happened, so mournful was his face, and yet so utterly ludicrous.|$|R
60|$|He {{had come}} close to my chair, and was leaning down, so that his head nearly touched mine. Really, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> I {{thought that he was}} going to take me into his arms. I looked up and laughed softly into his face.|$|E
6000|$|She caressed my hand, {{but did not}} speak; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> her worn {{face had}} dropped on the pillow, {{and her eyes were}} closed. [...] "I am tired--tired," [...] she murmured. [...] "Stay with me a little longer, but leave me if I sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|So I was pondering, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> and saw Charlotte {{standing}} in the entrance between the court and garden, {{looking at me and}} smiling, as she shaded her eyes with her hand from the sun, and then she ran to me lightly as a lapwing.|$|E
60|$|Lucille moved {{a little}} away from me, and I {{could not see}} her face, for she looked back towards the train of cars which came clanking down the track; but for once words were given me, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ceased, she <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again. Though the rich damask had deepened in her cheek, there was a {{significant}} question in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Each man's {{knife in}} its sheath in his girdle, {{loosened}} for dinner. As the first man, with a knowingly kindled eye, watches the filling of the poisoned chalice (truly {{but a very}} small tin mug, to be prosaic), and, tossing back his head, tosses the contents into himself, and passes the empty chalice and passes on, so the second man with an anticipatory wipe of his mouth on sleeve or handkerchief, bides his turn, and drinks and hands and passes on, in whom, and in each as his turn approaches, beams a knowingly kindled eye, a brighter temper, and a suddenly awakened tendency to be jocose with some shipmate. Nor do I even observe that {{the man in charge}} of the ship's lamps, who in right of his office has a double allowance of poisoned chalices, seems thereby vastly degraded, even though he empties the chalices into himself, one after the other, much as if he were delivering their contents at some absorbent establishment in which he had no personal interest. But vastly comforted, I note them all to be, on deck presently, even to the circulation of redder blood in their cold blue knuckles; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at them lying out on the yards, and holding on for life among the beating sails, I cannot for MY life see the justice of visiting on them--or on me--the drunken crimes of any number of criminals arraigned at the heaviest of assizes.|$|R
6000|$|I was at {{the bedroom}} window when the time {{approached}} for Philip's arrival. Quite {{at the far end}} of the road, I discovered him. He was on foot; he walked like a king. Not that I ever saw a king, but I have my ideal. Ah, what a smile he gave me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> made him <b>look</b> <b>up</b> by waving my handkerchief out of the window! [...] "Ask for papa," [...] I whispered as he ascended the house-steps.|$|R
