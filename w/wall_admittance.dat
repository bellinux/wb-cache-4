The circular microstrip antenna is calculated using the cavity model. The electromagnetic fields within the antenna cavity are determined from the impedance boundary condition at the side aperture. The contribution from the region outside the antenna is taken into account by the <b>wall</b> <b>admittance.</b> The <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> {{is defined by the}} magnetic field produced by the equivalent magnetic current at the aperture. The magnetic field is calculated by the spectral domain method. The wall admit-tances obtained by this method are compared with the results calculated by Shen. The calculated input impedances of the mi-crostrip antenna agree fairly well with the experimental data for the substrate thickness of up to 0. 048 λg.

40|$|A field {{matching}} method is described to analyze a recessed circular cavity radiating into a radial waveguide. Using the wall impedance approach, {{the analysis is}} divided into two separate problems of the cavity and its external environment. Based on this analysis, a computer algorithm is developed for determining <b>wall</b> <b>admittances</b> as seen {{at the edge of the}} patch in the cavity, the radial admittance matrix for the two-probe feed arrangement, and the input impedance as observed from the coaxial line feeding the cavity. This algorithm is tested against the general-purpose Hewlett-Packard finite-element High Frequency Structure Simulator as well as against measured results. Good agreement in all considered cases is noted...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{propagation}} in infinite, semiinfinite, and finite circular ducts with circumferentially varying <b>wall</b> <b>admittances</b> is investigated analytically. The infinite case is considered, and {{an example}} demonstrates {{the effects of}} wall-admittance distribution on dispersion characteristics and mode shapes. An exact solution is obtained for the semiinfinite case, a circular duct with a flanged opening: sidelobe suppression and circumferential-mode energy scattering leading to radiated-field asymmetry are found. A finite duct system with specified hard-walled pressure sources is examined in detail, evaluating reflection coefficients, transmission losses, and radiated-field directivity. Graphs and diagrams are provided, {{and the implications of}} the results obtained for the design of aircraft-turbofan inlet liners are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> of an {{arbitrarily}} shaped {{microstrip antenna}} is generally formulated. As examples, elliptical microstrip antennas {{with and without}} a circular slot are calculated. The <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> is determied by the spectral domain analysis in order to consider {{the effect of the}} dielectric substrate. The electromagnetic fields within thye cavity are expanded in terms of the eigenfunctions in the cylindrical coordinate system and their expansion coefficients are determined by applying the impedance boundary condition at the aperture {{in the sense of the}} least squares. The calculated input impedance and axial ratio agree fairly well with the experimental data. The proposed method is valid for the microstrip antennas with a patch whose geometry deviates from the particular coordinate system, such as single-feed circularly polarized microstrip antennas...|$|E
40|$|A two {{dimensional}} study is presented {{on the behavior}} of long waves in lined, curved ducts. The analysis includes a comparison between the propagation in curved and straight lined ducts. A parametric study was conducted over a range of <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> and duct wall separation. The complex eigenvalues of the characteristic equation, which {{in the case of a}} curved duct are also the angular wavenumbers, were obtained by successive approximations...|$|E
40|$|The <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> of {{circular}} microstrip antennas with perturbation segments is evaluated using Green's {{functions in}} the spectral domain. The wall susceptances of the primary mode is inductive at the aperture of the perturbation and is capacitive at the aperture except the perturbation segment. The input impedances and axial ratios are calculated by the cavity model with the wall admittances, and the geometry of the patch to radiate circular polarization is determined.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{solution}} to the convected acoustic wave equation and associated boundary conditions for rectangular ducts containing uniform mean flow is examined in terms of the complex mapping between the <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> and characteristic mode eigenvalues. It is shown that the Cremer optimum suppression criteria must be modified to account for the effects of flow below certain critical values of the nondimensional frequency parameter of duct height divided by sound wavelength. The implications of these results on the design of low frequency suppressors are considered...|$|E
40|$|A variational {{technique}} {{is used to}} model sound transmission through a nonuniform duct segment consisting of an axial variation in <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> or cross sectional area. The method involves the Ritz minimization of functionals which have the governing equations as stationary conditions. The variational method is verified by application to segments of variables-separable geometry for which eigenfunction expansion techniques offer an alternative solution procedure, and by comparison {{with the results of}} stepped duct approximations to the nonuniformity. Quantitative data are presented which indicate the boundary condition matching to be a suitable measure of the accuracy of the transmitted field...|$|E
40|$|Morse's {{equation}} for {{the radiation}} impedance of a vibrating rigid piston is extended {{to give the}} generalized radiation impedances of all modes in circular and annular ducts which have arbitrary <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> and which terminate in an infinite baffle. The extended equation is reduced to a single infinite integral which {{is a function of}} the mode radiation directivity factors. An infinite matrix equation is derived which relates the generalized mode reflection coefficients to the radiation impedances. Results are presented which show that the duct-wall admittance is a significant parameter in the effect of duct-determination reflections and that mode-coupling reflection effects may be more important than direct-mode reflection effects...|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{theory is}} used to {{calculate}} the acoustic field of a propeller in a soft walled circular wind tunnel and to compare the radiation patterns to the same propeller in free space. Parametric solutions are present for a "Gutin" propeller for a variety of flow Mach numbers, admittance values at the wall, microphone position locations, and propeller to duct radius ratios. Wind tunnel boundary layer is not included in this analysis. For <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> nearly equal to the characteristic value of free space, the free field and ducted propeller models agree in pressure level and directionality. In addition, the need for experimentally mapping the acoustic field is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the effect of changes in duct wall acoustic properties on the transmission of sound through ducts. Two special problems are considered. The first problem is that of a rectangular infinite-length duct with airflow and a single change in duct wall acoustic admittance. The second problem is that of an axisymmetric field in a finite circular duct without airflow and with an arbitrary number of duct wall acoustic admittance changes. Results for the first problem show the effect of <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> change and flow on the acoustic power transmission within the duct. Results for the second problem show the interactive effects of multiple duct liner sections on power radiated from a finite duct...|$|E
40|$|A {{geometrical}} acoustics {{approach is}} proposed {{as a practical}} design tool for absorbent liners in such short flow ducts as {{may be found in}} turbofan engine nacelles. As an example, a detailed methodology is presented for three different types of sources in a parallel plate duct containing uniform ambient flow. A plane wave whose wavefronts are not normal to the duct walls, an arbitrarily located point source, and a spatially harmonic line source are each considered. Optimal <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> distributions are found, and it is shown how to estimate the insertion loss for any admittance distribution. The extension of the methodology to realistic source distributions in variable area cylindrical or annular ducts containing arbitrary flow is shown to be conceptually straightforward and computationally practical on a vector-hardware digital computer...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented for the wave propagation in two-dimensional and circular lined ducts {{taking into account}} the effects of viscosity in both the mean and the acoustic problems. The method of composite expansions is used to express each acoustic flow quantity as the sum of an inviscid part and a boundary layer part insignificant outside a thin layer next to the wall. The problem is reduced to solving a second-order ordinary differential equation for the pressure perturbation as in the inviscid acoustic case but with a modified specific <b>wall</b> <b>admittance.</b> An analytic expression is presented for the variation of the modified admittance with the wall and flow parameters, such as the acoustic boundary layer thickness, the mean velocity and temperature gradients at the wall, the frequency of oscillation, and the wavelength...|$|E
40|$|Rigorous {{solutions}} are presented for sound diffraction {{in a circular}} cylinder with axial discontinuities of the <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> (or impedance). Analytical expressions are derived for the reflection and the transmission coefficients for duct modes. The results are discussed quantitatively in the limits of small admittance shifts (delta) and of low frequencies (ka). One of the results is the low frequency behavior of the reflection coefficient R(o) sub 00 of the fundamental mode. For the mode of a hardwall duct reflected from the junction with a softwall duct, (R(o) sub oo yields - (1 -square root of (ka) square root of (2 /i delta)); this result {{is in contrast to}} the frequency dependence of the reflection from the open end of a hardwall duct, for which R(o) sub oo yields - 1 -(ka) squared/ 2...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} work on {{the boundary}} layer receptivity problem has utilized large Reynolds number asymptotic theories, thus being limited to a narrow part of the frequency - Reynolds number domain. An alternative approach is presented for the prediction of localized instability generation which has a general applicability, and also accounts for finite Reynolds number effects. This approach is illustrated for the case of Tollmien-Schlichting wave generation in a Blasius boundary layer due to the interaction of a free stream acoustic wave with a region of short scale variation in the surface boundary condition. The specific types of wall inhomogeneities studied are: regions of short scale variations in wall suction, <b>wall</b> <b>admittance,</b> and wall geometry (roughness). Extensive comparison is made between {{the results of the}} finite Reynolds number approach and previous asymptotic predictions, which also suggests an alternative way of using the latter at Reynolds numbers of interest in practice...|$|E
40|$|Eigenvalue {{equations}} of {{the form}} D(lambda) = 0 are studied for acoustic modes in circular and annular ducts without flow. The ducts have locally reacting walls with arbitrary <b>wall</b> <b>admittance.</b> It is shown that circular ducts may have double eigenvalues, or wall admittances where both D(lambda) and D prime (lambda) are zero. These double eigenvalues are formed by the coalescence of the lowest-order eigenfunction with some higher-order eigenfunction. The eigenfunctions, or acoustic modes, associated with the double eigenvalues {{are found to be}} orthogonal to themselves so that the standard expansion formula for the acoustic field, which is obtained from a separation-of-variables analysis, is invalid. An alternate expansion formula for the acoustic field is derived. This alternate formula shows that the coalesced acoustic mode is linearly amplified by the transmission distance and exponentially attenuated at the expected rate. The expansion formula also reveals a new eigenfunction, or acoustic mode, which is exponentially attenuated {{at the same rate as}} the coalesced eigenfunction...|$|E
40|$|Three {{approximate}} methods - finite differences, weighted residuals, and {{finite elements}} - {{were used to}} solve the eigenvalue problem which arises in finding the acoustic modes and propagation constants in an absorptively lined two-dimensional duct without airflow. The matrix equations derived {{for each of these}} methods were solved for the eigenvalues corresponding to various values of wall impedance. Two matrix orders, 20 x 20 and 40 x 40, were used. The cases considered included values of <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> for which exact eigenvalues were known and for which several nearly equal roots were present. Ten of the lower order eigenvalues obtained from the three approximate methods were compared with solutions calculated from the exact characteristic equation in order to make an assessment of the relative accuracy and reliability of the three methods. The best results were given by the finite element method using a cubic polynomial. Excellent accuracy was consistently obtained, even for nearly equal eigenvalues, by using a 20 x 20 order matrix...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundary}} layer receptivity to free-stream acoustic {{waves in the}} presence of localized surface disturbances is studied for the case of incompressible Falkner-Skan flows with adverse pressure gradients. These {{boundary layer}}s are unstable to both viscous and inviscid (i. e., inflectional) modes, and the finite Reynolds number extension of the Goldstein-Ruban theory provides a convenient method to compare the efficiency of the localized receptivity processes in these two cases. The value of the efficiency function related to the receptivity caused by localized distortions in surface geometry is relatively insensitive to the type of instability mechanism, provided that the same reference length scale is used to normalize the efficiency function for each type of instability. In contrast, when the receptivity is induced by variations in wall suction velocity or in <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> distribution, the magnitudes of the related efficiency functions, as well as the resulting coupling coefficients, are smaller for inflectional (i. e., Rayleigh) modes than for the viscous Tollmien-Schlichting waves. The reduced levels of receptivity can be attributed mainly to the shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies of the inflectional modes. Because the most critical band of frequencies shifts toward higher values, the overall efficiency of the wall suction- and the wall admittance-induced receptivity decreases with an increase in the adverse pressure gradient...|$|E
40|$|Receptivity {{processes}} by which free-stream acoustic waves generate instability waves in boundary layers are investigated. Concentration is placed on mechanisms associated with local regions of short scale variation in wall suction or admittance distribution. These mechanisms are relevant to laminar flow control technology, in which suction is utilized to control the growth of boundary layer instabilities. The receptivity process requires a transfer of energy from the long wavelength of the free-stream disturbance to the short wavelength of the instability wave. In the case of wall suction, this occurs through the unsteady modulation, by the acoustic wave, of the short scale mean flow variation due to the steady wall suction. In the <b>wall</b> <b>admittance</b> mechanism, the boundary condition for the unsteady motion contains a short scale variation which directly scatters energy from the acoustic wave into the instability wave. The latter mechanism {{does not require a}} short scale adjustment in the mean boundary layer. Time harmonic, two and three-dimensional interactions are analyzed using the asymptotic, high Reynolds number, triple deck structure. The influence of subsonic compressibility is examined for the case of two-dimensional interactions, and a similarity transform is found which reduces the problem to an equivalent incompressible flow. For three-dimensional interactions, a similarity transform is possible only in the Fourier transform wavenumber space, and in the equivalent two-dimensional problem the frequency is complex. However, in many cases of practical interest, the imaginary component of this frequency is quite small and can be neglected. The acoustic wave orientation and the geometry of the wall suction or admittance distribution are found to significantly influence the amplitude of the generated instability wave. For an isolated, three-dimensional region of wall suction or admittance, instability wave growth is confined to a downstream, wedge shaped region. The saddle point method is utilized to calculate the characteristics of this instability wave pattern. In some ranges of parameter space, two saddle points are found to make comparable contributions. The instability wave pattern in these directions exhibits a beat phenomenon, due to constructive and destructive interference of the contributions from the two saddle points...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Industry often {{requires}} the sorting of one material from another. Although {{the detection of}} desired (or undesired) elements is well advanced, the mechanical ejection or removal of particles is fairly underdeveloped. Agriculture and mining applications have used air jets and water jets to eject particles ranging in weight from a few grams to several hundred. With the current trends in mechanization leading towards higher processing speeds, these traditional methods {{have been found to}} be unsuitable: they have slow turn-on and turn-off response times, leading to a high volume of material being ejected with the target. Higher processing speeds will lead to even greater amounts of waste material being ejected thus producing even lower yield concentrations. Thus the need for a quick response time, repetitive, impulse ejection mechanism in the sorting industry is apparent. A kinematic analysis of the required ejection mechanism blast strength shows that the required force depends on the target mass, the required deflection angle the force application angle and the force duration. Acoustical techniques in air are unsuitable as ejection force mechanisms. A water jet is proposed to meets these requirements. This water jet is caused by an electrical discharge in a liquid cavity. This produces a weak shock wave which is focused by the cavity to a nozzle where a slug of water is emitted. The cavity is an elliptical cavity of height h, with the electrodes mounted end on at the first focus and a reflecting cone and nozzle at the second focus. The propagation of weak shock waves in the elliptical cavity is studied theoretically and numerically - using a finite difference simulation program. The reflected converging wave is shown to depend on the cavity eccentricity and the <b>wall</b> <b>admittance.</b> The resulting converging shock wave has an asymmetrical pressure distribution. This analysis is used in the design of a prototype water jet generator. The electrical discharge circuit used for the production of shock waves in the cavity is analysed and the physical discharge process of electrical to shock energy conversion reviewed. Conditions for the maximisation of this transfer correspond to large water gap resistances, high voltages and low circuit inductances. Experiments on the prototype generator show that the transient water jet slug energy is relatively low. High speed photographic techniques reveal that the jet velocity is of the order of 30 m/s. Published results show much higher jets speeds are possible. The operation of the electrical discharge circuit is found to critically influence the water jet performance - electrical measurements show that the circuit is a sub-optimum, underdamped RLC circuit. The cone / nozzle operation is also shown to have a marked effect on performance. The nozzle in particular requires optimisation. The prototype in its present form is not suitable for use in an ejection system. Although the pulse length, rise time and channel spread of the device are suitable, the blast strength is not sufficient for deflection of the heaviest range of particles. Optimisation of the electrical circuit and increased energies will increase the blast strength...|$|E
