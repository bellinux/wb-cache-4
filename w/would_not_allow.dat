5|$|The British {{released}} Brand on 5 October 1944. Brand {{said they}} <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> {{him to return}} to Hungary and forced him to travel to Palestine. Bauer disputes this, writing that Brand was simply afraid of returning to Budapest, convinced the Germans would murder him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of his father, Caligula lived with his mother until her {{relations}} with Tiberius deteriorated. Tiberius <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> Agrippina to remarry for fear her husband would be a rival. Agrippina and Caligula's brother, Nero, were banished in 29 AD on charges of treason.|$|E

5|$|In later life, he {{attempted}} to have Anna Maria Luisa recognised as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but CharlesVI, Holy Roman Emperor, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and he felt he alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan foundered, and in 1737, upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.|$|E
5|$|Brudenell {{was a fine}} rider and, {{inspired}} by the decisive role of cavalry {{at the battle of}} Waterloo, his wish was to purchase a commission in a fashionable regiment and serve as an army officer. His father, however, mindful of preserving the family pedigree from risk of battle, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> this. Instead in November 1815 he was sent up to Christ Church, Oxford; as an aristocrat he was automatically granted admission without examination. He left in his third year—aristocrats with no academic bent were released after only two years—but despite showing some aptitude, he did not take a degree.|$|E
5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the conviction. Local newspaper coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was deemed to be inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E

5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> him the materials to prepare an adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Malón, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> it and that they would not reunite the band if the four members do not have a good personal relationship.|$|E
5|$|His father, disapproving of Darling's {{fondness for}} sport, sent {{him away from}} his cricket and Australian rules {{football}} teams to spend twelve months at Roseworthy Agricultural School. Later, Darling worked in a bank for a time and before his father appointed him manager of one of a wheat farm. Working on the farm added size and strength to an already stocky and athletic frame. He was selected for the South Australian team at age 19, but his father <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> him time off the farm to play.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{major issue}} during Panetta's tenure as Defense Secretary was the Obama administration's {{diplomatic}} effort to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In January 2012, Panetta stated that nuclear weapons development was a [...] "red line" [...] that Iran <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>allowed</b> to cross {{and that the}} United States was keeping all options, including military ones, open to prevent it. He said that Iran <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be <b>allowed</b> to block the Straits of Hormuz.|$|R

5|$|In 1890, a {{labor dispute}} {{led to the}} {{formation}} of a new league, composed of most of the better players from the National League. Although he was invited to join the competing league, Sunday's conscience <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> him to break his contract with Pittsburgh. Sunday was named team captain, and he was their star player, but the team suffered one of the worst seasons in baseball history. By August the team had no money to meet its payroll, and Sunday was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for two players and $1,000 in cash.|$|E
5|$|In July 2008, Autolink {{canceled}} {{their contract}} with Ofotbanen. Two weeks later, Autolink {{announced that they}} would establish their own railway company, {{which they had been}} working with since March. They stated that the deal with Ofotbanen was discontinued because Rail Management <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> additional private placements of capital, nor sell their shares to Autolink. From 29 July, all automotive trains stopped running, and no cars were transported for ten days. The same day, all board members in Ofotbanen representing Autolink withdrew from their positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips {{what would happen}} if Nhu responded to the cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

Schumacher was there on that occasion because Ferrari <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> anyone else to drive the one-of-a-kind black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show. The FXX was presented to Schumacher upon his retirement at Monza in 2006.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December {{the family}} moved to Versailles for two weeks during which, through a court connection, they were able to attend a royal dinner, where Wolfgang was {{reportedly}} allowed to kiss the hand of the Queen. At Versailles they also visited the famous courtesan Madame de Pompadour, then in the last months of her life"an extremely haughty woman who still ruled over everything", according to Leopold. In Nannerl's later recollections, Wolfgang was made to stand on a chair to be examined by the Madame, who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> him to kiss her.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 1948 Lafayette College {{was invited}} by the Sun Bowl Committee {{to play against}} the Texas College of Mines, now The University of Texas at El Paso. Just four days later, on November 23, the Lafayette faculty voted {{to turn down the}} bid because the Sun Bowl Committee <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> Showell to play. This bid {{rejection}} led to a large student demonstration on the Lafayette campus and in the city of Easton against segregation.|$|E

Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to 'put herself on ice', saying that he would only have time for her after the war. Specht however did not survive, dying five months before the war in Europe came to an end.|$|E
5|$|The {{story behind}} the episode was {{inspired}} by several wars and occupations in the past, including the Quartering Acts and the Iraq War. Several parts of the episode changed from the script, more predominantly the scenes involving a suicide bombing. The producers were worried that the Sci Fi Channel <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> {{the inclusion of the}} scene. The episode was seen by 2.2 million viewers and attracted generally positive reactions from critics. In addition, Moore's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and a Writers Guild of America award.|$|E
5|$|There was no {{official}} outcome from these hearings, but Congress subsequently passed a Consular Reform Bill {{which included a}} provision that specifically <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>allow</b> a diplomat, such as Magoon, to hold a separate administrative position. Rather than remove Magoon {{from one of his}} positions, he was named to become vice governor-general of the Philippines. Ultimately, this offer was rescinded before it could take effect, and he was instead appointed governor of Cuba.|$|E
