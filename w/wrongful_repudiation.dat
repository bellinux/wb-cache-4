2500|$|Wrongful {{dismissal}} {{refers to}} a termination of employment which contravenes a contract's terms, whether expressly agreed or implied by the courts. This depends on construction of the contract, read {{in the context of}} the statutory charter of rights for employees in the ERA 1996. In the old common law cases, the only term implied by the courts regarding termination was that employers had to give reasonable notice, and what was [...] "reasonable" [...] essentially depended on the professional status of the employee. In Creen v Wright, Lord Coleridge CJ held that a master mariner was entitled to a month's notice, though lower class workers could probably expect much less, [...] "respectable" [...] employees could expect more, and the period between wage payments would be a guide. Now the ERA 1996 section 86 prescribes that an employee should receive one week's notice before dismissal after one month's work, two weeks' notice after two years' work, and so forth up to twelve weeks for twelve years. The employer can give pay in lieu of notice, so long as the weeks' wages for the notice are paid in full. Often, contracts of employment contain express terms regarding a proper disciplinary procedure to be followed if someone is to be dismissed for disputes at work. Dismissals will usually be regarded as both wrongful and unfair if a procedure for dismissal is not followed. If a contractual disciplinary procedure is not followed, the employee may claim damages for the time it would have taken and the potential that she would still be employed. In Societe Generale, London Branch v Geys, the Supreme Court affirmed that a <b>wrongful</b> <b>repudiation</b> of a contract by the employer would not automatically terminate the agreement, because to do so would be to reward the wrongdoer. Only if an employee accepts the purported termination will the contract end. Until then the employer is liable for paying wages, and other terms of the contract, such as dismissal procedures, will survive.|$|E

50|$|The Supreme Court held (Lord Hope, Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Carnworth in the majority) that Mr Geys's {{contract}} was not automatically terminated with Société Générale's <b>wrongful</b> <b>repudiation.</b> The contract would only end {{if the other}} party elected to accept such a repudiation. If it automatically terminated, this would potentially reward the party who wrongfully repudiated the contract on the termination date it chose. In many cases, provisions of a unilaterally repudiated contract would survive and be enforceable, such as covenants against competition or disciplinary procedure clauses. The staff handbook, s.8.3, made no difference {{to the fact that}} an employee had to be notified of termination. Société Générale had not given clear notice to Geys about the payment. It was only on 6 January, when Geys received Société Générale's letter of 4 January, that the contractual right to terminate under the pay in lieu of notice method was validly exercised. Only then did Gey's employment with Société Générale come to an end.|$|E

40|$|On the 19 th December 2012 the Supreme Court {{provided}} {{an answer to}} the longstanding question as to the consequences of a wrongfully repudiated contract of employment. Was it for the innocent party to elect to accept the repudiation to bring the contract to an end? Or, was the contract automatically ended upon the <b>wrongful</b> <b>repudiation?</b> Previous authorities had moved between these elective and automatic theories. The elective theory held that a <b>wrongful</b> <b>repudiation</b> only became effective where the innocent party elected to accept the repudiation. Conversely, the automatic theory considered that the contract ended automatically upon the repudiation. Whilst in traditional contract law, the elective theory had been established as effective, this was not decided with authority in contracts of employment. In Geys, the Supreme Court had the opportunity to consider which was the applicable theory in relation to an employer’s use of a payment-in-lieu of notice (PILON) clause. The Court resolved the conflict (4 - 1 with Lord Sumption dissenting) by holding that the elective theory was preferred in instances of <b>wrongful</b> <b>repudiation</b> of a contract of employment. This judgment has significant implications for employers, but also for employees who wrongfully terminate the contract...|$|E

40|$|If a {{party to}} an {{employment}} contract commits a repudiatory dismissal or resignation, {{it has long been}} unclear whether the other party has the option either to terminate or affirm the contract (the elective theory) or whether the former's breach operates to bring the contract of employment to an end (the automatic theory). The recent decision of the Supreme Court in Société Générale (London Branch) v Geys has finally resolved this question. By a majority, the Supreme Court held that the elective theory also applies {{in the context of a}} <b>wrongful</b> <b>repudiation</b> of the employment contract by express dismissal or resignation. This note examines the significance of Geys in the context of the common law of the contract of employment and evaluates whether a number of related issues surrounding the breach and termination of the employment contract have been resolved...|$|E
