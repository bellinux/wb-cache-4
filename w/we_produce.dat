5|$|Before 2000, our factory used {{to produce}} 600 tons of soap annually. Due to the {{physical}} and economic obstacles we face {{now because of the}} Israeli occupation – and especially the checkpoints – <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> barely half that amount today.|$|E
25|$|Kriyamana is {{everything}} that <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> {{in the current}} life. All kriyamana karmas flow in to sanchita karma and consequently shape our future. Only in human life we can change our future destiny. After death we lose Kriya Shakti (ability to act) and do (kriyamana) karma until we are born again in another human body.|$|E
500|$|The {{same day}} Groening {{released}} his second statement, The Simpsons publicist Antonia Coffman was invited by Wayne Giesy, sales manager of Hull-Oakes Lumber Co. in Bellfountain, Oregon, to visit Oregon and see [...] "responsible timber management." [...] Giesy {{said they wanted}} to show the producers [...] "how we log, how we manufacture, what goods <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> for everyone and how we replant for future generations. What most timber companies are interested in is a balanced program." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Zambia, trade {{minister}} M. Patel complains: [...] "we [...] {{are simply}} not competitive in the way <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> goods". In a post Cold War, WTO-oriented Africa, consumer goods manufacturers never recovered from {{the first wave of}} Chinese products. Basic African factories cannot compete with the Chinese in terms of productivity or quality.|$|E
2500|$|An {{application}} of monoids {{in computer science}} is so-called MapReduce programming model (see [...] ). MapReduce, in computing, consists {{of two or three}} operations. Given a dataset, [...] "Map" [...] consists of mapping arbitrary data to elements of a specific monoid. [...] "Reduce" [...] consists of folding those elements, so that in the end <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> just one element.|$|E
30|$|To {{examine the}} {{morphological}} and dynamic signatures of {{the shapes and}} motions of the omega bands, <b>we</b> <b>produced</b> movie files using the original 3 -s-resolution ASI data.|$|R

30|$|We {{have shown}} that codA is an {{effective}} negative selection marker. <b>We</b> <b>produced</b> and molecularly characterized transgenic citrus expressing one or more copies of the codA gene without any observable phenotypic abnormalities.|$|R
2500|$|If we {{condense}} the skew entries into a vector, , then <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> a 90° rotation {{around the}} -axis for (1,0,0), around the -axis for (0,1,0), {{and around the}} -axis for (0,0,1). The 180° rotations are just out of reach; for, in the limit as , [...] does approach a 180° rotation around the [...] axis, and similarly for other directions.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, the American {{sociologist}} Read Bain {{wrote that}} [...] "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices {{and the skills}} by which <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> and use them." [...] Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. [...] Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as {{the things that people}} make and use. More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of [...] "technique" [...] to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (techniques de soi).|$|E
60|$|A. It must be small, as <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> {{little that}} is wanted in Britain. I suppose it cannot exceed £40,000.|$|E
30|$|After verifying each actual subsystem, <b>we</b> <b>produced</b> {{a product}} sample on RTM by {{replacing}} all the subsystems by model with the corresponding actual subsystems with hardware and we certified the product sample on RTM.|$|R
5000|$|Drummer Morrison later said, [...] "This is my {{favourite}} album. This is a really, really fabulous album. <b>We</b> <b>produced</b> this {{ourselves and}} it's {{got the best}} songs, and I think every single song is a classic. And if <b>we</b> had <b>produced</b> those songs the way radio demands - like, if we'd used drum machines and just had synthesisers do must the stuff - I think we could have got a hit." ...|$|R
30|$|As {{shown below}} our study of gene {{expression}} kinetics of growth factors showed that BMP- 2 {{was the most}} rapid and highest expressed factor, followed by BMP- 7 and TGF-β 1. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>produced</b> these as recombinant proteins in plants.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what use}} are these deeds now?" [...] said his lordship. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> them, we may give a colour to this fellow's claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> marvellous cures {{within the}} organism, but we {{draw the line}} at the {{periphery}} of the body. Telekinesis is to me the word of a lively fictionist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You try," [...] said Ezra coldly. [...] "If you get {{one-third of}} what you gave for your claim you'll be lucky. Why, man, you don't suppose <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> {{diamonds}} for local consumption. They are for exporting to Europe, and if Europe is already supplied by Russia, where are you to get your market?" ...|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>produced</b> {{logistic}} regression models for 1000 bootstrapped samples, sampled with replacement, from our dataset (Fox 2002). We averaged these models {{to produce a}} final validation model to compare the ORs, 95  % CIs, p values, and the AIC with our prediction model.|$|R
30|$|As the 3 rd step of MBD/UM as HCD cycle, {{a design}} {{solution}} {{has to be}} produced to meet the user requirements. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>produced</b> a design solution of the approach function on Robot for MBS on RTM to meet the user requirements.|$|R
60|$|We do {{not differ}} from known savages {{in being able to}} bring on non-normal {{psychological}} conditions, but <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> these, as a rule, by other methods than theirs, and such experiments are not made on all of us, as they were on all Red Indian boys and girls in the 'medicine-fast,' at the age of puberty.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{continued}} Colville, {{dropping his}} ironical tone, [...] "that we've {{much less to}} regret in their unsuspecting, unsophisticated freedom than {{in the type of}} hard materialism which <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> in young girls, perfectly wide awake, disenchanted, unromantic, who prefer the worldly vanities and advantages deliberately and on principle, recognising something better merely to despise it. I've sometimes seen them----" ...|$|E
60|$|ARJILLAX. That is false. The statue {{comes to}} life always. The statues of today are {{the men and women}} of the next incubation. I hold up the marble figure before the mother and say, 'This is the model you must copy.' <b>We</b> <b>produce</b> what we see. Let no man dare to create in art a thing that he would not have exist in life.|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{contrast}} echocardiography (MCE) {{has potential}} {{value in the}} assessment and quantitation of myocardial perfusion defects. However, the severity of stenosis detectable by MCE and its diagnostic accuracy remain undefined.

30|$|Then, <b>we</b> <b>produced</b> {{a design}} {{solution}} to meet user requirements for MBS on RTM. For producing the design solution, MBD was effective {{to produce a}} device model of Robot and UM of Target as subsystems for MBS on RTM {{without the need for}} developing any new hardware.|$|R
6000|$|The little Yankee {{had slipped}} {{to his feet}} with some return of a cock-fighting coolness. [...] "The defence," [...] he said, [...] "omits a coldly colossal fact. They say <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> none of the actual victims. Wal, here is one victim--England's celebrated and {{stricken}} Warner. I reckon he is pretty well produced. And they suggest that all the outrages were followed by reconciliation. Wal, there's no flies on England's Warner; and he isn't reconciliated much." ...|$|E
60|$|The mind of man has {{naturally}} a {{far greater}} alacrity and satisfaction in tracing resemblances than in searching for differences: because by making resemblances <b>we</b> <b>produce</b> NEW IMAGES; we unite, we create, we enlarge our stock; but in making distinctions we offer no food {{at all to the}} imagination; the task itself is more severe and irksome, and what pleasure we derive from it is something of a negative and indirect nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is only {{my light}} touch," [...] {{returned}} Turnbull. [...] "These hansom-cab rides {{will raise the}} tone--raise the tone, my dear fellow--of our London youths, widen their horizon, brace their nervous system, make them acquainted with the various public monuments of our great city.

30|$|In {{response}} to incidents at Central Manchester Foundation Trust, <b>we</b> <b>produced</b> {{a series of}} educational videos to improve our CVC complication rate. Whilst other videos are available, they are of varying quality and we believed it beneficial to demonstrate locally accepted technique, using locally available equipment.|$|R
