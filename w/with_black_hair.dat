5|$|Ibuki's build is {{depicted}} as slim and athletic, <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> held tightly back in a topknot ponytail that drops well beneath her waist. Her usual fighting outfit, in which she has appeared {{in most of the}} games, is a type of ninja dogi, consisting of a sleeveless upper garment, baggy pants (slit at the sides), arm guards, and a mask that conceals the lower half of her face. Her footwear consists only of cloth bandages wrapped around her shins, ankles and instep. Ibuki's alternative, everyday costume is a blue-and-white Japanese schoolgirl uniform, or casual clothes—in the same color scheme—with a chain of miniature kunai knives and a fake tanuki tail, introduced in Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition. One of her scrapped costume concepts for Super Street Fighter IV was a very distinct, partially armored ninja outfit, which was more skimpy and featured two Japanese swords on her back.|$|E

25|$|The medical {{examiner}} {{determined that the}} body was that of an Hispanic, Native American or Asian male between three and five years old <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> Due to the advanced decomposition of the body, however, even eye color and exact cause of death were impossible to determine. He was interred following a plot-side service in October 2007, in a donated plot, accompanied by a teddy bear; both his remains and the teddy bear were covered by a multi-design decorated blanket.|$|E

500|$|Warwick Davis played Filius Flitwick in {{the first}} two films as an old dwarf-like man with gray hair. In {{pre-production}} for the third film, the producers told Davis there was no role for Flitwick, but {{that they would like to}} have him play somebody else, at least for a cameo. Davis played a much younger-looking man <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and a moustache who directed the choir at the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, and was credited as portraying [...] "Wizard". During pre-production for the fourth film, director Mike Newell told Davis he wanted to keep his look from the last film but make this the new look for Flitwick. Davis now considers the character he has played some relative of Flitwick, though he is still credited as [...] "Filius Flitwick". In the sixth film, Harry specifically calls him Professor Flitwick, as does McGonagall in the seventh, calling him Filius.|$|E
500|$|Henry was the {{youngest}} of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers Robert Curthose, Richard and William Rufus, being, as historian David Carpenter describes, [...] "short, stocky and barrel-chested," [...] <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. He probably knew his sister, Adela, well, as the two were close in age. There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy. He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by Bishop Osmund, the King's chancellor, at Salisbury Cathedral; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to {{become a member of the}} clergy. It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read Latin and had some background in the liberal arts. He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.|$|E

500|$|Each of {{the three}} Presley singles {{released}} {{in the first half}} of 1957 went to number one: [...] "Too Much", [...] "All Shook Up", and [...] "(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released. Under the headline [...] "Presley Records a Craze in Soviet", The New York Times reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad. Between film shoots and recording sessions, the singer also found time to purchase an 18-room mansion eight miles (13km) south of downtown Memphis for himself and his parents: Graceland. When he reported to the film studio for his second film, the Technicolor Loving You, released in July, [...] "The makeup man said that with his eyes he should photograph well <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> so they dyed it." [...] Loving You, the accompanying soundtrack, was Presley's third straight number one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the Jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his [...] "good-luck charm".|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} mascot {{was revealed}} on a press-conference dedicated to 100 {{days before the}} Chess Olympiad held in Baku on 25 May 2016. The name of the mascot is [...] "Chess Mate" [...] and it represents a boy clad in a national dress. The author of the mascot is Musa Changiev, whose suggestion was selected out of 600 received in the national competition launched by the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee in March 2016. Changiev explained that he started working on the mascot once he collected some information about the game and tried to [...] "create an image of someone energetic and fond of thinking". He {{came up with the}} image of a young chess player <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and brows that are typical for the Azerbaijani people. The youngster wears glasses and is clad in a combination of national and modern features. Changiev added that the king's gown in which the youngster is worn symbolises the King as an important chess piece as well as the kings in the history of Azerbaijan. The gown is decorated with some Buta images and carpet patterns, which are traditional for the host country. The youngster's shirt, trousers and shoes are the modern features.|$|E
500|$|Anne exerted a {{powerful}} charm {{on those who}} met her, though opinions differed on her attractiveness. The Venetian diarist Marino Sanuto, who saw Anne when Henry VIII met Francis I at Calais in October 1532, described her as [...] "not one of the handsomest women in the world; she is of middling stature, swarthy complexion, long neck, wide mouth, bosom not much raised... eyes, which are black and beautiful". Simon Grynée wrote to Martin Bucer in September 1531 that Anne was [...] "young, good-looking, of a rather dark complexion". Lancelot de Carle called her [...] "beautiful with an elegant figure", and a Venetian in Paris in 1528 also reported that {{she was said to}} be beautiful. The most influential description of Anne, but also the least reliable, was written by the Catholic propagandist and polemicist Nicholas Sanders in 1586, half a century after Anne's death: [...] "Anne Boleyn was rather tall of stature, <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> and an oval face of a sallow complexion, as if troubled with jaundice. It is said she had a projecting tooth under the upper lip, and on her right hand six fingers. There was a large wen under her chin, and therefore to hide its ugliness she wore a high dress covering her throat... She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth". Sanders held Anne responsible for Henry VIII's rejection of the Catholic Church, and writing fifty years after her death, was keen to demonise her. Sanders's description contributed to what biographer Eric Ives calls the [...] "monster legend" [...] of Anne Boleyn. Though his details were fictitious, they have formed the basis for references to Anne's appearance even in some modern textbooks.|$|E

2500|$|Aspects of Lois' {{personality}} {{have varied}} over the years, {{depending on the}} comic book writers handling of the character and American social attitudes toward women at the time. In most incarnations, Lois has been depicted as a smart, determined, strong-willed and independent person. Her physical appearance has varied over the years, depending either on contemporary fashion, or media adaptations. In the 1990s, when the television series [...] began airing, Lois received a haircut that made her look more like actress Teri Hatcher {{and her eyes were}} typically violet to match her character on [...] Traditionally in the comics, the character has been shown <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> however, from the late 1980s through the '90s, Lois was depicted with auburn hair. In other media, she's been shown with dark blonde hair on the television series Smallville and red hair in the 2013 film Man of Steel.|$|E

The wardens searched for two more days, and then assumed {{that it was an}} escape case, though they wondered why, since his imprisonment period was almost over (...) The crime was there. Approaching the fireplace, Kulesh killed Centurashvili with an axe, burned his clothes, then dismembered him and hid the pieces in snow, in different places, putting specific marks on each burial place. ...

2500|$|Minerva McGonagall is deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor House, Transfiguration professor, {{and later}} Headmistress at Hogwarts, where she began {{teaching}} in December 1956. She is first {{introduced in the}} opening chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, when she meets Dumbledore at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey (the home of Harry's aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley). McGonagall {{is described as a}} tall, rather severe-looking woman, <b>with</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> typically drawn into a tight bun. She wears emerald green robes, a pointed hat, and always has a very prim expression. She speaks with a slight Scottish accent. She is, according to Rowling, a sprightly 70-year-old. McGonagall wears square spectacles that match the markings around the eyes of her Animagus form of a British Shorthair silver tabby cat; she has the distinction of being the first Animagus introduced in the series and being one of the few registered Animagi of the century, though she was rarely seen using the ability. Harry's immediate impression of her is of someone who is not to be crossed. She has a fondness for tartan, and her handkerchief, at least one hat, dressing gown, and dress robes are patterned with it. In the films, McGonagall often wears a Scottish brooch of a specific Scots style set with Cairngorm citrines and Scottish agate.|$|E
