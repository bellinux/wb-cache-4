40|$|Geomagnetic {{observatory}} data {{dates back}} more than 150 years. However, {{since the advent of}} digital recordings in the 1960 s these data have become increasingly separated from their associated metadata. Traditionally, information about an observatory’s instrumentation, data processing history, quality control methods, environment, housing, staffing etc. where noted annually in observatory yearbooks. Whilst many observatories still produce these documents many no longer record metadata in this way. In addition, subsequent changes made to datasets and then submitted to World Data Centres (WDC), have not been well documented leading to discrepancies between different data centres. Furthermore, known issues with particular datasets cannot be highlighted for current or future researchers as there are limited metadata held with or within digital data files. This paper describes the current efforts by the WDC for Geomagnetism, Edinburgh, to improve its holdings with these vital metadata. We describe how <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>collecting</b> and distributing various metadata via our WDC web pages. We also discuss some of the difficulties in capturing, storing and distributing geomagnetic metadata. The time-varying aspect to these data is a great challenge in this regard and is not something well captured in current metadata standards used for geospatial data. We wish to encourage observatory operators to record these vital metadata in some form or another (yearbooks, free-form text etc) and the geomagnetism community to help establish some standard for the level of metadata recorded. ...|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> able to <b>collect</b> vast {{quantities}} of data about the physical world but this has little significance until <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to process it, through analysis or simulation, to extract understanding and meaning. The so called fourth paradigm [1] of data-intensive discovery often requires significant computational power. All sectors of society (commercial, public and academic) have a need to exploit this new approach.|$|R
40|$|With the {{deployment}} of multi-modality and large-scale sensor networks for monitoring air quality, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> able to <b>collect</b> large and multi-dimensional spatio-temporal datasets. For these sensed data, we present a comprehensive visual analysis approach for air quality analysis. This approach integrates several visual methods, such as map-based views, calendar views, and trends views, to assist the analysis. Among those visual methods, map-based visual methods are used to display the locations of interest, and the calendar and the trends views are used to discover the linear and periodical patterns. The system also provides various interaction tools to combine the map-based visualization, trends view, calendar view and multi-dimensional view. In addition, we propose a self-adaptive calendar-based controller that can flexibly adapt the changes of data size and granularity in trends view. Such a visual analytics system would facilitate big-data analysis in real applications, especially for decision making support...|$|R
40|$|Lifelogging is the ambient, {{continuous}} {{digital recording}} of a person’s everyday activities {{for a variety}} of possible applications. Much of the work to date in lifelogging has focused on developing sensors, capturing information, processing it into events and then supporting event-based access to the lifelog for applications like memory recall, behaviour analysis or similar. With the recent arrival of aggregating platforms such as Apple’s HealthKit, Microsoft’s HealthVault and Google’s Fit, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> able to <b>collect</b> and aggregate data from lifelog sensors, to centralize the management of data and in particular to search for and detect patterns of usage for individuals and across populations. In this paper, we present a framework that detects both lowlevel and high-level periodicity in lifelog data, detecting hidden patterns of which users would not otherwise <b>be</b> aware. <b>We</b> detect periodicities of time series using a combination of correlograms and periodograms, using various signal processing algorithms. Periodicity detection in lifelogs is particularly challenging because the lifelog data itself is not always continuous and can have gaps as users may use their lifelog devices intermittingly. To illustrate that periodicity can be detected from such data, we apply periodicity detection on three lifelog datasets with varying levels of completeness and accuracy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} {{relational}} database (Cancer Research Uro-Oncology Database, CRUD) to enable automatic data collection on all urological malignancies within our region, {{as there is}} increasing emphasis on good data collection for surgical patients with cancer, and numerous overlapping systems that are amassing data on the same patients. METHODS: Links have been established between pathological databases, multidisciplinary team data-collection systems and patient-survival monitoring facilities, providing accurate pathology, treatment and survival data on all of uro-oncology patients. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> also developing individual modules for the oncological surgeons within our unit that are compatible with the British Association of Urological Surgeons (Section of Oncology), and have plans to connect to the Medical and Clinical Oncology data systems in the future. RESULTS: Pre-existing protocols for fresh tissue, plasma and urine collection have been incorporated within CRUD via a tissue-tracking system, {{to comply with the}} Human Tissue Act 2004, and link these samples to accurate clinical, pathological and survival data. Many research and audit projects have already used these data, including the construction of a 274 -case tissue microarray for renal cell carcinoma, microRNA hybridization arrays and analysis of 900 nephrectomy cases from the past three decades. CONCLUSIONS: Our work over the past 3 years in Oxford has established numerous links with organizations collecting data on our uro-oncological patients, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b> able to <b>collect</b> this excellent combined data on all of these patients, in an automated manner...|$|R
