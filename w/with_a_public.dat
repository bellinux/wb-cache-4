5|$|Born Elizabeth Fries Lummis, in New York, she {{published}} {{her first}} book, Poems, Translated and Original, in 1835. She married the chemist William Henry Ellet {{and the couple}} moved to South Carolina. She had published several books and contributed to multiple journals. In 1845 she moved back to New York and took {{her place in the}} literary scene there. She was involved <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> scandal involving Edgar Allan Poe and Frances Sargent Osgood and, later, another involving Rufus Wilmot Griswold. Ellet's most important work, The Women of the American Revolution, was published in 1845. The three volume book profiled the lives of patriotic women in the early history of the United States. She continued writing until her death in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{had been}} looking for someone to turn into a martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, a member of the Freikorps and a saboteur who was caught {{attempting}} to blow up a train in the Ruhr region while it was under occupation by French troops in retaliation Germany's not making its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter was executed by the French, and his gravesite later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and would have a memorial built for them in Munich which was required to be saluted when passing by, and who were honored <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> ceremony every year when the Putsch was remembered.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} Summer Olympics, Solo {{received}} a public warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance Canrenone had been detected. Solo {{said in a statement}} she had been prescribed a pre-menstrual medication and was not aware it contained any banned substances. She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E
5|$|Omak is {{a planned}} city. Throughout the 20th century, Ross {{designed}} {{what would become}} the city of Omak. Within a year of its establishment, the town had a central business district <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> bank and hotel supported by the local agricultural industry. The town was provided with a post office, previously known as Epley. Ross founded Omak School District in 1906; soon after this its first school, Omak Schoolhouse, was built. In 1910, a meat market, hardware shop, law office, stationery and confectionery store were constructed in Downtown Omak. A steel bridge built the following year collapsed into the Okanogan River upon initial use. It was quickly rebuilt with no further problems.|$|E
5|$|Romney used a {{bully pulpit}} {{approach}} towards promoting his agenda, staging well-organized media events to appeal {{directly to the}} public rather than pushing his proposals in behind-doors sessions with the state legislature. He dealt <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> crisis of confidence in Boston's Big Dig project– that followed a fatal ceiling collapse in 2006– by wresting control of the project from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority. After two years of negotiating the state's participation in the landmark Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative that instituted a cap-and-trade arrangement for power plant emissions in the Northeast, Romney pulled Massachusetts out of the initiative shortly before its signing in December 2005, citing a lack of cost limits for industry.|$|E

5|$|Running {{parallel}} to the main high street is a leat <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (Upper, Middle and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but {{the south end of}} the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat is no longer in use for powering mills and the Environment Agency is not interested in managing the leat nor keeping it flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore and maintain the Leat in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Stanley Halls (in South Norwood) {{were opened}} on 2 February 1903 by Charles Ritchie, 1st Baron Ritchie of Dundee {{at a cost}} of £13,000 (as Stanley Public Hall) to provide the local {{community}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> space for plays, concerts and lectures. It was the first building in Croydon to have electricity. In 1904 a clock tower and a hall were added. In 1993, a blue plaque was installed on a wall of Stanley Halls by English Heritage. The plaque reads W.F.R. STANLEY (1829–1909) Inventor, Manufacturer and Philanthropist, founded and designed these halls and technical school. It is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|The DMK party {{celebrated the}} success of Nadodi Mannan <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> {{function}} on 16 October 1958 at the Tamukkam Ground in Madurai. The function, which was attended by 200,000 people, saw Ramachandran being taken in a procession on a chariot drawn by four horses and garlanded twice. He was awarded a golden sword worth 110 pounds by the party leader C. N. Annadurai and member V. R. Nedunchezhiyan. Ramachandran later donated the sword to the Kollur Mookambika Temple. The film's 100th day theatrical run celebrations were held on 30 November 1958 at the Alagappa College in Madurai.|$|E

5|$|The General Services Administration (GSA) {{attempted}} {{to dispose of}} the Federal Reserve Bank Building through its surplus federal property procedures, but by November 2014 received no compelling applications from government agencies and organizations <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> function. A public auction began on December 5, 2014, with a starting bid set at $5 million, and was initially set to end on January 28, 2015; in late January, bids rose to near $10 million between the eight bidders and forced the auction's deadline to be extended into the following month. Bidding closed on February 7, 2015, with a high bid of $16 million submitted by an undisclosed bidder.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> holiday, {{and many people}} had left {{the city for the}} country. It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E
