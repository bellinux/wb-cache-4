5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>to</b> moderate humidity.|$|E
500|$|Morchella rufobrunnea {{ranges from}} Mexico through California and Oregon in the United States. It {{has also been}} {{introduced}} to central Michigan from California. It is one of seven Morchella species that have been recorded in Mexico. In 2009, Israeli researchers used molecular genetics to confirm {{the identity of the}} species in northern Israel, where it was found growing in gravelly disturbed soil near a newly paved path {{at the edge of a}} grove. This was the first documented appearance of the fungus outside the American continent. Unlike North American populations that typically fruit for only a few weeks in spring, the Israeli populations have a long-season ecotype, fruiting from early November to late May (winter and spring). This period corresponds to the rainy season in Israel (October to May), <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>to</b> moderate temperatures ranging from [...] during the day and [...] at night.|$|E

2500|$|Permanent implant {{brachytherapy}} is {{a popular}} treatment choice for patients <b>with</b> <b>low</b> <b>to</b> intermediate risk features, can be performed on an outpatient basis, and is associated with good 10-year outcomes with relatively low morbidity. [...] It involves the placement of about 100 small [...] "seeds" [...] containing radioactive material (such as iodine-125 or palladium-103) with a needle through {{the skin of the}} perineum directly into the tumor while under spinal or general anesthetic. These seeds emit lower-energy X-rays which are only able to travel a short distance. Although the seeds eventually become inert, they remain in the prostate permanently. The risk of exposure to others from men with implanted seeds is generally accepted to be insignificant. However, men are encouraged to talk to their doctors about any special temporary precautions around small children and pregnant women.|$|E

[...] It was a thriving center of business between approximately the 1660s through the middle of the 20th century. [...] This area has {{had a great deal of}} improvement in the last fifteen years.
