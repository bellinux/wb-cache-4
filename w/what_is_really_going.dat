25|$|Fairly {{straightforward}} statistics provide {{estimates of}} whether associations between genes on lists {{are greater than}} what one would expect by chance. These statistics are interesting, even if they represent a substantial oversimplification of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on. Here is an example. Suppose there are 10,000 genes in an experiment, only 50 (0.5%) of which play a known role in making cholesterol. The experiment identifies 200 regulated genes. Of those, 40 (20%) {{turn out to be}} on a list of cholesterol genes as well. Based on the overall prevalence of the cholesterol genes (0.5%) one expects an average of 1 cholesterol gene for every 200 regulated genes, that is, 0.005 times 200. This expectation is an average, so one expects to see more than one some of the time. The question becomes how often we would see 40 instead of 1 due to pure chance.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Fort {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{he said that}} [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} the Fat Duck is a great restaurant and Heston Blumenthal the most original and remarkable chef this country has ever produced". A. A. Gill for The Times recommended that people should [...] "eat here at least once to find out <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on in your mouth". Also in 2005, German food critic Wolfram Siebeck visited the restaurant complained of the delays in service and of several of the dishes, described the mustard ice cream in a red cabbage gazpacho soup as a [...] "fart of nothingness", while chef Nico Ladenis said of the restaurant, [...] "Someone who makes egg and bacon ice cream is hailed a genius. If you vomit and make ice cream out of it, are you a star?" [...] Tony Naylor of The Guardian enjoyed his trip to the restaurant in 2008, and afterwards criticised those who thought that spending £323.13 on a meal for two at lunchtime was too much.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, {{thanks to}} Kenny, {{the two men}} are mistakenly {{diagnosed}} to have [...] "pinkeye", but they turn into zombies and go around biting other people, turning them into zombies. Back home, Chef, who sees the outbreak on TV, tries to warn both the doctor and Mayor McDaniels (who is having sex with Officer Barbrady), but his pleas are ignored. The boys go trick-or-treating (Kyle now dressed as a vampire), not noticing the outbreak, and abandon Kenny, who continues to eat people. They arrive at Chef's home, and Chef tells them <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on before taking them to the morgue to stop the outbreak. After discovering the hotline number on the Worcestershire sauce bottle, the boys and Chef are attacked by the zombies with Chef becoming the next victim and dancing with other zombies. Stan and Cartman kill the other zombies with chainsaws and Stan hesitates to kill a zombified Wendy. After Kyle discovers he has to kill the original zombie (after being told complicatedly by the hotline lady), he slices Kenny in half, killing him. The spell is broken and all the zombies turn back to normal. Stan makes up with Wendy and they are about to kiss but he ends up puking on her, leaving her disgusted.|$|E
500|$|Damon Wise of Empire called Changeling [...] "flawless", and McCarthy {{said it was}} [...] "emotionally {{powerful}} and stylistically sure-handed". He stated that Changeling was a more complex and wide-ranging work than Eastwood's Mystic River, saying the characters and social commentary were brought into the story with an [...] "almost breathtaking deliberation". He said that as [...] "a sorrowful critique of the city's political culture", Changeling sat {{in the company of}} films such as Chinatown and L.A. Confidential. Honeycutt said the film added a [...] "forgotten chapter to the L.A. noir" [...] of those films, and that Eastwood's melodic score contributed to an evocation of a city and a period [...] "undergoing galvanic changes". Honeycutt said, [...] " [...] small-town feel to the street and sets... captures a society resistant to seeing <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on". Séguret said that while Changeling had few defects, it was mystifying that other critics had such effusive praise for it. Denby said it was beautifully made, but that it shared the chief fault of other [...] "righteously indignant" [...] films in congratulating the audience for feeling contempt for the [...] "long-discredited" [...] attitudes depicted. Ansen concluded that the story was told in such a sure manner that only a hardened cynic would be left unmoved by the [...] "haunting, sorrowful saga".|$|E
2500|$|Rubio's {{reviews from}} {{students}} have been positive, even from students who disagree with him politically. He generally gives the impression of being unbiased and nonpartisan, and when offering his own opinion identifies it as such. [...] Rubio says that he wants students, when they watch the news, to have an appreciation for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on behind the scenes, and says that teaching [...] "forces me to stop sometimes and analyze things".|$|E

50|$|Officer Jeff Alley {{played a}} huge role {{by making sure}} that the TV crews always had a deeper {{understanding}} of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on. He didn't play up the camera but instead took the great opportunity to educate those in TV land about police work with pros and cons of situations and allowed those with an interest in law enforcement to have a better understanding about the job.|$|R

2500|$|In present day, Linden (Mireille Enos) and Holder (Joel Kinnaman) {{look for}} Jamie at Richmond's {{election}} rally. Gwen (Kristin Lehman) tells them he is late, as is Richmond. Holder {{calls in a}} search for Jamie's campaign car. In the parking garage, Gwen tells them that a driver dropped Richmond off at Jamie's grandfather's house. At the house, Jamie finds his grandfather, Ted Wright (Marcel Maillard), talking to Richmond. As Jamie leaves with Richmond, Ted mentions figuring out where Jamie was the night [...] "that girl got killed". Jamie brings Richmond back to the office and informs him that Mayor Adams is conceding. After Richmond demands to know <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on, Jamie admits he arranged to plant the Indian bones at the waterfront construction site to hurt Adams' campaign. Chief Jackson and Michael Ames helped and, in exchange, Jamie promised that Richmond would approve the construction of a casino on the site. When Richmond asks what happened to Rosie, Jamie admits to an [...] "accident".|$|E
2500|$|Weill {{also contributed}} {{greatly to the}} Verfremdungseffekt by his music. Often the music would {{intentionally}} be unsuited for the onstage action, preventing the audience from getting carried away by the onstage emotion. For example, in act 2, scene 13, the hurricane has spared Mahagonny, and the people feel free to do whatever makes them happy. For Jacob Schmidt, this means eating a lot. He sings of how he has not had his fill yet with such lines as [...] "Not enough by half! / I may eat myself for supper." [...] And yet, the music betrays the seeming unbridled ecstasy of Jacob; he is singing to a discordant melody, and the accordion accompaniment sounds stark and rather macabre. The intention is that the audience realizes that all this is very wrong; Jacob claims {{to be having a}} great time, but the music suggests all may not be well, thus the audience needs to pay attention and think about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on. To further this point, Jacob then dies and the chorus sings of how happy he was while dragging out his corpse. This last twist of welcoming death is unexpected and contributes to the alienation.|$|E

50|$|Moreno's ideas {{may have}} {{influenced}} some of the pioneers of family therapy, but also there were developments in general science, namely, cybernetic theory, developed in the mid-1940s, and noting the nature of circularity and feedback in complex systems. By the 1950s, the idea that relationships themselves could be problematic became quite apparent. So, diagnostically, in the sense not of naming a disease or disorder, but just helping people think through <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on, the idea of relational disorder was nothing new.|$|R

6000|$|Yes, my friends. These {{are very}} terrible {{thoughts}}--very wrong thoughts some of them, very foolish thoughts some of them, though pardonable enough; for God pardons them, {{as we shall}} see. But they are real thoughts. They are what really come into people's minds every day; and I am here {{to talk to you}} about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on in your soul, and mine; not to repeat to you doctrines at second-hand out of a book, and say, There, that is what you have to believe and do; and, if you do not, you will go to hell: but to speak to you as men of like passions with myself; as sinning, sorrowing, doubting, struggling human beings; and to talk to you of what is in my own heart, and will be in your hearts too, some day, if it has not been already. This is the experience of all REAL men, all honest men, who ever struggled to know and to do what is right. David felt it all. You find it all through those glorious Psalms of his. He was no comfortable, book-read, second-hand Christian, who had an answer ready for every trouble, because he had never had any real trouble at all. David was not one of them. He had to go through a very rough training--very terrible and fiery trials, year after year; and had to say, again and again, 'I am weary of crying; my heart is dry; my heart faileth me for waiting so long upon my God. All thy billows and storms are gone over me. Thou hast laid me in a place of darkness, and in the lowest deep.' - ...|$|E
6000|$|And now, in {{the second}} half of this book, we will proceed to the {{consideration}} of things that really exist. It is, I deeply regret to say, necessary to return to realities, as they are in your daily life and mine. Our happy holiday in the land of nonsense is over; we shall see no more its beautiful city, with the almost Biblical name of Bosh, nor the forests full of mares' nests, nor the fields of tares that are ripened only by moonshine. We shall meet no longer those delicious monsters that might have talked in the same wild club with the Snark and the Jabberwock or the Pobble or the Dong with the Luminous Nose; the father who can't make head or tail of the mother, but thoroughly understands the child she will some day bear; the lawyer who has to run after his own laws almost as fast as the criminals run away from them; the two mad doctors who might discuss for a million years which of them has the right to lock up the other; the grammarian who clings convulsively to the Passive Mood, and says it is the duty of something to get itself done without any human assistance; the man who would marry giants to giants until the back breaks, as children pile brick upon brick for the pleasure of seeing the staggering tower tumble down; and, above all, the superb man of science who wants you to pay him and crown him because he has so far found out nothing. These fairy-tale comrades must leave us. They exist, but they have no influence in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on. They are honest dupes and tools, as you and I were very nearly being honest dupes and tools. If we come to think coolly of the world we live in, if we consider how very practical is the practical politician, at least where cash is concerned, how very dull and earthy are most of the men who own the millions and manage the newspaper trusts, how very cautious and averse from idealist upheaval are those that control this capitalist society--when we consider all this, it is frankly incredible that Eugenics should be a front bench fashionable topic and almost an Act of Parliament, if it were in practice only the unfinished fantasy which it is, as I have shown, in pure reason. Even if it were a just revolution, it would be much too revolutionary a revolution for modern statesmen, if there were not something else behind. Even if it were a true ideal, it would be much too idealistic an ideal for our [...] "practical men," [...] if there were not something real as well. Well, there is something real as well. There is no reason in Eugenics, but there is plenty of motive. Its supporters are highly vague about its theory, but they will be painfully practical about its practice. And while I reiterate that many of its more eloquent agents are probably quite innocent instruments, there are some, even among Eugenists, who by this time know what they are doing. To them we shall not say, [...] "What is Eugenics?" [...] or [...] "Where on earth are you going?" [...] but only [...] "Woe unto you, hypocrites, that devour widows' houses and for a pretence use long words." ...|$|E

The sources where (1) the zeal for verification of conjectured hypotheses research and (2) to explain the findings with theoretical capitalists demanding and commanding conjecture seldom if ever tapping the reality of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> on.

In time, he concentrates on the efforts of the young, as they have the most to lose: climate change and environmental collapse could take long enough that their elders may not be around to see the worst of what they have done.|$|R
