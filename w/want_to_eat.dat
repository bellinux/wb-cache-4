25|$|In its {{traditional}} form, it is easily {{large enough to}} fill the plate. It is eaten before the main meal as a starter – the idea being that you would then not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> {{as much of the}} more expensive meat.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Oliver {{embarked}} {{upon his}} school dinners campaign {{to improve the}} quality of food fed to pupils in schools. While the campaign was arguably successful, at the time it was a controversial shake-up for students and parents, some of whom believed that the students should have a healthy option available, but still be given the choice as to what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} {{method is}} to make a square pen with a -square garden in it. Plant about six crops, e.g., nettles and artichokes, inside the pen. The snails will choose what they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> If it has not rained, turn sprinklers on for about 15 minutes at dusk, unless the snails are dormant. A disadvantage to this method is that, if the snails are not mature {{at the end of the}} year, it is difficult to replant fresh plant crops in the pens.|$|E
25|$|The partitive–indefinite pro-clitic re is {{used when}} the NP {{refers to a}} new, {{non-specific}} instance of a notion. In order to understand this concept, compare the English sentences 'I ate a banana ' with 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> a banana '. Besides being indefinite in both cases, in the first sentence a banana is specific, because it refers to a specific banana; in the second sentence a banana is non-specific, because it can refer to any banana, not one in particular. Although this semantic difference is not grammaticalized in English, it is in Araki, using re as a marker for non-specific indefinite reference.|$|E
500|$|With his win, Carpenter {{became the}} first {{contestant}} in the worldwide Millionaire franchise to win the show's top prize. He said that the only question that had flustered him was one which asked for {{the location of the}} Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Carpenter eventually remembered that the film Tombstone included the gunfight, and he replied correctly with the answer 'Tombstone, Arizona'. While taking a vacation after his win, Carpenter considered quitting his job with the IRS, but eventually decided against it. He explained to Kiplinger's Personal Finance that [...] "after the taxes, it's not change-your-life kind of money if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> every day." [...] Carpenter also described the fame as having a bigger impact on his life than the money, later stating: [...] "The money doesn't change your life. What happens afterwards might." ...|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere Jenna {{begins to}} worry that her stalker, Maynard Roger Hoynes (Horatio Sanz), has lost {{interest}} in her. Jenna tracks down Maynard and her suspicions are confirmed, after he tells her that his therapist encouraged him to stop his obsession with her and move forward. Later, in the 30 Rock building, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) finds Jenna upset in her dressing room. She tells him why she is in that state and shows him letters that Maynard sent {{to her in the}} past. Kenneth, however, is confused as to why Jenna misses her stalker, leading her to reveal that Maynard has been the longest relationship she has ever had. The next day, Jenna enters her dressing room and sees that her picture is inscribed with the words [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> your boogers." [...] Jenna is touched to find that Kenneth is responsible for the graffito, and thanks him for his thoughtfulness.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing {{praise from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "The Host" [...] a rare A+, noting {{that it was}} [...] "a refreshing instance of a fully and satisfactorily resolved episode — like a perfect meal, although you definitely don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> during this one." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club described the episode as [...] "the first really, really icky X-Files", and while considering redundant the [...] "circular" [...] nature of the plot, with the creature {{coming back to the}} sewers after escaping, he felt that [...] "The Host" [...] "holds up because of the Flukeman's irreconcilable ugliness, and because it continues down the path that [...] "Little Green Men" [...] started on". On a more negative view, Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, considering that [...] "as fun as this episode can be, there are some places were it just doesn’t quite add up", criticizing writing elements such as the lack of resolution, the explanation for the Flukeman's origins, and the [...] "heavy-handed" [...] introduction of X. A writer from the Vancouver Sun listed [...] "The Host" [...] {{as one of the best}} stand alone episodes of the show, saying that it broke the [...] "B-movie fun at best" [...] quality of most X-Files standalone episodes, saying that [...] "thanks to its cinema-grade made-up effects, claustrophobic sets and chilling subject matter, this Chris Carter-penned episode not only took the show to new heights of horror and suspense, it offered a fresh alternative on network television". [...] "The Host" [...] was later picked for the 2008 DVD The X-Files: Revelations, with eight episodes Chris Carter considered [...] "essential grounding" [...] for the film [...] The plot for the episode was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin.|$|E
500|$|Soon after sobering up, Stewie {{stretches}} {{and takes}} out a Jenny Craig Anytime Bar from his shopping bag. [...] Brian loses his temper with Stewie for not revealing that he had been storing food the entire time, and Stewie punishes him by only offering one of the Bars he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> himself (though Brian is happy to have it). After Brian calms down, Stewie asks Brian why he has a gun, noting that Brian is a staunch gun control proponent and seems like the last person who would ever have a gun. Brian doesn't {{want to talk about it}} at first, but eventually admits to Stewie's shock and disbelief that he has the gun in case he ever feels he has to commit suicide. Brian confesses that he cannot find his purpose in life, and finds comfort in knowing he has the option of killing himself. He admits that the Scotch was to be a last drink. Stewie then admits that he would be lost without Brian, claiming he is the only person in the world that he really cares about; he tells a skeptical Brian that his earlier ranting against Brian was only an attack because Brian verball attacked him, and he finally tells Brian he loves him. Brian tells Stewie he loves him back. In addition, Stewie reminds Brian that maybe making someone else happy is enough, because it is the best gift one person can give, for which Brian thanks him. Stewie falls asleep as Brian reads the beginning of David Copperfield to him. The following morning, the vault door opens, and Brian carries a sleeping Stewie and their belongings out of the room in silence. The episode plays the closing credits without music as well.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, areas {{planted with}} wheat in Egypt {{exceeded}} [...] producing approximately 6 million metric tons. The domestic supply price farmers receive in Egypt is EGP 1200 ( [...] US$211) per ton compared to approximately EGP 1940 ( [...] US$340) per ton for import from the USA, Egypt's main supplier of wheat and corn. Egypt is the U.S.'s largest market for wheat and corn sales, accounting for US$1 billion annually and about 46% of Egypt's needs from imported wheat. Other sources of imported wheat, include Kazakhstan, Canada, France, Syria, Argentina and Australia. There are {{plans to increase}} the areas planted with wheat up to nearly [...] by 2017 to narrow the gap between domestic food supply and demand.

2500|$|Zhao was {{appointed}} Party Secretary of Sichuan in 1975, effectively the province's highest-ranking official. Earlier in the Cultural Revolution, Sichuan had been notable for the violent battles that rival organizations of local Red Guards had fought against each other. At the time, Sichuan was China's most populous province, {{but it had}} been economically devastated by the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, whose collective policies had collapsed the province's agricultural production to levels not seen since the 1930s, despite a great increase in the province's population. The economic situation was so bad that citizens in Sichuan were reportedly selling their daughters for food. Soon after taking office, Zhao introduced a series of successful market-oriented reforms, leading to an increase in industrial production by 81% and agricultural output by 25% within three years. Zhao's reforms made him popular in Sichuan, where the local people created a saying: [...] "yao chi liang, zhao Ziyang". (This saying is a pun on Zhao's name, which can be loosely translated as: [...] "if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> look for Ziyang.") ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{the use of}} genetically {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) was rising as a farming practice, as it made {{for the growth of}} larger (and thus less expensive to produce) corn crops. Environmental groups voiced concern over recent research evidence out of Switzerland, warning of the serious human health and environmental hazards involved with the production and consumption of products made with GMOs. Frito-Lay, due in part to its leverage as one of the world's largest purchasers of corn, became the target of lobbying efforts from both proponents and opponents of GMOs. In late 1999, Frito-Lay asked its suppliers not to use genetically engineered corn. A similar announcement followed in early 2000, when the company asked its farmers not to grow genetically modified potatoes. Frito-Lay stated these requests were made in response to consumers' worries, and not in response to protests by the OCA, Greenpeace or other groups. A representative of Greenpeace expressed the perspective that this move was a positive step, stating, [...] "Frito-Lay is about two-thirds of PepsiCo's sales. They realize the handwriting is on the wall and that people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> GMOs".|$|E
2500|$|Nina was {{a singing}} {{champion}} on Tanghalan ng Kampeon, with her winning pieces [...] "Better Days" [...] and [...] "Love Takes Time".

She takes good care of her voice and maintains a healthy diet, and swore it takes her only three days or less to recover from throat infections. In her 2011 documentary on TvN Asia, it was revealed that despite all the fame and success, Nina still regularly comes back to the Center for Pop Music to train her vocals and make it even stronger. She is also known for doing covers of popular hits. She expressed herself in a statement, saying [...] "I can say that the songs I sing in my albums very much represent who I am [...] I try to make it my own even if it was done originally by another artist." ...|$|E
