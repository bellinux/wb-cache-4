6000|$|So {{he took me}} to a mad-house in the Catskills. It was on a bare {{mountain}} frequented only by infrequent frequenters. You {{could see}} nothing but stones and boulders, some patches of snow, and scattered pine trees. The young physician in charge was most agreeable. He gave me a stimulant without applying a compress to the arm. It was luncheon time, and we were invited to partake. There were about twenty inmates at little tables in the dining room. The young physician in charge came to our table and said: [...] "It is a custom <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> not to regard themselves as patients, but merely as tired ladies and gentlemen taking a rest. Whatever slight maladies they may have are never alluded to in conversation." ...|$|E
40|$|The shows {{performed}} by Teatro dei Venti, with the dramaturgy by Vittorio Iervese, and Mario Barzaghi as an Art Direction Advisor, marks {{a new stage}} of four year research study of this theatre. This creation path puts the actor {{to the center of}} the artistic space of the theatre, through the support of his body with its artistic effects. It is a poetic place where the actor, the music and the striking surrounding meet and interact. The dramaturgy tendency is deliberately not linear, it is not descriptive, not narrative, anti-television. In fact the spectator will be invited to a banquet where the aspects of ‘ 900 are covered with theatrical flavorings that assign another taste. The intent of this staging is to project our gests towards an intuitive and emotional experience, towards that childish peculiarity that has faded in the adults. The Teatro dei Venti tries to bring it to life again through images, texts, music and actions. After all the only target of this path and of this show is to share <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests,</b> in a small amount of time, the experience of a century, with its striking memory...|$|E

40|$|In June of this year, I had the {{privilege}} of being able to facilitate a speaking tour for two senior Cuban scholars. Dr. Concepción Nieves Ayús is Dean Institute of Philosophy of Havana, and Dr. Hugo Pons is Vice President Cuban Society of Economists. Working with me on this project, was Dr. Nchamah Miller who I knew as a scholar at York University in Toronto, and is now Visiting Research Professor, Institute of Philosophy, Havana, Cuba. The four of us presented papers on the theme, “Contours of anti-neoliberalism in Latin America and the Caribbean: Case studies from Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia and ALBA”. The principal venue for the presentation of this research, was at Congress 2012, Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences (CFHSS), which this year took place in Waterloo, Ontario, using both the campuses of Wilfrid Laurier University, and the University of Waterloo. The response to the panel was quite positive. It was co-sponsored by two scholarly associations – Canadian Association for the Study of International Development (CASID/ACÉDI), and Society for Socialist Studies (SSS-SÉS), had a very good turnout, and sparked a lively discussion. To take advantage of the visit to Canada by the scholars from Cuba, two other events were organized. An informal, Spanish language event in Toronto, where members of the Hispanic community in the city were able to meet with and discuss <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> issues relevant to both Cuba and Canada, as well as an additional presentation of the Congress panel at the University of Toronto, organized by Ideas Left Out. Both of these events were also well attended and well received. One of the challenges with these kinds of cross-border exchanges is, of course, that of language. In both Waterloo and Toronto, {{we were able to get}} the assistance of extremely professional translators, who provided English translations for the oral presentation of Dr. Nieves Ayús, and provided a wonderful written translation of her text (Dr. Pons both wrote and delivered his paper in English). The panel’s focus was on the challenges facing small Caribbean countries in the context of neoliberalism. There were three different aspects to the discussion. Dr. Pons and Dr. Nieves Ayús provided fascinating, in-depth insights into the complex evolution of economics and politics in contemporary Cuba. Dr. Miller provided an outline and analysis of relations between Colombia and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. My paper focused on the impact in the region of the emergence of two new regional organizations, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). In the discussions which occurred during these presentations, there was considerable interest in developing some of these papers into articles for publication, contact from a publisher interested in a book project, and discussions about how some of this material could be the basis for the development of online courses. All told, it was an extremely fruitful experience. Latin America and the Caribbean have been victims of more than 500 -years of colonialism and imperialism. A key component of both colonialism and imperialism has been the denial of and/or distortion of sovereignty throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Neoliberalism has been but the most recent frame within which to continue this project. The FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) was to have consolidated neoliberalism across the hemisphere, under U. S. hegemony. But the rise of massive social movements throughout the region, prevented the launch of the FTAA in 2005. This has not stopped the attempt to institutionalize neoliberalism. Both the U. S. and Canada have turned to bilateral deals as an alternative to the FTAA. However, we have also seen the creation of regional trade and investment associations independent of the United States and Canada. This paper will examine two of these – ALBA (the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas) and UNASUR (the Union of South American Nations) – and assess their impact as counter-hegemonic projects. The paper builds on earlier research published in New Political Science and forthcoming in The Wiley-Blackwell Encyclopedia of Globalization...|$|E
