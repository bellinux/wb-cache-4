5|$|In 2013, a {{year before}} the {{payphone}} contract was set to expire, there was a competition that sought ideas to further repurpose the network of payphones. The competition, held by the administration of Michael Bloomberg, expanded the idea of the pilot project. There were 125 responses that suggested a <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network,</b> but none of these responses elaborated on how that would be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|The 3.2-megapixels {{camera is}} {{accompanied}} by a LED flash, and allows autofocusing and video recording. More features include a microSD slot and a headphone port. Relatively to its connectivity, the BlackBerry Bold 9700 has support for 3G HSDPA networks and integrates Wi-Fi and GPS. The T-Mobile version of the Bold 9700 supports UMA technology—unlicensed mobile access, which allows making voice calls with a <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network</b> and not just with a celullar network.|$|E
5|$|The iPad can use <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network</b> {{trilateration}} from Skyhook Wireless {{to provide}} location information to {{applications such as}} Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; {{it also has a}} black strip on the back to aid 3G reception. The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no Ethernet or USB port. However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.|$|E

5|$|There {{would be}} 4,550 hubs by July 2019 and 7,500 hubs by 2024, {{by which time}} LinkNYC is {{proposed}} {{to be the largest}} and fastest public, government-operated <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network</b> in the world. Slightly more than half, or 52%, of the hubs would be in Manhattan and the rest would be in the outer boroughs. There would be capacity for up to 10,000 Links within the network, as per the contract. The total cost for installation is estimated at more than $200 million. The eventual network includes 736 Links in the Bronx, 361 of which will have advertising and fast network speeds; as well as over 2,500 in Manhattan, most with advertising and fast network speeds.|$|E
5|$|Utility {{providers}} are regulated monopolies: Xcel Energy supplies electricity, CenterPoint Energy supplies gas, CenturyLink provides landline telephone service, and Comcast provides cable service. In 2007 citywide wireless internet coverage began, provided for 10 years by US Internet of Minnetonka to residents for about $20 per month and to businesses for $30. The Minneapolis <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network</b> earns $1.2 million annual profit {{and as of}} 2010 has about 20,000 customers. The city treats and distributes water and requires payment of a monthly solid waste fee for trash removal, recycling, and drop off for large items. Residents who recycle receive a credit. Hazardous waste is handled by Hennepin County drop off sites. After each significant snowfall, called a snow emergency, the Minneapolis Public Works Street Division plows over 1,000 miles (1,609km) of streets and 400 miles (643.7km) of alleys—counting both sides, the distance between Minneapolis and Seattle and back. Ordinances govern parking on the plowing routes during these emergencies as well as snow shoveling throughout the city.|$|E

25|$|In the {{international}} jetty, {{there is a}} large area where passengers can relax before their flight. Travelers are able to download to their smartphone or e-reader the first chapter of any books available on the platform Lire vous transporte. After that, they can choose to buy the entire book through the <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network</b> in the airport. A rest area has been constructed near gate 57 in order to read these books in a calm environment, with cushions and dimmed lights.

25|$|The city {{is waiting}} to hear {{whether it will be}} {{selected}} by the Government of Ontario as the area for testing driverless cars on public roads. The entire city would become a test centre; this would require the installation of a major new digital infrastructure to enable communications between vehicles, with the roadway and with traffic signals. Preliminary testing of driverless cars has been done here already, by the Waterloo's Centre for Automotive Research, affiliated with the University, but the decision as to where the multimillion-dollar technology grid will be installed has not yet been made by the Province. The city's free <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network</b> may be of value to IT industries and is an indicator of its serious interest in advanced technology.|$|E

25|$|Originally, mobile users {{had to be}} {{connected}} to a <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>network</b> in order to enter the store, hence its original name: iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store. However, at Macworld 2009, Apple issued a software update which automatically allowed 3G and EDGE users to access the store's full functionality for files smaller than 10 megabytes (MB). The iOS 3.0 update added the ability to download movies, TV shows, audiobooks, iTunes U, and ringtones on mobile devices, in addition to the previously available songs and podcasts. On February 18, 2010, Apple increased the 10MB 3G download limit to 20MB. In March 2012, Apple increased the 3G download limit to 50MB, and, in late 2013, Apple increased the limit to 100MB when they released the final version of iOS 7 for their new iPhones.|$|E
25|$|Party Shuffle {{was renamed}} iTunes DJ in iTunes 8. When iTunes was updated to 8.1, {{quite a few}} {{features}} were added to iTunes DJ.

Along with the song request feature voting on songs in the queue was added, the more votes a song gets the higher in the queue it will be and the sooner it will be played. Song voting can only be done when song requesting is enabled and in two ways: the first by right clicking on a song in the iTunes DJ queue on the host's computer in iTunes, the second is in the Remote application ether connected with the iTunes DJ option by a guest or by the host in the full playlist section. When song requesting is enabled a customizable welcome message is displayed below the host's shared library name in the button used to connect to iTunes DJ.|$|E
