500|$|Associated {{with the}} fact that the {{electron}} can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected {{with the fact}} that an electron is a fermion and obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics. The basic rule is that if we have the probability amplitude for a given complex process involving more than one electron, then when we include (as we always must) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events, the resulting amplitude is the reverse – the negative – of the first. The simplest case would be two electrons starting at A and B ending at C and D. The amplitude would be calculated as the [...] "difference", , <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> expect, from our everyday idea of probabilities, that it would be a sum.|$|E

About 45minutes before the attack, Schrieber cut the power to the left engine at [...] over the camp.

Schneber repeated this several times while also performing various aerobatic maneuvers.

Prince later commended the pilots' actions: [...] "The idea of an aerial decoy was a little unusual and honestly, I didn't think it would work, not in a million years.

500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band. A month later, in October, album sessions for Memory Almost Full began, and were produced by David Kahne and recorded at Abbey Road Studios. McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

2500|$|Although Diophantus made {{important}} {{advances in}} symbolism, he still lacked the necessary notation to express more general methods.

LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have to commit combat forces.

2500|$|After Simeona's {{death in}} 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored {{a book with}} Joe Vitale called Zero Limits {{referring}} to Simeona's Hooponopono teachings.

In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Hooponopono is getting to [...] "the state of Zero, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have zero limits. No memories. No identity." [...] To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the mantra, [...] "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. [...] Thank you." [...] It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility, taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If one would take complete responsibility for one's life, then everything one sees, hears, tastes, touches, or in any way experiences would be one's responsibility because it is in one's life. The problem would not be with our external reality, it would be with ourselves. Total Responsibility, according to Hew Len, advocates that everything exists as a projection from inside the human being. As such, it is similar to the philosophy of solipsism.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson states that, {{while there}} is no unifying theme or concept behind the album, [...] "There are at least four or five songs on that record which I call the divorce songs, the {{relationship}} songs, which are all about various stages of the splitting up a relationship, of dissolving a relationship. Russia On Ice, How Is Your Life Today, Shesmovedon, Feel So Low, I mean, the last track of the album. The period in a relationship, where the relationship is kind of... still exists, but it's in that period where, really, there is nothing left but hatred and despise - Hatesong is the other one.

2500|$|An {{official}} {{close to}} the presidency said the dilution of Mugabe's powers promised in the agreement was [...] "illusory", and described the MDC as merely a [...] "junior partner" [...] whose only role would be [...] "to gain legitimacy and international funds". ZANU-PF planned to take the ministries of defence, justice, home affairs, farming, information, and mines. The mining sector is the last occasionally functioning {{part of the economy}} given the country's wealth of natural resources and this carries huge opportunities for corruption. The MDC would be offered the finance ministry, in an effort to persuade donors that real reform was taking place so that would trigger billions in aid and reconstruction. The presidential official said [...] "It's a tricky situation for the MDC...Nonetheless we now have the opposition in government and they have to fix the economy, just as they told the electorate." [...] A ministerial post involving kick starting foreign aid is seen by some as a poison chalice for the MDC. If the party were to succeed it would help shore up support for the ZANU-PF and make it harder to oust in the future, while a failure would cause the MDC to be branded as incompetent and would undermine its own support. MDC officials were said {{to be aware of the}} risk of being manipulated and refused to sign up for a ministry that lacks real authority. According to an MDC spokesman, [...] "It would appear that Zanu-PF does not understand power-sharing. We are still poles apart, with them insisting on taking all the key ministries, literally rendering the (opposition) peripheral in government – in fact, a situation <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be in but out of government." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Greenblatt {{argues that}} Shakespeare {{probably}} initially loved Hathaway, supporting this {{by referring to}} the theory that a passage {{in one of his}} sonnets (Sonnet 145) plays off Anne Hathaway's name, saying she saved his life (writing [...] "I hate from hate away she threw/And saved my life, saying 'not you.'"). Nevertheless, after only three years of marriage Shakespeare left his family and moved to London. Greenblatt suggests that this may imply that he felt trapped by Hathaway. Other evidence to support this belief is that he and Anne were buried in separate (but adjoining) graves and, as has often been noted, Shakespeare's will makes no specific bequest to his wife aside from [...] "the second best bed with the furniture". This may seem like a slight, but many historians contend that the second best bed was typically the marital bed, while the best bed was reserved for guests. The poem [...] "Anne Hathaway" [...] by Carol Ann Duffy endorses this view of the second best bed, having Anne say: [...] "The bed we loved in was a spinning world of forests, castles, torchlight, clifftops, seas <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> dive for pearls." [...] On the other hand, [...] "In the other bed, the best, our guests dozed on, dribbling their prose". A bed missing from an inventory of Anne's brother's possessions (removed in contravention of their father's will) allows the explanation that the item was an heirloom from the Hathaway family, that had to be returned. The law at the time also stated that the widow of a man was automatically entitled to a third of his estate, so Shakespeare did not need to mention specific bequests in the will.|$|E

2500|$|Watermark {{opens with}} a same-titled {{instrumental}} track with wordless vocals, a tradition that Enya continued on her next three studio albums. Its title derived from a poem Roma was writing {{at the time of}} recording, which inspired her to name the track accordingly. However, the track was kept as an instrumental and the poem was left unused. It was printed {{for the first time in}} the liner notes for Enya's 2002 box set, Only Time – The Collection. During a meeting with Enya, Diana, Princess of Wales revealed that [...] "Watermark" [...] was a favourite of hers. [...] "Cursum Perficio" [...] came about after Enya and the Ryans had seen a documentary on American actress and model Marilyn Monroe, who once wrote the phrase on the tiles on her front doorstep. It means [...] "Your journey ends here" [...] in Latin, and Roma completed a set of Latin lyrics based around the phrase. Enya wanted her vocals to be [...] "bold and up-front" [...] like that of a choral piece, and realised early on that translating its lyrics into English or Gaelic would not complement the music, so Latin was used. [...] "On Your Shore" [...] refers to Magheragallon Beach at Enya's hometown of Gweedore, County Donegal that houses a cemetery where her grandparents are buried. Its emotional and personal connection to her childhood inspired her to write it. She explained, [...] "When the first people lived in Gweedore, there was a sort of shelter for the fishermen ... The sea came in when there was a sermon going on and everybody was wiped out. There are a lot of stories like that, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> start to talk about them and a song would evolve." [...] It was written as an instrumental at first, but Enya and Nicky found lyrics suited the track better. Numerous [...] "vocal experiments" [...] were tried out for it, but neither suited the music, so it took the more simple form of a single lead vocal with one synthesiser. The clarinet solo was originally sung on its demo, but Nicky suggested a clarinet was the most suitable instrument which suited the vocals she used when singing it.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the generic}} alien concept was finalized, {{each of the}} effects coordinators worked with a {{specific}} actor. Mahan chose to work with Mandy Patinkin, as well as Francisco's son. Rosengrant worked with Leslie Bevis who played Cassandra. Woodruff worked on Terence Stamp who played the part of Harcourt. In trying to emphasize {{the uniqueness of the}} [...] characters, Mahan commented, [...] "We wanted the audience to be able to recognize the actors immediately. They were all so good, {{it would have been a}} shame to cover them up completely." [...] Other effects coordinators like Gillis remarked, [...] "The actor who played Trent Porter, for example–Brian Thompson–was a really rugged guy, so he came off looking like a really tough character. On the other hand, Kevyn Major Howard–who played Harcourt's murderous henchman–had very delicate, boyish kind of features, so we used that quality to create a creepy juxtaposition." [...] While effects coordinators were struggling to finish the final design and full-scale production of the alien prosthetics, Hurd chose makeup artist Zoltan Elek to supervise the overall application. Elek had previously worked on the film Mask and the character Max Headroom. Elek insisted that the alien coloration be much more closer to human skin tones rather than the originally chosen yellowish pigment. Elek recalled his disagreement with Winston as Stan felt, [...] "... the aliens should be a totally different color than the humans, with a lot of yellows, blues and grays. To me, that scheme was too monstrous–in fact, we ended up using it on the Harcourt monster at the climax." [...] Another creative aspect of the makeup was the gradation between the principal and background masks. The crew of Alien Nation sought to avoid the same mistakes made in Planet of the Apes twenty years earlier. As explained by Gillis, [...] "We had what we referred to as 'A-B-C-D' makeups, ... The 'A' makeups were those custom designed for the principal actors, while the 'B' makeups were mix-and-match <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> recombine pieces from other actors to create a new character. Our 'D' masks–the ones furthest from camera–were overhead slip latex masks incapable of changing expression. The 'C' masks, however, were made of foam latex and could be glued down to get some expression from the characters in the middleground." [...] Application of the Newcomer makeup known as [...] "spuds" [...] or [...] "potatoheads" [...] on set, required four hours; a task which Patinkin described as being [...] "a pain in the ass." [...] Masks were manufactured in a production line to meet the enormous demand for the film. Mahan mused, [...] "We would pull the pieces out of the oven, fix them up, paint them and have them ready for pickup that afternoon to be taken to the set. The pieces were barely cold when Zoltan and his crew applied them." ...|$|E
