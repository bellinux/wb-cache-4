5|$|Cylinder working {{pressure}} is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15°C or 20°C. and cylinders {{also have a}} specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65°C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable {{in terms of the}} standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified {{working pressure}} stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65°C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.|$|E

25|$|The law of {{superposition}} is an axiom {{that forms}} {{one of the}} bases of the sciences of geology, archaeology, and other fields dealing with geological stratigraphy. In its plainest form, it states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences, the oldest strata <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the sequence. This is important to stratigraphic dating, which assumes that the law of superposition holds true and that an object cannot be older than the materials {{of which it is}} composed. The law was first proposed in the 17th century by the Danish scientist Nicolas Steno.|$|E
25|$|In Einstein's {{theory of}} general relativity, gravity {{is treated as}} a {{phenomenon}} resulting from the curvature of spacetime. This curvature {{is caused by the}} presence of mass. Generally, the more mass that is contained within a given volume of space, the greater the curvature of spacetime <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boundary of its volume. As objects with mass move around in spacetime, the curvature changes to reflect the changed locations of those objects. In certain circumstances, accelerating objects generate changes in this curvature, which propagate outwards {{at the speed of light}} in a wave-like manner. These propagating phenomena are known as gravitational waves.|$|E

25|$|One topic {{covered in}} this section {{describes}} the responsibility art therapist have to their patients (ATCB 2005). According to the ATCB, art therapists must strive to advance the wellness of their clients, respect {{the rights of the}} client, and make sure they are providing a useful service (2005). They cannot discriminate against patient whatsoever, and may never desert or neglect patients receiving therapy. Art therapist must fully explain to their patients what their expectations of the patients <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> outset of the professional relationship between the two. Art therapists should continue therapy with a patient only if the client is benefiting from the therapy. It's against the principles established by the ATCB for art therapist to have patients only for financial reasons.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009, Edmonton {{city council}} {{approved}} a new low-floor train route {{that would leave}} a new ground-level station at Churchill Square on 102 Avenue between 100 and 99 streets before stopping in The Quarters redevelopment on 102 Avenue between 97 street and 96 street. From here the route enters a tunnel and travels beneath 95 street descending into the river valley to cross the North Saskatchewan River on the new Tawatinâ Bridge, which will be constructed east of Louise McKinney Park. The route then proceeds to climb the hill adjacent to Connors Road then proceed east along 95 Avenue and southbound at 85 Street. The route will travel southbound along 85 Street crossing the traffic circle and shifting to 83 Street, continuing south and east towards Wagner Road. Finally the line will proceed south along 75/66 Street until it reaches Mill Woods Town Centre. Within this line the proposed stations are: Quarters, Muttart, Strathearn, Holyrood, Bonnie Doon, Avonmore, Davies (to include a bus terminal and park & ride), Millbourne/Woodvale, Grey Nuns, and Mill Woods Town Centre. The maintenance and storage of vehicles for the line <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new Gerry Wright Operations and Maintenance Facility, at Whitemud Drive and 75 Street.|$|E

I go with Custer and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> death." [...] Kellogg was not predicting his own death or Custer's defeat; instead, [...] "at the death" [...] is a phrase borrowed from fox hunting meaning [...] "present at the kill" [...] (viz., of the pursued).|$|E
500|$|On 17 July 2009, Del Piero {{extended}} {{his contract with}} Juventus by one more year until 30 June 2011 in Pinzolo while training for pre-season, thus practically ensuring that he would retire at the club with which he started his professional career. During his renewal, he said, [...] "I am happy at Juventus and we are competitive. I want to keep playing {{for as long as}} I can and I'm certain that for at least two more years I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top level." [...] On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa. Del Piero finished the season as the all-time top scorer for Juventus, having scored over 250 goals in all competitions with the club, and having also made over 600 appearances in official matches for Juventus, breaking Scirea's appearance record.|$|E
500|$|Old Trafford was {{originally}} {{the home of}} Manchester Cricket Club, but became the home of Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1864 upon that club's formation. The ground is on Talbot Road, Stretford, {{where it has been}} since 1856. Similar to its counterpart, one end of the Old Trafford cricket ground is called the Stretford End. It has been a test venue since 1884 and has hosted three World Cup semi-finals. After the 2005 Ashes Test, when more than 20,000 fans had to be turned away, {{the decision was made to}} increase the ground's capacity from 20,000 to 25,000. Initial plans included building a new stadium on the site of Trafford Town Hall, opposite the present ground. However, Trafford Council voted against the demolition of the town hall and instead, in 2007, signed an agreement jointly with Lancashire County Cricket Club, Ask Developments, and Tesco, to redevelop the ground on its present site. [...] The new cricket ground <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heart of a [...] development that will also include business space, residential, retail, hotel and leisure facilities. More than £25million is expected to be invested in the redevelopments at Old Trafford.|$|E

2500|$|Christiaan Huygens proved in 1673 {{that the}} pivot {{point and the}} center of {{oscillation}} are interchangeable.
