In most parts of England the plate-rail was preferred. Plate-rails were used on the Surrey Iron Railway (SIR), from Wandsworth to West Croydon. The SIR was sanctioned by Parliament in 1801, and finished in 1803. Like the Lake Lock Rail Road, the SIR was {{available to the public}} on payment of tolls; previous lines had all been private and reserved exclusively for the use of their owners. Since it was used by individual operators, vehicles would vary greatly in <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing</b> (gauge) and the plate rail coped better.|$|E

50|$|They were {{designed}} as small mixed traffic branch locomotives, mainly used on branch lines. The design {{was based on}} the earlier 4400 Class, but with larger driving wheels and altered <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing.</b> This gave them extra speed — capable of 60 mph in service. A total of 75 were built; 55 were built in four batches between 1906 and 1915 and a fifth batch of 20 locos was built in 1924, during Collett's tenure at Swindon. The first two batches were originally numbered 2161-2190 but were renumbered 4500-4529 during 1912. The first batch (2161-2180) is significant in that it was the last batch of locos built at Stafford Road Works, Wolverhampton. Of this batch 2168 (as 4507) was the last Wolverhampton-built loco to remain in service with BR, not being withdrawn until 1963. The final two batches built were nos. 4530-4554 in 1913-15 and nos. 4555-4574 in 1924.|$|E

Run at much lower revs than the truck engine, the 101 came in the usual standard and row-crop models, with four-speed transmission, and was capable of 20 mph (32 km/h) on roads. The row-crop model offered adjustable rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing</b> and rear wheel brakes, as well as PTO. There was also a rare model with a single front wheel. They also featured hood sides with dozens of louvers, which disappeared late in 1941. The Super was upgraded to the 217 in³ (3,554 cc) Chrysler in 1940, giving it almost 50 hp (37 kW) at the belt, {{making it one of}} the most powerful tractors on the market that year. It continued to be used in the 101 Super until 1940, when it was supplanted by the 217 in³ (3,554 cc).|$|E

5000|$|Many Suspended Looping Coasters {{operate with}} two trains {{consisting}} of ten cars, though some operate with {{as few as}} seven cars. Poorly maintained, poor track layout or most likely non-exact track manufacturing can cause SLCs riders to experience painful [...] "head banging", whereby the head hits the Over the Shoulder Restraints. They also use very small plastic seats {{with little or no}} room for a person to move. Contrary to popular belief, the <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing</b> on the trains (the 'gaps' between the side friction wheels, up-stop wheels, and the track) adds little to the roughness of these rides. Vekoma is currently manufacturing new trains with convenient hip harnesses. Unlike the first generation of trains, this modification will make the overall ride experience more comfortable.Vekoma also make vest-like harnesses that allow to rider to sit more comfortable riding. The only two known places to have these trains is at Morey's Piers, and at Isla Magica in Spain. In 2012, Lethal Weapon - The Ride at Warner Bros.

The newly opened ride runs with trains manufactured by Kumbak and uses less restrictive harnesses which are similar, but not identical to, the vest-like restraints found on the SLCs at Morey's Piers and Isla Magica.|$|E
5000|$|The Catalan Talgo was an {{international}} express train introduced in 1969 that linked Geneva, Switzerland, with Barcelona, Spain. It {{was named after}} the Spanish region Catalonia and the Talgo equipment it used. It was an extension and upgrading of a predecessor train, Le Catalan, a first-class-only French (SNCF) Rapide train {{that had been in}} operation since 1955 but running only between Geneva and the stations nearest the Spanish-French border, connecting with a second-class-only [...] "autorail" [...] trainset to and from Barcelona. The national railway network of Spain, Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles (RENFE), was using Iberian gauge for all of its main lines, while those of France and Switzerland use standard gauge. As a result of this break-of-gauge, train journeys between Geneva and Barcelona consisted of two separate parts, with travelers having to change from a French to a Spanish train or vice versa at the border—at Portbou (alternatively written as Port Bou) on southbound trains and at Cerbère on northbound trains. In 1968, this was resolved with the introduction of the Talgo III RD trainsets, which featured variable gauge wheelsets. At Portbou station, the <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing</b> of each passenger carriage was adjusted by a gauge changer for the difference in gauge, and passengers no longer had to change trains. After successful test runs, the Catalan was extended from Port Bou to Barcelona as a through train on 1 June 1969, becoming the Catalan Talgo and upgraded to a Trans Europ Express (TEE). Most other rail journeys through this border crossing continued to require a change of train at Cerbère station or at Port Bou, as most trains did not use Talgo III RD trainsets.|$|E
40|$|Use of ridge-till and no-till {{systems has}} {{increased}} dramatically since the early 1980 s when ridge-planting equipment and conservation tillage cultivators became readily available. The ridge-till system involves the establishment and annual re-forming of permanent, single-row ridges into which crops are planted year after year. To obtain maximum productivity with the ridge-plant system (and many believe with no-till systems), all wheel traffic should be confined to interrows. Wheel traffic on ridges can alter the ridge profile and condition of crop residue. Ridge deformation or excessive tire sinkage can affect subsequent planter performance, crop emergence and the overall productivity of both ridge-till and no-till systems. Thus, the row (ridge or root zone) area should not be compacted by the tires from field equipment. For these reasons, {{it is important to}} consider equipment <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing...</b>|$|E

This paper describes further development of an advanced low noise main landing gear that was previously designed and tested in the European SILENCER project. The work was carried out under the current European co-financed TIMPAN project (Technologies to IMProve Airframe Noise) using a 1 / 4 scaled landing gear model that was tested in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel. A variety of gear configurations were tested including a new side-stay design and various modifications to the bogie inclination, <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing,</b> bogie fairings with different flow transparency, leg-door configurations and brake fairings. The farfield noise data from the tests are compared with results from a landing gear noise prediction model, transposed to full scale flight conditions and compared with the full scale test data obtained for the original SILENCER advanced A 340 style 4 -wheel main landing gear. An optimal combination of tested gear modifications led to a further noise reduction of up to 8 dB(A) in terms of overall A-weighted noise levels relative to the original advanced gear configuratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to predict rut depth in local flexible pavements. Predication model in pavement performance is the process that used to estimate the parameter values which related to pavement structure, environmental condition and traffic loading. The different local empirical models have been used to calculate permanent deformation which include environmental and traffic conditions. Finite element analysis through ANSYS computer software is used to analyze two dimensional linear elastic plane strain problem through (Plane 82) elements. Standard Axle Load (ESAL) of 18 kip (80 kN) loading on an axle with dual set of tires, the <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing</b> is 13. 5 in (343 mm) with tire contact pressure of 87 psi (0. 6 MPa) is used. The pavement system is assumed to be an elastic multi-layers system with each layer being isotropic, homogeneous with specified resilient modulus and Poisson ratio. Each layer is to extend to infinity in the horizontal direction and have a finite thickness except the bottom layer. The analysis of results show that, although, the stress level decrease 14 % in the leveling course and 27 % in the base course, the rut depth is increased by 12 and 28 % in that layers respectively because the material properties is changed...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a common}} problem in the southeastern United States, especially on sandy soils as found in the Coastal Plain of NC. One of the main causes of soil compaction is equipment traffic in fields. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the amount of traffic occurring in North Carolina fields and the effect that the level of traffic had on soil compaction as measured by soil bulk density. GPS was used to map all traffic on these fields in 2006. Using measurements of tread widths and <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing,</b> a series of processes in a GIS was performed to generate a map indicating the level of traffic that occurred in each area of the field. After all field operations were complete as well as the GIS analysis, fields were sampled for bulk density again. Sample locations were then based on the number of passes that had occurred. Initial results showed that 65 - 85 % of the field’s area was tracked. Bulk density ranged from 0. 5 to 0. 8 g/cm 3 in the organic soil, and from 1. 6 to 1. 8 g/cm 3 in the sandy soils. Initial results show that in the organic soil, areas of the field that were tracked at least four times had significantly higher bulk density in the 0 - 10 cm depth than the areas that received no tracks...|$|E

40|$|Higher spatial {{resolution}} imaging data is always desirable {{to the international}} community of planetary scientists interested in improving understanding of surface formation processes. We have previously developed a novel Super-resolution restoration (SRR) technique (Tao & Muller, 2016) using Gotcha sub-pixel matching, orthorectification, and segmented 4 th order PDE-TV, called GPT SRR, which is able to restore 5  cm- 12. 5  cm near rover scale images (equivalent to Navcam projected FoV at a range of ≥  5  m) from multiple 25  cm resolution NASA MRO HiRISE images. The SRR technique has been successfully applied to the rover traverses for the MER and MSL missions within the EU FP- 7 PRoViDE project. These SRR results have revealed new surface information including the imaging of individual rocks (diameter ≥  25  cm) by comparison of the original HiRISE image and rover Navcam orthorectified image mosaics. In this work, we seek evidence from processing {{a very large number of}} stereo reconstruction results from all Navcam stereo images within PRoViDE, registration and comparison with the corresponding SRR image, in order to derive a quantitative assessment on key features including rocks (diameter <  150  cm) and rover track <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing.</b> We summarise statistics from SRR-Navcam measurements and demonstrate that our unique SRR datasets will greatly support the geological and morphological analysis and monitoring of Martian surface and can also be applied to landing site selection, in order to avoid unsuitable terrain, for any future lander/rover as well as help to define future rover paths...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. In {{structural}} engineering practice the actions imposed by {{overhead travelling cranes}} onto the supporting structure are defined as static forces amplified by dynamic coefficients and applied as pseudo-static forces without taking the interaction between crane and supporting structure into account. To investigate the validity of this approach, the forces generated at the wheels of an experimental crane are measured, as the crane traverses on the supporting structure. The interaction at {{the wheels of the}} crane is also visually recorded. These wheel load results will also be used by other researchers, to calibrate a numerical model of the experimental system. A full-scale 5 ton electric overhead travelling crane (EOTC) running on top of rails and a supporting structure, was designed and erected for research purposes. The crane has a span of 8. 3 m and <b>wheel</b> <b>spacing</b> of 4 m, which can be modified. The supporting structure consists of three simply supported mono-symmetric plate girders on each side, with a total length of 13. 8 m. This is supported by columns with a height of about 3. 5 m. This paper describes the calibration of this system for measurement purposes. A data acquisition system was implemented to capture forces, strains, deflections and accelerations at various points on the crane and the supporting structure as well as to measure the velocity of the crane. The forces at the crane wheels are measured through strain gauges on the end carriage load measuring system. The calibrated facility is used to investigate the behaviour of the crane and the supporting structure under regular and exceptional wheel loads, which are classified as follows: - Regular wheel loads occur during normal payload hoisting and lowering, longitudinal crane travel with payload and lateral crab travel with payload. - Exceptional wheel loads occur during eccentric payload hoisting (payload outside normal operational area), impact forces on end-stops, maximum hoisting of the payload, failure of a longitudinal drive mechanism of the crane, misalignment of the supporting structure and skewing of the crane. The maximum values of these experimentally determined wheel loads and the dynamic response of the system is used to help describe the behaviour of the electric overhead travelling crane and its supporting structure...|$|E
