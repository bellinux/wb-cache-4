500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to me that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance {{seems to me to be}} showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E
500|$|Some 35 of the signers {{met at the}} St. Charles Hotel in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 1984, to {{determine}} a course of action. The meeting included 18 nuns of the Vatican 24. They said the Vatican, in its stern reaction, [...] "seeks to stifle {{freedom of speech and}} public discussion in the Roman Catholic Church and create the appearance of a consensus where none exists." [...] The group issed a statement describing the current Church stance as not {{in the spirit of the}} Vatican II which said, [...] "Let there be unity in what is necessary, freedom in what is unsettled and charity in any case." [...] Sister Donna Quinn, a past president of the National Coalition of American Nuns, said, [...] "We believe <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> speak out when we have a differing opinion, and this is something European men do not understand." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that the Neumünster Zoo in northern Germany, which owns Knut's father, was suing the Berlin Zoo for the profits from Knut's success. [...] Although the Berlin Zoo conceded Neumünster's ownership of Knut due to a previous agreement, it contended that the other zoo has no right to its proceeds. Neumünster had previously tried to negotiate with Berlin Zoo, but later sought a court ruling in their favor. Peter Drüwa, the zoo director at Neumünster, stated that they [...] "do not want to remove Knut from his environment, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> our request for money." [...] Shortly before Knut's second birthday, reports began circulating that the bear would have to be relocated to another zoo because he was becoming too large for his enclosure. The zoo later released statements that they wish to keep Knut, and the mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, also declared he wanted the still-adolescent cub to stay in the capital.|$|E

The first {{was to take}} the {{presumption}} that illegal use was intended in that kind of marketing, or at least take judicial notice. The second was in regard to the appeals court's concern about targeting certain lifestyles. [...] "I can't make the argument strong enough that I think under the rational interest of the community and the state <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> legislate against lifestyles, such as homicidal maniacs, burglars, and drug abusers ...

2500|$|In 1718, {{the poet}} Alexander Pope, a renowned dog lover, also criticized Hales' work. In {{conversation}} with his friend, Joseph Spence, Pope reportedly said of Hale: [...] "He commits {{most of these}} barbarities {{with the thought of}} its being of use to man.

There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that 'corresponds' to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and {{we have the right to}} sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a 'corresponding withdrawal', a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have been talked about on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands".|$|E
