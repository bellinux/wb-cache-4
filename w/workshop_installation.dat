40|$|This {{report shows}} methods and {{workflow}} when exploring {{the potential to}} change Outotecs HCD Silver Electrolysis machine to a module type. It’s done {{as an attempt to}} lower the <b>workshop</b> and <b>installation</b> costs and to give customer a more accurate prize directly. To do this a concept was produced which was set to a stress test. Additional objectives were to investigate freight and installation procedures, pneumatic connections and to calculate the difference in cost. Once the concept, a reinforced type of the original frame, was chosen stress tests in computer simulations were made and appropriate alterations were made. To make the module more “plug and play”-based changes such as relocation of the drive unit. A basic drawing of a freight frame was also made to ensure that the module could be shipped. Since the costs are not calculated it’s not explored if this is a cheaper way to manufacture the machine. But it seems to work to build the module this way so this question will be answered later. Parts of the module can be implemented on the original machine and therefore the work has not been in vain anyway...|$|R
