5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers <b>with</b> <b>poor</b> hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E

5|$|Although {{sufficient}} for the Southern Railway's needs, the Nclass was an ideal test-bed for experiments with new steam technology.

In June 1930, No.A816 was withdrawn from service {{for the application of}} experimental Anderson steam conservation equipment at Eastleigh Works. This was designed by a Scottish marine draughtsman, Mr. A.P.H.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the association between}} longitudinal growth measures (height, abstract weight, head circumference, and extent of catch-up growth) and neuropsychological functioning at 7 years in moderately and late preterm children. METHODS: This study {{was part of a}} prospective, community-based cohort study. Data on growth were obtained from records on routine assessments in well-child centers until age 4 years and in a research setting at 7 years. Neuropsychological functioning was assessed at age 7 years. We assessed associations of growth with neuropsychological functioning and determined odds ratios for impaired neuropsychological functioning. All analyses were corrected for maternal education. RESULTS: We included 234 children. Median gestational age was 34 weeks (P 25 - 75 : 33 - 35 weeks), and mean birth weight was 2. 2 kg (+/- 0. 5 kg). Short stature at all ages was associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> motor, IQ, and attention scores and led to increased risks of impaired motor skills and low IQ. Lower weight at 1 and 4 years was associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> IQ scores. Increased weight gain between age 4 and 7 years was, however, associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> motor, IQ, and attention scores. Decreased head circumference gain {{in the first year of}} life was associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> motor and attention scores and led to an increased risk of impaired motor and attention skills. CONCLUSIONS: In moderately and late preterm children, poorer growth in the first 7 years is associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> neuropsychological functioning. Regarding height, short stature was also associated with a higher likelihood of clinically relevant impaired neuropsychological functioning...|$|R

40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{is associated}} <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> health, yet pathways through which IPV affects either mental or physical health {{are not well}} characterized. Methods Structural equation modeling {{was used to test}} a model in which physical-IPV and battering were considered as separate independent variables. The sample included 191 women currently experiencing either physical IPV or battering. Emotional support provided to women experiencing IPV was hypothesized to mediate the impact of IPV on current mental and physical health (dependent variables). Results Higher scores on emotional support were associated with better physical (β = − 0. 23, P < 0. 01) and mental health (β = − 0. 27, P < 0. 001). Physical IPV was directly associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> mental health (β =. 023, P < 0. 01) and indirectly associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> physical health (β = 0. 18, P < 0. 001) and mental health (β = − 0. 04, P < 0. 05), primarily through battering.

40|$|Background: Children <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> {{language}} skills {{are more likely}} to show externalizing behavior problems, as well as to become rejected by their peers. Peer rejection has also been found to affect the development of externalizing behavior. This study explored the role of peer rejection in the link between {{language skills}} and the development of externalizing behavior. Methods: Six hundred and fifteen (615) children were followed from kindergarten to grade 4. Receptive language skills were measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test in grade 2. Teachers reported externalizing behavior and peer reports of social rejection were measured annually. Results: Children <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> receptive language skills showed increasing externalizing behavior, while children with better receptive language skills showed decreases in externalizing behavior. Children <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> receptive language skills experienced peer rejection most frequently. The link between receptive language skills and the development of externalizing behavior was mediated by the development of peer rejection. Findings suggested that this mediational link applied mostly to boys. Conclusion: Children <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> language skills are at increased risk of becoming rejected by mainstream peers, which adds to the development of externalizing behavior. © 2010 The Authors.

Pulse-pressure amplification reflects the augmentation of blood pressure between the central and peripheral arteries, which diminishes with aging. We aimed to determine the association between central blood pressure and cognitive function in independently living adults aged 20 to 82 years (N = 493). In adjusted regression models, higher central systolic pressure and higher central pulse pressure were each associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> processing speed, Stroop processing, and recognition memory. Lower amplification was associated <b>with</b> <b>poorer</b> Stroop processing, working memory, and recognition memory.

In summary, central pressures and amplification were sensitive indicators of cognitive aging, predicting aspects of cognitive performance not predicted by brachial blood pressure...|$|R
