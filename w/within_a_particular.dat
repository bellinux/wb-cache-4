5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led}} to genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, various national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts issue forecasts of hurricane activity. These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University (CSU), as well as Weather Research Center (WRC) and Tropical Storm Risk (TSR), then known as TSUNAMI.

5|$|Before {{and during}} each {{hurricane}} season, several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that {{help determine the}} number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> year. According to NOAA, the average Atlantic hurricane season between 1950 and 2005 contained 10.3 tropical storms, 6.2 hurricanes, 2.7 major hurricanes, and an ACE index of 66–103 units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index, but the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season are occasionally considered as well.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of {{and during}} the season, several {{meteorological}} services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO), Coastal Carolina University (CCU), Colorado State University (CSU), and North Carolina State University (NCSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help {{determine the number of}} tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014–16 El Niño event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and two major hurricanes, with an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of between 66 and 103 units.|$|E
5|$|During the day, whitetip reef sharks {{spend much}} of their time resting inside caves. Unlike other requiem sharks, which rely on ram {{ventilation}} and must constantly swim to breathe, this shark can pump water over its gills and lie still on the bottom. At night, whitetip reef sharks emerge to hunt bony fishes, crustaceans, and octopus in groups, their elongate bodies allowing them to force their way into crevices and holes to extract hidden prey. Individuals may stay <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> area of the reef for months or years, frequently returning to the same shelter. This species is viviparous, in which the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. One of the few sharks in which mating has been observed in the wild, receptive female whitetip reef sharks are followed by prospective males, which attempt to grasp her pectoral fin and maneuver the two of them into positions suitable for copulation. Females give birth to one to six pups every other year, after a gestation period of 1013 months.|$|E
5|$|In advance of, and during, each {{hurricane}} season, several {{forecasts of}} hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services, scientific agencies, and noted hurricane experts. These include forecasters from the United States NOAA's National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center's, Philip J. Klotzbach, William M. Gray and their associates at CSU, Tropical Storm Risk, and the United Kingdom's Met Office. The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that {{help determine the}} number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> year. As stated by NOAA and CSU, an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained roughly 12tropical storms, 6hurricanes, 3major hurricanes, and an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) Index of 66–103units. NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above-average, average, or below-average based on the cumulative ACE Index; however, the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well.|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} assumption {{in studies}} of multiagent resource allocation problems is that the value an individual agent places on its assignment remains unchanged by any redistribution of the remaining resources among the other agents. This assumption renders impossible analyses of scenarios where the utility an agent attaches to <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> set of resources is determined by factors other than the resource set itself. Thus an agent’s perception of what its allocation is worth may be tempered by its view of what other agents in the system may own, e. g. if working <b>within</b> <b>a</b> coalition <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> allocation may assume a greater value if other coalition members hold certain resources. In this paper we develop a model for examining such context dependent valuations and consider various decision problems related {{to the existence of}} context dependent allocations satisfying various criteria. ...|$|R

5|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} {{to place the}} work <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> genre. MTV compared the song's style to the group Devo and new wave music. El País described the piece as an electropop song {{that contributed to the}} viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. Dose described it as an electro jam session which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The Los Angeles Times called the piece a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described the piece as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song for dancing. New Musical Express recommended the piece, and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the piece as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that the end product was comedic. The Arizona Daily Star described the piece as a pop music dance song.|$|E
5|$|The {{individuals}} <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>particular</b> area often {{differ in}} their foraging methods and prey types, and tend to follow the same patterns as their mothers. The diet of local populations also changes over time, as sea otters can significantly deplete populations of highly preferred prey such as large sea urchins, and prey availability is also affected by other factors such as fishing by humans. Sea otters can thoroughly remove abalone from an area except for specimens in deep rock crevices, however, they never completely wipe out a prey species from an area. A 2007 Californian study demonstrated, in areas where food was relatively scarce, {{a wider variety of}} prey was consumed. Surprisingly, though, the diets of individuals were more specialized in these areas than in areas where food was plentiful.|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in Alcoholics Anonymous (A. A.) and other secular, spiritual, and religious frameworks of long-term addiction recovery. The present paper explores the varieties of spiritual experience <b>within</b> <b>A.</b> <b>A.,</b> with <b>particular</b> reference {{to the growth of}} a wing of recovery spirituality promoted <b>within</b> <b>A.</b> A.

The growing varieties of A. A. spirituality (spanning the “Christianizers” and “Seculizers”) reflect A.
