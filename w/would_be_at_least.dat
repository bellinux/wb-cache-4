5|$|Some of the ferry's six {{proposed}} routes {{were originally}} {{supposed to be}} operational in June 2017, but the implementation date was later moved to May 1. Under the 2015 plan, the whole system is expected to come into full service by 2018. The system includes routes that were formerly under NY Waterway, most notably the East River route. There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 18 boats needed for rush-hour operation. Twelve boats would be deployed in 2017, while the other six would be put in service the next year. The number of boats was later revised slightly to 20, including three boats that would be upgraded later.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as strong as on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 1.25 times as strong as on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi, at age 22, {{was called}} to the bar in June 1891 and then left London for India, where he learned {{that his mother had}} died while he was in London and that his family had kept the news from him. His {{attempts}} at establishing a law practice in Bombay failed because he was psychologically unable to cross-examine witnesses. He returned to Rajkot to make a modest living drafting petitions for litigants, but he was forced to stop when he ran foul of a British officer. In 1893, a Muslim merchant in Kathiawar named Dada Abdullah contacted Gandhi. Abdullah owned a large successful shipping business in South Africa. His distant cousin in Johannesburg needed a lawyer, and they preferred someone with Kathiawari heritage. Gandhi inquired about his pay for the work. They offered a total salary of £105 plus travel expenses. He accepted it, knowing that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one year commitment in the Colony of Natal, South Africa, also a part of the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1950s, the Tübingen School of Plato {{interpretation}} {{has argued}} that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato <b>would</b> <b>be,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.|$|E
25|$|In February 2014, Abrams said filming {{would begin}} in May and last about three months. The {{official}} announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom. That month, {{it was revealed}} that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland {{prior to the start of}} official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film. In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun, filming in secret in the U.A.E. emirate of Abu Dhabi by a second-unit. Later that month, {{it was revealed that}} in addition to 35mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65mm IMAX format. In July, Bad Robot reported on Twitter that the film <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partially shot on IMAX cameras.|$|E
25|$|The trial {{operation}} was successful and DNL and {{the postal service}} decided to commence permanent services from the following season. The city engineer was given the responsibility to plan an airport. He noted that there were plans for an airport to be built at Heimdal, but that such an airport <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five years away. The port authority had considered {{the possibility of using}} Ilsvika on the fjord, but the site was exposed to waves and would need the expansion of a causeway. Three locations at Jonsvatnet were considered: Valsetbukta, Kulsetbuka and Jervan. The former was found to be best suited and was also the closest to the city. Unlike during the trial flights the city concluded that the airport would need infrastructure to support operations. These included a floating wharf, a slipway to avoid aircraft being damaged if they should blow on land and a terminal building.|$|E

25|$|Significant {{indicator}} activity {{would be}} expected below the mountain weeks to years before magma penetrates {{its way through the}} Earth's crust. The large amount of seismicity and the sensitivity of the current seismograph in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and would most likely cause an expanded monitoring effort. As the magma rises to the surface, the mountain would probably swell and the surface would likely rupture, causing greatly increased vigour in the hot springs, and the formation of new hot springs or fumaroles on the mountainside. In other words, they would get hotter. Minor and possibly large landslides could occur and may perhaps temporarily dam the Squamish River, as happened in the past without earthquake shaking and intrusion-related deformation. The continued presence of magma near the surface would eventually make contact with surface water, causing phreatic eruptions and debris flows, such as what occurred in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. By this time Highway 99 would be closed and Squamish <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partially, and possibly entirely, abandoned.|$|E
500|$|In July 1990, Kerrey {{withdrew his}} {{support from the}} {{proposed}} radioactive-waste repository in Boyd County, asserting that the facility might no longer be needed and might not be economically feasible. [...] Nelson joined Kerrey in calling for a moratorium on further work. [...] Orr declared {{that she would be}} willing to suspend the process, if Kerrey could guarantee that Nebraska taxpayers and power consumers would not suffer, but expressed concern that such a move might be a violation of federal law; an Orr staffer cited a study indicating that costs of withdrawing from the waste-disposal compact <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> $150 million, and might be as high as $425 million.|$|E
500|$|In 1864, it was {{expected}} that the newly formed Hammersmith and City Railway would build its western terminus on the north bank of the river between Chelsea and Fulham. In 1864, in anticipation of the new railway line generating high demand for a river crossing, an Act of Parliament was passed granting permission to the Wandsworth Bridge Company to build a bridge, to be financed by tolls, with the proviso that the bridge <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> [...] wide and cross the river with no more than three spans. Rowland Mason Ordish designed an Ordish–Lefeuvre Principle bridge to comply with the Act's specifications, of a similar design to his nearby Albert Bridge. Wandsworth Bridge and Albert Bridge were authorised on the same day, and were the last private tollbridges authorised in London.|$|E

500|$|The {{curriculum}} {{drifted to}} a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science. The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted {{the attention of}} the MIT leadership. During these [...] "Boston Tech" [...] years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School. There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard. In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni. However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively {{put an end to the}} merger scheme.|$|E
500|$|In February and March {{the rate}} of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton {{calculated}} that the ship had travelled a mere [...] since 19 January. However, as winter set in {{the speed of the}} drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April Shackleton recorded the nearby pack [...] "piling and rafting against the masses of ice"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance [...] "she would be crushed like an eggshell". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75°23′S, 42°14′W, still drifting northwards. [...] It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice, and there was no certainty that Endurance would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area. Shackleton now considered the possibility of finding an alternative landing ground on the western shores of the Weddell Sea, if that coast could be reached. [...] "In the meantime", he wrote, [...] "we must wait".|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, Baird {{produced}} a federal study supported by five independent economists {{to support his}} approach to the Kyoto Protocol.

[...] Opposition parliamentarians dismissed the report as a scare tactic, while Liberal Environment critic David McGuinty argued that the study was misleading, saying {{that it did not}} properly examine international emission trading and ignored jobs to be created through the [...] "green economy". The report claimed that Canada's ability to invest in developing nations to meet emissions targets through CDM by misquoting the amount of credit to be $85 million instead of the real approximation of $3 billion. Soon afterward, a United Nations report also contradicted the study mentioning that [...] "steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished at a cost of only 0.12 per cent of the world's annual economic output" [...] but Baird responded that Canada's gas emission levels would peak in 2012, three years before the UN's set target of 2015.|$|E
