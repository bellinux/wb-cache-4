500|$|Scott's story {{concept was}} {{partially}} inspired by Chariots of the Gods?, Erich von Däniken's work about {{the theory of}} ancient astronauts which hypothesizes that life on Earth was created by aliens. Scott said, [...] "NASA and the Vatican agree that [...] almost mathematically impossible {{that we can be}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>today</b> without there being a little help along the way... That's what we're looking at , at some of Erich von Däniken's ideas of how did we humans come about." [...] Spaihts originated the idea that David, the android, is like humans but {{does not want to be}} anything like them, eschewing a common theme in [...] "robotic storytelling" [...] such as Blade Runner. He also developed the theme that while the human crew is searching for their creators, David is already among its creators. Scott liked these ideas and further explored them in Lindelof's rewrite. For Shaw, Lindelof felt it was important that she was distinct from Aliens Ripley, to avoid inevitable comparisons between the two characters. In Spaihts's draft, Shaw was directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants to seek out potentially dangerous knowledge. As with David, Lindelof expanded this facet of the character during his rewrites. He spent approximately eight months developing the script, finishing in March 2011 as filming began.|$|E

[...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics.

40|$|I {{presented}} {{my paper}} on day 2 {{of the conference}} in a round table venue with about 30 people in attendance, including Aboriginal & non-Aboriginal education and Indigenous Studies scholars, high school teachers and administrators, university students, the conference organizers and others. Because of time issues {{all of us in}} the 10 : 30 to noon sessions had to squish our 1. 5 hr presentations into 1 hr so I had to edit as I went along. The presentation I gave is not written out in formal or informal format. The form and function are based on oral tradition and that is how I presented it. Throughout the narrative I created spaces for people to ask questions and provide their own insights. The verbal feedback I received during and following the session was positive. A number of high school teachers and administrators noted that this teaching model is unique and they believed that students would be able to relate to it and that it would capture their interest. Many asked if they could use the teaching model in their classrooms and since the model was created for sharing I was very pleased. I have not yet received formal feedback on the session. Everyone in attendance received the evaluation form but I am not sure how many actually filled it out nor am I sure if I will be getting a summary of them. The discussions that my presentation prompted among attendees were insightful and I was encouraged to write it down for publication purposes so it could reach a broader audience. So, this is now on my academic “things to do” list. It is a common truth that in order to understand <b>were</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at <b>today</b> <b>we</b> need to understand how we got here—we need to understand our history. More than ever our youth need the understanding and empowerment that comes from being able to make a personal connection between our Peoples’ historical experiences and our current conditions. Without an understanding of <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at <b>today</b> it can <b>be</b> an overwhelming challenge to face the future with hope and enthusiasm. The history of Indigenous Peoples is often taught in an alienating vacuum with disempowering and frustrating results. Many youth today find little connection between life as they know it and the “noble savage” rendition or the more common “the Indians” approach that objectifies and distances them from their past even more. “Towards a Cree Understanding of Colonialism” tells the story of how <b>we</b> came to <b>be</b> in the situation <b>we</b> <b>are</b> in <b>today</b> by placing the student in the centre of his/her learning experience and providing them with hands-on analytical tools. The foundations of this teaching model are traditional Teaching Circles which explain how our families and communities related, functioned, and flourished prior to European intrusions. The old ways are then systematically dismantled as new ways were introduced, imposed & eventually internalized. Personal enlightenment and empowerment comes from decolonizing ourselves at the individual level— decolonization <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at <b>today</b> as <b>we</b> strive to create a place for ourselves on our terms in the society that envelopes us.

The identity of who <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> what <b>we</b> do, {{and most importantly}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> from. <b>Today's</b> world consists of instant gratification, the ever-present need to "get it now", have it "done yesterday" {{and of course the}} ability for "one stop shopping. " We work more so that we can have more "stuff", bigger cars and even bigger homes because after all "bigger is always better" right? All of these trends in our lives lead to a result. We spend more hours working, less time with family and even less time in our community. This doesn't just affect one person either. It affects our society as a whole. Our current trends have lead to urban sprawl, degradation of city centers, less sense of community most importantly the continued loss of rural farmland. This thesis is a study of sprawling suburban development, which is characterized by oversized front yards, wide, featureless streets, and inhospitable house fronts dominated by huge garage doors. It is through studying of these current trends that I look to design the single-family home with an approach to a more responsible way of developing these areas that are in danger of loosing the sense of who they are. The result will consist of redefining development, designing with the neighborhood, community and user in mind. The test of the contextual transfer of ideas will aim at accomplishing these goals.

40|$|As {{recently}} as perhaps 25 years ago, employee voice was narrowly conceived. In the research literature, employee voice was largely {{seen as an}} extension of Hirschman’s (1970, p. 30) conception of voice as a means to “change, rather than escape from [that is, exit], an objectionable state of affairs. ” In industrial relations, this was most influentially articulated through Freeman and Medoff’s (1984) collective voice face of labor unions. Consistent with this, employee voice in practice was largely seen as something best delivered through labor unions. In retrospect, {{it is easy to see}} what should have been articulated 25 years ago as a future course for employee voice. Specifically, one should have called for broader definitions of employee voice, more diverse disciplinary perspectives on broader aspects of voice, and greater recognition of individual and nonunion forms of voice in practice. Thankfully, that <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> at <b>today,</b> as witnessed by the breadth and depth of the chapters in this handbook and other recent collections of employee voice research (e. g., Budd, Gollan, and Wilkinson 2010). So while the future of narrowly-conceived voice and the closely-associated institution of labor unionism are perhaps questionable at best, there is a strong future for richer and broader conceptualizations and forms of employee voice. Ironically, this new breadth and depth of contemporary research on employee voice makes it more challenging to lay out its future, and it is impractical as well as redundant to cover all of the future directions raised by the chapters in this handbook. I will instead propose some areas where I think particular attention is warranted, but the reader is again encouraged to also read the others chapters in the handbook with an eye toward thinking critically about future directions for employee voice in both research and practice...|$|R

40|$|Commodity {{computer}} graphics chips <b>are</b> probably <b>today’s</b> most powerful computational hardware one can buy for money.

Due to the movie and game industry <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to <b>today.</b> One of Intel’s co-founder Gordon E. Moore said once {{that the number of}} transistors on a single integrated chip was to double every 18 month. So far this seems to be correct for the CPU. However for the GPU the development has gone much faster, and the floating point operations per second has increased enormously. Due to this rapid evolvement many researchers and scientists has discovered the enormous floating point potential can be taken advantage of, and a numerous applications has been tested such as audio and image algorithms. Also in the area of marine acoustics this has become interesting, where the demand for high computational power is increasing. This master report investigates how to make a program capable to run on a GPU for calculating an underwater sound field. To do this a graphics chips with programmable vertex and fragment processor is necessary. Programming this will require graphics API like OpenGL, a shading language like GLSL, and a general purpose GPU library like Shallows. A written program in Matlab is the basic for the GPU program. The goal is to reduce calculation time spent to calculate a underwater sound field. From this the increment from Matlab to GPU was found to be around 40 - 50 times. However if Matlab was able to calculate the same number of rays as maximum on the GPU, the increment would probably be bigger. Since this study was done on a laptop with nVidia GeForce Go 6600 graphics chip, a higher gain would theoretically be obtainable by a desktop graphics chip. </p...|$|R
