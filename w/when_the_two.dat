5|$|Among Episcopalians, Qualified Chapels {{used the}} English Book of Common Prayer. They {{installed}} organs and hired musicians, following {{the practice in}} English parish churches, singing in the liturgy as well as metrical psalms, while the non-jurors had to worship covertly and less elaborately. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> branches united in the 1790s, the non-juring branch soon absorbed the musical and liturgical traditions of the qualified churches.|$|E
5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an enemy sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him.

5|$|As the two nearby Manchester {{clubs have}} rarely {{been in the}} same {{division}} as Stockport, historically there has been little rivalry with either club. However, the rivalry between Stockport County and Manchester City took form between 1997 and 2002, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> clubs spent three out of five seasons in the same division and during the 1998/99 season, Stockport were a division above City.|$|E

5|$|During {{the regular}} season, Clemson was No. 10 in rushing yards, {{averaging}} 236.4 per game. Its passing offense was somewhat weaker, ranked No. 63 and averaging 210.1 yards per game. In total, however, Clemson's offense ranked No. 10 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> amounts were added together. In scoring offense, the Tigers averaged 36.0 points per game, {{good enough for}} No. 14 {{in the country in}} that category.|$|E

5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> pure metals {{come into}} contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as in iron rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium.

5|$|The Blue-Green rivalry often {{erupted into}} gang warfare, and street {{violence}} {{had been on}} the rise in the reign of Justin I (r. 518–527), who took measures to restore order, when the gangs murdered a citizen in the Hagia Sophia. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian, which began <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> main factions united and attempted unsuccessfully to overthrow the emperor.|$|E
