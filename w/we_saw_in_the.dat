500|$|The two matches aside, Hassett had a {{productive}} lead-in to the Tests, scoring 110 against Surrey and two fifties. One of these {{came in a}} match against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and was basically a full-strength Test team. It {{was a chance to}} gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. Australia batted first and Hassett made 51 in an innings win. Fingleton hailed Hassett's display as [...] "the prettiest half century <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole summer. There was not effort in his play. The ball sped quietly and quickly in all directions." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Spanish Teacher" [...] {{was given}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that [...] "much of this episode {{felt like a}} very deliberate throwback to season one, in some very good ways", and IGN's Robert Canning said that [...] "the overarching storylines on Glee have become far more engaging than what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first half of the}} season". John Kubicek of BuddyTV stated that the episode [...] "does a lot of things right {{when it comes to the}} plot", and Billboard Rae Votta described the plot as [...] "consistent and well managed, with believable motivation, response and action all around". However, Jen Chaney of The Washington Post wrote that the episode [...] "brought more narrative developments that didn’t make sense", and Rolling Stone Erica Futterman stated that aside from Martin's scenes, [...] "the rest of the episode found us back in scatterbrained plot territory". Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times liked the episode and described it as [...] "the kind that makes you belly-laugh and chortle and snicker despite your better judgment".|$|E

500|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full-strength Test team, while Australia selected their first-choice team. Bradman captained the team and batted at No. 3 with Hassett in his customary position at No. 4. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team would line up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. It was a chance for players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. Australia elected to bat and Hassett came in to join Bradman at 2/171. The pair took the score to 200 before Bradman fell for 98 to leave Australia at 3/200. Hassett then put on 80 with Miller before being trapped leg before wicket (lbw) for 51 by Jack Young. Fingleton hailed Hassett's display as [...] "the prettiest half century <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole summer. There was not effort in his play. The ball sped quietly and quickly in all directions." [...] Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings, with Hassett catching Len Hutton and Ken Cranston in the first innings.|$|E
500|$|The New Zealand {{visual effects}} studio Weta Digital was {{initially}} selected {{to assist in}} creating a preview clip for the 2007 Comic-Con Convention. The studio's 100 employees later developed the visual effects for 300 of the 600 shots in the film. In total, {{there are more than}} 100 jumps in the film, and each jump was modified based on the distance and location the character(s) jumped. The jumps were developed using Nuke and Shake software; many, including those to Big Ben and the Sphinx were created with Maya. Weta's VFX supervisor Erik Winquist explained how the visual effects of the jumps were created: [...] "The concept of what a jump looks like changed and evolved a little over the course of post production. There are shots in the film that use still array footage but not {{in the same way that}} <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Matrix. The Matrix was largely about stopping time whereas this was about using slow shutter speeds on those still array cameras to end up with a streaky motion-blurred image as the perspective was changing, which is a pretty interesting look." [...] Other visual effects studios that assisted with the film include Hydraulx, Digital Domain, and Pixel Magic. Lightwave 3D was also used for some of the movie's scenes.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Marvel Studios held a {{presentation}} at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources said, [...] "The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise" [...] and is [...] "heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses [...] of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, [...] "Awesome. Or {{it would be if}} we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trailer". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises, which was downloaded more than 12.5million times in its first 24 hours. The trailer received 20.4 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including , 21 Jump Street and The Hunger Games.|$|E

2500|$|Act-On {{was founded}} in 2008 by Raghu Raghavan, {{formerly}} a founder of Responsys, after he saw [...] "potential for a sophisticated, but affordable SaaS marketing tool mid-market companies could easily use." [...] Act-On initially sold through alternate channels, but later created its own sales team. Entering the market after several competitors had been established, Act-On had a second-mover advantage, learning from the success and failures of earlier market entrants. Raghavan commented in a 2013 interview, [...] "We came in, we saw {{all of the things}} that had not been done right in this space, and I think it allowed us to build a company in a whole new way to attack what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> monsters' market." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones saw Jonestown {{as both a}} [...] "socialist paradise" [...] and a [...] "sanctuary" [...] from media {{scrutiny}} {{that had}} started with the Kinsolving articles. Former Temple member Tim Carter describes {{the reason for the}} move to Jonestown as [...] "in seventy four (1974), what <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States was creeping fascism." [...] Carter explained, [...] "It was apparent that corporations, or the multinationals, were getting much larger, their influence was growing within the government, and the United States is a racist place." [...] Carter said the Temple concluded that Guyana was [...] "a place in a black country where our black members could live in peace", [...] "it was a socialist government" [...] and it was [...] "the only English speaking country in South America." ...|$|E
2500|$|The National Museum of Ireland {{is clearly}} not correct in saying that the fashion began after Queen Victoria was {{presented}} with {{a replica of the}} [...] "Cavan Brooch" [...] on her visit to Dublin to see the Great Industrial Exhibition in 1853; the Royal Collection has two brooches that Prince Albert bought for her from West & Son in 1849 on an earlier visit to Dublin, which were already being made in editions. [...] Albert presented them in November and at Christmas that year: [...] "...such beautiful souvenirs, both made after those very curious old Irish ornaments <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> College in Dublin, one a silver shawl brooch, in smaller size than the original" [...] was her reaction to the November gift. [...] A later gift from Albert included a setting of a cairngorm he had picked up when walking in the Scottish Highlands, a more authentic type of gem than the brightly coloured foreign stones used in much Celtic Revival jewellery.|$|E

Bit by bit, that early potential <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Secret Wars" [...] tie-in starts to bear fruit in A-Force #3." [...] Lake gave the issue a 7.5 saying, [...] "Bucking the usual slow roll-out most super team books enjoy, A-Forces latest is again a high energy affair. Where last issue saw Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson provide a welcome jump in character development and explored relationship dynamics, issue #3 offers a more action oriented focus." [...] Partridge gave it an 8 and said, [...] "Writers Kelly Thompson and G. Willow Wilson continue the dazzling chemistry and tension between the team {{while at the same time}} keeping each woman's voice on point and selling Antimatter as a real threat to the team." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{touring the}} Mediterranean with Lina in 1904, the couple stopped over in Palestine, expecting {{it to be}} but one stop of many. He wrote, [...] "On {{reaching}} Jerusalem, we changed our plans. All that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land made such a deep impression on us that we gave {{up the idea of}} going to other places. Visiting the holy sights of which one hears and reads since childhood, watching the scenes in life as pictured in the Bible, was most soul-stirring. From that time on we felt a strange and intense desire to return to the land." [...] Nathan and Lina became staunch Zionists. He built soup kitchens for the aged and the blind and the physically defective in 1917. He supported workrooms so that unskilled laborers could find employment. He built health stations which ministered to the victims of malaria and trachoma. He believed strongly in palliative care. He provided $250,000 for the establishment of the Jerusalem Health Center and made possible the founding of a Pasteur Institute. He lent moral and material support to the farmers and colonists of Israel and labored {{in the interests of the}} Hebrew University.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the simple}} solutions, the [...] "combined doors solution" [...] comes closest to a {{conditional}} solution, as <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> discussion of approaches using {{the concept of}} odds and Bayes theorem. It {{is based on the}} deeply rooted intuition that revealing information that is already known does not affect probabilities. But, knowing that the host can open one of the two unchosen doors to show a goat does not mean that opening a specific door would not affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door. The point is, though we know in advance that the host will open a door and reveal a goat, we do not know which door he will open. If the host chooses uniformly at random between doors hiding a goat (as is the case in the standard interpretation), this probability indeed remains unchanged, but if the host can choose non-randomly between such doors, then the specific door that the host opens reveals additional information. The host can always open a door revealing a goat and (in the standard interpretation of the problem) the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen door does not change, but it is not because of the former that the latter is true. Solutions based on the assertion that the host's actions cannot affect the probability that the car is behind the initially chosen appear persuasive, but the assertion is simply untrue unless each of the host's two choices are equally likely, if he has a choice (...) [...] The assertion therefore needs to be justified; without justification being given, the solution is at best incomplete. The answer can be correct but the reasoning used to justify it is defective.|$|E
