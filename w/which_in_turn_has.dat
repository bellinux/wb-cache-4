5|$|A catastrophic injury such as SCI puts {{strain on}} marriages and other romantic relationships, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> {{important}} implications for quality of life. Partners of injured people often feel out of control, overwhelmed, angry, and guilty while having added work related to the injury, less help with responsibilities like parenting, and loss of wages. Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E
5|$|Although {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain {{and parts of the}} body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
5|$|Egypt {{was ruled}} by the Shi'ite Fatimid dynasty from 969, {{independent}} from the Sunni Abbasid rulers in Baghdad and with a rival Shi'ite caliphconsidered the successor to the Muslim prophet Mohammad. The caliph's chief administrator, called the vizier, was chiefly responsible for governance. From 1121 the system fell into murderous political intrigue and Egypt declined from its previous affluent state. This encouraged Baldwin III of Jerusalem to plan an invasion that was only halted by the payment by Egypt of a tribute of 160,000 gold dinars. In 1163 the deposed vizier, Shawar, visited Zengi's son and successor, Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo, in Damascus seeking political and military support. Some historians have considered Nur ad-Din's support as a visionary attempt to surround the Crusaders, but in practice he prevaricated before responding only {{when it became clear}} that the Crusaders might gain an unassailable foothold on the Nile. Nur al-Din sent his Kurdish general, Shirkuh, who stormed Egypt and restored Shawar. However, Shawar asserted his independence and allied with Baldwin's brother and successor Amalric of Jerusalem. When Amalric broke the alliance in a ferocious attack, Shawar again requested military support from Syria, and Shirkuh was sent by Nur ad-Din for a second time. Amalric retreated, but the victorious Shirkuh had Shawar executed and was appointed vizier. Barely two months later he died, to be succeeded by his nephew, Yusuf ibn Ayyub, who has become known by his honorific 'Salah al-Din', 'the goodness of faith', <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> become westernised as Saladin. Nur al-Din died in 1174. He was the first Muslim to unite Aleppo and Damascus in the Crusade era. Some Islamic contemporaries promoted the idea that there was a natural Islamic resurgence under Zengi, through Nur al-Din to Saladin although this was not as straightforward and simple as it appears. Saladin imprisoned all the caliph's heirs, preventing them from having children, as opposed to having them all killed, which would have been normal practice, to extinguish the bloodline. Assuming control after the death of his overlord, Nur al-Din, Saladin had the strategic choice of establishing Egypt as an autonomous power or attempting to become the preeminent Muslim in the Eastern Mediterraneanhe chose the latter.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, the middle {{course of the}} river was an area of {{widespread}} logging. The discovery of petroleum at nearby Spindletop led to the river basin becoming the scene of widespread oil drilling. The lower river became heavily industrialized, developed with many oil refineries and chemical plants. Such alteration to the wetlands resulted in a degradation of the water quality, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> led to on-going efforts to restore {{the quality of the}} river. In addition, draining of wetlands and dredging of bayous has caused decline of wetlands, and coastal erosion, making the area much more vulnerable to hurricane damage.|$|E

25|$|Results {{have been}} mixed as the lack of {{mechanical}} grip {{has resulted in the}} more ingenious designers clawing back the deficit with aerodynamic gripâ pushing more force onto the tyres through wings and aerodynamic devices, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> resulted in less overtaking as these devices tend to make the wake behind the car 'dirty' (turbulent), preventing other cars from following closely due to their dependence on 'clean' air to make the car stick to the track. The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{place of}} Riesling, the easier {{cultivated}} MÃ¼ller-Thurgau grape (14.7%) and other Riesling crossings like Kerner (4.6%) were planted {{in large quantities}} on the sites that were not suitable for Riesling, and which in many cases had been previously used for other agricultural purposes. A negative consequence of these large-scale plantings is that the wine produced from these sites are typically of a lower quality than Riesling wines <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> a depressing economic effect on the prices of all Mosel wines. While consumers have benefited with top quality Riesling wines being underpriced in comparison {{with some of the}} world's other great wines from places like Bordeaux, Burgundy and California, the economic hardship created by the prices has caused some of the smaller Mosel vineyards to go out of business.|$|E

25|$|Phylogeny {{as applied}} to {{historical}} linguistics involves the evolutionary descent of languages. The phylogeny problem {{is the question of}} what specific tree, in the tree model of language evolution, best explains the paths of descent of all the members of a language family from a common language, or proto-language (at the root of the tree) to the attested languages (at the leaves of the tree). The Germanic languages form a tree with Proto-Germanic at its root that is a branch of the Indo-European tree, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> Proto-Indo-European at its root. Borrowing of lexical items from contact languages makes the relative position of the Germanic branch within Indo-European less clear than the positions of the other branches of Indo-European.

25|$|Following the {{economic}} {{reforms in the}} 1990s, satellite television channels from around the worldâBBC, CNN, CNBC, and other private television channels gained {{a foothold in the}} country. There are no regulations to control the ownership of satellite dish antennas and also for operating cable television systems in India, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>has</b> helped for an impressive growth in the viewership. The {{growth in the number of}} satellite channels was triggered by corporate business houses such as Star TV group and Zee TV. Initially restricted to music and entertainment channels, viewership grew, giving rise to several channels in regional languages, especially Hindi. The main news channels available were CNN and BBC World. In the late 1990s, many current affairs and news channels sprouted, becoming immensely popular because of the alternative viewpoint they offered compared to Doordarshan. Some of the notable ones are Aaj Tak (run by the India Today group) and STAR News, CNN-IBN, Times Now, initially run by the NDTV group and their lead anchor, Prannoy Roy (NDTV now has its own channels, NDTV 24x7, NDTV Profit and NDTV India). Over the years, Doordarshan services also have grown from a single national channel to six national and eleven regional channels. Nonetheless, it has lost the leadership in market, though it underwent many phases of modernisation in order to contain tough competition from private channels.|$|E
