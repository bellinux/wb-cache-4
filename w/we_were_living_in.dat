25|$|It was Fala, my husband's little dog, {{who never}} really readjusted. Once, in 1945, when General Eisenhower came {{to lay a}} wreath on Franklin's grave, {{the gates of the}} regular {{driveway}} were opened and his automobile approached the house accompanied by the wailing of the sirens of a police escort. When Fala heard the sirens, his legs straightened out, his ears pricked up and I knew that he expected to see his master coming down the drive as he had come so many times. Later, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the cottage, Fala always lay near the dining-room door where he could watch both entrances just as he did when his master was there. Franklin would often decide suddenly to go somewhere and Fala had to watch both entrances in order to be ready to spring up and join the party on short notice. Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return.|$|E

The room had been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with not very much covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this pigsty. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a toilet, like {{right next to the}} ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E

[...] "We didn't have a day off in the five-and-a-half weeks we were there, 12 or 14 hours a day," [...] Ross said in a 2005 interview. [...] "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," [...] recalled Ross.

60|$|But {{the most}} shamefully {{mercenary}} engagement that I think Amenda ever entered into, was {{one with a}} 'bus conductor. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the north of London then, {{and she had a}} young man, a cheesemonger, who kept a shop in Lupus Street, Chelsea. He could not come up to her because of the shop, so once a week she used to go down to him. One did not ride ten miles for a penny in those days, and she found the fare from Holloway to Victoria and back a severe tax upon her purse. The same 'bus that took her down at six brought her back at ten. During the first journey the 'bus conductor stared at Amenda; during the second he talked to her, during the third he gave her a cocoanut, during the fourth he proposed to her, and was promptly accepted. After that, Amenda was enabled to visit her cheesemonger without expense.|$|E

60|$|Years later, {{when she}} had left us and when I had grown almost to manhood and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> another place, I found that we had as {{neighbour}} a Belgian gentleman who was a botanist. I {{could not find a}} specimen of my plant to show him, but gave him a minute description of it as an annual, with very large, tough, permanent roots, also that it exuded a thick milky juice when the stem was broken, and produced its yellow seeds in a long, cylindrical, sharply-pointed pod full of bright silvery down, and I gave him sketches of flower and leaf. He succeeded in finding it in his books: the species had been known upwards of thirty years, and the discoverer, who happened to be an Englishman, had sent seed and roots to the Botanical Societies abroad he corresponded with; the species had been named after him, and it was to be found now growing in some of the Botanical Gardens of Europe.|$|E
6000|$|This reminds me--nine years ago, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> Tedworth Square, London, {{a report}} was cabled to the American {{journals}} that I was dying. I {{was not the}} one. It was another Clemens, a cousin of mine,--Dr. J. Ross Clemens, now of St. Louis--who was due to die but presently escaped, by some chicanery or other characteristic of the tribe of Clemens. The London representatives of the American papers began to flock in, with American cables in their hands, to inquire into my condition. There was nothing the matter with me, and each in his turn was astonished, and disappointed, to find me reading and smoking in my study and worth next to nothing as a text for transatlantic news. One of these men was a gentle and kindly and grave and sympathetic Irishman, who hid his sorrow the best he could, and tried to look glad, {{and told me that}} his paper, the Evening Sun, had cabled him that it was reported in New York that I was dead.

But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this {{new generation}}, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die." ...|$|E

"Once upon a time," [...] {{continued}} Madam, much {{flattered by}} {{the row of}} interested faces before her, [...] "my father went away on business, leaving mother, aunt, and us girls to Jack's care. Very proud he was, to be sure, of the responsibility, {{and the first thing}} he did was to load that pistol and keep it by his bed, in our great worriment, for we feared he 'd kill himself with it. For a week all went well; then we were startled by the news that robbers were about. All sorts of stories flew through the town (<b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the country then); some said that certain houses were marked with a black cross, and those were always robbed; others, that there was a boy in the gang, for windows, so small that they were considered safe, were entered by some little rogue. At one place the thieves had a supper, and left ham and cake in the front yard. Mrs. Jones found Mrs. Smith's shawl in her orchard, with a hammer and an unknown teapot near it.

6000|$|During {{the height}} of the malady, an old English general officer, who had served in India, and who was now {{residing}} near us, sent me an invitation to dinner. Tired of seeing no one, I went. Here everything was as tranquil as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the purest atmosphere in Europe. Sir ----, my host, observed that he had got seasoned in India, and that he believed good living one of the best preventives against the disease. The Count de ---- came in just before dinner was announced, and whispered to me that some twelve or fifteen hundred had been buried the previous day, although less than a thousand had been reported. This gentleman told a queer anecdote, which he said came from very respectable authority, and which he gave as he had heard it. About ten days before the cholera appeared, a friend of his had accompanied one of the Polish generals, who are now in Paris, a short distance into the country to dine. On quitting the house, the Pole stopped to gaze intently at the horizon. His companion inquired what he saw, when, pointing to a hazy appearance in the atmosphere, of rather an unusual kind, the other said, [...] "You will have the cholera here in less than ten days; such appearances always preceded it in the North."
