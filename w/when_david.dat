5|$|Jolliffe's motives {{regarding}} his accusations, {{as well as}} his choice of words, would be questioned for many years afterwards. That would change. In the late 1970s, <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Lewis was doing research for his Memoirs he came across archival evidence proving the charge.

5|$|David Wallace {{comes to}} the Scranton branch and says that the client was so pleased with the {{discount}} that they {{decided to make the}} company their exclusive provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. <b>When</b> <b>David</b> sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E

5|$|David's time as Prince of the Cumbrians and Earl {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of his life as a great territorial lord. His earldom probably began in 1113, when Henry I arranged David's marriage to Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon, who was the heiress to the Huntingdon–Northampton lordship. As her husband, David used the title of earl, and there was the prospect that David's children by her would inherit all the honours borne by Matilda's father Waltheof. 1113 is the year <b>when</b> <b>David,</b> for the first time, can be found in possession of territory in what is now Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other {{at either end of}} a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot in order to protect himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Stirling was {{pitching}} his idea for a dedicated airborne commando unit (which later evolved into the Special Air Service) he obtained Clarke's support partly by promising to use the SAS name. From late 1942, Clarke used the 1st SAS in his major order of battle deception (codenamed Operation Cascade). The brigade formed part of the fictional 4th Airborne Division; between then {{and the end of}} the war it was used to mislead Axis commanders about the strength of Allied forces in North Africa, and as part of several specific tactical deceptions.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opponents in}} the semi-finals were Borussia Mönchengladbach, the team they had beaten to win the European Cup the {{previous}} year. The first leg was played in Germany at the Bökelbergstadion, which was Borussia's home ground at that time. Borussia took an early lead when Wilfried Hannes scored. Liverpool equalised in the 88th minute, <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Johnson scored, but in the following minute Rainer Bonhof scored from a 22-yard free-kick, so Borussia won 2-1. In the second leg, at Anfield, Ray Kennedy scored for Liverpool in the sixth minute, Kenny Dalglish scored in the 35th minute, and Jimmy Case scored in the 56th minute, giving Liverpool a 3–0 win in the match and a 4–2 win on aggregate, and securing a place in their second consecutive European Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Schmid spent 19 {{seasons as}} the head coach at UCLA, accumulating a record of 322–63–33(wins–losses–draws), and {{reaching}} 16 consecutive playoffs between 1983 and 1998. He earned a reputation for producing some of the nation's best goalkeepers <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Vanole, Brad Friedel, and Matt Reis came through the university. By 1994, he had coached 16 players at UCLA who were later selected for the U.S. national team. Schmid avoided recruiting foreign talent to bolster his squad. He relied mainly on players from California, whom he believed to be less physically aggressive but more creative and attacking.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>David's</b> first book, Mediterranean Food was {{published}} in 1950 the British public was still enduring food rationing after the Second World War.

5|$|The British {{government}} and Welsh employment bodies funded and subsidized external businesses to locate new ventures within the valleys {{to replace the}} vanishing heavy industries. The first attempt to bring in business not connected to the coal mining industry began in the 1920s <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Jones, Town Clerk to the Rhondda Urban Council, gained government support in attracting outside businesses to the area. Companies included Alfred Polikoff's clothing factory, Messers Jacob Beatus, manufacturing cardboard boxes and Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd. Following {{the end of the}} Second World War, 23 companies were set up in the Rhondda Valleys, eighteen of them sponsored by the Board of Trade. Most companies had periods of growth and collapse, notably Thorn EMI in the 1970s and Burberry in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|United {{were drawn}} against fellow Premier League side Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final.

However, United responded and two goals from Scholes in the remainder of the first half gave United the lead. They scored a third in the second half when striker Ruud van Nistelrooy converted a penalty. United won the match 3–1 and progressed to the final after winning the tie 4–2.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>David</b> O'Leary {{replaced}} Graham {{as manager}} {{it became clear}} that his centre-back pairing of choice would be Lucas Radebe and the 18-year-old Jonathan Woodgate, so Wetherall decided to leave Leeds for a club where he could play regular first-team football. A transfer to nearby Huddersfield Town fell through after terms had been agreed, and the player's reluctance to move house while wife Caroline was heavily pregnant with their second son caused him to reject an offer from Southampton. After eight years with Leeds, having scored 18 goals from 250 games in all competitions, he accepted an offer from fellow West Yorkshire club Bradford City.|$|E

5|$|With Rose {{absent in}} the United States, Windle won the 220yd, 440yd, 880yd and 1650yd {{freestyle}} at the 1963 Australian Championships, {{in times of}} 2min 2.8s, 4min 23.0s, 9min 10.5s and 17min 59.6s respectively. His quest to sweep all of the freestyle events failed <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Dickson defeated him in a touch finish in the 110yd race. The pair were neck and neck but Dickson judged the finishing touch on the wall better. Windle collected two more wins {{as part of the}} New South Wales team in the 4×220yd and the 4×110yd freestyle relays, anchoring both quartets.|$|E
5|$|After Sorkin's {{completion}} of the script in January 2014, development on the project began to heat up <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Fincher entered negotiations to direct the film, with Fincher selecting Christian Bale as his choice for Jobs. However, in April 2014, Fincher exited the project due to contractual disputes. Danny Boyle was then hired to direct, with Leonardo DiCaprio in discussions for the role. In October, DiCaprio exited, with Bale, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Bradley Cooper being considered. Sorkin revealed {{in an interview that}} month that Bale was once again cast in the role, with Seth Rogen entering negotiations to play Wozniak, and Jessica Chastain being considered for a part. Ike Barinholtz revealed he had auditioned for the role of Wozniak. In November, Bale again left the project, with Michael Fassbender emerging as a frontrunner to replace him, and Scarlett Johansson reportedly being offered a role before Sony put the project in turnaround and Universal Pictures acquired it.|$|E
5|$|Although Arsenal and Manchester United had {{previously}} contested many significant matches, Sir Alex Ferguson believed the rivalry started in January 1987 <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Rocastle was sent off for retaliating against a foul on Norman Whiteside. It is, however, generally perceived {{to have begun}} in October 1990, when a brawl between both sides at Old Trafford resulted in both clubs being docked points in the 1990–91 First Division. The scuffle started when Arsenal's Anders Limpar, who scored the only goal of the game, contested for the ball with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin. Limpar's teammate Nigel Winterburn tackled Irwin, which prompted Brian McClair and Irwin to retaliate. Winterburn was pushed onto the advertising hoardings and all the players bar goalkeeper David Seaman partook in a 20-second mêlée. As well as a points deduction, both clubs fined several of their players, and in Arsenal's case, their manager too. Arsenal and United next faced each other at Highbury {{a little over a}} month later in the Football League Cup fourth round. 19-year-old winger Lee Sharpe scored a hat-trick as United won the tie 6–2.|$|E

5000|$|He is the {{suspected}} antagonist {{in the story}} but is actually not.

5|$|City's unbeaten run was {{extended}} to six games <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Brown scored on his debut to beat Macclesfield Town 1–0. The run {{came to an end}} with consecutive 2–1 defeats to Bury and Rochdale. On 20 February 2008, David Wetherall, who had played nearly 300league games for City since he joined in 1999, announced he would retire {{at the end of the}} season. City won their first win in three games when they beat Notts County for the second time in as many months, with a 3–1 win. Three days later City added a second consecutive win by defeating Rotherham United 3–2 in the game which had been postponed in December, with Lee Bullock scoring his first goal for the club. The same day, club chairman Julian Rhodes announced a new season ticket offer in a bid to fill more of the 25,000-seater stadium for the following season by offering free tickets if more than 9,000adult tickets were bought.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{appointed}} two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court. The first vacancy occurred <b>when</b> <b>David</b> Davis {{resigned to}} enter the Senate during the election controversy of 1876. On taking office, Hayes appointed John Marshall Harlan to the seat. A former candidate for governor of Kentucky, Harlan had been Benjamin Bristow's campaign manager at the 1876 Republican convention, and Hayes had earlier considered him for Attorney General. Hayes submitted the nomination in October 1877, but it aroused some dissent in the Senate because of Harlan's limited experience in public office. Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty-four years, in which he voted (usually in the minority) for an aggressive enforcement {{of the civil rights}} laws. In 1880, a second seat became vacant upon the resignation of Justice William Strong. Hayes nominated William Burnham Woods, a carpetbagger Republican circuit court judge from Alabama. Woods served six years on the Court, ultimately proving a disappointment to Hayes as he interpreted the Constitution in a manner more similar to that of Southern Democrats than to Hayes's own preferences.|$|E
