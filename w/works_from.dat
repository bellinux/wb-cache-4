5|$|Besides the {{internal}} references {{that they often}} make to earlier passages within them, Schubert's last sonatas contain distinct allusions and resemblances {{to some of his}} previous works, mostly earlier piano works, as well as many of his songs.

5|$|For unknown reasons, Ruisdael {{almost entirely}} stopped dating his work from 1653.

Dating subsequent work has therefore been largely based on detective work and speculation.|$|E

5|$|From 1833–36, {{he lived}} in Switzerland.
