It is the outer portion of the muscle where the muscle attaches to the body wall.|$|R

5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not Enough from the film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the film.|$|E

5|$|In July 1995, the Minnesota Vikings {{acquired}} Alipate for use {{on special}} teams. Throughout the season, Alipate was also used as a backup for multiple positions, including the middle linebacker and strongside linebacker. He played in all 16 regular season games that year, but Alipate's playing time was limited mostly to special teams. Alipate <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the Vikings after training camp in 1996 in favor of first-round draft pick Duane Clemons. Alipate tried out for the Vikings in 1998 but was not signed by the team.|$|E

On the Silver Vision home video release in the UK, this match was placed after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. Up next, Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the Balmoral Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the bagpipes.|$|E

5|$|The first season, which premiered on March 19, 2009, was {{the number}} one primetime cable {{telecast}} among females 12–24 years old {{and one of the}} top four among all viewers 12–34 years old. The second season began filming at the school in 2009, and first aired on January 16, 2010. The show <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> one hour to 30minutes and focused on new transfer students instead of current SCPA students, leading some students and parents to complain that the admission process had been compromised. The school denied the claim.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{was created by}} Rembrandt in 1637. It was not given an official title. The current one is the most recent, widely accepted one. Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by {{an analysis of the}} panel's wood, which showed that it <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> a tree felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River Landscape with Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been X-rayed.|$|E
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E
5000|$|... "Boneless" [...] {{short ribs}} <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> either the chuck or plate, and consist of rib meat {{separated}} from the bone. [...] "Boneless country-style short ribs", however, are not true short ribs. They are found primarily in the United States, and <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the chuck eye roll (serving as a less expensive alternative to rib steak).|$|R
5|$|Pork steaks <b>are</b> {{generally}} <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> {{the shoulder}} of the pig, but can also <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the loin or leg of the pig. Shoulder steaks <b>are</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the same primal cut of meat most commonly used for pulled pork, and can be quite tough without long cooking times due to the high amount of collagen in the meat; therefore, pork shoulder steaks are often cooked slower than a typical beef steak, and may be stewed or simmered in barbecue sauce during cooking.|$|R
5000|$|The pre- and-post-show songs [...] "Somewhere in Time" [...] and [...] "Open Your Eyes" [...] <b>were</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the 1997 production.

5|$|After his {{professional}} baseball career ended, Richard returned to Louisiana and invested in some business ventures. He fell prey to an oil business scam, losing over $300,000 in the deal. A few years later, Richard paid $669,000 in a divorce settlement to ex-wife Carolyn. He married and divorced again, losing his suburban Houston home {{and most of}} his money. In 1989, Richard was drafted into the Senior Professional Baseball Association and played for the Orlando Juice but <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the team in preseason play. In the winter of 1994, Richard was homeless and destitute and lived under a highway overpass in Houston.|$|E
5|$|Alford {{was signed}} by the BC Lions and participated at {{training}} camp in 1996, but he <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> the roster in late June. Despite not being offered {{a spot on the}} practice squad, Alford remained in Surrey and practiced with the Lions for free. He was signed onto the active roster in late July after the Lions cut receivers Darryl Frazier and Clarence Verdin. Alford made his CFL debut against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats on July 27, 1996. After recording over 200 receiving yards across two games in August, Alford began starting at wide receiver. He finished the season as the second most-productive Lions receiver with 721 receiving yards, leading the team to nominate Alford for the league-wide Most Outstanding Rookie award.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Culver Line extension, the BRT's fare <b>was</b> <b>cut</b> <b>from</b> 10 cents to 5 cents, and Coney Island became a much more {{affordable}} vacation area compared to in previous years. In 1923, these lines came {{under the control of the}} Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the BRT's successor company. Riders at the new station were promised trains that ran every three minutes during rush hours, but this quickly proved not to be true. In 1923, a reporter for the Brooklyn Standard Union observed that rush hour trains had headways of eight minutes on the Sea Beach Line and fifteen minutes on the West End Line, and that no direct Manhattan service was being run on either the Brighton or Culver Lines during rush hours.|$|E
