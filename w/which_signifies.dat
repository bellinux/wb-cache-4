5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray <b>which</b> <b>signifies</b> different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E

25|$|Meaning and truth. The most {{important}} and striking difference between Megarian-Stoic logic and Aristotelian logic is that Megarian-Stoic logic concerns propositions, not terms, and is thus closer to modern propositional logic. The Stoics distinguished between utterance (phone), which may be noise, speech (lexis), which is articulate but which may be meaningless, and discourse (logos), which is meaningful utterance. The most original part of their theory {{is the idea that}} what is expressed by a sentence, called a lekton, is something real; this corresponds to what is now called a proposition. Sextus says that according to the Stoics, three things are linked together: that <b>which</b> <b>signifies,</b> that which is signified, and the object; for example, that <b>which</b> <b>signifies</b> is the word Dion, and that which is signified is what Greeks understand but barbarians do not, and the object is Dion himself.|$|E

25|$|Loop My Loop is a {{back-lit}} cibachrome {{photograph of}} blond hair intertwined with a pig's intestines. The golden locks signify purity and love knotted with the intestines, <b>which</b> <b>signifies</b> the raw animalistic side to human nature. This work has links {{with the ideas of}} Georges Bataille, a French intellectual and literary figure who worked in fields such as anthropology, sociology, and history of art. Chadwick's Loop My Loop is similar to her work from 1990, titled Nostalgie de la Boue. In this work, two rounded cibachrome transparencies were hung one above the other. The top one contained a ring of earthworms, while the bottom pictured someone's scalp with the center imploding. Both images appear similar, but by placing the worms above the human scalp the distinction upholding the human above the animal is no longer held.|$|E
25|$|The book {{refers to}} the book of learning, however, for a {{university}} that sought to implement the Oxbridge traditions of teaching excellence, {{it is important to}} note that the La Trobe book, unlike Oxford, Cambridge, Sydney or Monash, does not contain clasps, <b>which</b> <b>signifies</b> that the book cannot be opened with ease. Its absence does not suggest that the La Trobian approach to learning is any less rigorous, rather, it represents a different approach towards knowledge that can only be seen in conjunction with the other heraldic symbols. That is, that learning and the pursuit of enlightenment is attained through the journey that one undertakes to achieve their desired outcome. Even then, the outcome at which one has reached, may not have been the outcome initially sought. Thus, it is the importance placed on the journey of learning, and what is derived from it, that forms the heart of the university philosophy.|$|E
