5|$|Many senior officers, {{particularly}} the Catholic Generals Khiêm and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried what they {{viewed as a}} handing of power to the Buddhist leaders. They tried to remove Khánh in favor of Minh, and recruited many officers to their plot. Khiêm and Thieu sought out US Ambassador Maxwell Taylor for a private endorsement of their plan, but Taylor did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiêm's group from acting on their plans.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after taking}} charge, Manekshaw reached the {{conclusion}} that poor leadership had been {{a significant factor in}} IV Corps' failure in the war with China. He felt that his foremost responsibility was to improve the morale of his demoralized soldiers, and issued orders to advance to the positions lost in the war, which kept morale up. Just five days into his command, Nehru visited the headquarters with his daughter Indira Gandhi and the COAS, and found the troops advancing. Nehru stated that he did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> men to die. The COAS assured him that he would get the orders rescinded. Manekshaw retorted that the COAS should allow him to command his troops the way he wished or send him to a staff appointment. Gandhi intervened and told Manekshaw to go ahead. Though Gandhi had no official position, she had great influence in the government. The next task Manekshaw took-up was to reorganize the troops in North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). He took measures to overcome the shortages of equipment, accommodation, and clothing.|$|E

25|$|Khánh's {{concessions}} sparked {{opposition from}} Khiêm and Thiệu, both Catholic. They tried {{to remove him}} in favour of Minh, and they recruited many officers into their plot. Khiêm and Thiệu sought out Taylor and sought a private endorsement for a coup against Khánh, however the U.S. ambassador did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the government. This deterred Khiêm's group from staging a coup.|$|E
25|$|Fearing that {{he could}} be toppled by the intensifying protests, Khánh made concessions, {{repealing}} the new constitution and police measures, and promising to reinstate civilian rule and remove the Cần Lao, a Catholic political apparatus covertly used to maintain the Diệm regime in power by seeking out dissenters, etc. Many senior officers, in particular the Catholics, such as Khiêm and Thiệu, decried what they viewed as a handing of power to the Buddhist leaders, They then tried to remove Khánh in favour of Minh, and recruited many officers into their plot. Khiêm and Thiệu sought out U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Taylor and sought a private endorsement for a coup, but Taylor did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the already unstable government. This deterred Khiêm's group from following through on their plans.|$|E
25|$|In August, Khánh {{drafted a}} new constitution, {{which would have}} {{augmented}} his personal power and hamstrung Minh of what authority he had left as well as ousting him from power. However, this only served to weaken Khánh as large urban demonstrations broke out, led by Buddhists, calling {{for an end to}} the state of emergency and the new constitution. In response to claims that he was harking back to the Diệm era of Roman Catholic domination, Khánh made concessions to the Buddhists, sparking opposition from Khiêm and Thiệu, both Catholics. They then tried to remove him in favour of Minh, and they recruited many officers. Khiêm and Thiệu sought out Taylor and sought a private endorsement to install Minh by staging a coup against Khánh, but the U.S. ambassador did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the government.

500|$|Newark city {{officials}} decided {{they did not}} <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> ships scrapped along the city's waterfront. Newark was implementing a beautification plan for the waterfront, and had allocated $70 million for improvements. As such, the city declared that any attempt to bring New Mexico to Newark would be blocked. Two city fireboats, Michael P. Duffy and William T. Brennan, were dispatched and were prepared to use their fire hoses and chemical sprayers to halt Lipsett and New Mexico. In response, Lipsett organized its own force of four tugs, and the United States Coast Guard declared it would guarantee safe passage of New Mexico, provided legal entry was permitted. This showdown was dubbed by the press as the [...] "Battle of Newark Bay", while the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce announced it would protest Newark's [...] "slur" [...] of New Mexico's namesake, through its refusal to admit the battleship.|$|E
500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E
500|$|Further reviews {{tended to}} be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's starting {{to feel as if}} Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> of this. I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a result, the Communist Party {{opposed the}} government, rejecting it as pro-Nazi. Perón countered the Communist complaints, saying that [...] "The excuses they seek {{are very well}} known. They {{say that we are}} 'nazis', I declare we are as far from Nazism as from any other foreign ideology. We are only Argentines and want, above all, the common good for Argentines. We do not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> [...] fraud, nor more lies. We do not want that those who do not work live from those who do".|$|E
2500|$|In August 1964, after Khánh {{decided to}} take more power for himself by declaring a state of {{emergency}} and introducing a new constitution, Buddhists launched protests against the new junta, claiming that there was a plot to revive the Diêm era by predominantly Catholic groups such as Cần Lao veterans and Đại Việt supporters, pinpointing Khiêm and Thiệu, both Catholics who had been favoured by Diêm. Khánh's concessions to the Buddhists sparked opposition from Khiêm and Thiệu, who tried to remove Khánh in favour of Minh, recruiting other officers. Khiêm said [...] "Khánh felt there was no choice but to accept since the influence of [...] Trí Quang was so great that he could not only turn {{the majority of the people}} against the government but could influence the effectiveness of the armed forces". They sought out Taylor and sought a private endorsement for a coup against Khánh, but the U.S. ambassador did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> changes in leadership, fearing a corrosive effect on the government. This deterred Khiêm's group from toppling Khánh.|$|E
2500|$|Gigi Becali, {{known for}} his {{repeated}} homophobic comments at previous LGBT events, stated, [...] "I have nothing against them, but why they make a parade, I don’t understand. Let them meet in the park, 300, 500 of them, to make a show. I would have nothing against it, but a parade, propaganda? It is abnormal." [...] Becali, {{who is also the}} president of the Steaua football club, stated that he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> homosexuals coming to Ghencea Stadium, but later appeared to contradict himself by saying [...] "Discrimination? It's discrimination if I don't let them come. Where's the discrimination?" [...] The National Council for Combating Discrimination announced that it will be investigating if Becali's comments breach Romania's anti-discrimination laws, which also cover speech. In a later interview, however, Becali declared, [...] "I love them [...] {{in the same way that}} I love all other people. They can marry at the City Hall, every day, 10 of them if they want to. But in church, they don't have a place.|$|E

2500|$|They circulated, for instance, the reprint of {{an article}} quoted by the Aryan in its issue of March–April 1912 : [...] "The smoke-coloured Hindu, exotic, unmixable, picturesque, a languid worker and a refuge for fleas, we will always have with us, but we don’t <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> of him. We don’t want any Hindu women. We don’t want any Hindu children. It’s {{nonsense}} to talk about Hindu assimilation. The Sikh may be of Aryan stock; I always thought he was of Jewish extraction. He may be near-white though he does not look it. But we know him, and don’t <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> of him. British Columbia cannot allow any more of the dark meat {{of the world to}} come to this province. To deport these British subjects from India would be the wisest thing. These Sikhs are far too obtrusive. They are of no use to the country. British Columbia would be a hundred times better off without them. Certainly no more of them must be allowed to come." [...] Both Das and Kumar with the help of Surendramohan Bose and Hussain Rahim [...] had set to bring together the various Indian communities in terms of a united action, until it reached the climax in the Gadhar organisation. Bose had been sent to Japan by the Scientific and Industrial Association of Kolkata in 1906. On reaching Canada at the end of 1907, Bose had informed Sri Aurobindo on 26 December, that Bengalis were wrong in hoping for Japanese help in their nationalist movement, although they had some sympathisers. Specialised in chemistry, he also toured as a lecturer on Indian subjects. In 1913 he became the general secretary of the Hindustan Association of the USA. Shortly before leaving America, in 1913, [...] from Chicago, he sent to Harnam [...] notes and formulae of his own for making bombs. [...] In January 1914, Bose wrote again from Paris along with [...] "a valuable copy of the process used by the Russian Revolutionists..." [...] Having visited revolutionaries in Paris and Geneva, Bose reached India in February 1914. [...] Harnam Singh (of Sahri) was the other important revolutionary who shared with them this patriotic task : a former trooper of the 4th Cavalry in India, he had gone to China in 1904 and, three years later, reached Canada with Kumar. In 1908-1909 he attended school at Seattle, and went to Vancouver as Kumar’s guest. In a letter to Das, in July 1913, Kumar described Harnam {{as the leader of the}} revolutionary movement in Vancouver. Owing to his friendship with Harnam, Baba Gurdit Singh of the Komagata Maru affair knew well this zealous group and, prior to his expedition, had received from Das names and addresses of the leading Jugantar figures like Atulkrishna Ghose and Satish Chakravarti who worked under Jatindranath Mukherjee. [...] Harnam was deported from San Francisco on 26 September 1914.|$|E
2500|$|United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), a {{coalition}} of more than 1,300 international and U.S.-based organizations opposed to what they describe as [...] "our government's policy of permanent warfare and empire-building" [...] organized the March 19 actions. The events – involving up to 1000 people – took place throughout the downtown with protesters marching on 12th street to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building on Constitution Avenue declaring {{that they do not}} <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>more</b> tax money being used to wage war. Led, in part, by the War Resisters League and Code Pink, 31 people were arrested for crossing police lines at the IRS and blocking three entrances. [...] Demonstrators also gathered in front of institutions which profit from the war, such as the American Petroleum Institute – where they staged a sit-in blocking traffic – and at military recruitment offices. The protesters, including war veterans, demanded the arrests of President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as war criminals. Students for a Democratic Society protesters marched up and down K Street as part of their [...] "Funk the War" [...] protest to [...] "put on the map all the people who profited from the war". Other protesters hurled balloons full of red paint at a military recruiting station and smeared it on buildings of defense contractors Bechtel and Lockheed Martin. Many protesters marched to beating drums, and chanted, [...] "No blood for oil!" [...] Traffic in many areas was disrupted, and interruptions at the IRS were evident as workers inside were seen peering out windows at the protesters. At least thirty demonstrators were arrested around the IRS headquarters for crossing a police barricade. Two blocks from the Whitehouse, in McPherson Square, over two hundred protesters declared victory in shutting down traffic with some engaging the police while others chained their hands together inside school desks while demanding cuts in war spending and more money for education. [...] According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report published in October 2007, the U.S. war in Iraq could cost taxpayers $1.9 trillion by 2017 when counting the huge interest costs because combat is being financed with borrowed money.|$|E
