25|$|On average, 42 {{episodes of}} Blue Heelers were {{broadcast}} per year on Australian television, with each episode comprising fifty scenes. One episode was made every week. The scripts were written to a formula which allowed one day for rehearsal, two days on location {{and two days}} in the studio. Episodes were shot eight to ten weeks ahead of their scheduled broadcast date. There were 16 episodes {{in various stages of}} production at any one time (from the conception of new storylines to post-production). In addition, there were always seven complete episodes <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to air. Apart from the regular cast members, the show employed 4,300 guest actors annually, plus 30 extras every week. A total of 150 people were involved in some way with the show's production each week, including cast members, crew, wardrobe, publicists and writers.|$|E

[...] Horowitz went on to criticize this issue as a problem Sega would have again with the Sega 32X in 1994, stating, [...] "History would repeat itself in the harshest of manners only five years later. Sega's expectations of third party support for something it showed little enthusiasm for were entirely unrealistic and ultimately meant that no games would be in the pipeline." ...|$|E

Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark.

500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
500|$|The Washington Monument in Washington D.C. {{is often}} seen as {{a prime example of}} phallic {{architecture}} and American masculinity. The towering monument, made of marble, granite, and bluestone gneiss, it is both the world's tallest stone structure and the world's tallest obelisk, standing [...] according to the National Park Service. Construction of the monument began in 1848, was halted from 1854 to 1877, and was completed in 1884. In a Journal review, dated 17 October 1911, Arnold Bennett said of the monument, [...] "Saw Washington monument. Phallic. Appalling. A national catastrophe – only equalled by the Albert Memorial. Tiny doll-like people <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into it." [...] Dan Burstein says of it, [...] "Speaking of sex symbols, there is no more phallic symbol in existence than the Washington Monument, and the Capitol dome can be viewed as breastlike." [...] James Webb used a metaphor to praise the [...] "uplift" [...] power of the Washington Monument as a white phallus, [...] "piercing the air like a bayonet". In the futuristic film Hardwired, set in the United States where everything noteworthy is commercialized, the Washington Monument is used as a giant Trojan condoms billboard.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; I forgot myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E

500|$|Wilder-Neligan's first {{fight with}} his new {{battalion}} was the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, which commenced on 20 September {{as part of the}} Battle of Passchendaele. In the initial planning for this offensive, the 10th Battalion was committed to the third phase of the attack by the 3rd Brigade. For this attack, Wilder-Neligan had split his command into two. The assault would be carried out by two specially trained [...] "storm" [...] companies, with his other two companies responsible for carrying forward ammunition and equipment and [...] "mopping-up" [...] pockets of resistance. During the move to the start line, the two carrying and [...] "mopping-up" [...] companies of the battalion were caught in a heavy and persistent German barrage, suffered significant casualties and became disorganised. Wilder-Neligan sent back his adjutant to re-organise them, and they came through the German shell fire to their assembly positions. Although initially intended as the third wave of the brigade attack, the second wave 12th Battalion had moved to the left {{as a result of the}} German barrage, and the 10th effectively joined the second wave on its right. The 10th had also moved forward to avoid the heavy barrage, and had become intermingled with the first wave formed by the 11th Battalion. When a machine gun in a pillbox held up the leading troops, Wilder-Neligan sent one of his [...] "storm" [...] platoons to outflank the German position. When the platoon commander was killed, the South Australians [...] "went mad" [...] according to Wilder-Neligan, killing rather than capturing most of the German garrison. When the first objective was reached, Wilder-Neligan had his battalion fill the gap in the line to the right of the 12th Battalion. As soon as the two carrying and [...] "mopping-up" [...] companies reached the second objective, Wilder-Neligan left them there to dig in. During a pause in the battle while his two [...] "storm" [...] companies were <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward to the third objective, Wilder-Neligan had specially procured copies of the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail newspapers distributed for his men to read. With the help of the heavy creeping barrage, the third objective was quickly taken. During the battle, the unit suffered 207 casualties. On the day following the battle, he was billed by a London newspaper as [...] "The Eccentric Colonel", due to his distribution of newspapers to his waiting troops.|$|E

2500|$|At one Canadian service, {{hidden cameras}} showed {{a mother who}} was {{carrying}} her muscular dystrophy-afflicted daughter, Grace, being stopped by two screeners when they attempted {{to get into the}} line for a possible blessing from Hinn. The screeners asked the mother if Grace had been healed, and when the mother replied in the negative, they were told to return to their seats; the pair got out of line, but Grace, wanting [...] "Pastor Benny to pray for ," [...] asked her mother to support her as she tried to walk as a show of [...] "her faith in action," [...] according to the mother. After several unsuccessful attempts at walking, the pair left the arena in tears, both mother and daughter visibly upset at being turned aside and crying as they explained to the undercover reporters that all Grace had wanted was for Hinn to pray for her, but the staffers rushed them out of the line when they found out Grace had not been healed. A week later at a service in Toronto, Baptist evangelist Justin Peters, who wrote his Masters in Divinity thesis on Benny Hinn and has attended numerous Hinn crusades since 2000 as part of his research for his thesis and for a seminar he developed about the Word of Faith movement entitled A Call for Discernment, also demonstrated to the hidden cameras that [...] "people who look like me"—Peters has cerebral palsy, walks with arm-crutches, and is obviously and visibly disabled—"are never allowed on stage [...] it's always somebody who has some disability or disease that cannot be readily seen." [...] Like Grace and her mother, Peters was quickly intercepted as {{he came out of the}} wheelchair section (there is one at every crusade, situated at the back of the audience, far away from the stage, and never filmed for Hinn's TV show) in an attempt to join the line of those <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> onstage, and was told to take a seat.|$|E

Reed said that every comedian savours {{the chance to play}} a role like Point in which [...] "you like to see if you can make 'em cry a little". He also noted that, generally, [...] "I like anything where the dancing comes in". His least favourite role was Major-General Stanley in Pirates, a role that he relinquished in 1969. He also found two drawbacks to playing King Gama: [...] "the heavy make-up ... hid every feature of his face except his eyes, and made it impossible for him to wear his glasses so that he could do his newspaper crossword while <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on".
