5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations. Either <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> {{the center of}} an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the Copernican principle—or the universe is uniformly expanding everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker.|$|E

25|$|By {{what color}} of propriety {{a portion of}} the people of the State, can {{organize}} themselves into a body, independent of the civil power, and contravene the general laws of the land by preventing the free enjoyment of the right of citizenship to another portion of the people, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a loss to comprehend.|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> {{war with}} them: they look upon us as enemies – as invaders – as oppressors and persecutors – they resist our invasion.

25|$|We {{have made}} {{extraordinary}} progress {{the last couple}} of weeks and have come too far to walk away now. We are fully committed and prepared to work around the clock if that's what it takes to reach a final agreement. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a point where deals get done as long as both parties share a desire to cross the finish line together. There just isn't much left to resolve.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, {{and it is not}} recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E

He reports: [...] "there's lots of {{fighting}} where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> present, and just {{now we are}} in the German trenches, so have a busy time... I'd like to see you all again..." [...] For the next two days, the Canadian front line was under almost continuous bombardment. The 27th Battalion fared particularly badly, and on the night of 5–6 April, the 29th began relieving them, slowed down by the mud, extra equipment and a congestion of troops.|$|E

On the other formats, B-side tracks such as [...] "Till I Loved You", [...] "The Love Inside", and [...] "No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)" [...] were used.

500|$|Mike Ryan of Uproxx {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Newt Scamander {{is nothing like}} Harry, {{but it has to}} be this way. It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us feel like <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E

500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is {{going to bring}} us to the verge of {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism." [...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E

They've been carrying out atrocities since 1992. We must not permit the genocide that Milosevic has in mind for Kosovo to continue. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a critical hour." [...] He was critical of past inaction by the Clinton administration in the matter, and within days was urging {{that the use of}} ground troops not be ruled out. [...] McCain became a very frequent guest on television talk shows discussing the conflict, and his [...] "We are in it, now we must win it" [...] stance drew much attention. [...] On March 31, three American soldiers were captured by Yugoslavia; the next day, McCain canceled his planned roadshow, stating [...] "this is not an appropriate time to launch a political campaign." [...] He received media praise for his action and continued to be a highly visible spokesman for strong action regarding Kosovo; CNN pundit Mark Shields said that, [...] "In thirty-five years in Washington, I have never seen a debate dominated by an individual in the minority party as I've seen this one dominated by John McCain." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 2010, TV Tonight {{reported}} that Neighbours would reduce crew operations in 2011 so production could be upgraded. The changes {{meant that the}} location manager and catering team were no longer required, studio shoots would be reduced from three cameras to two, and location shots will be mainly confined to the Ramsay Street and Lassiter's complex sets, with occasional filming in one-off places. Of the changes, FremantleMedia said [...] "Neighbours is undergoing a work flow upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> the forefront of professionalism and efficiency." [...] They added that the show's production model had been in place since 1985 {{and that it was}} time to evolve it. On 14 March 2011, The Australian {{reported that}} Neighbours has become the first television show available to watch on a free iPhone application. Viewers are able to watch whole episodes within three hours of them airing on Eleven. Nick Spooner, the head of Ten digital media said [...] "This is part of what we call our 'three-screen approach' – broadcast, online and mobile – and it is intended to build viewer engagement with a show and our brand. This is a way for us to stay in touch with our audience and to keep them coming back." [...] To celebrate the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton, Neighbours filmed a specially commissioned scene for the UK episode airing on the same day as the wedding. The episode, which had already aired in Australia, marked the first time an Australian show recorded extra scenes for a UK broadcaster.|$|E
