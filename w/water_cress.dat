5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, such as <b>water</b> <b>cress</b> or floating sweetgrass, usually {{close to the}} surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic bags. In the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E

50|$|Historically, the River Lynch {{was named}} after the flat terraces, known as a lynch in Old English, which were formed when {{cultivating}} the steep slopes of a river valley, {{much the same as}} the rice terraces of South East Asia. The terrace, or lynch, was designed to reduce soil erosion by slowing the rapid run-off of water, and a series of these terraces gave the Lynch landscape a stepped appearance. These terraces were used extensively in the area directly above the River Lynch for the production of <b>water</b> <b>cress</b> during the 19th and early 20th centuries, using the fertile brick earth soils of the valley sides. The site of these former terraces is still clearly visible today within the Lampits housing estate, in the sloping open area below the course of the New River, leading downhill to Conduit Lane East and the Lynch Mill Pond. The terraces at the Lynch were situated above a deep funnel-shaped natural hole that carried water up from the chalk. The pond and watermill at Lynch Corner, fed by the spring, were described in medieval court rolls, as being ancient and known locally as 'Le Lince.' The New River, which passes directly overhead, closely hugging the 100 foot contour of the Lea Valley, destroyed much of the original landscape of the area, notably Lynch Hill and the Lynch Gap.|$|E

40|$|An {{introduction}} to the Taupo Volcanic Zone and probable sources of polluting elements entering the aquatic environment {{is followed by a}} description of collection and treatment of samples used in this study. The construction of a hydride generation apparatus for use with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer for the determination of arsenic and other hydride forming elements is described. Flame emission, flame atomic absorption and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (I. C. P. -E. S.) were used for the determination of other elements. Determinations of arsenic and other elements were made on some geothermal waters of the area. It was found that these waters contribute large (relative to background levels) amounts of arsenic, boron and alkali metals to the aquatic environment. Some terrestrial vegetation surrounding hot pools at Lake Rotokawa and the Champagne Pool at Waiotapu was found to have high arsenic concentrations. Arsenic determinations made on the waters of the Waikato River and some lakes of the Taupo Volcanic Zone revealed that water from the Waikato River between Lake Aratiatia and Whakamaru as well as Lakes Rotokawa, Rotomahana and Rotoehu was above the World Health Organisation limit for arsenic in drinking water (0. 05 µg/mL) at the time of sampling. Arsenic accumulates in the sediments of the Waikato River and Lakes of the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The levels were variable, but characteristically around 100 µg/g. Trout taken from the Waikato River and some lakes in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, had flesh arsenic concentrations of the same order of magnitude as the water from which they were taken. Trout from Lakes Rotorua, Rotoiti and Rotomahana contained average flesh mercury concentrations above the World Health Organisations limit for mercury in foodstuffs (0. 5 µg/g). There were positive correlations between weight, length and flesh mercury concentration. Freshwater mussels from Lakes Rotorua and Tarawera had arsenic concentrations above the World Health Organisations limit for arsenic in foodstuffs (2 µg/g). Shellfish taken {{from the mouth of the}} Waikato river and from Raglan were below the World Health Organisation's limit for arsenic and mercury.

Pesticides residues were quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The ability of these biological agents to detoxify and clean up these pesticide residues in both soil and plants was studied. In soil samples, the highest percentages of malathion-degradation were ≥ 60 and ≥ 90 % after 28 and 42 days, respectively. The half-life times of malathion were accounted by 24, 23, 25 and 25 days for Amaranth, Kidney bean, Lettuce and Watercress, respectively. For dimethoate, results of time course studies in soil degradation revealed that Amaranth and Kidney bean were the most effective plants in dimethoate degradation, whereas ≥ 90 % was degraded after 42 days. The half-life times of dimethoate were accounted by 28, 30, 25 and 30 days for Amaranth, Kidney bean, Lettuce and Watercress, respectively. In plant tissues, only ≤ 5 and ≤ 3 % of malathion and dimethoate still in plant tissue, respectively. These results suggest that phytoremediation ability of plants could accelerate the degradation of malathion and dimethoate residues in plant tissues.

This diploma thesis deals with a theme about Microbial Activity of Soil influenced by different measurements of crude oil hydrocarbon contamination and observing of microbial consorcia activity in contamined, not contamined and sterile soil. The initial chapter deals with crude oil contamination and bacterial metabolism which is able to remove this contamination. There was executed a container trial in the experimental part of this thesis. The plants were planted into different types of adjusted soil (crude oil application, sterilization and so on). There was compared a production of biomass and there are a few conclusion from these results. The elementary thing is that the soil micro-organisms which appear in oil soil can make a life strategy in this enviroment and can also prosper which reflects on the production of biomass. The container trial was determined as the most exact method of soil activity valuation because it is nearest to the real soil proportion.

40|$|The European rusted {{flea beetle}} Neocrepidodera ferruginea (Scopoli, 1763) is {{reported}} {{for the first time}} from Québec and Ontario, Canada. It was likely introduced into southern Ontario at an international port on the Great Lakes in early 1970 s, or possibly earlier in the 1960 s. However, the exact location and date of introduction could not be precisely determined. The flea beetle has since dispersed northeastwards and reached Aylmer, north of Ottawa River, in Québec, by 2003. This is about 375 [*]km from Niagara Falls, where the oldest known specimens were collected in 1977. In 2009, various wild habitats and cultivated areas of Aylmer were surveyed. The host plants of the larvae could not be determined, but adults were swept from many plant species including various weeds and cultivated grasses: Alopecurus pratense (meadow foxtail), Dactylis glomerata (orchard-grass), Festuca rubra (red fescue-grass), and Poa pratensis (Kentucky blue-grass).

The above ground biomass of erect emergent macrophytes, tules and cattails, (Scirpus spp., Typha spp.) ranged from 560 g to 3015 g of dry mass per square meter with the average nitrogen concentration of 0. 9 %. The creeping or soft emergent macrophytes such as water primrose, <b>water</b> <b>cress</b> and pennywort (Ludwigia peploides, Nasturtium aquaticum, Hydrocotyle verticillata, Sagittaria latifolia) usually reached significantly lower biomass (average of about 450 gm- 2) but the biomass was richer in nitrogen (3 %). Representatives of the second group were also characterized by significantly faster decomposition rates. Methods of propagation of plants from rhizome and stem cuttings were elaborated. A greenhouse experiment carried out to determine the dependence of growth characteristics on water level showed that Hydrocotyle verticillata seemed to be most sensitive to low water levels followed by Nasturtium aquaticum. Ludwigia peploides grew well at all five tested water levels. Both Hydrocotyle verticillata and Nasturtium aquaticum were more sensitive to high nitrogen concentrations than Ludwigia peploides. The mesocosm experiment studying the effect of four different water levels on the growth and biomass allocation in tall erect emergents (Scirpus californicus, S. acutus, Typha domingensis, Phragmites australis) and short emergents (Polygonum sp., Scirpus robustus, Sagitta ria latifolia and Ludwigia peplaides) showed that with the exception of Typha domingensis, Sagitta ria latifolia and Scirpus robustus, all other species allocated more biomass into belowground organs in the low water level treatment than in the high water treatment. Results of this experiment in combination with the observations from the field are crucial for proper species selection for various treatment purposes. Five species, Scirpus californicus, S. acutus, Typha domingensis, Sagitta ria latifoia and Ludwigia peploides, were grown in outdoor hydroponic cultures in a heavy metal experiment. Zinc, lead, cadmium and copper in the concentrations of 0. 1, 1 and 10 ppm of were added to the nutrient solution in the cultures. After two weeks of exposure to the heavy metals, plants were measured, harvested, biomass was sorted into roots, rhizomes, stems and leaves, dried and analyzed for concentrations of individual metals. There were no statistically significant differences in the growth expressed as the percentage increment of total length between the control and all concentrations of all metals. However, there were species and organ specific differences in the accumulation of individual metals. Most metals were accumulated in roots, specifically adventitious roots. Ludwigia peploides seemed to be the most efficient in the accumulation of all metals tested...|$|E
40|$|Scurvy was {{encountered}} oft en in {{the early}} modern era {{in connection with the}} absence of vitamin C on long sea journeys and in frequent wars. Even though the nature of the disease was not known, the effectiveness of foods and remedies rich in vitamin C became known through experience. Europe’s physicians nevertheless had only a vague idea of what scurvy was. Many other illnesses were thought to be scurvy due to the indefinite nature of its symptoms. Doctoral dissertations on scurvy were readily written and defended at European universities. As many as four physicians who later worked as doctors in the Baltic provinces did so as well {{in the latter half of}} the seventeenth century and the early eighteenth century: Benjamin Fischer and Conrad Rudolph Hertz who worked in Riga as military surgeons; Nicolaus Buchner, who was a doctor in Mitau (Jelgava), and Christian Ehrenfried Eschenbach, who worked for a time as a doctor in Tartu and later as a professor of medicine in Rostock. Of those dissertations, Nicolaus Buchner’s doctoral thesis drew upon his observations from his experience as a fi eld doctor with the German-Polish garrison in Dünamünde (Daugavgrīva) fortress, which was besieged by the Swedes during the Great Northern War in the latter half of 1701. His practical work as a doctor provided him with the opportunity to familiarize himself with all phases of the progress of scurvy. The causes of scurvy were generally thought to be the accumulation of salts resulting from the inhalation of salty sea air and the consumption of salted and smoked meat products, thus thickening the blood and leading to the afflictions of scurvy. Only Eschenbach’s position differed from the others. He maintained that the causes of this disease were more likely spoiled food and contaminated drinking water. The dissertations chiefly recommended agents promoting excretion, secretion and voiding (bloodletting, laxatives and medicines for inducing urination, perspiration and vomiting) as treatment for scurvy, as was usual at that time for the treatment of other illnesses as well, and medicines for cleansing the organism, some of which were toxic chemical preparations harmful to the organism. Yet among the recommended medicines were also some ten herbs that due to their content of vitamin C really did prove to be effective means for preventing and alleviating scurvy. Such herbs were scurvy grass (cochlearia), <b>water</b> <b>cress</b> (nasturtium), cress (lepidium), horseradish (raphanus rusticus), lemon juice (succus citri), pine shoots or fir shoots (summitates pinii vel abietis), garlic (allium) and onion (allium gepa). The authors of all four dissertations agreed on the positive effect of some of the substances listed above. Th is means that the practice in treating this disease that had evolved over generations was a step ahead of medical theories.
