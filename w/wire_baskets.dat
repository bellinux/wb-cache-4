Two examples of saddle point problems are considered: the mixed formulation of the linear elasticity system and the generalized Stokes system in three dimensions.

The unknowns interior to each element are first implicitly eliminated by using exact local solvers. The resulting saddle point Schur complement is solved with a Krylov space method with block preconditioners.

The relative condition number, provided by the DD preconditioner under consideration, is O((1 + p) ^ 3. 5) and its total arithmetic cost is O((1 + p) ^ 1. 75 [(1 + p) (1 +(1 + p)) p^ 3 R+ p R^ 2]), where R {{is the number of}} finite elements.
