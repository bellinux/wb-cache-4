500|$|One day, {{the protagonists}} {{seek out a}} dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> ought to do. The dervish {{responds}} by asking rhetorically why Pangloss {{is concerned about the}} existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them [...] "free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty." [...] Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set to work on this [...] "commendable plan" [...] (louable dessein) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him [...] "we must cultivate our garden" [...] (il faut cultiver notre jardin).|$|E
2500|$|As {{academics}} like Peter Leeson and Marcus Rediker argue, {{a pirate}} was {{more often than}} not someone from a previous seagoing occupation. They were merchant seamen, sailors in the royal navy, and privateers, all of whom would form into a pirate crew. They were not upper class, but the [...] "dregs of society." [...] George Choundas argues in his book Pirate Primer that there was in fact a pirate language, but it was simply accents and the way of speech to which men of the seas were accustomed. They came from different ethnic backgrounds or political units, so pirate speech was simply the way these men could communicate; and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>all</b> knew was the language of the seas. It was the nautical speech of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
