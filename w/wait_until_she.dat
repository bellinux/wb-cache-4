5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work {{needed to be done}} on the armament, but it had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E

After being together for a few months, David tried to get Donna to bed with him where she confesses and says she is a virgin and she will <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> gets married. David wants to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> is ready and their relationship continues. David also helps Donna when she discovers her mother's affair with another man.|$|E

25|$|Born Katherine Bayley Butler, she was {{the eldest}} of two daughters of James Bayley Butler and Katherine Butler (née McWeeney). Both {{she and her sister}} Beatrice {{attended}} Alexandra College, Dublin, and later the Ursuline convent, Waterford. Butler had decided to take up a religious vocation from age 17, but was persuaded to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> was 21 by her parents. She used this time to undertake a degree in science at University College Dublin.|$|E
25|$|Williams's {{parents wanted}} their {{daughter}} to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> was 16 {{to participate in}} professional tournaments. However, in 1995 just after turning 14, Williams planned to make her professional debut as a wild-card entry in the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, California, but was denied by the WTA due to age-eligibility restrictions of the organization. She subsequently filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's tour, but withdrew it {{at the behest of}} her parents. Her first professional event was in October 1995 at the Bell Challenge in Quebec, where she used a wild-card entry to circumvent age-eligibility rules. She lost {{in the first round of}} qualifying to then 18-year-old American Annie Miller, winning just two games.|$|E
25|$|In 1796, Dussek and {{his wife}} began having serious marital troubles. In an account of {{uncertain}} veracity, {{it was reported that}} Sophia, who {{had fallen in love with}} another man, asked Dussek for money to repair her harp. She then used the money to leave the house, removing her belongings in her harp case, and claiming to have left for dinner with a female friend. A suspicious Dussek went with his father-in-law to the man's house, where Sophia locked herself in. She and Dussek argued, and she cursed him, claiming to be pregnant by the other man. Dussek, relenting, promised her freedom to do what she wanted; this led to a reconciliation of sorts. It seems unlikely that Dussek ever saw Sophia and his daughter Olivia after he left London in 1799; Sophia had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> knew Dussek had died before she could remarry, which she did in 1812.|$|E

500|$|The Kakawin Ramayana says that, when Sita is {{tormented by}} her 300 rakshasi guards, only Trijata {{comes to her}} rescue and offers her solace, keeping her company and playing games with her. In the Seri Rama, Trijata (here called [...] "Dewi Srijati") {{is in charge of}} Sita's custody in Lanka. Sita tells Ravana that she will not even {{consider}} Ravana's marriage proposal while her husband is alive, and will believe he's dead only if she sees his head in Ravana's hands. To trick Sita, Ravana visits her with two heads and proclaims that they belong to Rama and Lakshmana, but Trijata stops him and asks him to return the next day. She presents the heads to Sita, who decides to commit suicide, but Trijata asks her to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> can verify the truth. Carrying Sita's dagger, she meets Rama and in return receives a girdle woven by Sita from Rama. She is carried back to Lanka by Hanuman. When Ravana arrives the next day, Trijana rebukes him for his deception and informs him that she had met Rama herself the previous day. An enraged Ravana tries to kill Trijata, who runs and seeks refuge in Sita, who takes all the blame. Trijata is recused of her duties and Sita is transferred to an iron castle, guarded by an army commanded by one of Ravana's ministers.|$|E
500|$|Carey Mulligan {{plays the}} narrator, Kathy, an introverted, observant {{character}} who projects both innocence and knowingness, and who {{over the course}} of the story develops from a passionate, optimistic child to a wise and accepting young woman. Prior to her casting, Mulligan had already read the novel a few times, considering it to be a favourite of hers. She recalled that from when she first read the book three years ago she had wanted to play Kathy. The young actress said that she could not [...] "bear the idea of anyone else" [...] portraying Kathy, although she acknowledged that she thought other people would be able to do a better performance. She was certain that someone would make a film adaptation of the novel and had hoped that they would <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> would be old enough to play the character. Romanek told The Los Angeles Times that he originally was having difficulty finding the right actress to play Kathy; a tight filming deadline loomed prior to Mulligan's casting. Peter Rice, the head of Fox Searchlight (the company financing the film) was watching An Education at the Sundance Film Festival in January. He wrote Romanek a four-word text message: [...] "Hire the genius Mulligan." [...] When later asked why the message was so abrupt, he explained that he was still in the middle of viewing the film. Rice exhibited what was described as a [...] "rare foresight" [...] in greenlighting a film with an almost unknown lead actress. [...] "He just knew that she was it", said Romanek.|$|E
500|$|The {{first season}} of Grey's {{received}} mostly positive reviews from the critics. In {{regard to the}} first season, New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a [...] "winner", whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating [...] "You simply can't stop watching." [...] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was [...] "so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: [...] "The show is much {{more a matter of}} commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode [...] "nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn", writing that overall: [...] "It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man." [...] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: [...] "When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead. That goes against conventional wisdom, which dictates that it's easier to get women to watch shows aimed at men." [...] Review Stream gave positive reviews regarding the pilot episode, [...] "A Hard Day's Night", due to the undeniable chemistry between Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey from the series' first scene. Regarding Miranda Bailey's appearance in the pilot, ReviewStream.com stated [...] "She's such a small woman but <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> speaks". HomeTheaterInfo.com, however, had a mixed perspectives on the pilot, noting that the storylines were similar to fellow ABC series Desperate Housewives, but also [...] "brilliantly written, extremely well acted and directed to near perfection". IGN gave a positive review stating, [...] "The show isn't derivative, and actually maintains a tenuous edge over its predecessor, the characters resemble real people - who are fragile, and yes, fallible." [...] and added, [...] "this facile description does little justice to the show's tightly-wound plotting, character subtleties, or masterful acting, it speaks to the intangible nature of what differentiates the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, in network television." ...|$|E

2500|$|Goody had {{a number}} of health scares during the 2000s. In 2002 (shortly before her Big Brother 3 appearance) a {{cervical}} smear test revealed abnormal cells, a possible indicator of cancer. She was tested for ovarian cancer in 2004 and bowel cancer in 2006, with negative results for each. Goody had hospital tests in early August 2008, after her fourth cancer scare; she had collapsed four times. On 19 August, while she was on the Indian reality show Bigg Boss, Goody was told that test results confirmed cervical cancer. According to her spokesperson, [...] "It looks like her cancer is at an early stage but we will have to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> gets back to Britain and sees a specialist and has more tests." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{opinions}} of Socrates {{in any given}} dialog not only often contradict conventional morality, they also contradict his own previous opinions. For example, in the Apology, Socrates praises [...] "the son of Thetis" [...] (Achilles) for making light of death {{because he was so}} obsessed with getting revenge on Hector for killing Patroclus. In this scene, Achilles does not go in to fight, but agrees to his mother's command that he <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> gets special battle gear made for him. Socrates invocation of Achilles as a model for his own fearlessness is misplaced because Achilles is a coward in the scene. [...] In the Republic Socrates has a different opinion of Achilles. [...] He calls him emotionally overwrought, and greedy (for taking bribes—which, according to Homer, he did not do). [...] Socrates famously argues that the Iliad needs to be rewritten.|$|E

2500|$|Swain {{was born}} on November 30, 1958 in Fullerton, California. She is the {{youngest}} of three children. Her mother, Joyce, bred Cardigan Welsh Corgis that have appeared in Hollywood films and television. In a 1989 interview, Swain said she {{was three years old}} when she asked for dance lessons, but had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> was five, when she did classical ballet. In 1969, she became the youngest member of the Dance Theater of Orange County, a local company that performed at benefit shows in Anaheim. She spent eleven years studying ballet, and also learned flamenco dancing. She performed at multiple Disneyland's Christmas Fantasy on Parade events. She studied at the Community Theatre of Performing Arts and the Wilshire Theatre of Arts. She also performed in costume as the [...] "Dutch Puppet", a name she used as a publishing alias during her early recording career. She went to Loara High School during her sophomore year, but then transferred to Anaheim High School. After graduating from high school in 1976, Swain joined the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, where she performed as a showgirl in her first year, and as an elephant rider in her second year. Her first singing project was a Los Angeles radio spot where she would introduce and announce programs while impersonating members of The Go-Go's.|$|E

60|$|Once more poor Mrs. Quack {{was quite}} {{overcome}} with her troubles and sorrows. Peter wished {{with all his}} heart {{that he could do}} something to comfort her, but of course he couldn't, so he just sat still and <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> could tell him just what did happen to Mr. Quack.|$|R
60|$|Having {{reached that}} conclusion--pregnant with coming assaults on the weakly-fortified {{discretion}} of poor Mrs. Wragge--the housekeeper cautiously abstained from exhibiting herself any longer under an inquisitive aspect.

6000|$|Soon after Festing {{started for}} British Columbia Sadie drove {{over to the}} farm; because she {{had heard about the}} fight in the poolroom and {{suspected}} why he had gone. At first she found it difficult to break down Helen's reserve, but the latter could not resist her frank sympathy, and softening by degrees, allowed herself to be led into confidential talk. Sadie <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> thought she understood the matter, and then remarked: ...|$|R

60|$|Foster felt embarrassed, but {{the sense}} of {{restraint}} was stronger. Alice had somehow imposed it and he must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> took it away. He thought {{she wanted him to}} finish.|$|E
6000|$|Victoria {{repeated}} the words over to herself, [...] "It must be {{of his own}} free will," [...] <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> should be alone to seek their full interpretation.

60|$|After {{hearing the}} door close, Emma lay {{for a few}} minutes listening, <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> felt sure Mrs. Harkey was well out of the yard, then she crept out of bed and crawled to the window.

60|$|Then {{she came}} towards {{the house and}} Helen felt half-annoyed and half-amused. Stephen {{did not like to}} be {{disturbed}} when he was busy, and she knew what he thought of Bob. Moreover, she wondered with some curiosity what Mrs. Charnock had to say to her. Sadie sat down and <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>she</b> recovered breath.|$|R
