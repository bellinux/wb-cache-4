Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill that were presented in the three-part documentary Unknown Chaplin (1983) – has since revealed his unique <b>working</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

25|$|To use gas for {{practical}} purposes {{it was first}} necessary to develop a <b>working</b> <b>method</b> for the production and capture of the gas. There is considerable doubt as to the date by which this process was perfected. However, numerous accounts exist that by 1794 Murdoch was producing coal gas from a small retort containing heated coals with a three or four-foot iron tube attached, through which he piped the gas before sending it through an old gun barrel and igniting it to produce light.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no other}} 17th-century artist who {{employed}} the exorbitantly expensive pigment lapis lazuli (natural ultramarine) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours umber and ochre should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed. This <b>working</b> <b>method</b> most probably was inspired by Vermeer’s understanding of Leonardo’s observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object. This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.|$|E

In the final report of this assessment (FNBE 2011) the answers sloyd teachers have provided reported briefly and in general way. With the results of the assessment, it is apparent that the sloyd teachers use learner-oriented <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> in general.

This is achieved through 14 semi-structured interviews with practicing auditors, where emphasis is put on interpretation. Conclusions drawn are that the effect on the auditors’ <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> are more prominent than on the tools, due to paperless <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> and increased flexibility. Unlike previous research, this study also discovers an increasing effect – education. Thereby, education is underlined as important among auditors, where institutions also have to develop available education to the new competence needed...|$|R
500|$|Describing his <b>working</b> <b>method</b> as [...] "sheer {{perseverance}} to {{the point}} of madness", Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture. Robinson writes that even in Chaplin's later years, his work continued [...] "to take precedence over everything and everyone else." [...] The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.|$|E

500|$|... "Happiness Is a Warm Gun" [...] evolved out of song {{fragments}} that Lennon {{wrote in}} Rishikesh. According to MacDonald, this <b>working</b> <b>method</b> {{was inspired by}} the Incredible String Band's songwriting. The basic backing track ran to 95 takes, due to the irregular time signatures and variations in style throughout the song. The final version consisted of the best half of two takes edited together. Lennon later described the song as one of his favourites, {{while the rest of the}} band found the recording rejuvenating, as it forced them to re-hone their skills as a group playing together to get it right. Apple's press officer Derek Taylor made an uncredited contribution to the song's lyrics.|$|E

40|$|Literature-related <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> of {{academics}} in biology. − Literature-related <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> are those methods that academics apply {{to find and}} utilize the literature relevant to their work. In this context, the present survey describes a model of literature-related <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> basically comprising the following phases: search for bibliographic references to literature ("literature searching"), management of bibliographic references, obtaining copies of relevant works ("literature obtaining"), and management of copies of the literature. In order to analyse literature-related <b>working</b> <b>methods,</b> primarily six empirical studies on scientists in biology and the life sciences respectively are made use of; moreover, several other studies are used. For literature searching, bibliographic databases, the World Wide Web, and informal communication {{prove to be the}} most important sources of information. For obtaining literature, the most important sources of supply are local library holdings and local licenses on the one hand, and resources freely available on the internet on the other hand. Regarding <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> of personal reference management and managment of copies of literature, considerable knowledge gaps have to be acknowledged. Only marginally, if at all, do most studies probe what is happening with references to literature and with literature itself on the academics' side. For many aspects of literature-related <b>working</b> <b>methods,</b> tendencies of change are becoming obvious in recent times, related to technological progress in general, as well as to subject-specific developments of scientific methodologies and data structures in biology. In the present survey, conclusions for two different spheres are drawn. User research in library and information science should aim at formulating working hypotheses more precisely, and at incorporating academics' literaturerelated <b>working</b> <b>methods</b> as a whole. On the libraries' part, there is not only the obvious necessity, but also the opportunity to focus more on the specific needs of biologists...|$|R
500|$|Yorke is Radiohead's {{principal}} songwriter and lyricist; songs usually {{begin with}} a sketch by Yorke, which is harmonically developed by Jonny Greenwood before the other members develop their own parts. Arrangement is a collaborative effort, with all the band members having roles in the process; all the band's songs are credited to [...] "Radiohead". While Jonny Greenwood plays most lead guitar parts, O'Brien makes use of effects units to create ambient effects. The Kid A and Amnesiac sessions brought a change in Radiohead's musical style and <b>working</b> <b>method.</b> Since their shift from conventional rock music instrumentation toward an emphasis on electronic sound, the members have gained flexibility and now regularly switch instruments depending on the particular song requirements. On Kid A and Amnesiac, Yorke played keyboard and bass, while Jonny Greenwood often played ondes Martenot, bassist Colin Greenwood worked on sampling, and O'Brien and Selway branched out to drum machines and digital manipulation, also finding ways to incorporate their primary instruments, guitar and percussion, respectively, into the new sound. The relaxed 2003 recording sessions for Hail to the Thief led to a different dynamic in Radiohead, with Yorke admitting in interviews that his power in the band had been [...] "absolutely unbalanced" [...] {{and that he would}} [...] "subvert everybody else's power at all costs. But... it's actually a lot more healthy now, democracy-wise, than it used to be." ...|$|E
500|$|Tasso, {{based on}} the life of sixteenth-century Italian poet, Torquato Tasso, {{is a perfect example of}} both Liszt's <b>working</b> <b>method</b> and his {{achievements}} based on restless experimentation. The 1849 version following a conventional overture layout, divided into a slow section ("Lament") and a fast one ("Triumph"). Even with this division, the entire work was actually a set of variations on a single melody—a folk hymn sung to Liszt by a gondolier in Venice in the late 1830s. Among the most significant revisions Liszt made was the addition of a middle section in the vein of a minuet. The theme of the minuet was, again, a variant of the gondolier's folk hymn, thus becoming another example of thematic transformation. Calmer than either of the outer sections, it was intended to depict Tasso's more stable years in the employment of the Este family in Ferrara. In a margin note, Liszt informs the conductor that the orchestra [...] "assumes a dual role" [...] in this section; strings play a self-contained piece {{based on the}} original version of the gondolier's hymn while woodwinds play another based on the variation used in the minuet. This was very much in the manner of Italian composer Pietro Raimondi, whose contrapuntal mastery was such that he had written three oratoriosJoseph, Potiphar and Jacobwhich could be performed either individually or together. Liszt made a study of Raimondi's work but the Italian composer died before Liszt could meet him personally. While the minuet section was probably added to act as a musical bridge between the opening lament and final triumphal sections, it along with other modifications [...] "rendered the 'Tasso Overture' an overture no longer". The piece became [...] "far too long and developed" [...] to be considered an overture and was redesignated a symphonic poem.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{the first}} time that Siouxsie worked with {{producers}} who also physically played on the record, which made a [...] "huge difference". Instead of recording the album in one block session, she commuted from France to Bath to the producers' studio. She made several trips from the end of 2006 to May 2007, concentrating on two or three tracks at the time. This <b>working</b> <b>method</b> provided a useful overview, as she stated: [...] "Sometimes when you're so involved in a project day in day out, you can lose sight of the goal or the object. It puts a different discipline to it". She used technology as a tool, listening to the recording process of the music from home. Siouxsie's only instruction to her two composers was [...] "to treat every song as a potential single".|$|E

Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking [...] songs as far as [...] could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] " [...] would do a mix of it and add production ideas and we would just kind of go back and forth like that. [...] is the wizard at computers, and the history that we have working with him we don't have with anybody else, so it made sense on the familiarity level and the ease of working level." [...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard <b>working</b> <b>method</b> in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|E
