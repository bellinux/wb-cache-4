Most vegetation has colonised naturally, with {{among others}} common reed, purple loosestrife, yellow iris, water-plantain, water figwort, soft rush, gypsywort, water starwort, curled pondweed, common duckweed, <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not,</b> water mint, brooklime.|$|E
25|$|Colliery pond {{was created}} when the National Coal Board {{constructed}} a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath {{the grass and}} acts as a dam. Water plants include <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not,</b> bogbean and purple loosestrife. Large numbers of creatures are attracted to the pond, such as toads, moorhens, smooth newts, swan mussels plus varieties of damselfly and dragonfly.|$|E

Then I {{asked her for}} a flower, and {{apparently}} much amused she presented me with a <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not,</b> then she sauntered on to a small cottage close by. Arrived there, she turned round and faced me, {{her hand on the}} gate, and after gazing steadily for some moments exclaimed, [...] "Delighted at going back to school--who ever heard such a thing?" [...] and, bursting into a peal of musical child-laughter, she went into the cottage.|$|E

50|$|Purwell Ninesprings is a 6.4 hectare {{nature reserve}} {{managed by the}} Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust in Hitchin in Hertfordshire. It has open water with water voles and birds such as moorhens, mallards and teals. Other birds include snip and siskins. The wet ground has plants such as tussock sedge, yellow iris and <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-nots.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Most European reed beds mainly {{comprise}} Phragmites australis {{but also}} include many other tall monocotyledons adapted to growing in wet conditions [...] - [...] other grasses such as reed sweet-grass (Glyceria maxima), Canary reed-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) and small-reed (Calamagrostis species), large sedges (species of Carex, Scirpus, Schoenoplectus, Cladium and related genera), yellow flag iris (Iris pseudacorus), reed-mace ("bulrush" [...] - [...] Typha species), water-plantains (Alisma species), and flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus). Many dicotyledons also occur, {{such as water}} mint (Mentha aquatica), gipsywort (Lycopus europaeus), skull-cap (Scutellaria species), touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), brooklime (Veronica beccabunga) and <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-nots</b> (Myosotis species).|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{to go back}} to its disadvantages, {{the village}} is waterless; at all events in summer, when water is most wanted. Water is such a blessing and joy in a village--a joy for ever when it flows {{throughout}} the year, as at Nether Stowey and Winsford and Bourton-on-the-Water, to mention but three of all those happy villages in the land which are known to most of us! What man on coming to such places and watching the rushing, sparkling, foaming torrent by day and listening to its splashing, gurgling sounds by night, does not resolve that he will live in no village that has not a perennial stream in it! This unblessed, high and dry village has nothing but the winter bourne which gives it its name; a sort of surname common to a score or two of villages in Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, and Hants. Here the bed of the stream lies by the bank {{on one side of the}} village street, and when the autumn and early winter rains have fallen abundantly, the hidden reservoirs within the chalk hills are filled to overflowing; then the water finds its way out and fills the dry old channel and sometimes turns the whole street into a rushing river, to the immense joy of the village children. They are like ducks, hatched and reared at some upland farm where there was not even a muddy pool to dibble in. For a season (the wet one) the village women have water at their own doors and can go out and dip pails in it as often as they want. When spring comes it is still flowing merrily, trying to make you believe that it is going to flow for ever; beautiful, green water-loving plants and grasses spring up and flourish along the roadside, and you may see comfrey and <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not</b> in flower. Pools, too, have been formed in some deep, hollow places; they are fringed with tall grasses, whitened over with bloom of water-crowfoot, and poa grass grows up from the bottom to spread its green tresses over the surface. Better still, by and by a couple of stray moorhens make their appearance in the pool--strange birds, coloured glossy olive-brown, slashed with white, with splendid scarlet and yellow beaks! If by some strange chance a shining blue kingfisher were to appear it could not create a greater excitement. So much attention do they receive that the poor strangers have no peace of their lives. It is a happy time for the children, and a good time for the busy housewife, who has all the water she wants for cooking and washing and cleaning--she may now dash as many pailfuls over her brick floors as she likes. Then the clear, swift current begins to diminish, and scarcely have you had time to notice the change than it is altogether gone! The women must go back to the well and let the bucket down, and laboriously turn and turn the handle of the windlass till it mounts to the top again. The pretty moist, green herbage, the graceful grasses, quickly wither away; dust and straws and rubbish from the road lie in the dry channel, and by and by it is filled with a summer growth of dock and loveless nettles which no child may touch with impunity.|$|E
5000|$|Myosotis scorpioides (syn. Myosotis palustris), the <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not</b> or true forget-me-not, is an {{herbaceous}} perennial {{flowering plant}} in the borage family, Boraginaceae.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the flora}} {{in the area}} are many species of wildflowers and grasses, {{including}} dog's tail, knapweed, red clover, great burnet, pignut, with such waterside plants as watercress and <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not.</b>|$|E
50|$|The pits are colonised by a rich flora. In the {{southern}} site grassland plants include southern marsh-orchid, bee orchid, common fleabane, field scabious and parasitic knapweed broomrape. Marshland plants include tufted <b>forget-me-not,</b> <b>water</b> mint, pink water-speedwell, common spike-rush, amphibious bistort and the rare greater tussock-sedge.|$|R
60|$|The {{flowers are}} quite {{different}} from those of the peaty marshes on the opposite side of the district, belonging to an alluvial soil, washed down from the chalk hills. The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning star. Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and comfrey of every shade of purple, the <b>water</b> avens and <b>forget-me-not,</b> also that loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms. Orchis latifolia is in plenty, and also Orchis incarnata, sometimes called the Romsey orchis. Of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches. Is it compensation for the Pinguicula vulgaris, which has been drained away, or the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating? Higher up the course of the river, Orchis conopsea, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact Orchis pyramidalis, and the rare Epipactis palustris are to be found, as well as Campanula Glomerata, and crow garlic, in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works.|$|R

50|$|The village pond in Loose was {{recently}} surveyed and contained {{a mixture of}} the following species: water mint, meadowsweet, common reed mace, water dropwort, bittersweet, yellow iris, branched bur-reed, greater tussock sedge, brooklime, water figwort, <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not,</b> great willowherb, and marsh marigold.|$|E
50|$|Aquartic plants {{supported}} are pondweed, flowering rush, <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not,</b> water-cress {{and water}} dock. There is white willow, crack willow and osier. In {{the area of}} rough grassland the nationally rare swamp meadow grass may be found. Woodland trees include alder and ash as well as willow.|$|E
50|$|Colliery pond {{was created}} when the National Coal Board {{constructed}} a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath {{the grass and}} acts as a dam.

Large numbers of creatures are attracted to the pond, such as toads, moorhens, smooth newts, swan mussels plus varieties of damselfly and dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|With its {{brackish}} water, the Edsviken {{offers a}} unique environment for its flora and fauna. Various coastal and wetland plants grow around the Edsviken, including <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not</b> - a rare plant in Sweden - Bolboschoenus maritimus and seaweed. The Eurasian oystercatcher and the barnacle goose both nest on the Edsviken, {{which also has}} {{a wide variety of}} fish species, including: perch, bream, pike, ruffe, zander and the occasional herring.|$|E
50|$|Mimulus michiganensis {{is found}} almost {{exclusively}} {{on the shores of}} the Great Lakes, or what were ancient shorelines. It grows on lakesides and stream banks in wet, saturated soils or in very shallow water. It requires cold, clear flowing water in full sunlight. The substrate is sand covered in muck. It also appears to require a narrow pH range that is slightly alkaline. The habitat is the edges of forests dominated by northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). Other plants in the area may include touch-me-not (Impatiens biflora), <b>water</b> <b>forget-me-not</b> (Myosotis scorpioides), watercress (Nasturtium officinale), wild mint (Mentha arvensis), and marsh marigold (Caltha palustris).|$|E
50|$|As {{well as some}} Trout and Salmon it has {{a healthy}} {{population}} of Sticklebacks, Minnows, Freshwater Shrimps, Freshwater Limpets, Caddisfly Larvae, Blackfly, Stonefly and Leeches, indicating that the water quality is good. Mallard and heron are frequently encountered and the occasional Great Crested Grebe can be seen. Eels are sometimes to be found on land, especially in wet weather, taking a shortcut {{across the top of}} the lengthy loops that are found in the river in the area.Marchantia polymorpha, the Common Liverwort grows on the bare bedrock dykes of the Annick near Cunninghamhead Mill, this plant being much rarer than the name suggests. Pellia epiphyla and Lunularia liverworts grow on the earth riverside banks at Cunninghamhead and elsewhere. The riverside vegetation includes Butterburr, Reed-Canary Grass, Rushes, <b>Water</b> <b>Forget-Me-Not,</b> Brooklime-Speedwell, Giant Hogweed, Hemlock Water-Dropwort, Willows and Alders.|$|E
