50|$|Vandwelling is a {{lifestyle}} of living full or part-time {{in a wide}} variety of vehicles, mainly <b>window</b> <b>vans</b> that have been modified with basic amenities like house batteries, a bed platform, some form of toilet, sink and storage space. Although the term can apply to living in other types of vehicles, it is mainly associated with vans because the word vandwelling is a portmanteau of the two words van and dwelling. Some vandwellers live this lifestyle by choice; seeking freedom, self-sufficiency and mobility without paying into conventional stationary housing. Vandwelling may be done using a Campervan, Recreational vehicle, Travel trailer, or a mobile home. However, SUVs and larger station wagons can also be lived in.|$|R

The Volkswagen van had made an impact on the marketplace, thus Dodge, Chevrolet and Ford responded with their own versions.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} indicates that stimulus-driven and goal-directed control of visual selection operate independently and in different time <b>windows</b> (<b>van</b> Zoest et al., 2004). The present study further investigates how eye movements are affected by stimulus-driven and goal-directed control. Observers were presented with search displays consisting of one target, multiple non-targets and one distractor element. The task of observers {{was to make a}} fast eye movement to a target immediately following the offset of a central fixation point, an event that either co-occurred with or soon followed the presentation of the search display. Distractor saliency and target-distractor similarity were independently manipulated. The results demonstrated that the effect of distractor saliency was transient and only present for the fastest eye movements, whereas the effect of target-distractor similarity was sustained and present in all but the fastest eye movements. The results support an independent timing account of visual selection. © VSP 2006...|$|R
50|$|Market share {{was almost}} 90% for the Diesel engine {{and a little}} more than 10% for the petrol engine. While the petrol engine was mainly used for ambulances, firetrucks, special vans for cold areas, {{commercial}} buyers preferred the Diesel engine for its lower fuel consumption and best reliability. In the UK, originally only diesel engines were on offer, but as the British market was 80 percent petrol at the time sales were less than scintillating. For 1982 petrol models were added, and sales immediately increased by 80 percent. The body styles were panel van, different versions of <b>window</b> <b>vans,</b> pickup and pickup with double cab.Already the power outputs for the 4-cylinder engines were very good, so the 307D was one of the fastest 3,5 ton (GVWR) Diesel-Vans in Europe of the late 1970s. Low gearing also meant that the vans were capable pullers, able to make best use of the power available whilst returning surprisingly good fuel economy for the large size and weight of vehicle.|$|R

5000|$|The 1st {{generation}} ChevyVan {{refers to}} the first Chevrolet G-Series vans G-10 [...] ton production years 1964 through 1966. General Motors saw a market for a compact van based on a modified passenger car platform {{to compete with the}} already successful Ford Econoline and Dodge A100. The 1964 ChevyVan had a cab forward design with the engine was placed in a [...] "doghouse" [...] between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a [...] "cab over" [...] vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the Chevy II, a more conventional compact car than Chevrolet Corvair. The forward engine design allowed a flat rear floor with low deck heights {{in the rear of the}} van for loading/unloading cargo. This model was also sold by GMC as Handi-Van. The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90 hp 153-cubic-inch straight-4 or Chevrolet Straight-6 engine. A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass. The first 1964 ChevyVan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes. Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory. In 1965, Chevy added Sportvan which featured windows actually integrated into the body. GMC marketed their <b>window</b> <b>van</b> as Handi-Bus. Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.|$|E

The [...] "S" [...] series, intended for private use, is largely similar but the larger, more comfortable rear seats are equipped with belts and are further {{to the rear of}} the vehicle with more leg room. While the seats still fold down, unlike the [...] "V", the [...] "S" [...] does not offer a flat loading floor. These characteristics are due to Japanese tax preferences for commercial vehicles, which only allow for temporary accommodation in the rear and demand a flat loading floor. The range received a very subtle facelift of a more rounded overall appearance for 1993, it included altered front and rear lights, bumpers, and a new bonnet and front seats. This version was available to Japanese customers from August 1992 and also incorporated some changes to the lineup, including the new RV-4 model with crossover pretensions. Turbocharged automatics now received a four-speed transmission.|$|R
