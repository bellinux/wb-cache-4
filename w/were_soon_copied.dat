50|$|In West Germany May's {{heritage}} {{was less}} problematic; both {{the books and}} the festivals <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> and reprinted. The Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg overtook its predecessor in Rathen, as the GDR officials discontinued the tradition there. The Federal Republic experienced some aspects of an idealized Indian image during the Protests of 1968 and the related generation and in the founding phase of Die Grünen and NGOs like Greenpeace, which have a strong influence in Germany. Cultural critics tended to depict Indians positively to criticize Western society while conflicts of and with actual Native Americans over issues such as fur hunting, slavery, forest fire triggering, non-sustainable practices such as buffalo jumps, seal clubbing and whaling were neglected. The positive image, however, also influenced the self-image of actual Indians.|$|E
5000|$|It was in late 1972 that Phase 2 {{first used}} {{an early version}} of the [...] "bubble letter" [...] or [...] "softie", a style of writing which would become {{extremely}} influential and is considered a [...] "giant leap" [...] in the art form. The puffed-out, marshmallow-like letters drawn by Phase 2 <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other artists who added their own variations. Phase himself quickly embellished on his original form, creating and naming dozens of varieties of softies such as [...] "phasemagorical phantastic" [...] (bubble letters with stars), [...] "bubble cloud", and [...] "bubble drip." [...] He is also credited with pioneering the use of arrows in graf writing around this same time. Hip-hop journalist Jeff Chang has noted that Phase 2's canvasses from 1973 have [...] "been widely recognized as defining the early genre." ...|$|E

50|$|His capital dwindling, Repton {{moved to}} a modest cottage at Hare Street near Romford in Essex. In 1788, aged 36 and with four {{children}} and no secure income, he hit {{on the idea of}} combining his sketching skills with his limited experience of laying out grounds at Sustead to become a 'landscape gardener' (a term he himself coined). Since the death of Capability Brown in 1783, no one figure dominated English garden design; Repton was ambitious to fill this gap and sent circulars round his contacts in the upper classes advertising his services. He was at first an avid defender of Brown's views, contrasted with those of Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price, but later adopted a moderate position. His first paid commission was Catton Park, to the north of Norwich, in 1788.That Repton, with no real experience of practical horticulture, became an overnight success, is a tribute to his undeniable talent, but also to the unique way he presented his work. To help clients visualise his designs, Repton produced 'Red Books' (so called for their binding) with explanatory text and watercolours with a system of overlays to show 'before' and 'after' views. In this he differed from Capability Brown, who worked almost exclusively with plans and rarely illustrated or wrote about his work. Repton's overlays <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by the Philadelphian Bernard M'Mahon in his 1806 American Gardener's Calendar.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} season of post-war league football, Burnley gained {{promotion}} through {{second place in the}} Second Division. Additionally, there was a run to the FA Cup Final, with Aston Villa, Coventry City, Luton Town, Middlesbrough and Liverpool being defeated before Charlton Athletic beat Burnley 1-0 after extra time in the final at Wembley. Burnley immediately made an impact the top division, finishing third in 1947-48 as the club began to assemble a team capable of regularly aiming for honours. Between 1954 and 1957, manager Alan Brown introduced short corners and a huge array of free kick routines, which <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> across the land. In the 1956-57 season, Ian Lawson scored on his debut as a 17-year-old a record four goals versus Chesterfield in the FA Cup. That same season saw a club record 9-0 victory over New Brighton in the FA Cup—despite missing a penalty—and the following season former player Harry Potts became manager. The team of the 1950s revolved around the midfield duo of Jimmy Adamson and Jimmy McIlroy (a new stand was named after the latter in the 1990s) and these two were key to the championship-winning team of 1959-1960 managed by Potts (who now gives his name to the road which Turf Moor occupies). After a tense season in which Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers were the other protagonists in the chase for the league title, Burnley clinched the championship at Maine Road, Manchester with a 2-1 victory on 2 May 1960 with goals from Brian Pilkington and Trevor Meredith. Although they had been in contention all season, Burnley had never led the table until this last match was played out.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue was}} counterstamped because a {{significant}} quantity of stamps {{was stolen from}} the San Salvador post office.

40|$|Italian printed drawing books (libri da disegnare) {{comprise}} {{an important}} {{body of evidence}} for our knowledge of artistic training in Italy during the early modern period. Libri da disegnare are groups of printed images that instruct in drawing the human body through a progression, whether by means of line-by-line instructions, following steps from outline to shaded, or building up the body from its individual features. Intended for both professional and amateur audiences, these printed sources <b>were</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> throughout Europe where they influenced drawing education for the next 400 years. ^ Tracing the relationship between writing and drawing {{in the literature of}} the early modern period, the first chapter explores the origins of the genre within other didactic manuals and within contemporary traditions of elementary education. Next, three case studies explore the ways in which text interacts with images within the genre: Odoardo Fialetti’s two etched drawing books (c. 1608), an unpublished manuscript by Francesco Cavazzoni from 1611, and Giuseppe Maria Mitelli’s books {{from the end of the}} century. The third chapter considers how these projects included or rejected information found in other types of printed books used by artists, such as treatises of anatomy, perspective, and proportion. Such study makes it clear that printed drawing books represent a new type of art literature. The final chapter problematizes the monolithic notion of the printed drawing book and suggests that they be discussed within separate categories: books, series, fragments, and copies. This dissertation highlights the diverse formats of Italian drawing books and serves to underscore the varied circumstances of their creation as opposed to the previously held belief that they stemmed more or less exclusively from practice in the Carracci academy. Exploring the origins and forms of the genre in Italy, its country of origin, this study provides a better understanding of artistic education in the decades after the formation of the first academies of art. ...|$|E
50|$|During {{that same}} time period, to support its own {{internal}} need for {{a large number of}} high quality, high resolution displays, Doremi built the first HDSDI to DVI converter, which allow users to have a low cost high definition monitoring system using computer displays. This innovative product <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> followed by a pattern generator.

5000|$|In the 1860s the showman P. T. Barnum {{exhibited}} women whom {{he claimed}} were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, big hair style, {{which had no}} precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other female performers in the United States, who became known as [...] "moss-haired girls". It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It {{may have been a}} reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.|$|R
5000|$|The first fern bar was the {{original}} T.G.I.

It opened March 15, 1965 and <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other restaurants in the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after its}} {{building}} {{the architecture of}} Marble Hill House became widely known from published engravings, and was widely admired for its compact plan and tightly controlled elevations.

WTCG, which had already been distributed via microwave to cable systems in much of the Southeastern United States, became the first national superstation; Turner's idea <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by companies who applied for satellite uplinks to distribute other independent stations, including WGN-TV (channel 9) in Chicago, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|The {{command format}} for sending {{graphics}} to the terminals was very simple, and <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> {{by a number}} of other terminal vendors. These later moved to traditional video terminals using raster scan displays, although these generally offered lower resolution, perhaps half that of the 4010. A number of these also understood the color codes from the Tektronix 4105 raster scan terminal, which added color to the original 4010 command set. This emulation continued to be used and copied by newer terminals to this day; NCSA Telnet and xterm emulates the 4014 (xterm -t).|$|R
5000|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy, and <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900.

50|$|Harris {{was born}} in New York on October 29, 1826. He was a {{professional}} merchant for ship equipment {{at the corner of}} South Street and Maiden Lane. At the first, he was working alone but later with his business partner named Nathan Gilette Pond, where they established the Harris & Pond company. The business premises had already opened by his father in 1805, and since working there they began to exported large quantities of butter to British Hong Kong. This export business was so successful that the trademark <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other exporters and stuck on its own goods.|$|R
50|$|NYSE Arca's {{liquidity}} fee/rebate structure {{resembles that}} of other electronic communication networks.

NYSE Arca charges traders that remove liquidity from the Arca-book $3.00 per 1,000 shares. Traders that add liquidity receive a $2.00 rebate per 1,000 shares. Traders that route orders out of the NYSE Arca system are charged $1.00 per 1,000 shares for Tape A securities and $4.00 per 1,000 shares for other securities.|$|R
50|$|The Governor {{decided that}} his fleet of four ships and three-hundred men was {{a match for}} the pirate ship and sloop so sailed towards them with his {{soldiers}} and arms concealed. As they neared the pirate sloop it raised its black flag, started to manoeuvre and <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by the pirate ship. When the Governor's fleet came within range he hoisted his colours and his men rushed upon the decks and gave the pirates a broadside who immediately tried to run. The pirate sloop was pummelled with broadsides {{and most of its}} men fled into the hold with the exception of Worley and a few others who died in the cross-fire upon deck.|$|R
5000|$|Although the Act {{ceased to}} have effect from 1660, the treason {{consisting}} of inviting foreigners to invade England or Ireland <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> in the Sedition Act 1661, {{which made it}} treason [...] "to move or stirr any Foreiner or Strangers with force to invade this Realme or any other His Majesties Dominions or Countreys being under His Majesties Obeysance." [...] Although no longer treason today, this remains an offence under the Treason Felony Act 1848, {{which makes it a}} crime punishable with life imprisonment [...] "to move or stir any foreigner or stranger with force to invade the United Kingdom or any other of her Majesty's dominions or countries under the obeisance of her Majesty." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{face was}} based on Porson's {{transcription}} of the Medea. Richard Austin was commissioned by the Cambridge University Press to cut it, from 1806 onwards. It was cast by Caslon foundry, but it never appeared in their specimens, as the type was peculiar to Cambridge. It was completed and used only after Porson's death in 1808, in the editions of plays of Euripides produced by Cambridge scholars. After its first appearance, it <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by other founders, and was released by Monotype with some corrections in 1912. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, it has become the predominant Greek type used in Britain, with Victor Scholderer's New Hellenic typeface (favored by Cambridge University Press) the only notable exception.|$|R
25|$|The {{solution}} was introduced with the BMW 801 14-cylinder twin-row radial. Kurt Tank designed a new cooling system for this engine that used a high-speed fan to blow compressed air into channels that carry {{air to the}} middle of the banks, where a series of baffles directed the air over all of the cylinders. This allowed the cowling to be tightly fitted around the engine, reducing drag, while still providing (after a number of experiments and modifications) enough cooling air to the rear. This basic concept <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by many other manufacturers, and many late-WWII aircraft returned to the radial design as newer and much larger designs began to be introduced. Examples include the Bristol Centaurus in the Hawker Sea Fury, and the Shvetsov ASh-82 in the Lavochkin La-7.|$|R
50|$|The North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) M Class was a {{class of}} 0-4-4T steam {{locomotive}} designed by John H. Adams, third son of William Adams. It was designed for suburban passenger work on the potteries loop lines. They shared components such as a drumhead smokebox which rested on the saddle and an almost identical boiler with the NSR L class. The boiler of the M class later became a standard boiler for the NSR, it being used on the NSR's New L class and H class. The M class introduced {{a new form of}} cab roof which curved around to join the cab sides, as with the Midland Railway at the time, and <b>was</b> <b>soon</b> <b>copied</b> by the SE&CR. 5 were built between 1907 and 1908 at the NSR's Stoke Works and withdrawals taking place between 1930 and 1939. None survived into preservation.|$|R
