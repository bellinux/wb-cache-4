5|$|Caregivers use {{language}} {{to help children}} become competent members of society and culture. From birth, infants receive pragmatic information. They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers. Actions and speech are organized in games, such as peekaboo to provide children with information about words and phrases. Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond. As children advance and participate more actively in interactions, caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly. Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours. They provide input about <b>what</b> <b>children</b> are expected to say, how to speak, when they should speak, {{and how they can}} stay on topic. Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour, using verbal reinforcement, posing a hypothetical situation, addressing children's comments, or evaluating another person.|$|E

It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected <b>what</b> <b>children</b> believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, {{it is very difficult to}} know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending.|$|E

500|$|Morrow {{reported}} that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as [...] "appeasement gestures". According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television [...] "made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate <b>what</b> <b>children</b> learned from them. By the mid-1970s, commercial television abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming. Other critics hoped that Sesame Street, with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers. It {{was not until the}} mid-1990s when a children's television educational program, Blue's Clues, used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content. The creators of Blue's Clues were influenced by Sesame Street, but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, [...] "We wanted to learn from Sesame Street and take it one step further".|$|E

Before the pond that is there now, {{it was only the}} river, which is <b>what</b> <b>children</b> swam in. Every summer, Mr. Graydon would dam up the river and it would flood and create a deeper place to swim. People would picnic by the water and hold events there. Graydon remains one of the jewels of Ridgewood, treasured by residents young and old.|$|E
2500|$|The nativist theory, {{proposed}} by Noam Chomsky, argues that {{language is a}} unique human accomplishment, and {{can be attributed to}} either [...] "millions of years of evolution" [...] or to [...] "principles of neural organization that may be even more deeply grounded in physical law". Chomsky says that all children have what is called an innate language acquisition device (LAD). Theoretically, the LAD is an area of the brain that has a set of universal syntactic rules for all languages. This device provides children with the ability to make sense of knowledge and construct novel sentences with minimal external input and little experience. Chomsky's claim is based upon the view that <b>what</b> <b>children</b> hear—their linguistic input—is insufficient to explain how they come to learn language. [...] He argues that linguistic input from the environment is limited and full of errors. Therefore, nativists assume that it is impossible for children to learn linguistic information solely from their environment. However, because children possess this LAD, they are in fact, able to learn language despite incomplete information from their environment. Their capacity to learn language is also attributed to the theory of universal grammar (UG), which posits that a certain set of structural rules are innate to humans, independent of sensory experience. This view has dominated linguistic theory for over fifty years and remains highly influential, as witnessed by the number of articles in journals and books.|$|E
