5|$|Liubartas (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' {{youngest}} son. In {{the early}} 1320s {{he married a}} daughter of Andrew of Galicia and ruled Lutsk in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother Lev of Galicia's deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a <b>war</b> <b>with</b> Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia. <b>War</b> <b>with</b> Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The Galicia–Volhynia Wars were settled after 1370, when Poland received Galicia, while Lithuania retained Volhynia. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.|$|E
