When Del Rey first played [...] "West Coast" [...] to her record label, Interscope Records, they were dissatisfied with its chorus being slower in {{beats per minute}} than its verses. They responded to the her, stating, [...] "None of these songs are good for radio and now you're slowing them down <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> speeded up". In an interview with The Guardian, Del Rey explained that she felt [...] "murky" [...] with her life during the song's writing, {{and it was that}} feeling which influenced it to sound disconnected from mainstream pop.|$|E
500|$|On {{expanding}} {{the characters in}} the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outside of Avengers films, Feige stated, it's about [...] "teaching the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. Just like comic readers have been doing for decades and decades ... people sort of are accepting that there's just a time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> together and there's a time when they're not." [...] In April 2014, Feige revealed that Edgar Wright's pitch for Ant-Man in 2006 helped shape the early films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "We changed, frankly, some of the MCU to accommodate this version of Ant-Man. Knowing {{what we wanted to do}} with Edgar and with Ant-Man, going years and years back, helped to dictate what we did with the roster for Avengers the first time. It was a bit of both in terms of his idea for the Ant-Man story influencing the birth of the MCU in the early films leading up to Avengers." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He summed it up by saying [...] "What a dreadful episode. While it's important in the grand scheme of things in what it establishes about Data's background, the episode itself is horrendously bad, from the clumsy script to the embarrassingly inept body-double work." [...] He thought the ending was anticlimactic, and that the characters all acted [...] "as dumb as posts" [...] in the episode. The most positive thing he said of the episode was that [...] "Spiner's teeth marks are all over the scenery when he's onscreen as Lore". DeCandido gave [...] "Datalore" [...] a score of four out of ten. Cast member Wil Wheaton watched the episode for AOL TV in December 2007. While he credited the art direction of the episode, he criticised the story, saying that [...] "it comes down to lazy writing that has things happen because they're supposed to happen, rather than having them happen organically. The characters are credulous <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> skeptical, the audience isn't surprised by anything after the second act, and there are story problems that should have never gotten past the first draft." [...] He remembered really enjoying the episode as a child, but felt that it didn't hold up on repeat watchings as an adult, and stated that Spiner's [...] "fantastic job creating distinctly different characters in Data and Lore" [...] wasn't enough to remedy the other faults in the episode. He gave it a D grade.|$|E
500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important that I believe, if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story." ...|$|E

At a traditional university, it is important to study [...] "why" [...] a method is scientifically right; however, this is less important at Universities of Applied Sciences.
