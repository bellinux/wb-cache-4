In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the Velvet Revolution that ended 41 years of Communist rule.|$|E

500|$|From {{early in}} his England career, D'Oliveira and his {{supporters}} saw the MCC tour of South Africa in 1968–69 as potentially being a key moment in his career. Guy Fraser-Sampson suggests: [...] "Nobody could be in any doubt {{that the possibility of}} D'Oliveira being chosen {{as a member of the}} England touring party would raise massive political complications". When D'Oliveira visited South Africa to work as a [...] coach in 1966, the subject was raised continually. People speculated whether D'Oliveira would be selected and, if so, whether the South African government would allow him to play. Some of his supporters worried that his acceptance of a place on a tour to South Africa might be interpreted as approval of the political situation there, but D'Oliveira was determined to play, aware of what it would mean to the non-white people of South Africa. In 1967, Griffith flew to South Africa to discuss the forthcoming tour and to seek a solution to any potential problems—the MCC wanted the tour to go ahead without any political trouble. Little came of the meetings; Oborne suggests that both sides simply [...] "agreed to hope that the <b>whole</b> <b>issue</b> went away".|$|E

[...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps gave a mixed review of the video, calling the song [...] "over-the-top" [...] with a [...] "lackluster" [...] and [...] "understated" [...] video. Doses Leah Collins was more neutral in her review, questioning if Gaga was simply [...] "swooning with nostalgia for other pop culture nuggets that have featured the same NYC backdrop of fire escapes and brown-stone steps" [...] or just attempting to [...] "be saving a metric buttload on the budget". While reviewing the video for The Vancouver Sun, Collins compared Gaga's look in the video to a [...] "hooker" [...] from the 1982 American science fiction film, Blade Runner.|$|E

Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive [...] "the <b>whole</b> <b>issue</b> with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for." [...] However, King stressed the theory was [...] "one possibility out of a hundred". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident.

[...] It {{had nothing to do with}} the 'South Park' controversy. It was not an attack targeting Viacom."
