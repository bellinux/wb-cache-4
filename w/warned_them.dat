5|$|Nuaym {{then came}} up with an {{efficient}} stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> about the intentions {{of the rest of the}} Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured.|$|E
5|$|At his trial, Bonnet downplayed his own {{authority}} over his pirate crew. He {{told the court}} that his crew engaged in piracy against his will, {{and said he had}} <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> that he would leave the crew unless they stopped robbing vessels. He further stated that he had been asleep during the capture of the sloop Francis. The court did not accept these protestations. Boatswain Ignatius Pell testified that Bonnet's quartermaster, Robert Tucker, had more power than Bonnet. A powerful quartermaster {{appears to have been a}} common feature of pirate crews in the early modern era.|$|E
5|$|Finding {{themselves}} {{surrounded by}} the Viet Minh, the French at Sop-Nao stood for six days while in radio contact with Teullier at the main strong point. The survivors, following authorisation from the French captain, retreated during the night of April 9/10 along a round-about route following the assumption by Grézy that the Viet Minh had laid ambushes along the most direct path. The French hacked a new path through the jungle until they reached Laotian tribesmen on April 11, who <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> of Viet Minh units following them. The French attempted to turn for Phong-Saly {{to the north and}} met an allied convoy travelling down the Nam Hou in canoes. The two forces combined and sailed down the river towards Muong Khoua.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had never meant anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E
5|$|The 'congress' {{met again}} {{in the spring of}} 480BC. A Thessalian {{delegation}} suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance. A force of 10,000 hoplites was dispatched under the command of the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles to the Vale of Tempe, which they believed the Persian army would have to pass through. However, once there, Alexander I of Macedon <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> that the vale could be bypassed by several other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large, and the Greeks retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass {{the women on}} the train, but the guerrillas robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E

5|$|At 06:00 on 26 April 1797, the 74-gun ship of {{the line}} HMS Irresistible under Captain George Martin and the 36-gun frigate HMS Emerald under Captain Velterers Cornewall Berkeley were sailing at the {{southern}} edge of Jervis' (now known as Earl St. Vincent) fleet. While cruising close to the Spanish coast two unknown ships were sighted. Martin immediately ordered his ships to give chase and the strangers fled with Martin's vessels in pursuit. The new arrivals were two Spanish 34-gun frigates, the Santa Elena and Ninfa, bound to Cádiz from Havana with a cargo of silver specie. The captains of these Spanish ships had unwittingly sailed into the midst of the blockade fleet the previous night, but had had a fortunate encounter with a Spanish fishing vessel which had <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> of the danger. Acting quickly, the captains off-loaded their treasure into the fishing boat with instructions to carry it safely into Cádiz.|$|E
5|$|Raj Thackeray and SP leader Abu Asim Azmi were booked under Indian Penal Code {{sections}} 153 (wantonly giving provocation {{with intent}} to cause riot), 153 A (promoting enmity between groups {{on the basis of}} place of birth, residence, etc.) and 153 B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) on 11 February. The police also applied section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to both politicians and <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> not to hold any press conferences or rallies in the next seven days. On 13 February, however, police arrested both the leaders. Later that day, a local court granted Raj conditional bail and ordered him not to make any speeches that would inflame public tension. He obtained a release after furnishing a personal bond of Rs.15,000. Azmi was arrested and taken to the Bhoiwada court in South Central Mumbai and was released on surety of Rs.10,000.|$|E
5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who <b>warned</b> <b>them.</b> Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E

5|$|Vlad Ţepeş's only ally, Mihály Szilágyi, was {{captured}} in 1460 by the Turks while traversing Bulgaria. Szilágyi's men were tortured to death, while Szilágyi was killed by being sawed in half. Later that year, Mehmed sent envoys to Vlad to urge him to pay the delayed Jizya (tax on non-Muslims). Vlad Ţepeş provoked Mehmed by having the envoys killed and in a letter dated September 10, 1460, addressed to the Transylvanian Saxons of Kronstadt (today: Braşov), he <b>warned</b> <b>them</b> of Mehmed's invasion plans and asked for their support. Vlad Ţepeş had not paid the annual Jizya (tax on non-Muslims) of 10,000 ducats since 1459. In addition to this, Mehmed asked him for 1000 boys that were to be trained as janissaries. Vlad Ţepeş refused the demand, and the Turks crossed the Danube and started {{to do their own}} recruiting, to which Vlad reacted by capturing the Turks and impaling them. The conflict continued until 1461, when Mehmed asked the Prince to come to Constantinople and negotiate with him.|$|E
