5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access <b>when</b> <b>things</b> went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the struggles of the American working class and politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray {{the idea that there is}} hope even <b>when</b> <b>things</b> appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E

5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know <b>when</b> <b>things</b> are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and <b>when</b> <b>things</b> become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is <b>when</b> <b>things</b> became more abstract.|$|E

5|$|Tom later {{pulled a}} series of stunts {{in order to get}} the pair back together, in the end a stint that ended up seeing Tom in {{hospital}} managed to get them to see the error of their ways. Happily reunited, Max and Steph go to tell Frankie that the wedding's back on. Frankie's elated but warns Steph that Max shouldn't let Cindy come between them. Max is reluctant to choose sides but <b>when</b> <b>things</b> come to the boil between the two, his loyalty is tested. Fed up, Max tells Cindy that unless she will accept his decision to marry Steph than she and Holly can no longer stay with them.|$|E

Also, like Dungy, they remain calm <b>when</b> <b>things</b> go badly. They guide instead of goad, and Lovie Smith found that perhaps the most instructive thing of all.|$|E

It was bred to think and act independently and make decisions on its own.|$|E
25|$|He did {{not join}} the Brahmo Samaj then but {{inspired}} the youth of Krishnanagar along the path of modernity. Some of his students later emerged as leaders of the new movement.

25|$|After {{high school}} White became a {{bookkeeper}} {{at the firm}} where his father worked. He was a diligent worker, but his job gave him little opportunity to pursue his artistic interests. He wrote that he reported to work at 7 am {{six days a week}} and left at 6 in the evening, sometimes working on Sundays <b>when</b> <b>things</b> were really busy. His maternal uncle Ira Billman, who was a published poet, encouraged White to continue developing his creative skills, and by 1890 White was producing sketchbooks filled with pencil sketches, pen-and-ink drawings and watercolors.|$|E
25|$|It took Alexander {{three days}} to get {{everything}} ready for the general assault {{that was about to}} take place against the city. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> were finally ready, Alexander divided his force into three parts. The first part of the force he ordered to attack the palisades that were around the city itself. The second part formed a line of battle and faced the Theban infantry. The third part was a reserve, tasked with plugging up any holes and to press up any advantages that the Macedonians gained {{in the course of the}} siege.|$|E

25|$|The three Scandinavian kingdoms {{joined in}} 1387 in the Kalmar Union under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. Sweden left the union in 1523 under King Gustav Vasa. In the {{aftermath}} of Sweden's secession from the Kalmar Union, civil war broke out in Denmark and Norway. The Protestant Reformation followed. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> had settled, the Norwegian Privy Council was abolished—it assembled {{for the last time}} in 1537. A personal union, entered into by the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway in 1536, lasted until 1814. Three sovereign successor states have subsequently emerged from this unequal union: Denmark, Norway and Iceland.|$|E
25|$|Alice Mitchell, née Johnson — Dennis' stay-at-home mother Alice {{is usually}} the reassuring figure Dennis can run to <b>when</b> <b>things</b> get too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. Although she grew up among animals on a chicken ranch, a running gag is that Alice Mitchell has a phobia of snakes. Another running gag {{involves}} Dennis's ever-changing parade of new babysitters: no one will take the job twice. Alice is also known for punishing Dennis's misbehavior by having him sit in the corner {{in a rocking chair}} for timeout, although a couple of times she has instituted tougher disciplinary measures such as spanking, where afterward Dennis is shown crying or grumbling about the adversity.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) {{wanted his}} team {{out of the}} Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> did not {{progress}} quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to move them to Northern Virginia. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish. Houston voters responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros stayed put.|$|E
