5|$|In 1988, Guy Caron {{left the}} company due to artistic {{differences}} {{over what to do}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> generated by Cirque du Soleil's first financially successful tour.

5|$|She {{suffered}} another serious financial setback in 1835 {{when she}} {{lost most of}} her life savings, about £300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> but Shelley Emling writes that {{it is not clear whether}} the man ran off <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.|$|E
5|$|Steinbeck {{was right}} about the lack of popular appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to pay back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E
5|$|A Thousand Leaves is the 10th studio album by the American {{experimental}} {{rock band}} Sonic Youth. It {{was released on}} May 12, 1998, by DGC Records.

Since the band had an unlimited {{amount of time to}} work in their studio, the album features numerous lengthy and improvisational tracks that were developed unevenly. Three highly experimental extended plays, , , and , were recorded simultaneously with the album.|$|E

5|$|In 1970 Zappa met {{conductor}} Zubin Mehta. They {{arranged a}} May 1970 concert where Mehta conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic augmented by a rock band. According to Zappa, {{the music was}} mostly written in motel rooms while on tour with the Mothers of Invention. Some of it was later featured in the movie 200 Motels. Although the concert was a success, Zappa's experience working with a symphony orchestra was not a happy one. His dissatisfaction became a recurring theme throughout his career; he often felt {{that the quality of}} performance of his material delivered by orchestras was not commensurate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he spent on orchestral concerts and recordings.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E

5|$|Many of Coffin's {{theories}} and principles {{can be seen}} in practice in her most famous creation, Harry and Ruth du Pont's gardens at their Winterthur estate. Her work on the gardens began in 1929 and became the biggest commission of her career. It was very fortuitously timed for her, as the Wall Street Crash of 1929 wiped out the fortunes of many of her clients and brought to an end the era of commissioning elaborate gardens for large country estates. Coffin had somewhat better luck with her investments and the enormous fortune of the du Ponts insulated the family from the worst of the Great Depression, permitting work on Winterthur to continue throughout the downturn. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from her investments and the fees from the du Ponts for the Winterthur commission, Coffin was able to maintain two homes, a maid and a chauffeur despite the general economic decline.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because the house had not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E
