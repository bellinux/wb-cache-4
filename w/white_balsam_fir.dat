5000|$|The Schroeder Lumber Company Bunkhouse is {{the last}} {{remaining}} structure of a logging camp in Schroeder, Minnesota, United States, on the North Shore of Lake Superior. The Schroeder Lumber Company from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, established a camp there in 1895, on the Cross River. The loggers had plenty of <b>white</b> pine, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> and spruce trees to cut. Loggers also dynamited the top 20 ft of the Cross River waterfall to widen the river and built a series of dams to hold water in reserve. This enabled the loggers to move the logs down the river and into Lake Superior, where they were collected into a [...] "holding boom" [...] that kept the logs from floating away. The camp operated until 1905, when crews left to log the Apostle Islands.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} {{lies within}} a densely forested region {{located at the}} head of the St. Charles River. Nourishing a boreal ecosystem, extensive forests of black spruce, <b>white</b> spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> cover much of the landscape. This ecosystem provides a healthy habitat for the populations of moose, wolves, bear, ptarmigan, rabbit and lynx that inhabit the area. The St. Charles River strategically opens into the mouth of Cape St. Charles and the Great Caribou Islands. Large populations of Atlantic salmon annually migrate the St. Charles River to reach native breeding grounds. The surrounding bay is also home to a variety of fish species including trout, freshwater smelts and shellfish.|$|R
2500|$|The park bears three {{distinct}} upland forest types. [...] Pine forest grows on level areas, ridgetops, and lakeshores.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to obtain the {{kinetics}} parameters of combustion for forest residue from white spruce, <b>white</b> pine and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> needles under inert atmosphere. The biomass material particle size of 150 μm prepared from each of these species was subjected to the combustion process at five different heating rates: 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 °C min - 1. TGA was used to analyse the data of the weight degradation over the increase in temperature up to 800 °C. The experimental data was then used to develop a reaction kinetic model to obtain the activation energy, E. The proximate and ultimate analysis of the species was carried out. The conversion degree α occurred at different temperature range when different heating rates were applied. The activation energy related to the combustion of white spruce needles was the highest (262. 4 kJ mol - 1) compared to white pine (197. 14 kJ mol - 1) and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> needles (139. 94 kJ mol - 1) ...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{commonly}} grown species include Eastern White pine, Virginia pine, Scotch pine, Colorado Blue spruce, Norway spruce, Serbian spruce, <b>White</b> spruce, <b>Balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> Grand fir, Frasier fir, Canaan fir, Noble fir, Turkish fir, White fir, Blue Ice Carolina and Sapphire cypress (both are sterile hybrids of the Arizona cypress), Leyland cypress, Eastern Red cedar, and Douglas fir. These trees have become popular {{because of their}} appearance, color, aroma, texture, {{or a combination of}} these properties. The Norway spruce, Serbian spruce, Scotch pine, and Turkish fir are not native to the United States. [...] However, genetic variations within these species have allowed some varieties to be grown in climates that differ substantially from the climate where the species originated. The Eastern White pine is native to the eastern U.S. The Colorado Blue Spruce is native Colorado and Utah. The White spruce is native to the north-central U.S. and Canada. The Noble, Douglas, and Grand firs are both native to the northwest of the U.S. The <b>Balsam</b> <b>fir</b> is native to the northeastern U.S. [...] The Canaan fir is native to the Canaan Valley of West Virginia. The White fir is native to California and the Southwestern mountains of the U.S. [...] From these varied trees, Christmas tree nurseries must select varieties to propagate based on the climate of their region and the type of farms that they will be selling to.|$|R
50|$|Rice Creek is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area that {{features}} a large, high-quality wetland complex of conifer swamps, fens, and sedge meadows along a two-mile stretch of Rice Creek. The creek contains dense, lush beds of emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation, including wild rice. <b>White</b> cedar, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> black spruce, and tamarack are the dominant trees in the conifer swamp. Several stands of old-growth hemlock/hardwood forest {{can be found in}} the site, each with a supercanopy of large white pine. Two fens, fed by groundwater seepages and of exceptional floristic diversity, are found near the creek. Overall, the site supports a high concentration of rare plants and animals. At least seven species of orchid are found here: showy lady slipper, heart-leaf twayblade, swamp pink, striped coralroot, blunt-leaf orchid, northern bog orchid, and boreal bog orchid (Platanthera dilatata). Other notable plant species include: bog arrowgrass, naked miterwort, marsh cinquefoil, purple clematis, and downy willowherb (Epilobium strictum). Notable animal species present include: barred owl, gray jay, pine siskin, winter wren, and bog copper.|$|R
5000|$|Most trees {{native to}} the Canadian boreal are conifers, with needle leaves and cones. These include: black spruce, <b>white</b> spruce, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> larch (tamarack), {{lodgepole}} pine, and jack pine. A few are broad-leaved species: trembling and large-toothed aspen, cottonwood and <b>white</b> birch, and <b>balsam</b> poplar. There are large areas of black spruce, a species which is tolerant of shallow soil, permafrost and waterlogged substrates, although as a consequence they have relatively low biological productivity.Owing to the short growing season, generally infertile soils, generally shallow soils, and frequent waterlogging, most of these forest types are slow-growing species, which generally tend to predominate in stressed habitats. [...] Similarly, many of the understory shrubs are in the Ericaceae, a family known to tolerate acid, infertile and flooded habitats: examples include Labrador tea, sheep-laurel and blueberry. Since nutrient levels are so low, overall, the productivity of forest trees is highly dependent on {{the rate at which}} mineral elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus are recycled by litterfall and decomposition. After logging, the loss of nutrients may convert forested areas into shrub barrens dominated by shrubs such as sheep-laurel. Many of the plant species are fire-dependent, since fire removes neighbouring plants, and recycles nutrients locked in organic matter.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship of}} stem diameter to tree, site and stand characteristics for six major tree species (trembling aspen, <b>white</b> birch, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> lodgepole pine, black spruce, and white spruce) in Alberta (Canada) with data from Alberta Sustainable Resource Development Permanent Sample Plots. Using non-linear mixed effects modeling techniques, we developed models to estimate diameter at breast height using height, crown and stand attributes. Mixed effects models (with plot as subject) using height, crown area, and basal area of the larger trees explained on average 95 % {{of the variation in}} diameter at breast height across the six species with a root mean square error of 2. 0 cm (13. 4 % of mean diameter). Fixed effects models (without plot as subject) including the Natural Sub-Region (NSR) information explained on average 90 % of the variation in diameter at breast height across the six species with a root mean square error equal to 2. 8 cm (17. 9 % of mean diameter). Selected climate variables provided similar results to models with NSR information. The inclusion of nutrient regime and moisture regime did not significantly improve the predictive ability of these models...|$|R
40|$|Wood {{degradation}} and defects, such as voids and knots, affect {{the quality and}} processing time of lumber. The ability to detect internal defects in the log can save mills time and processing costs. In this study, we investigated three nonde-structive evaluation techniques for detecting internal wood defects. Sound wave transmission, x-ray computed tomogra-phy, and impulse radar were used to examine <b>white</b> spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> logs. Computed tomography resulted in the highest resolution for voids, knots, and high moisture con-tent areas, but {{at a very high}} price. Both sound wave trans-mission and impulse radar were able to detect large voids and areas of degradation, and these techniques showed some sensi-tivity to very knotty logs. None of the methods was able to detect small pockets of decay. The use of radar requires an experienced operator because of the difficulty of interpreting the data...|$|R
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of inundative releases of Trichogramma minutum Ril. for biological control of Choristoneura fumiferana was investigated by Smith et al. (1986) in the Canadian boreal forest in 1982-83. The time of release, parasite density, and local weather {{were the most}} significant factors affecting the level of egg parasitism. The food supply of adult female parasites, vertical location of the host egg-mass in the stand, intensity of solar radiation and density of the host were less important. Parasitism of eggs was similar on <b>white</b> spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir.</b> Parasites reared at different temperatures and on different host eggs differed in biological characteristics, with undetermined effects {{on the success of}} field releases. Geographical strains of Trichogramma minutum were not considered as important as rearing conditions in subsequent releases because of the high degree of individual variation within each strain.|$|R
25|$|The forested, or {{woodlands}} area {{is dominated}} by trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), other poplars and spruces, although other species of trees do occur. Pines, mostly jack pine and lodgepole pine will often grow in areas that have sandy soil conditions. Other native species may include box elder, tamarack and willow, while the foothills area in the southeast of the region, such as Turtle Mountain or Spruce Woods Provincial Park, have woodland of <b>white</b> spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> but quaking aspen will domninate where the woodland has been cleared by fire. The proportion of forests to grasslands has increased somewhat over the prairie in areas not affected by agriculture in the last 100 years. This increase {{is partly due to}} the reduction of prairie fires which used to destroy the new saplings on the fringes of the aspen groves. Also, it was a common practice for farmers to plant stands of trees as windbreaks.|$|R
40|$|Compositional {{nutrient}} {{diagnosis was}} used to evaluate the nutritional status of trees located in the Abitibi region of Quebec {{in order to determine the}} effects of species (<b>white</b> birch, conifer (<b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> and <b>white</b> spruce), stand are (31, 51, 72, and 125 years) and parent material (lacustrine clay and glacial till) on foliar nutrient concentrations. Significant differences were found in foliar nutrient concentrations between the three species growing on similarly classified sites. The age of the stand significantly influenced the foliar nutrients of trees, illustrated by the significant decrease in foliar nitrogen concentration on clay and till and phosphorus concentrations on clay with stand age irrespective of species. Foliar nutrient concentrations varied significantly between parent materials. Trees of all species growing on clay stands exhibited deficiencies in nitrogen and conifers also exhibited severe deficiencies in magnesium. On till, deficiencies of potassium for birch, magnesium for conifer, and phosphorus for poplar were observed...|$|R
50|$|The forest {{immediately}} {{surrounding the}} lake was last burned over in the mid 1800s, and so is now well over 100 years old and approaching climax. <b>White</b> spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> are now the dominant tree species {{on the shores of}} the lake. The lakeshore population of paper birch and trembling aspen is in decline, and deciduous trees are now fairly inconspicuous except in isolated pockets. This is a fairly recent development, as the deciduous trees that sprouted after the fires only started dying off in numbers in the 1980s. Before this time, the lake shore forest was dominated by deciduous trees. Therefore, for much of the 20th century, Spruce Island (which had escaped the fires) had a conspicuous evergreen forest in contrast to the younger deciduous forest of the surrounding shore, and thus the island received its name. However, the aging of the lakeshore forest means Spruce Island's forest is no longer visually distinctive.|$|R

5000|$|The town lies neatly {{within a}} {{sheltered}} harbour {{at the mouth}} of St. Lewis Bay. Like most of the landscape along the east coast of Labrador, barren, rocky slopes scourged by the frigid Labrador Current extend throughout the St. Lewis Sound. The sub-Arctic climate of the south Labrador coast generally offers a pleasant cool summer climate, which is soon replaced with a snow-covered, ice-chilled winter season. This harsh environment, with a few trifling exceptions, nourishes a hardy boreal ecosystem. Collective forests of black spruce, <b>white</b> spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> are confined to interior valleys and riverbanks where the geography affords mild protection against the elements. Yet, the bleak, rocky shore of the Labrador coastline strongly resembles an Arctic tundra biome. St. Lewis embellishes its position as the easternmost permanent community on the North American mainland. The community’s physical location provides an excellent vantage point to view the southward procession of icebergs and floe-ice commencing every summer. St. Lewis is proudly recognized by Newfoundland and Labrador Tourism as located in the province's renowned [...] "Iceberg Alley".|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} {{enzymes that}} could be developed to reduce the recalcitrance of softwood resources, the transcriptomes of the softwood-degrading white-rot fungus Phanerochaete carnosa were evaluated after growth on lodgepole pine, <b>white</b> spruce, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> and sugar maple and compared to the transcriptome of P. carnosa after growth on liquid nutrient medium. One hundred fifty-two million paired-end reads were obtained, and 63 % of these reads were mapped to 10, 257 gene models from P. carnosa. Five-hundred thirty-three of these genes had transcripts that were {{at least four times}} more abundant during growth on at least one wood medium than on nutrient medium. The 30 transcripts that were on average over 100 times more abundant during growth on wood than on nutrient medium included 6 manganese peroxidases, 5 cellulases, 2 hemicellulases, a lignin peroxidase, glyoxal oxidase, and a P 450 monooxygenase. Notably, among the genes encoding putative cellulases, one encoding a glycosyl hydrolase family 61 protein had the highest relative transcript abundance during growth on wood. Overall, transcripts predicted to encode lignin-degrading activities were more abundant than those predicted to encode carbohydrate-active enzymes. Transcripts predicted to encode three MnPs represented the most highly abundant transcripts in wood-grown cultivations compared to nutrient medium cultivations. Gene set enrichment analyses did not distinguish transcriptomes resulting from softwood and hardwood cultivations, suggesting that similar sets of enzyme activities are elicited by P. carnosa grown on different wood substrates, albeit to different expression levels...|$|R
