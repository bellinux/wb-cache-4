5|$|At the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1242, the Mongol hordes {{broke the}} Seljuk hegemony in Anatolia. Alanya was then {{subject to a}} series of invasions from Anatolian beyliks. Lusignans from Cyprus briefly {{overturned}} the then ruling Hamidid dynasty in 1371. The Karamanids sold the city in 1427 for 5,000 gold coins to the Mamluks of Egypt for a period before General Gedik Ahmed Pasha in 1471 incorporated it into the growing Ottoman Empire. The city was made a capital of a local sanjak in the eyalet of Içel. The Ottomans extended their rule in 1477 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> the main shipping trade, lumber, then mostly done by Venetians, under the government monopoly. On September 6, 1608, the city rebuffed a naval attack by the Order of Saint Stephen from the Republic of Venice.|$|E

Local officials surrendered and signed peace treaties with the British. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> these peace treaties to Beijing they were punished for their failures. The Qing Dynasty government {{refused to acknowledge}} the treaties, nor did they acknowledge any Chinese territory had been lost. Instead, they sent in more troops to drive back the British.|$|E
25|$|However, Joan of Acre’s {{independent}} nature caused numerous {{conflicts with}} her father. Her father disapproved of her leaving court after {{her marriage to}} the Earl of Gloucester, and in turn “seized seven robes {{that had been made}} for her.” He also strongly disapproved of her second marriage to Ralph de Monthermer, a squire in her household, {{even to the point of}} attempting to force her to marry someone else. While Edward ultimately developed a cordial relationship with Monthermer, even giving him the title of Earl, there appears to have been a notable difference in the Edward’s treatment of Joan as compared to the treatment of the rest of her siblings. For instance, her father famously paid messengers substantially <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> news of the birth of grandchildren, but did not do this upon birth of Joan’s daughter.|$|E

500|$|Of the {{original}} 40-member Leningrad Radio Orchestra, only 14 or 15 {{still lived in}} the city; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. Shostakovich's symphony required an expanded orchestra of 100 players, meaning the remaining personnel were grossly insufficient. Eliasberg, at the time being treated for [...] "dystrophy", went door to door to seek out those musicians who had not responded to the orchestra's reassembly due to starvation or weakness. [...] "My God, how thin many of them were," [...] one of the organizers remembered. [...] "How those people livened up when we started to ferret {{them out of their}} dark apartments. We were moved to tears <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> out their concert clothes, their violins and cellos and flutes, and rehearsals began under the icy canopy of the studio."

500|$|Parker arguably {{exercised}} tightest {{control over}} Presley's film career. In 1957, Robert Mitchum asked Presley to costar {{with him in}} Thunder Road, on which Mitchum was writer and producer. According to George Klein, one of his oldest friends, Presley was offered starring roles in West Side Story and Midnight Cowboy. In 1974, Barbra Streisand approached Presley to star {{with her in the}} remake of A Star is Born. In each case, any ambitions the singer may have had to play such parts were thwarted by his manager's negotiating demands or flat refusals. In Lacker's description, [...] "The only thing that kept Elvis going after the early years was a new challenge. But Parker kept running everything into the ground." [...] The prevailing attitude may have been summed up best by the response Leiber and Stoller received <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> a serious film project for Presley to Parker and the Hill and Range owners for their consideration. In Leiber's telling, Jean Aberbach warned them to never again [...] "try to interfere with the business or artistic workings of the process known as Elvis Presley." ...|$|E

[...] Alderson was the first round pick in the 2007 draft and was ranked the number four prospect in the Giants organization by Baseball America, [...] but Sanchez provided a much needed jump for the Giants offense. Sanchez ended the 2009 season batting [...]293 with 41 runs batted in and 22 walks.

Next was reforming the orchestra. Only 15 members were still available; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. Posters went up, requesting all Leningrad musicians {{to report to the}} Radio Committee. Efforts were also made to seek out those musicians who could not come. [...] "My God, how thin many of them were," [...] one of the organizers of the performance remembered. [...] "How those people livened up when we started to ferret them out of their dark apartments.

2500|$|An {{attempt to}} change the rules was made by Condoleezza Rice and Tzipi Livni <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> forth the concept of a shelf agreement. [...] The idea was to {{disengage}} the linkage between negotiations and actions on the ground. In theory this would allow negotiations until a [...] "shelf agreement" [...] defining peace would be obtained. Such an agreement would not entail implementation. It would just describe what peace is. It would stay on the shelf but eventually will guide the implementation. The difficulty with this notion is that it creates a dis-incentive for Israel to reach such an agreement. The lack of clarity about what happens after agreement is reached will result in insurmountable pressures on Abbas to demand immediate implementation. However, from the Israeli point of view, the Palestinians are not ready to create a stable state, such an implementation process will almost guarantee instability in the Palestinian areas with a possible Hamas takeover as happened in Gaza.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Pinto, {{a former}} {{scientist}} at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech in Pasadena, published in Physical Review his Gedankenexperiment for a [...] "Casimir engine". The paper showed that continuous positive net exchange of {{energy from the}} Casimir effect was possible, even stating in the abstract [...] "In the event of no other alternative explanations, one should conclude that major technological advances {{in the area of}} endless, by-product free-energy production could be achieved." [...] In 2001 Capasso et al. showed how the force can be used to control the mechanical motion of a MEMS device, The researchers suspended a polysilicon plate from a torsional rod – a twisting horizontal bar just a few microns in diameter. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> a metallized sphere close up to the plate, the attractive Casimir force between the two objects made the plate rotate. They also studied the dynamical behaviour of the MEMS device by making the plate oscillate. The Casimir force reduced the rate of oscillation and led to nonlinear phenomena, such as hysteresis and bistability in the frequency response of the oscillator. According to the team, the system’s behaviour agreed well with theoretical calculations.|$|E

2500|$|Authorities within state-endorsed {{religions}} were {{suspicious of}} pietist doctrine which they {{often viewed as}} a social danger, as it [...] "seemed either to generate an excess of evangelical fervor and so disturb the public tranquility or to promote a mysticism so nebulous as to obscure the imperatives of morality. A movement which cultivated religious feeling almost as an end itself". While some pietists (such as Pastor Francis Magny) held that [...] "mysticism and the moral law went together", for others (like his pupil Françoise-Louise de la Tour) [...] "pietist mysticism did less to reinforce the moral law than to take its place...the principle of 'guidance by inner light' was often a signal to follow the most intense of her inner sentiments...the supremacy of feeling over reason". Religious authorities could bring pressure on pietists, such as <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> some of Magny's followers before the local consistory {{to answer questions about}} their unorthodox views or when they banished Pastor Magny from Vevey for heterodoxy in 1713. Likewise, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional disputation was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship.|$|E
2500|$|Boyzone manager Louis Walsh {{is quoted}} as saying: [...] "We're all {{absolutely}} devastated. I'm in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don't know much about what's happened yet. I only heard after The X Factor (UK television talent show on which Walsh is a judge) and we will rally around each other this week. He was a great man." [...] Walsh {{dropped out of the}} live results show of The X Factor on 11 October 2009 {{as a direct result of}} Gately's death. Simon Cowell addressed the issue at the start of the programme. He said: [...] "This is really, really tragic news I want to send out my condolences to the family, our thoughts are with Louis". That edition of the show attracted an [...] "absolutely huge" [...] audience which was said to have been seeking updates on the singer's death. Walsh also was absent from the second week of The X Factor which coincided with Gately's funeral,—later commenting: [...] "I never want to watch the show at home again. I've been shouting at the TV all night"—at which Walsh was too upset to speak. My First Time, a stage show which was set to star bandmember Keith Duffy, was cancelled entirely. Duffy, Graham, Keating and Lynch had memorial [...] "76 09" [...] tattoos (Gately's birth and death years) engraved on their bodies <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> Gately's body home.|$|E
2500|$|Shibe scion Jack briefly {{tried his}} hand as a boxing {{promoter}} in the early 1910s, shortly after his father built Shibe Park, and {{although he did not}} pursue the career, he did make the acquaintance of other promoters in the Philadelphia boxing world, including Bob Gunnis and Herman [...] "Muggsy" [...] Taylor. Gunnis and Taylor became among the first promoters to book a bout into a major league baseball stadium <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>brought</b> Johnny Dundee vs. George Chaney to Shibe Park in July 1917, and although the fight itself was unremarkable, the concept propelled Gunnis and Taylor to the forefront of their trade. Over the next forty years, perhaps a hundred boxing cards took place at Shibe, some of them big-time pairings and even championship bouts. Benny Leonard retained his championship against challenger Johnny Kilbane in 1917, and 1928's Benny Bass vs. Harry Blitman was said by sportswriters to be the best featherweight bout in the city's history. In the 1950s, Gil Turner, Ike Williams, Charley Fusari and many other top fighters fought important bouts at Shibe Park. At first, groundskeepers set the ring up over the pitcher's mound, but soon this changed to the area over home plate with the baseball backstops dismantled; spectators sat in the main grandstand for the fight. Even before the installation of the light towers in 1939, staging night boxing was easy because of the vastly smaller area that needed to be lit –portable searchlights did the trick.|$|E

[...] Musgrove rejoined Williamson in 1892, and in 1896 they broke box-office records with an original Australian pantomime, Djin Djin. [...] Williamson married Mary Alice Weir, a dancer, in 1899, and his partnership with Musgrove dissolved that year unpleasantly. [...] Among other ventures, in 1900 Williamson leased Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne, and began a series of extensive renovations and expansions to the theatre that became the flagship venue for J. C. Williamson in years to come. He also leased Her Majesty's Theatre in Sydney, and in 1902 mounted the biggest production in its history, Ben Hur, at a cost of £14,000. [...] With a running time of nearly four hours, the production contained huge choral numbers, marches and a spectacular chariot race, with horses galloping on a treadmill in front of a moving backdrop. [...] The music was composed by American Edward Stillman Kelly and remained popular for some years. [...] A bubonic plague outbreak temporarily closed the theatre soon afterwards, and it was burnt down with huge losses. [...] But Williamson organized a Shakespeare company at the Theatre Royal and rebuilt the theatre in 1903. The next year he entered partnership with George Tallis, his Melbourne manager, and with Gustave Ramaciotti as legal adviser. [...] Visually sensational shows were now 'the Firm's' speciality, and the organisation had grown to employ 650people.|$|E
