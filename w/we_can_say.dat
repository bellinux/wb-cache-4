25|$|Aristotle holds a teleological worldview: he {{sees the}} {{universe}} as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists {{for the sake of}} actuality. Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form, and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing. Now, each thing has certain potentialities {{as a result of its}} form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither. Hence, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that the snake ought to slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.|$|E

25|$|Theology in the Flesh {{shows that}} biblical writers used {{a wide array}} of metaphors to {{understand}} topics such as sin, salvation, and God. Salvation, for example, is thought of in terms of release from slavery, as friendship with God, as healing, as returning from the dead, and as finding your way home to list but a few. No single metaphor says everything that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> about salvation and so multiple metaphors are needed. There are often several legitimate ways, within constraints, for Christians to understand a topic. The book provides lots of examples of how different Christian communities, over time and across cultures, use different metaphors for salvation and so arrive at conflicting theological positions.|$|E

On the other hand, there was clear proof of perjury and obstruction of justice which could be prosecuted in a relatively straightforward trial.|$|E
25|$|From the {{descriptions}} {{that have come}} down to us through the writings of those such as Plato, Aristoxenus and, later, Boethius, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> with some caution that the ancient Greeks, at least before Plato, heard music that was primarily monophonic; that is, music built on single melodies based on a system of modes/scales, themselves built on the concept that notes should be placed between consonant intervals. It is a commonplace of musicology to say that harmony, {{in the sense of}} a developed system of composition, in which many tones at once contribute to the listener's expectation of resolution, was invented in the European Middle Ages and that ancient cultures had no developed system of harmony—that is, for example, playing the third and seventh above the dominant, in order to create the expectation for the listener that the tritone will resolve to the third.|$|E

25|$|When {{a cluster}} of microparticles are trapped within a {{monochromatic}} laser beam, {{the organization of the}} microparticles within the optical trapping is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the binding forces are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.|$|E
25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The {{lone pair of electrons}} moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This lone pair of electrons abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth {{as long as they are}} close enough to the substrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{true power}} of STR {{analysis}} {{is in its}} statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are independently assorted (having {{a certain number of}} repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the product rule for probabilities can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that the probability of having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x1018) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches. Moreover, since there are about 12 million monozygotic twins on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.|$|E
