500|$|In March 2011, six {{roles were}} cast (including Dylan Minnette as Rex Britten, Michael's son). Minnette commended the series' script, {{and noted that}} auditioning was quick.

In January 2012, Kevin Weisman was cast in a recurring role as Ed Hawkins, a detective in a separate division of the LAPD.|$|E

500|$|Saiz {{wanted to}} keep the video mostly in the moment without much narrative; he said, [...] " [...] wanted it to be more about the girls, doing the {{performance}} with Beyoncé taking a backseat as a kind of madam character"; in order to convey that idea, the singer does not sing the song's lyrics in the video. He envisioned the clip as being [...] "sexy and provocative, but not so overt", leaning to more sophisticated visuals. In an interview with New York magazine, Saiz affirmed that there are many references to 1990s eroticism and the 1995 video for [...] "Human Nature" [...] by American singer Madonna in the clip for [...] "Yoncé". Elaborating further on the video shoot, Saiz told BuzzFeed, [...] "The girls were incredible. Everyone kind of checked whatever ego at the door and we <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> to make something fun and special." [...] He described the cast as being [...] "spontaneous and not at all contrived". Joan Smalls revealed during an interview that the crew did not follow a certain script while filming and added it was [...] "up for interpretation" [...] - she mentioned the scene where she licks Beyoncé's breast as her own idea, getting inspiration from the song's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that we sat down and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
500|$|Metcalfe {{spoke of}} the new storyline, saying how [...] "honoured" [...] she was {{to take part in}} the storyline as well as praising the writer, Anna Clements: [...] "I'm honoured to have been given this storyline to raise {{awareness}} of such an important cause. Count the Kicks is a fantastic charity, which aims to teach expectant mothers about noticing changes in their pregnancy to reduce the risk of stillbirth. And working with Sands has helped me understand how Mercedes would cope with life after her baby has died. Mercedes has already been through so much tragedy in her life, but the death of her son will show a much more fragile side to her character. The scripts are brilliantly written by Anna Clements and with the help of the two charities, I was able to really understand what Mercedes is going through." [...] Erica Stewart, the bereavement support services manager at Sands, said: [...] "We're pleased to have been approached by the researchers and writers at Hollyoaks for advice and help to ensure that this heartbreaking storyline is portrayed truthfully and sensitively. Stillbirth is not rare and it's a tragedy that can happen to anyone. Sadly thousands of babies die each year in the UK. In 2013, over 100 babies every week were stillborn or died soon after birth. For a show like Hollyoaks with a youth focus to be covering this devastating experience is a brilliant way of raising awareness of the issues surrounding baby death among a younger audience who may have not otherwise come across them." [...] Metcalfe later further discussed the storyline, revealing that when she read the scripts she had [...] "a lump in my throat", which made cry and when she had finished reading the scripts, she was [...] "sat their sobbing". She continued to say: [...] "When it came to playing it on set I did minimal rehearsals because I didn't want to wear out the true meaning of the words." [...] before praising the script writing, calling them [...] "brilliant" [...] and stating she did not have to work hard to find the [...] "level of emotion", [...] "The words <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> on the page. I broke down every time." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 30, 1960, John Deere dealers {{from around}} the world converged on Dallas, Texas, for an {{unprecedented}} product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the [...] "New Generation of Power", the company’s first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>there</b> to see. The Dallas Memorial Auditorium, the Texas State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Cotton Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event, a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside Neiman-Marcus, a popular Dallas-based department store.|$|E
2500|$|Havins {{agreed with}} Riegel that the reveal scenes were exciting. [...] "I'm always {{up for a}} {{challenge}} and I work best under pressure," [...] she said. [...] "My competitive side kicks in. So the thought that I maybe couldn't do it made me be like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm doin' it!' We put so much preparation into it." [...] Justin Bruening (Jamie Martin) and Jacob Young (JR) were the only other cast members in the episode. [...] "...I worked with a private coach, we worked on it together.... We {{put a lot of}} time into this episode," [...] Havins stated. [...] "We usually don't have that luxury, but this time we did; this took priority. And shooting it, too, we knew it was a big deal." [...] She revealed that the producers and director were patient with them. [...] "And if we felt we didn't like where a take went, usually they're like, 'No, it's fine, let's move on,' but this time they were like, 'Let's do it again. We loved that take, girls, but let's try something else,' and we'd go in a totally different direction." [...] She said, [...] "They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [...] and I were, so that was a really good feeling. We <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>there,</b> we were all in it together, and hopefully, the finished product shows it." ...|$|E
