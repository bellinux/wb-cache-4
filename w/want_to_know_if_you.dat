500|$|Green Day's {{sound is}} often {{compared}} to first wave punk rock bands {{such as the}} Ramones, The Clash, Sex Pistols, The Jam, and the Buzzcocks. Stylistically, the group is characterized as punk rock, pop punk and alternative rock. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Green Day as [...] "punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs." [...] While Armstrong is the primary songwriter, he looks to the other band members for organizational help. Billie Joe Armstrong has mentioned {{that some of his}} biggest influences are seminal alternative rock bands Hüsker Dü and The Replacements, and that their influence is particularly noted in the band's chord changes in songs. Green Day has covered Hüsker Dü's [...] "Don't <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>If</b> <b>You</b> Are Lonely" [...] as a b-side to the [...] "Warning" [...] single, and the character [...] "Mr. Whirly" [...] in the group's song [...] "Misery" [...] is a reference to the Replacements song of the same name. Among other influences, Green Day have also cited The Kinks, The Who and power pop pioneers Cheap Trick. English rock musician Noel Gallagher of Oasis complained about the band semi-jokingly, claiming that the band had ripped off his song [...] "Wonderwall" [...] with its song [...] "Boulevard of Broken Dreams".|$|E
