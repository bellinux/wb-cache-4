40|$|In {{order to}} make our lifestyles sustainable, {{changing}} our consumption patterns is fundamental. Hence, we need to better understand who the "consumers" are and to consider them as an active actor to directly engage for ensuring effective policies. In order to support a resource-light society, production and consumption {{need to be considered}} through an integrated system view; within this, consumers play an important role as co-acting subjects. Almost every activity in private life involves a form of consumption aimed at satisfying the subject's needs and often regarded through an economic lens. Sustainable development is not about abolishing private consumption, but rather about making it environmentally, socially and individually sustainable in its design, organization and realization, also involving ideas of simplicity or renunciation. In this paper, we will assess the status quo of the German and European debates on Consumer Research Policies and discuss the idea to link sustainability research and consumer research - where a strategic relation is currently missing. <b>Within</b> <b>that</b> <b>discussion,</b> an evidence-based and obligatory consumer research strategy in Germany and Europe would represent a significant improvement. A system view perspective is necessary to take into consideration the impressive amount of diversity, and to elaborate realistic economic and consumer policies. Therefore, we propose nine steps for understanding the role of the consumer in implementing sustainable development from a scientific and political perspective. The limitations of this paper are thus a result of the very diverse and often unclear policies and agendas produced by governments. The implementation of the proposed innovative research agenda for a future-orientated and sustainability-based consumer research is not free from challenges. Still, the paper suggests the first steps towards this direction. After a critical discussion of the current EU and German consumer and sustainability policies, nine differentiated and substantial ways to integrate and ameliorate them are proposed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{following}} six {{types of}} functions are considered which, {{when applied to}} a word, return an interval of that word: (1) prefixk, which returns the prefix of length k; (2) suffixk, which returns the suffix of length k; (3) chopk, which returns all but the first k symbols; (4) chopk, which returns all but the last k symbols; (5) Fprefixλ, which returns the first λ part of the word; and (6) Fsuffixλ, which returns the last λ part of the word. (Here k is a nonnegative integer and λ a real number, 0 < λ < 1.) The main result is that any composition of functions of the first four types {{which is not a}} trivial function is represented in exactly one of the forms prefixjchoplchopm, suffixkchoplchopm, choplchopm, or prefix 2 suffix 1, and is unique <b>within</b> <b>that</b> form.

However, {{recent research has}} started to uncover a clear impact upon learning progression and transforming student understanding across disciplines. This paper details a series of case studies from the JuxtaLearn project conducted across Europe in schools and HE. The results show an increase in students’ depth of understanding (deep learning) through creative juxtaposed approaches, in particular using participatory video making. For this research, an ecology of different devices (mobiles, tablets, tabletops, large screens and computers) was used to scaffold a juxtaposed collaborative learning process supporting {{a deeper understanding of}} ‘tricky topics’.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the notion of {{community}} within online teaching and learning, in particular <b>within</b> <b>that</b> of online <b>discussion.</b> It offers a review of conceptions of community across different settings and considers that an online learning community should show spirit, trust, interaction, and learning. The notion of community is then explored within a case study of a Masters level online course on action research taught at a distance from a public University in USA. This course encouraged practitioners with different roles in education to begin action research projects to develop their professional practice. A multimethod approach was taken to explore the actions and perceptions of course participants. Findings are organised around the four elements of spirit, trust, interaction, and learning with each element described and elaborated {{in the context of the}} study. It is suggested that there were elements of community within the course but interaction was limited by time and course requirements. It is further suggested that the course better illustrates the idea of a community-minded practitioner learning group, rather than a community, and the strengths and weaknesses of this characterisation are set out. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{thinking}} on security fails {{to explain the}} security predicament of Third World states. These states, with their existence assured by international recognition, are not primarily concerned with externally generated threats. Their internal characteristics violate the tenants of the realist theory, because they {{have more than one}} nation within their borders. The domestic conditions of these states make them internally insecure and weak [...] -the threat of ethnic conflict great. As such, placing security in the military sphere alone, ignores these contradictions which lead to an insecurity dilemma. Thus, the concept of security needs to be broadened to include, not merely the military but also the political, societal and economic factors. The threat posed to state security from dissenting ethnic groups is both a domestic and foreign policy issue.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} food ethnography {{of a small}} group of Vietnamese immigrants who live in Hamilton and Mississauga. Members of this community have previously been identified as consumers of fish and wildlife foods directly procured from the Great Lakes basin. I explore the symbolic, social, and nutritional place of fish and its relationship to perceptions of contamination, risk, and health in this group. I describe the socio-cultural, historical, and environmental context of this group of people with whom I conducted research in the summer of 1996. Ethnographic data was collected by means of participant observation during a five-week household placement with a Vietnamese family. In addition, I conducted interviews and cooking sessions among sixteen households. My findings reveal dynamic changes in Vietnamese dietary practices, including the diminished role of fish in their diet. I argue that for the Vietnamese people with whom I spoke, concerns about health and the environment are not a priority and therefore, from their perspective, they are not a risk group for Great Lakes contaminants. I show that what is accepted as risk is partly a political process and that the Vietnamese construct, negotiate, and manage risk in their own way. While the ethnography is a focused look at Vietnamese foodways and the role of fish <b>within</b> <b>that</b> context, the <b>discussion</b> of risk goes beyond the particular to larger issues surrounding the politics of fish consumption in this group. Finally, I make recommendations for further research and initiatives based on my findings...|$|R

40|$|The {{intention}} of the project is to determine whether political elites have to discuss an issue using a specific emotional tone before the public and other political elites consider that issue a problem. Research has not yet demonstrated under what conditions elite rhetorical cues can heighten issue attention. Past {{studies have suggested that}} an increase in the absolute intensity of elite issue discussion can heighten perceptions of an issue as a problem. The problem with this notion is <b>that</b> <b>within</b> <b>that</b> absolute issue <b>discussion,</b> elites might simply be repeatedly saying conditions related to an issue are stable. They might also be presenting basic factual background information about an issue, a type of discussion unlikely to capture the interest of many in the political system. There has to be a specific type of cue that elites can offer to compel others in the political system to reconsider their outlook on issue salience. Derived from dual systems theories of emotion, the dissertation predicts <b>that</b> issue <b>discussion</b> <b>that</b> heightens feelings of anxiety increases the likelihood of an altered outlook on issue salience. To evaluate this prediction, time series statistical techniques are employed. The time series models evaluate whether prior change in the level of anxietybased cues by the president and the media predict changes in the level of attention the public offers to that issue. The same types of models evaluate whether this form of issue discussion by the president predicts issue dynamics of the media, and vice-versa. The several issues studied are crime, health care, poverty, and the environment. Information spanning thirty years is collected from presidential papers, general and ideological media newspaper coverage, and multiple public survey organizations. The findings suggest anxiety-based issue discussion does have the potential to guide issue attention. Prior changes in anxiety-based cues do predict future levels of attention the public provides to issues. A positive shift in anxiety cues by elites appears to have the capacity to increase public attention to issues. This increase though appears to be very small and abbreviated, suggesting limited effects. Elites do not appear to influence each other through anxiety cues...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores white American masculinity {{within the}} “ginger” phenomenon. To guide this study, I asked: How is racism {{conceptualized}} and understood within popular culture, {{as seen through}} discussions {{of whether or not}} gingerism constitutes racism? How do commenters respond or interact when their understandings of racism or explanations for gingerism are challenged by other commenters? And finally, what does the creation of and prejudice against/making fun of a “hyperwhite” masculine identity at this social/historical moment suggest about the current stability of the dominant white masculine identity? Through discourse analysis of online comments, I explored discussions of race, gender, and gingerism. The analysis covered 6, 413 comments on 102 articles. I found <b>that</b> <b>within</b> <b>discussions</b> of race and gingerism, readers made use of varying definitions of race and racism. Different definitions led to conflations of racism, oppression, and bullying. Simplified and individualized definitions of race and racism also led to arguments that supported frameworks of reverse racism and post-racism. So-called discrimination against redheaded men was overall considered to be more serious than for women. These arguments were bound up in questions of the specificity of cultural contexts, and ethnic and national identities, particularly with regard to Irish and Scottish immigrant heritage in the United States and United Kingdom. Future work should continue to untangle ideas of race and physical appearance and ask how whiteness is understood and works within this context...|$|R
