They <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> maintaining/protecting their self-concept. Because their lives are not authentic this is a difficult task and they are under constant threat. They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial. Distortion occurs when the individual perceives a threat to their self-concept. They distort the perception until it fits their self-concept.|$|E

500|$|Dmowski had a scientist's {{background}} and thus preferred logic and reason over emotion and passion. He once told famous pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski that music was [...] "mere noise". Dmowski {{felt very strongly}} that Poles should abandon what he considered to be foolish romantic nationalism and useless gestures of defiance and should instead <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> becoming businessmen and scientists. Dmowski was very much influenced by Social Darwinist theories, then popular in the Western world, and saw life as a merciless struggle between [...] "strong" [...] nations who dominated and [...] "weak" [...] nations who were dominated.|$|E
500|$|In 1774, Day visited Sabrina {{to inform}} {{her that she}} would be apprenticed to the Parkinsons, a family of dressmakers, as Day {{believed}} the profession would not expose her to temptation. She was delivered to the family with the stipulation that she should <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> chores and be denied luxuries. The Parkinsons, however, treated Sabrina well, to the extent that Day later chastised them for not instilling [...] "industry and frugality" [...] in her. Less than a year later the Parkinsons' business went bankrupt, leaving Sabrina without an apprenticeship and nowhere to live. Day arranged for her to stay with his friends, the Keir family, and implied that she could take on the role of housekeeper at his own home. Day again considered Sabrina, who was now 18, a potential wife, but did not let her know of his intentions, nor that her upbringing was part of his experiment.|$|E

The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E

[...] In 2009, he was cast as Bot, the robot superhero, on the children's show Team Umizoomi through the relationships he had made at Nickelodeon on Blue's Clues. [...] He found working on Team Umizoomi [...] "comforting" [...] {{because many of the}} same crew, producers, and creators had also worked on Blue's Clues. [...] It {{was the first time he}} had worked as a voice-over artist, unlike on Blue's Clues, when he was able to be more physical acting in front of a blue screen. [...] He said, about Team Umizoomi, [...] "the work the animators have done on it has been superlative". [...] He stated that he enjoyed working on Team Umizoomi because it gave him the opportunity to participate in a show from its inception, which he had missed with Blue's Clues. [...] Patton said his voice performance of Bot, which he modeled on Brent Spiner's performance as the android Data on [...] and was influenced by Mel Blanc's work in the classic Warner Bros. cartoons, [...] "ended up sounding more like my natural voice, with a teeny bit of superhero in there". [...] Despite both roles in Blue's Clues and Team Umizoomi requiring him to sing, he did not consider himself a natural singer and felt that he had to <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> it. [...] He said, about being cast as Bot, [...] "I get to be a superhero. Who doesn't want to be a superhero"?.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} engineers, Wally was {{originally}} a worker trying to get fired to get a severance package. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He often carries a cup of coffee, calmly sipping from it {{even in the midst}} of chaos or office-shaking revelations. Wally is extremely cynical. He is even more socially inept than Dilbert (though far less self-aware of the fact), and references to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon. Like the Pointy-Haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and will take advantage of any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work. Squat and balding, Wally is almost invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie. [...] Adams has stated that Wally was based on a Pacific Bell coworker of his who was interested in a generous employee buy-out program—for the company's worst employees. This had the effect of causing this man—whom Adams describes as [...] "one of the more brilliant people I've met"—to <b>work</b> <b>hard</b> <b>at</b> being incompetent, rude, and generally poor at his job to qualify for the buy-out program. Adams has said that this inspired the basic laziness and amorality of Wally's character. Despite these personality traits Wally is accepted as part of Dilbert, Ted, Alice, and Asok's clique. Although his relationship with Alice is often antagonistic and Dilbert occasionally denies being his friend, their actions show at least a certain acceptance of him.|$|E
