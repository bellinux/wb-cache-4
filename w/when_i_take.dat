2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} McKay's life, McKay embraced Catholicism, {{retreating}} from Communism entirely. [...] His sudden conversion into Catholicism puzzled {{many for}} over half a century. When McKay converted into Catholicism in his final years, he was perceived to be suffering from poverty, health problems, and political and social exclusion by his own beloved Harlem. [...] Before his actual conversion, he wrote to long-time friend and mentor, Max Eastman, about [...] "doing a lot of reading and research, especially on Catholic work among Negroes----Because if and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> the step I want to be intellectually honest and sincere about it".(McKay to Eastman, June 1, 1944). Five months later, when McKay was baptized into the Holy Roman Catholic Church, he wrote to Eastman to assure him that [...] "I am not less the fighter" [...] for doing so (McKay to Eastman, October 16, 1944, Rpt. in Passion 305)".|$|E
