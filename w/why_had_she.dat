500|$|The {{trial began}} in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with {{three days of}} {{testimony}} from MacMillan. [...] Brownlee's lawyer, Arthur LeRoy Smith, used his cross examination {{to call into question}} almost everything MacMillan said. [...] To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had even met Brownlee. [...] He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. [...] Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until {{more than a year after}} that date. [...] In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. [...] After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large deadbolt on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not used it? [...] "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," [...] was the plaintiff's response. [...] MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. [...] When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period.|$|E
2500|$|In the prosecution's closing statement, Skurka {{told the}} jury that Selena: [...] "had {{been reduced to a}} mere picture thanks to the March 31 actions of the defendant." [...] Skurka asked the jury why Saldívar, a nurse, did not {{administer}} first aid and <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> had not called 911 after accidentally shooting the singer in the back. Skurka then provided details of the three different stories Saldívar used to explain the purchase of the gun, as well as the different stories about her alleged rape. The prosecutor pointed out that if Saldívar had wanted to commit suicide she had ample time to do so. Valdez took out a calendar for the month of March 1995 and chronologically pointed out the events preceding the killing of Selena. According to Valdez, Saldívar hated Quintanilla, Jr. and believed that she got revenge by killing his daughter [...] "someone he loved the most." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{knew now}} <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> looked guilty at my appearance, what {{had brought her}} out that afternoon, <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> hurried me in, {{the nature of the}} [...] "book" [...] <b>she</b> <b>had</b> run back to fetch, the reason <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> wanted me to go back by the high-road, and <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> pitied me. It was all in the instant clear to me.|$|R

6000|$|Yet {{it had to}} be so. She did {{not want}} to do it. Yet she had to. Oh, why, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> leagued herself to this evil system where she must brutalize herself to live? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> become a school-teacher, why, why? ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there was}} her uncle's opinion: he still {{thought that they}} might be married. Oh, <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> sent her letter? and <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> made it so cold? With such a letter as that before him, Frank could not do other than consent to her proposal. And then, why did he not at least answer it? ...|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{glared at}} him fiercely--glared first at him {{and then at the}} {{innocent}} Beatrice. Could he be going to propose to her, then?

But the heart of Beatrice, who sat momentarily expecting to be publicly denounced, grew ever fainter. The waters of desolation were closing in over her soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Señor, {{this is not}} a thing I love joking about," [...] said he. [...] "Let us talk {{of other}} things. What I want to know is, what is Calixto's sister doing here? <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> left her country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know nothing}} about it. You cannot know {{anything}} about it. <b>Why</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> treated me in this way? To send up to a man and simply tell him that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> changed her mind! God in heaven!--that you should bring me such a message!" ...|$|R

60|$|Feeling him abstract, {{withdrawn}} from her, Helena experienced the dread of losing him. She {{was in his}} arms, but his spirit ignored her. That was insufferable to her pride. Yet she dared not disturb him--she was afraid. Bitterly she repented her of the giving way to her revulsion a little space before. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not smothered it and pretended? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she,</b> a woman, betrayed herself so flagrantly? Now perhaps she had lost him for good. She was consumed with uneasiness.|$|E
60|$|<b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> gone out? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not {{remained}} {{a fixture in}} the house, seeing that {{it had always been}} possible that he should come? But why! oh, why! had he treated her in this way, leaving his card at her home, as though that would comfort her in her grievous desolation? It would have been far better that he should have left there no intimation of his coming. She took the card, and in her anger threw it from her into the fire.|$|E

6000|$|Noel {{felt the}} blood rush into her cheeks. The light leaped up, and Leila came forward. She looked {{extremely}} pale, calm, and self-contained, in her nurse's dress; her full lips were tightly pressed together, but Noel {{could see her}} breast heaving violently. A turmoil of shame and wounded pride began raging in the girl. <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not flown long ago? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> let herself be trapped like this? Leila would think she had been making up to him! Horrible! Disgusting! Why didn't he--why didn't some one, speak? Then Leila said: ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> left me secretly, {{without a}} word of farewell? Because she was suffering, in mind or body? Or because she resented, {{naturally}} resented, my neglect of her? ...|$|E

50|$|There, Superman {{asks about}} Jennings <b>why</b> <b>has</b> <b>she</b> being {{following}} {{him through his}} journey. Jennings shows him the Sunstone her students found, saying that when Superman passed by the school she worked at, the Sunstone filled her with all of Superman's feelings of sadness and doubt. This established a mental link between her and Superman, effectively transforming Jennings into the living embodiment of his depression. The Sunstone not only gave her Kryptonian powers, but it also gave Jennings the power to alter Superman's dreams and affect the things he saw and heard.|$|R

60|$|As he {{made this}} resolve {{something}} like real love returned to his heart, and he became for a while sick with regret. He assured himself that he had loved her, {{and that he could}} love her still;--but <b>why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not been true to him? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> clung to her father instead of clinging to her husband? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not learned his ways,--as a wife is bound to learn the ways of the man she marries? <b>Why</b> <b>had</b> <b>she</b> not helped him in his devices, fallen into his plans, been regardful of his fortunes, and made herself one with him? There had been present to him at times an idea that if he could take her away with him to that distant country to which he thought to go, and thus remove her from the upas influence of her father's roof-tree, she would then fall into his views and become his wife indeed. Then he would again be tender to her, again love her, again endeavour to make the world soft to her. But it was too late now for that. He had failed in everything as far as England was concerned, and it was chiefly by her fault that he had failed. He would consent to leave her;--but, as he thought of it in his solitude, his eyes became moist with regret.|$|E
