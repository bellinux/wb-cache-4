40|$|International audienceThe {{detection}} of <b>water</b> <b>leakages</b> in dikes using distributed temperature sensors {{is an interesting}} prospect due to the commercial viability of these optical fiber based sensors. The acquired temperature data, being not directly interpretable, requires intervention of advanced signal processing techniques. In this work, we propose a system for the identification of singularities such as existing dike structures and <b>water</b> <b>leakages.</b> The distances where singularities exist show temperature variations {{over the course of}} a day which are different from the nonsingular zones. The different nonsingular zones though show a similar temperature variation trend. The proposed system estimates this reference trend as the most coherent component of the Singular Value Decomposition applied on daily data. The corresponding SVD residue subspace thus represents the deviation from the reference subspace and thus contains information on singularities. The L 2 norm of this residue is a good discrimination measure for identification of these singularities...|$|R

25|$|Average {{non-revenue water}} was 7.3% in 2007, varying {{from less than}} 5% up to 15%. The low level of <b>water</b> <b>leakage,</b> down from 18% in 1978, has been {{achieved}} through speedy repairs that are typically undertaken {{the same day that}} a connection is reported, and through the use of high-quality pipe materials. The government's target is to reduce losses to 2% for large utilities and 5% for small utilities. Japan is perhaps the only country in the world that also collects nationwide data on unaccounted for sewage, i.e. the amount of water that erroneously enters the sanitary sewer system e.g. through connections from stormwater sewers or groundwater leakage. The average unaccounted for sewerage is 12%, varying from 6% in Shiga to 30% in Sapporo.|$|E

2500|$|The {{building}} {{featured a}} central circular block (officially {{known as the}} Main Block, but often referred to by staff as the [...] "doughnut") around which were studios, offices, engineering areas and the News Centre. In {{the centre of the}} main block was a statue designed by T.B. Huxley-Jones of Helios, the Greek god of the sun, to symbolise the radiation of television around the world. At the foot of the statue were two reclining figures, symbolising sound and vision, the components of television. It was originally a fountain, but owing to the building's unique shape it was too noisy for the staff in the overlooking offices, and there were problems with <b>water</b> <b>leakage</b> into the videotape area directly beneath.

2500|$|The {{problem of}} leaks is further aggravated {{by the fact}} that many of them involve {{corrosive}} salt water. This is caused by the proximity of Boston Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean, causing a mix of salt and fresh water leaks in the tunnel. The situation is made worse by road salt spread in the tunnel to melt ice during freezing weather, or brought in by vehicles passing through. Salt water and salt spray are well-known issues that must be dealt with in any marine environment. It has been reported that [...] "hundreds of thousands of gallons of salt water are pumped out monthly" [...] in the Big Dig, and a map has been prepared showing [...] "hot spots" [...] where <b>water</b> <b>leakage</b> is especially serious. Salt-accelerated corrosion has caused ceiling light fixtures to fail (see below), but can also cause rapid deterioration of embedded rebar and other structural steel reinforcements holding the tunnel walls and ceiling in place.|$|E

[...] Originally the Cockle had a shallow triangular fin and rudder, but this was later extended upwards to a curved and slightly pointed profile which more than doubled the area, to cope better with single-engine flying. A tube ran transversely across the hull just above the main step, into which the axle of a pair of ground-handling wheels could be inserted.|$|E

2500|$|Since 5 November, {{there has}} been a {{shortage}} of chlorine for water treatment due to Israeli blockades, increasing the risk of outbreak of water diseases. On 27 December, Israeli airstrikes extensively damaged two water wells, rendering a population of 30,000 Palestinians without water. On 2 January, airstrikes in the al-Mughraqa area damaged a main drinking water pipe, cutting off water supplies to 30,000 people in the Nuseirat Camp. The UN sums the situation that as of 2 January, 250,000 people in Gaza City and northern Gaza are without water supply; seven water wells were seriously damaged and cannot be repaired due to bombardments. As of 4 January, and as reported by the Palestinian Coastal Municipality Water Utility (CMWU) throughout the UN reports, 70% of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population have no access to water, in particular in Gaza City and northern Gaza. As of 6 January, 800,000 Palestinians have no access to water, and those who still enjoy water access face problems in purifying such water as well as risking additional danger of contamination due to waste <b>water</b> <b>leakage.</b> This situation lasts in the third week of the attacks where 500,000 Palestinians still have no access to running water, another 500,000 receive water for four to six hours only every five to seven days, and the rest receive water for four to six hours every two or three days. Five days after the unilateral lull, one fifth of the Gaza strip 1.5 million population has no direct access to drinking water and currently depends on water purchased from private suppliers. As of [...] 26, 8 January days after the unilateral ceasefire, at least 70% of the water system is functioning, although {{this does not mean that}} everyone is receiving water due to localized damage. By 5 February, a month and 8 days since the beginning of the Israeli attacks, the CMWU reports that 50 percent of Gaza's 1.5 million population receives running water for 6–8 hours every second day; 30 percent of the population receives running water every third day; and ten percent of the population receives water every five days. Ten percent of the population does not receive running water and depends on tankered water. As of 9 February, the CMWU reports that 50,000 people do not have access to water and an additional 150,000-200,000 receive water every 5 or 6 days. According to the World Health Organization guidelines, 80% of drinking water in Gaza is not currently safe for human consumption.
