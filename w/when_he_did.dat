The NBO was incorporated in 1999, but Paul allowed it to be dissolved in 2000 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not file the required paperwork with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office. He later recreated the board in 2005, but it was again dissolved in 2011.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015 {{the team}} {{confirmed}} that Riis {{had been removed}} from active duty due to differences between Riis and Tinkov. Media reports had initially indicated that Riis had been suspended <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not appear at the 2015 Milan–San Remo as planned, and that this was due to a disappointing start to the season for the team. His departure from the team was officially announced on 29 March.|$|E

5|$|John {{initially}} attended local schools. When he was aged 10, {{his family}} scraped together {{the money to}} send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston. Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university. Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> remarking to his secretary Joseph Pope that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{played only}} three {{seasons with the}} 49ers. Like Tittle, Johnson had a late-blooming career; his most {{productive}} years came with the Pittsburgh Steelers, well after his time in San Francisco. He remains the oldest player to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so in 1964 at age 35. He retired in 1966 with the third most career rushing yards in the NFL. Johnson's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame came in 1987, and was an honor that contemporaries felt was fifteen years overdue.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1952, Williams was {{dismissed}} from the Grand Ole Opry for habitual drunkenness and missing shows. He returned to Shreveport, Louisiana {{to perform in}} KWKH and WBAM shows and in the Louisiana Hayride, for which he toured again. His performances were acclaimed when he was sober, but {{despite the efforts of}} his work associates to get him to shows sober, his abuse of alcohol resulted in occasions <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not appear or his performances were poor. In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.|$|E

And the servant does ill that ails him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it, and nothing Allāh creates for him of good is more {{beneficial}} for him than that. That {{is because the}} servant, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> the good that gladdens him, has high expectations through it, and he sees that he has abundance beyond others apart from him; {{and it may be}} that Allāh will pull it down, and pull down many actions along with it. And indeed, the servant does an act of ill that ails him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it, and Allāh may bring about in him a dread and shame (wajal) until he meets Allāh most high, all the while the fear of it is in his awe, down in his very gut.|$|R
5|$|Over the years, Stevens held several {{important}} NWP leadership positions, including Legislative Chairman and membership {{on the executive}} committee. In 1920, Alva Belmont {{was elected president of}} the NWP and Stevens served as Belmont’s personal assistant, even writing Belmont's autobiography. Belmont and Steven's relationship was contentious, but the younger Stevens accepted years of control by Belmont over many of her personal actions. Traveling to Europe with Belmont for work of the NWP, Belmont insisted that Steven's fiance could not join them and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> Belmont removed to France without Stevens.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a {{haberdashery}} together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt {{during the recession}} of 1921. Truman did not pay off {{the last of the}} debts from that venture until 1934, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so {{with the aid of a}} political supporter. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.|$|E

5|$|Tittle was {{the fourth}} player to throw seven {{touchdown}} passes in a game, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so in 1962 against the Redskins. He followed Sid Luckman (1943), Adrian Burk (1954), and George Blanda (1961). The feat has since been equaled by four more players: Joe Kapp (1969), Peyton Manning (2013), Nick Foles (2013), and Drew Brees (2015). Tittle, Manning and Foles did it without an interception. His 36 touchdown passes in 1963 set a record which stood for over two decades until it was surpassed by Dan Marino in 1984; as of 2016 it remains a Giants franchise record.|$|E
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E
5|$|Anbe Vaa {{marked the}} first time AVM Productions had written a script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already {{completed}} script. AVM Productions' founder A. V. Meiyappan's son M. Saravanan, one of the film's producers, recalled in 2013 that, as a fan of M. G. Ramachandran, it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner. For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.|$|E

5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs made up for his {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and staying on his feet. Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and reluctance to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the suggestion that he didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent crosser of the ball <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> venture forward. He scored his first professional goal during his 59th game. By comparison, Gibbs' long-term successor at right-back, Lloyd Doyley, scored his first professional goal on his 269th appearance.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{exclusive}} {{access to the}} King provoked {{several members of the}} nobility, and in 1307 the King was again forced to send him into exile. During this absence he served as the King's Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Edward managed to negotiate a deal with the opposition, however, and Gaveston returned the next year. Upon his return his behaviour became even more offensive, and by the Ordinances of 1311 it was decided that Gaveston should be exiled for a third time, to suffer outlawry if he returned. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> return in 1312, he was hunted down and executed by a group of magnates led by Thomas of Lancaster and Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick.|$|E
5|$|In 1979 Tonelli {{failed to}} defend his US title in the 100m backstroke, but managed third in the event at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in his final year of university. In his four years at Alabama, he was an eight-time All-American in the 100m and 200m backstroke. His triumph at the NCAA Championships came amid the {{backdrop}} of a teammate's death in a waterskiing accident during a social event {{with a group of}} fellow swimmers. Tonelli was driving the powerboat <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a U-turn that resulted in his teammate being thrown off his skis and into the water.

5|$|Kershaw {{was drafted}} seventh {{overall in the}} 2006 MLB draft. He {{worked his way through}} the Dodgers' farm system in just one full season, and reached the majors at 20 years old. When he debuted in 2008, he was the {{youngest}} player in MLB, a title he held for one full year. In 2011, he won the pitching Triple Crown and the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the youngest pitcher to accomplish either of these feats since Dwight Gooden in 1985. Kershaw pitched a no-hitter on June 18, 2014, becoming the 22nd Dodger to do so. Being a left-handed strikeout pitcher and playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kershaw has often been compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. He became the first pitcher in history to lead MLB in ERA for four consecutive years <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so in the 2011 through 2014 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Perry {{became the}} first player to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards in {{consecutive}} seasons, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so in 1953 and 1954. His 1,018 yards rushing in 1953 and 1,049 in 1954 were the third and second highest totals for a single season in the NFL, respectively, behind only Steve Van Buren's 1,146 yards in 1949. He led the league in carries, rushing yards, rushing yards per game, and yards from scrimmage in both seasons. His ten rushing touchdowns and 13 total touchdowns in 1953 were both the most in the NFL that year. Perry, McElhenny, and Tittle comprised the offensive backfield of that year's Pro Bowl. The Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), and New York Daily News each named Perry their first-team All-Pro fullback. Morabito awarded Perry an extra five dollars for every yard he gained in 1953, for a total bonus of $5,090.|$|E
