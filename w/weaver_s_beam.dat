40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} {{the potential benefits of}} applying two embodiments of adaptive lighting to the U. S. and European low-beam patterns: curve lighting that involves shifting the beam horizontally into the curve, and motorway lighting that involves shifting the beam vertically upward. The curve lighting simulations paired 80 -m radius left and right curves with a horizontal beam shift of 15 °, and 240 -m radius curves with a shift of 10 °. The motorway lighting simulations involved upward aim shifts of 0. 25 ° and 0. 5 °. For both curve and motorway lighting, changes in both visibility and glare illuminance were considered. Marketweighted model year 2000 U. <b>S.</b> and European <b>beam</b> patterns were used. We conclude that curve lighting, as simulated here, would substantially improve seeing performance on curves for both types of beams. On left curves (but not on right curves) there would be an increase in disability glare for oncoming traffic. No major discomfort glare problems would be expected. Although the shifted U. <b>S.</b> <b>beams</b> were found to perform slightly better overall than the shifted European beams, the main difference in performance is between the shifted and nominally aimed beams. Motorway lighting, as simulated here, would also substantially improve seeing performance, with the benefits already present at an upward shift of 0. 25 °. Because the increases in glare illuminance would be minor, and because motorways often incorporate median barriers or wide separations between lanes of opposing traffic, we do not expect substantial problems with increased glare. The European beams benefit more from this embodiment of motorway lighting than do the U. <b>S.</b> <b>beams.</b> (This is the case because under nominal aim the European beams provide less visibility illuminance and their vertical gradient is steeper.) Nevertheless, the nominally aimed U. <b>S.</b> <b>beams</b> tend to outperform the European beams shifted upward 0. 25 °...|$|R
40|$|Steinmanella Crickmay (Bivalvia, Trigonioidea) is an abundantly {{recorded}} genus {{from the}} Tithonian-Barremian of the Neuquén Basin, Argentina. A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (<b>Weaver),</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis (Burckhardt) and <b>S.</b> quintucoensis (<b>Weaver).</b> <b>S.</b> quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank ribs. S. neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae. S. curacoensis has an oval outline, an inflated shell, poorly marked carinae and numerous flank ribs. S. quintucoensis was recorded in all the studied localities and is dominant at Cerrito de la Ventana. S. neuquensis and S. curacoensis were found only in Cerrito de la Ventana and Puerta Curaco. In the latter, S. curacoensis dominates the assemblage, while S. neuquensis is in both localities represented by a few specimens. All species are commonly found in black shales {{as well as in}} calcareous shales, along with other bivalves and ammonoids, and preservation is quite variable, some specimens being highly weathered (particularly in Puerta Curaco) while others remain almost pristine. Some were collected from thin storm-deposited packstones in Cerrito de la Ventana.

These cracks propagated towards the right end of tensile laminate, followed by rupture of end anchorage which occurred along the right shear span of the beam, and resulted in complete debonding of tensile CFRP laminate and the buckling of compressive CFRP laminate.|$|R
