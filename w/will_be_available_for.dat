25|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{renewable}} power {{sources such as}} wind and solar, geothermal energy is dispatchable, meaning that it is both available whenever needed, and can quickly adjust output to match demand. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), {{of all types of}} new electrical generation plants, geothermal generators have the highest capacity factor, a measure of how much power a facility actually generates as a percent of its maximum capacity. The EIA rates new geothermal plants as having a 92% capacity factor, comparable to those of nuclear (90%), and higher than gas (87%), or coal (85%), and much higher than those of intermittent sources such as onshore wind (34%) or solar photovoltaic (25%). While the carrier medium for geothermal electricity (water) must be properly managed, the source of geothermal energy, the Earth's heat, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available,</b> <b>for</b> most intents and purposes, indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Support for {{programming}} languages is added {{by using a}} specific VSPackage called a Language Service. A language service defines various interfaces which the VSPackage implementation can implement to add support for various functionalities.

If the interface is implemented, the functionality <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> the language. Language services are implemented on a per-language basis. The implementations can reuse code from the parser or the compiler for the language. Language services can be implemented either in native code or managed code. For native code, either the native COM interfaces or the Babel Framework (part of Visual Studio SDK) can be used. For managed code, the MPF includes wrappers for writing managed language services.|$|E
