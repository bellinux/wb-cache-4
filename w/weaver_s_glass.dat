40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>glass</b> {{industry}} {{is comprised of}} four primary industry segments [...] flat glass, container glass, specialty glass, and fiberglass [...] which together consume $ 1. 6 billion in energy annually. On average, energy costs in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>glass</b> industry account for around 14 percent of total glass production costs. Energy efficiency improvement is an important way to reduce these costs and to increase predictable earnings, especially in times of high energy price volatility. There is a variety of opportunities available at individual plants in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>glass</b> industry to reduce energy consumption in a cost-effective manner. This Energy Guide discusses energy efficiency practices and energy-efficient technologies that can be implemented at the component, process, system, and organizational levels. A discussion of the trends, structure, and energy consumption characteristics of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>glass</b> {{industry is}} provided along {{with a description of}} the major process steps in glass manufacturing. Expected savings in energy and energy-related costs are given for many energy efficiency measures, based on case study data from real-world applications in glass production facilities and related industries worldwide. Typical measure payback periods and references to further information in the technical literature are also provided, when available. The information in this Energy Guide is intended to help energy and plant managers in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>glass</b> industry reduce energy consumption in a cost-effective manner while maintaining the quality of products manufactured. Further research on the economics of the measures [...] as well on as their applicability to different production practices [...] is needed to assess potential implementation of selected technologies at individual plants...|$|R
40|$|Graphite-epoxy panels with <b>S</b> <b>glass</b> {{buffer strips}} {{were tested in}} tension and shear to measure their {{residual}} strengths with crack-like damage. The buffer strips were regularly spaced narrow strips of continuous <b>S</b> <b>glass.</b> Panels were made with a uniweave graphite cloth where the <b>S</b> <b>glass</b> buffer material was woven directly into the cloth. Panels were made with different width and thickness buffer strips. The panels were loaded to failure while remote strain, strain {{at the end of}} the slit, and crack opening displacement were monitoring. The notched region and nearby buffer strips were radiographed periodically to reveal crack growth and damage. Except for panels with short slits, the buffer strips arrested the propagating crack. The strength (or failing strain) of the panels was significantly higher than the strength of all-graphite panels with the same length slit. Panels with wide, thick buffer strips were stronger than panels with thin, narrow buffer strips. A shear-lag model predicted the failing strength of tension panels with wide buffer strips accurately, but over-estimated the strength of the shear panels and the tension panels with narrow buffer strips...|$|R

A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (<b>Weaver),</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis (Burckhardt) and <b>S.</b> quintucoensis (<b>Weaver).</b> <b>S.</b> quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank ribs. S. neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae. S. curacoensis has an oval outline, an inflated shell, poorly marked carinae and numerous flank ribs. S. quintucoensis was recorded in all the studied localities and is dominant at Cerrito de la Ventana. S. neuquensis and S. curacoensis were found only in Cerrito de la Ventana and Puerta Curaco. In the latter, S. curacoensis dominates the assemblage, while S. neuquensis is in both localities represented by a few specimens. All species are commonly found in black shales {{as well as in}} calcareous shales, along with other bivalves and ammonoids, and preservation is quite variable, some specimens being highly weathered (particularly in Puerta Curaco) while others remain almost pristine.

40|$|Background: Infection {{constitutes}} {{the most important}} complication caused by biomaterials. Bioactive glasses have properties such as osteoconductivity and good restorability, {{some of which have}} revealed antibacterial effects. Therefore, these biomaterials are appropriate candidates for orthopedic and dental applications. The present study was conducted to analyze the antibacterial effect of bioactive glass nanoparticles. Methods: In this experimental study, 37 S and 58 <b>S</b> <b>glass</b> compositions were synthesized via sol-gel technique. Characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescent (XRF) were used for the prepared powders. The antibacterial activity of these compounds was studied using Escherichia coli as gram negative and Staphylococcus aureus as gram positive bacteria. The antibacterial effect of samples was evaluated at concentration of 25, 50 and 100 mg/ml. Results: The particle size of the samples was mainly less than 100 nm. The 37 <b>S</b> <b>glass</b> showed the highest antibacterial activity and the minimum bactericidal (MBC) at 25 mg/ml concentration against both bacteria. At broth concentrations below 100 mg/ml, 58 S showed no antibacterial activity; however, it completely eliminated Escherichia bacteria and reduced the growth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Conclusion: These bioactive glass nanopowders can be regarded as good candidates in orthopedic application for the treatment of bone and dental defects but need supplementary and more evaluation considering their antibacterial effect on two important bacteria...|$|R

(5) Assess the impact of product testing and certification programs on the industry. The U. <b>S.</b> <b>glass</b> industry is a $ 27 billion enterprise with both large producers and small firms playing pivotal roles in the industry. While most sectors of the glass industry have restructured and consolidated in the past 20 years, the industry still employs 150, 000 workers.
