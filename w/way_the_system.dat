5|$|Through {{the steady}} {{taxation}} of Edward III's reign, parliament – {{and in particular}} the Commons – gained political influence. A consensus emerged that in order for a tax to be just, the king had to prove its necessity, it had to be granted by the community of the realm, and it had to be to the benefit of that community. In addition to imposing taxes, parliament would also present petitions for redress of grievances to the king, most often concerning misgovernment by royal officials. This <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was beneficial for both parties. Through this process the commons, and the community they represented, became increasingly politically aware, and the foundation was laid for the particular English brand of constitutional monarchy.|$|E
5|$|The new route added several locks to the canal, making {{water supply}} {{problems}} more severe. Because of the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of locks work, water is lost {{from the upper}} part of a canal each time a vessel passes through. This is a particular issue for the pound between Bradford Lock at Bradford on Avon and the Bath Locks, where a series of locks need to be opened each time the gates are opened. Most lock gates are not watertight, therefore some water leaks from the higher levels of the canal to those lower down. The water has to be replaced, or eventually the upper levels of the canal would not hold enough water to be navigable. Canals are usually fed by diverting water from streams and rivers into the upper parts of the canal, but if no suitable source is available or sufficient, a pumping station, such as the one at Claverton, can be used to maintain the water level. Crofton Pumping Station was built to supply water to the summit pound of the canal, opening in 1810 but, unlike Claverton, was powered by steam.|$|E

25|$|After formation, a hypercycle reaches {{either an}} {{internal}} equilibrium or {{a state with}} oscillating concentrations of each type of chain I, but with the total concentration of all chains remaining constant. In this <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> consisting of all chains can be expressed as a single, integrated entity. During the formation of hypercycles, several {{of them could be}} present in comparable concentrations, but very soon, a selection of the hypercycle with the highest fitness value will take place. Here, the fitness value expresses the adaptation of the hypercycle to the environment, and the selection based on it is very sharp. After one hypercycle wins the competition, it is very unlikely that another one could take its place, even if the new hypercycle would be more efficient than the winner. Usually, even large fluctuations in the numbers of internal species cannot weaken the hypercycle enough to destroy it. In the case of a hypercycle, we can speak of one-for-ever selection, which is responsible for the existence of a unique translation code and a particular chirality.|$|E

500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, the {{nomination}} was decided by delegates under the Democratic Party's rules, so the candidates campaigned {{to maximize their}} delegate advantage. If {{the nomination}} were decided by popular vote, they likely would have campaigned differently, in order to run up the vote in populous states like New York and Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{has said that the}} popular vote should have no effect under the current rules: [...] "It’s a delegate race. The <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> works is that the delegates choose the nominee." [...] Obama's chief strategist suggested that the Clinton campaign's focus on the popular vote was a distraction tactic: [...] "When they started off, it was all about delegates.... Now that we have more delegates, it’s all about the popular vote. And if that does not work out, they will probably challenge us to a game of cribbage to choose the nominee." [...] Nevertheless, polls have shown that a plurality of Democrats think superdelegates should consider the popular vote when deciding which candidate to support.|$|E
