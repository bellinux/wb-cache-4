40|$|Monoculture and {{intercropping}} {{systems are}} techniques of controlling weeds in technical culture (ecology). Change in cropping system from monoculture to intercropping {{may affect the}} growth of weed species which cause different interaction between weed and plant competition. This research aimed to determine {{the composition of the}} weed community on the cultivation of monoculture and intercropping systems between maize, peanuts and cowpea. Treatment tested were G 0 = without crops (weedy), G 1 = maize <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 80 x 25 cm, G 2 = maize <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 100 x 25 cm, G 3 = maize <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 80 x 25 cm (+ 3 row of peanut), G 4 = maize <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 100 x 25 cm (+ 4 row of peanut), G 5 = maize <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 80 x 25 cm (+ 3 row of cowpea), G 6 = maize <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 100 x 25 cm (+ 4 row of cowpea), G 7 = peanut <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 25 x 25 cm, and G 8 = cowpea <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 25 x 25 cm. The results showed that based on Sum Dominance Ratio (SDR) analysis, the weeds in this study consisted of 17 species, i. e. 11 species of broadleaf weeds, 3 species of sedges weeds, and 3 species of grasses weeds. The intercropping system of maize <b>with</b> <b>planting</b> distance of 100 x 25 cm (+ 4 rows of cowpea) gave lower weed communities than the other treatments. Coefficient Community (C) that ranged from 4. 54 to 14. 64 showed differences of weeds and weed communities when the coefficient was under 75 % or communities weed species had equality species in the community compared. Shannon-Wienner Index (H') showed the diversity of weed communities the H' value ranged between 1. 29 and 2. 18. Weed control in intercropping system with cowpea reduced weed dry weight. While intercropping systems of G 3, G 4, G 5 and G 6 suppressed weed dry weight by 15. 38, 27. 69, 55. 38, and 53. 85 % compared with G 2, respectively...|$|R

5|$|A {{proposed}} 1993 {{treatment of}} T. apollinea as a subspecies of Tephrosia purpurea noted some regional variations, <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> in the Eastern Desert of Egypt possibly producing smaller pods, leaves, and leaflets, and plants from oases having densely pubescent spreading hairs. Among the features they described as differentiating the apollinea subspecies from the nominate purpurea subspecies were that apollinea has somewhat longer pods (3.55 or sometimes 5.5cm, rather than 34cm), {{a wider range}} in the quantity of seeds per pod (generally 79, as low as 3, rather than generally 56, or sometimes 7), the pods being curved upwards rather than downwards, and leaflets having 9 rather than 7 lateral veins.|$|E
5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or {{continue to live}} in water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch fast-moving prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E

5|$|Botanists {{study how}} plants produce food {{and how to}} {{increase}} yields, for example through plant breeding, making their work important to mankind's ability to feed the world and provide food security for future generations. Botanists also study weeds, which are a considerable problem in agriculture, and the biology and control of plant pathogens in agriculture and natural ecosystems. Ethnobotany {{is the study of}} the relationships between plants and people. When applied to the investigation of historical plantâ€“people relationships ethnobotany may be referred to as archaeobotany or palaeoethnobotany. Some of the earliest plant-people relationships arose between the indigenous people of Canada in identifying edible plants from inedible plants. This relationship the indigenous people had <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> was recorded by ethnobotanists.|$|E
5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> that have a higher resilience to pests and diseases and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been {{identified}} as invasive species, ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for {{about a quarter of the}} total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. The type of foreign vegetation also varies, <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system.|$|E

5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and swale plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|Flowers {{have converged}} to take {{advantage}} of similar birds. Flowers compete for pollinators, and adaptations reduce unfavourable effects of this competition. The fact that birds can fly during inclement weather makes them more efficient pollinators where bees and other insects would be inactive. Ornithophily may have arisen for this reason in isolated environments with poor insect colonization or areas <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> which flower in the winter. Bird-pollinated flowers usually have higher volumes of nectar and higher sugar production than those pollinated by insects.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Sutorius eximius {{grow in the}} soil singly or {{scattered}} among leaf litter. A mycorrhizal species, the bolete has been recorded growing in association <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> from various genera, including Dicymbe, Dipterocarpus, Fagus, Hopea, Quercus, Shorea, and Tsuga. The species has been recorded from North America, Costa Rica, and Indonesia. In Costa Rica, where it usually associates with the endemic oaks Quercus seemannii and Q.copeyensis, the lilac-brown bolete can be locally abundant in the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera de Talamanca. Additional locations with collections {{that have not been}} confirmed by DNA analysis include Guyana, Japan, China. Although S.eximius has been reported from Thailand, molecular analysis of Thai collections suggests that they represent a distinct, as-yet unnamed species.|$|E

5|$|In 1882 Stowe {{purchased}} {{a plot of}} land in Mandarin on the St. Johns to build the Mandarin Church of Our Saviour, the dedication of which she attended. The windows of the church were installed by its benefactors. Calvin's health began to fade and in 1884 the Stowe family left Mandarin forever {{to spend the rest}} of their years in Hartford. He died two years later and Stowe asked to add a window in the Mandarin church in his memory, but it remained plain glass for 30 years. The church's parishioners remained so loyal to Stowe that they neglected to suggest an alternate plan for the window. Stowe declined into a childlike state after 1894, losing much of her memory but keeping her fascination <b>with</b> <b>plants</b> and flowers as she would wander Hartford exclaiming over those she came across.
