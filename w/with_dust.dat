5|$|Book XVI covers {{metals and}} rocks, {{starting}} <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> and earth, {{and moving on}} to gemstones of different colours, glass and mines. Metals include gold, silver, copper, iron, lead and electrum. Weights and measures end the book. Games with boards and dice are described.|$|E
5|$|Football is Chad's {{most popular}} sport. The country's {{national}} team is closely followed during international competitions and Chadian footballers have played for French teams. Basketball and freestyle wrestling are widely practiced, {{the latter in}} a form in which the wrestlers put on traditional animal hides and cover themselves <b>with</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared {{images of the}} dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> particles ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium milling {{operations}} produced {{large quantities}} of toxic cutting fluid contaminated with particles of plutonium and uranium. Thousands of 55-gallon drums of the waste were stored outside in an unprotected earthen area called the 903 pad storage area, where they corroded and leaked radionuclides over years into the soil and water. An estimated 5,000 gallons of plutonium-contaminated oil leached into the soil between 1964 and 1967. Portions of this waste, mixed <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> that composed Pad 903, became airborne in the heavy winds of the Front Range and contaminated offsite areas {{to the south and}} east.|$|E
5|$|The race's {{penultimate}} day {{of racing}} {{was scheduled to}} go from Bari to Naples. During the stage, Lucien Petit-Breton crashed {{and was forced to}} abandon the race. The route had the riders go through rough roads that were heavy <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> and occasional passed over streams, thus flooding the roads. The riders were also chase by enraged buffalo. All of those factors caused the riders to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples, in Pompeii with Alfredo Sivocci winning the day. The last stage ended back in Rome, where the race began. Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day. Bianchi's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|Winds can shape landforms, via {{a variety}} of aeolian {{processes}} such as the formation of fertile soils, such as loess, and by erosion. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> outbreaks have been assigned regional names {{in various parts of}} the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.|$|E
50|$|Delphinium scopulorum is heat {{tolerant}} {{and deer}} resistant. One must treat the mildew <b>with</b> <b>dusting</b> sulfur or mildew spray. It is recommended to cut spikes above foliage leaving the old stem {{of about one}} foot before the flowers fade out.|$|R
50|$|The {{forewings}} are pale ocherous, <b>with</b> brownish <b>dusting</b> and {{an irregular}} angulated creamy white fascia before the middle, {{as well as}} a faintly defined narrower acutely angulated fascia at two-thirds. The basal third of the wing is ocherous. The hindwings are yellowish white, <b>with</b> fuscous <b>dusting.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{design was}} adopted by an Act of Parliament in 1813, which {{permitted}} the commissioners to borrow £600,000 for building and construction. The street was intended to have commercial purposes and {{it was expected that}} a majority of the income would come from private capital. Nash took responsibility for design and valuation of all properties. Construction of the road resulted in demolishing numerous properties, disrupting trade and polluting the air <b>with</b> <b>dust.</b> Existing tenants had first offer to purchase leases on the new properties. The Treasury supported the proposal because, in the aftermath of the lengthy Napoleonic Wars, there was an urgent need for the government to create jobs. Government expenditure was low because the design relied heavily upon private developers, such as Nash himself. The buildings were to be let on 99-year leases, as was common at the time, and income could be recouped in the form of ground rent.|$|E

25|$|Grain-gas heating: Collisions at high densities between gas {{atoms and}} {{molecules}} <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> grains can transfer thermal energy. This {{is not important}} in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.|$|E
25|$|The surface {{composition}} of the northern ice cap in middle spring (after a winter's accumulation of seasonal dry ice) has been studied from orbit. The outer edges of the ice cap are contaminated <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> (0.15% by weight) and are mostly water ice. As one moves toward the pole, the surface water ice content decreases and is replaced by dry ice. The purity of the ice also increases. At the pole, the surface seasonal ice consists of essentially pure dry ice with little dust content and 30 parts per million of water ice.|$|E
25|$|That same month, 12 Hurricane Mk IIB Trops were {{supplied}} to the Dutch forces on Java. <b>With</b> <b>dust</b> filters removed and fuel and ammo load in wings halved, these {{were able to}} stay in a turn with the Oscars they fought. After Java was invaded, some of the New Zealand pilots were evacuated by sea to Australia. One aircraft which had not been assembled, was transferred to the RAAF, becoming the only Hurricane to see service in Australia, in training and other non-combat units.|$|E

25|$|Trial revenue {{services}} commenced in February 1946 on the Bergen Line from Oslo to Geilo. After a month {{there were}} {{issues with the}} pinions, causing them {{to have to be}} replaced. The unit continued on the Geilo service until September. By then the roller bearings in the prime mover's big ends were sufficiently weakened that they were causing engines to malfunction. Low standards caused by wartime manufacturing combined <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> and rust in the engines through four years of storage required a major clean-up of the prime movers before they could be returned to service. The prime movers were manufactured in 1939 and their big ends had to be replaced with sleve bearings to improve reliability.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that it is}} a planet, the {{geography}} of Mars varies considerably. However, the dichotomy of Martian topography is striking: northern plains flattened by lava flows contrast with the southern highlands, pitted and cratered by ancient impacts. The surface of Mars as seen from Earth is consequently divided into two kinds of areas, with differing albedo. The paler plains covered <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> and sand rich in reddish iron oxides were once thought of as Martian 'continents' and given names like Arabia Terra (land of Arabia) or Amazonis Planitia (Amazonian plain). The dark features were thought to be seas, hence their names Mare Erythraeum, Mare Sirenum and Aurorae Sinus. The largest dark feature seen from Earth is Syrtis Major Planum.|$|E
25|$|Health {{problems}} in miners {{were the result}} of working in poor air, filled <b>with</b> <b>dust</b> from blasting, and from dampness. Although the miners lived nearly as long {{as the rest of the}} local population, they aged more quickly. The worst affected at Greenside were those who had come from the poorly ventilated mines on Alston Moor. The smelters suffered lead poisoning from inhaling lead fumes at the furnaces. The miners ran their own insurance scheme, paying a shilling a quarter to either the Oddfellows Lodge (founded June 1839) or the Mechanics Lodge (founded 1869). By the 1930s these were paying 12 shillings a week to men unable to work through sickness or accident.|$|E
