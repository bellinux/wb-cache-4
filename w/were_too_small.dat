5|$|In the past, the Suffolk {{was often}} criticised for its poor feet, having hooves that <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> for its body mass.

5|$|Although the Poor Law Amendment Act did not ban {{all forms}} of outdoor relief, it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law {{authorities}} except in a workhouse. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were {{to be built in}} every parish and, if parishes <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small,</b> parishes could group together to form Workhouse Unions. The Poor Law Commissioners were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.|$|E

Bierman remained on the staff for three seasons before he left to become head coach at Mississippi A. In 1924, Tulane set a new school record for wins and finished with an 8–1 record. The following season, the Green Wave bested the prior year's mark and posted a 9–0–1 record. School officials declined an invitation to face Washington in the Rose Bowl, because they believed the Tulane players <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small.</b> Indiana University attempted to hire Shaughnessy after his undefeated season, but he instead chose to sign a ten-year extension with Tulane.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Bayern {{purchased}} {{land near}} the Allianz Arena {{with the purpose}} of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started, after overcoming internal resistance. The main reasons for the project were that the existing facilities <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> and that the club, while very successful at senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level. The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.|$|E
5|$|In April 1916 a German battlecruiser {{squadron}} with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded {{the coastal}} ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main {{aim of the}} raid was to entice out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to intervene if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to intervene so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.|$|E

5|$|Militarily, the French {{utilized}} large column formations {{against the}} rebels, a tactic which the French chief-of-staff of the Army of the Levant, General André-Gaston Prételat, {{found to be}} generally ineffective against small mobile rebel units. Instead, he believed the optimal way to defeat the rebels was to recruit local militias who would share the two main strengths of the rebels: knowledge of the terrain and high mobility. However, the Syrian gendarmerie conscripted by the French military could not defeat the rebels because they <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> numerically, and not entirely reliable in battles against fellow locals.|$|E
5|$|The stave churches {{owe their}} {{longevity}} to architectural innovations that protected these large, complex wooden structures against water rot, precipitation, wind, and extreme temperatures. Most {{important was the}} introduction of massive sills underneath the staves (posts) {{to prevent them from}} rotting. Over the two centuries of stave church construction, this building type evolved to an advanced art and science. After the Reformation, however, no new stave churches were built. New churches were mainly of stone or horizontal log buildings with notched corners. Most old stave churches disappeared because of redundancy, neglect or deterioration, or because they <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to accommodate larger congregations, and too impractical according to later standards.|$|E
5|$|A fresh wave of {{concerns}} about France followed in the 1880s, accompanied {{by the introduction of}} still more powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation. An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E

5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{only two}} Catholic churches existed in Moscow: the Saint Louis des Français church for the French {{population}} and the St. Peter and Paul church for the Polish parishioners. As the congregation for the Polish church had increased to around 30,000 members, the existing buildings <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small.</b> Following the submission of a petition to the Governor-General of Moscow, the local council voted for a new church in 1894. Construction of a new church was permitted with several conditions, including two pertinent to the building site: the structure was to be built away from the old city centre, and was not to be located in the vicinity of any Orthodox sacred sites.|$|E

A further two small raids were attempted in January and one on February2, but none of five aircraft dispatched reached the islands and four were shot down. In early February the 6thAir Army's parent headquarters, the General Defense Command (GDC), reached {{the conclusion that the}} raiding forces being dispatched against the American bomber bases <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>small</b> to be effective.
