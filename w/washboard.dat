40|$|The aims of {{the thesis}} were to study how <b>washboarding</b> (the {{undulations}} present {{on the surface of}} corrugated cardboard used to manufacture boxes) relates to the mechanical properties of paper and the board manufacturing conditions and to examine the impact of <b>washboarding</b> upon the structural integrity and printability of corrugated cardboard packaging. A digital image profilometry technique was developed to measure the <b>washboarding</b> profiles of corrugated board. This technique was used to measure the <b>washboarding</b> depth and profiles for a range of corrugated boards, some constructed manually and some machine manufactured. This enabled a study into how a change in the mechanical properties of paper and glue affect <b>washboarding</b> depth. The effect that the speed of machine manufacturing had upon the degree of <b>washboarding</b> was also determined. A study of how environmental conditions affect <b>washboarding</b> geometry was undertaken. The effects of the extent of <b>washboarding</b> upon a range of board performance measures were tested empirically and modelled using Finite Element Analysis. These were edgewise compression testing (ECT), three-point bend, and MD-Shear (an Amcor Ltd. proprietary test). A method was developed to measure full-tone print coverage of corrugated board and was used to study how <b>washboarding</b> affects the printing quality of corrugated board...|$|R
50|$|<b>Washboarding</b> or {{corrugation}} is {{the occurrence}} of periodic, transverse ripples in the surface of gravel and dirt roads. <b>Washboarding</b> occurs in dry, granular road material with repeated traffic, traveling at speeds above 5 mi/h km/h. <b>Washboarding</b> creates an uncomfortable ride for the occupants of traversing vehicles and hazardous driving conditions for vehicles that travel too fast to maintain traction and control.|$|R
50|$|Several {{articles}} addressing real-life <b>washboarding</b> {{on roads}} cite South Dakota Local Transportation Assistance Program (LTAP) Special Bulletin #29, “Dealing with Washboarding,” by Ken Skorseth. These sources attribute <b>washboarding</b> to three causes: dry granular materials, vehicle speeds, {{and the quality}} of the granular material. Other cited causes include vehicle speed, traffic volume, and hard acceleration or braking. Also, the source claims that light vehicles have a bigger effect on producing <b>washboarding</b> than heavy trucks.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an on-line method for detecting <b>washboarding</b> generated in bandsaws. It uses a parameter {{based on the}} shape of sawing force amplitude distributions. The curve of the probability density function of the parallel sawing force amplitude obeyed a normal distribution for the normal sawn surface, but it changed to an M-shaped distribution when <b>washboarding</b> appeared on the sawn surface of the workpiece. The curve of probability density function of the normal sawing force amplitude obeyed the normal distribution for any sawn surface investigated. The workpiece including a knot did not influence use of the parameter for detecting the appearance of <b>washboarding.</b>|$|R

25|$|The lively Memphis blues style, which {{developed}} in the 1920s and 1930s near Memphis, Tennessee, was influenced by jug bands such as the Memphis Jug Band or the Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers. Performers such as Frank Stokes, Sleepy John Estes, Robert Wilkins, Joe McCoy, Casey Bill Weldon and Memphis Minnie {{used a variety of}} unusual instruments such as <b>washboard,</b> fiddle, kazoo or mandolin. Memphis Minnie was famous for her virtuoso guitar style. Pianist Memphis Slim began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements. Many blues musicians based in Memphis moved to Chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Washboarding</b> or {{corrugation}} {{of roads}} comprises {{a series of}} ripples, which occur {{with the passage of}} wheels rolling over unpaved roads at speeds sufficient to cause bouncing of the wheel on the initially unrippled surface. Most studies of <b>washboarding</b> pertain to granular materials, including sand and gravel. However, other work suggests that the phenomenon may occur in material, which has some binding of particles, e.g. clayey soils.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, zydeco {{evolved from the}} music of the Creoles in {{southwest}} and south central Louisiana. At an earlier period, Creole and Cajun music were more similar, but after World War II, this regional French music evolved into a distinct expression of the Creoles, Louisianians whose shared languages and culture transcend race. Along with the accordion, the second main instrument in a zydeco group is a corrugated metal <b>washboard,</b> called a Zydeco Rubboard or frottoir. They made the music contemporary by adding electrical instruments (guitar and bass), keyboards, drumkit and even sometimes horns. The Creole Zydeco music of Grammy winning artists Queen Ida Guillory, Clifton Chenier, Rockin' Sidney Simien, Buckwheat Zydeco and Terrance Simien remain some of the most internationally recognized zydeco music. John Delafose, Andrus Espree (aka Beau Jocque), Boozoo Chavis, Rosie Ledet, Chubby Carrier, Canray Fontenot, Amédé Ardoin, Rockin' Dopsie, Geno Delafose, Nathan Williams, Keith Frank, Chris Ardoin, Cedric Watson and Jeffery Broussard are also other well known zydeco musicians.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco was popular, {{both for}} {{personal}} use, and for trading with Indians and other pioneers. Each person brought {{at least two}} changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A <b>washboard</b> and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred {{once or twice a}} month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel. Most wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. The wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.|$|E

500|$|Lennon and Griffiths {{decided to}} form a skiffle group in November 1956. This initial line-up {{consisted}} of Lennon and Griffiths on guitars, and school friends Pete Shotton and Bill Smith on <b>washboard</b> and tea chest bass, respectively. The group, initially called the Blackjacks, quickly changed their name to the Quarrymen. Both Lennon and Shotton have been credited with coining the name Quarrymen after a line in their school's song: [...] "Quarrymen, old before our birth. Straining each muscle and sinew". The choice of name was tongue-in-cheek as Lennon regarded the reference in the school song to [...] "straining each muscle and sinew" [...] as risible. Smith's tenure in the band was extremely short, and was replaced in quick succession by Nigel Walley, Ivan Vaughan, and Len Garry throughout late 1956 and early 1957. Also during this period, drummer Colin Hanton and banjo player Rod Davis joined the group. This group of Lennon, Griffiths, Shotton, Garry, Hanton, and Davis formed the first stable line-up of the group.|$|E

[...] The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as [...] "Rock Island Line" [...] and [...] "Walking Cane", with Starkey raking a thimble across a <b>washboard,</b> creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools.
