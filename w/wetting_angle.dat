[...] Modern ski bases often are made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Kuzmin asserts that UHMWPE is non-porous and can hold neither wax nor water, {{so there is no}} possibility for filling pores; furthermore, he asserts that UHMWPE is very hydrophobic, which means that wet snow does not appreciably retard the ski and that glide wax offers little additional ability to repel water. He notes that clear bases are more durable and hydrophobic than those with carbon content. The same author asserts that texture is more important than surface chemistry for creating the optimum balance between a running surface that's too dry (not slippery enough) and too wet (ski subject to suction forces). In warm, moist snow, texture can help break the retarding capillary attraction between the ski base and the snow. Giesbrecht agrees that low <b>wetting</b> <b>angle</b> of the ski base is key and also emphasizes the importance of the degree of surface roughness at the micrometre scale as a function of snow temperature—cold snow favoring a smoother surface and wetter, warmer snow favoring a textured surface.|$|E

5000|$|Contact angle, or <b>wetting</b> <b>angle,</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} parameter in real systems where perfect wetting ( [...] = 0o) is hardly ever achieved. The Young equation provides reasoning for contact angle involvement in capillary condensation. The Young Equation explains that the surface tension between the liquid and vapor phases is scaled to the cosine of the contact angle. As shown in the figure to the right, the contact angle between a condensed liquid and the inner wall of a capillary can affect the radius of curvature a great deal. For this reason, contact angle is coupled inherently to the curvature term of the Kelvin equation. As the contact angle increases, the radius of curvature will increase as well. This is to say that a system with perfect wetting will exhibit a larger amount of liquid in its pores than a system with non-perfect wetting ( [...] > 0o). Also, in systems where [...] = 0o the radius of curvature is equal to the capillary radius. [...] Due to these complications caused by contact angle, scientific studies are often designed to assume [...] = 0o.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technique}} {{is closely related}} to using gas adsorption to measure pore sizes, but uses the Gibbs-Thomson equation rather than the Kelvin equation. They are both particular cases of the Gibbs Equations of Josiah Willard Gibbs: the Kelvin equation is the constant temperature case, and the Gibbs-Thomson equation is the constant pressure case.This behaviour {{is closely related to}} the capillary effect and both are due to the change in bulk free energy caused by the curvature of an interfacial surface under tension.The original equation only applies to isolated particles, but with the addition of surface interaction terms (usually expressed in terms of the contact <b>wetting</b> <b>angle)</b> can be modified to apply to liquids and their crystals in porous media. As such it has given rise to various related techniques for measuring pore size distributions. (See Thermoporometry and Cryoporometry.)The Gibbs-Thomson effect lowers both melting and freezing point, and also raises boiling point. However, simple cooling of an all-liquid sample usually leads to a state of non-equilibrium super cooling and only eventual non-equilibrium freezing. To obtain a measurement of the equilibrium freezing event, it is necessary to first cool enough to freeze a sample with excess liquid outside the pores, then warm the sample until the liquid in the pores is all melted, but the bulk material is still frozen. Then, on re-cooling the equilibrium freezing event can be measured, as the external ice will then grow into the pores.This is in effect an [...] "ice intrusion" [...] measurement (cf. mercury intrusion), and as such in part may provide information on pore throat properties. The melting event can be expected to provide more accurate information on the pore body.|$|E

Since deformations of this kind will occur regularly when soils are tilled or wheeled with machinery the question was raised how such events would change soil capillary properties. Circular capillaries with a concave inner surface were compared to the ones with a convex inner surface. They were formed by the fixing of either three or four rods with circular diameter together.
