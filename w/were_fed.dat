5|$|A {{number of}} {{preclinical}} {{studies have demonstrated}} inhibitory effects of MFGM against several pathogens. Both whole bovine MFGM and its extracted lipid components were found to exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of rotavirus infectivity in vitro. Antibacterial effects of MFGM have included decreased gastric colonization and inflammation after H. pylori infection in mice; inhibition of shiga toxin gene expression by E. coli O157:H7; and decreased colonization and translocation of L. monocytogenes. Mice that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> prophylactically with bovine whey glycoprotein fraction, including MFGM proteins, did not develop diarrhea after exposure to rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} that they <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> {{a variety of}} foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that the children were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, did show love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
5|$|By {{signing the}} Treaty of Utrecht, King Louis XIV of France {{recognised}} the Hanoverian succession in Britain. Nevertheless, gossip that Anne and her ministers favoured {{the succession of}} her half-brother rather than the Hanoverians continued, despite Anne's denials in public and in private. The rumours <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> by her consistent refusals to permit any of the Hanoverians to visit or move to England, and by the intrigues of Harley and the Tory Secretary of State Lord Bolingbroke, who were in separate and secret discussions with her half-brother about a possible Stuart restoration until early 1714.|$|E
50|$|Pollen can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> {{from outside}} or inside the hive. When pollen or a pollen {{supplement}} <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> it can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> as a powder, granules or in pattie form. Pollen feeders are usually {{used at the}} beginning of the brood rearing season.|$|R

5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how the young <b>were</b> <b>fed,</b> but related pigeons provide crop milk. Contemporary depictions show a large crop, which was {{probably}} used to add space for food storage and to produce crop milk. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the dodo and the solitaire was limited by the amount of crop milk they could produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|MAR {{operated}} in two modes, surveillance, and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5seconds. Returns <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> into systems that automatically extracted {{the range and}} velocity, and if the return was deemed interesting, the system automatically began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns {{in an effort to}} accurately determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that would fall outside its area.|$|E

5|$|Most French {{prisoners of}} war were not held in camps {{for most of the}} war, but instead, over 93 percent of French {{prisoners of war}} lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under the terms of the Geneva Convention NCOs were, like officers, {{exempted}} from work during captivity, but Germans often forced them to work. Workers <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} {{hundreds}} sent to hospital with malaria, many died, many recovered in hospital but later suffered a relapse {{and went to}} hospital again, many men were invalided home {{as a result of}} malaria, with their health badly undermined.With so many men sick amongst the British Empire forces, it became common for one man to be placed in charge of eight horses. At this time, the horses <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> newly threshed barley, which resulted in the deaths of 15 horses in Chaytor's Force, while a further 160 became seriously ill.|$|E
5|$|Piglets that <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with {{a formula}} {{containing}} milk phospholipids and gangliosides to mimic levels in human milk made choices more rapidly and with fewer errors in a spatial T-maze cognitive test compared to controls, implying improved spatial learning. Similarly, Vickers et al. (2009) demonstrated that administration of complex milk lipids to rats from postnatal day 10 through adulthood (day 80) led to {{significant improvements in}} learning and memory tasks compared to control animals. Conversely, a study of complex milk lipid supplementation to pregnant mice {{did not have an}} effect on cognitive tasks in their offspring.|$|E

5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a sharp decline in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|The {{experimental}} potatoes {{had been}} transformed with the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree Red potatoes as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin. Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.|$|E

Witnesses from across the Savannah River in South Carolina reported seeing flames shoot up several stories high. There were 112 employees on-site at the time. The explosion occurred {{in the center of the}} refinery, where bagging and storage facilities <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> completed product by a network of elevators and conveyor belts. Many of the buildings here were six to eight stories high with narrow gaps in between.|$|E

5|$|Written {{records of}} premastication {{have been found}} in Ancient Egypt, though the {{practice}} likely extends back into prehistoric times to non-human ancestors. For instance, in the Ancient Egyptian Ebers medical papyrus, a mother was instructed to give a medical remedy to a child through premastication. In the fifth century A.D. Roman culture, premastication of infants' food by caretakers was also common, though the lack of sanitation along with the practice contributed to infant mortality. Infants in Medieval Europe <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> an assortment of mashed, premasticated food or bread softened with liquids.|$|E
5|$|Constantine's {{share of}} the Empire {{consisted}} of Britain, Gaul, and Spain. He therefore commanded {{one of the largest}} Roman armies, stationed along the important Rhine frontier. After his promotion to emperor, Constantine remained in Britain, driving back the tribes of the Picts and secured his control in the northwestern dioceses. He completed the reconstruction of military bases begun under his father's rule, and ordered the repair of the region's roadways. He soon left for Augusta Treverorum (Trier) in Gaul, the Tetrarchic capital of the northwestern Roman Empire. The Franks, after learning of Constantine's acclamation, invaded Gaul across the lower Rhine over the winter of 306–307AD. Constantine drove them back beyond the Rhine and captured two of their kings, Ascaric and Merogaisus. The kings and their soldiers <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> to the beasts of Trier's amphitheater in the adventus (arrival) celebrations that followed.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, the team's {{treatment}} {{was the source}} of numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E

50|$|The Holland Lop rabbit should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> {{daily with}} good quality pellets, fresh vegetables, and {{unlimited}} grass or timothy hay, {{as well as}} fresh water. Pellets should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> one ounce per pound of body weight. Rabbits enjoy {{many different types of}} fresh vegetables, such as romaine lettuce, endives, parsley, coriander, dill, fennel and arugula, as well as carrots. Fresh leafy vegetables should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> at a rate of at least 1 packed cup per 2 pounds of body a day. Leafy greens high in oxalic acid, such as parsley and spinach, should not <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> every day. Non-leafy vegetables such as carrots or peppers should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> in much smaller quantities, about 1 tablespoon per 2 pound of body weight per day. Alfalfa hay or alfalfa based pellets should only <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> to juvenile rabbits under 1 year. Treats from pet supplies stores are often not particularly safe for rabbits to ingest. They often are high in sugar or fat, or contain foods that rabbits cannot digest.|$|R

The infants fed the supplemented formula also showed improvements across multiple developmental measures at 18 months, with significantly better scores on the Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II), the Fagan test (novelty preference rate), the latency of visual evoked potentials (VEP), and sustained attention test than in the control group.|$|E
5|$|Leguat {{stated that}} the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct Cylindraspis tortoises. It is not known how the young <b>were</b> <b>fed,</b> but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. It {{has been suggested that}} the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough {{now had to}} {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière.
