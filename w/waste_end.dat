The wetlands are quickly being colonized by invasive species, and a great number of phytoplankton have been identified, some of which are caused by the pollution.The Bonaberi suburb of Douala, with a rapidly growing population of over 500,000, illustrates the urban environmental problems.More than 75% of Bonaberi is 2 m above sea level on average.With limited land, poor people have encroached into wetlands.As of 2002, the dense mangrove swamp forest, which included luxuriant growths of palms, was undergoing extinction due to urbanization.The houses and industrial buildings on the cleared land are poorly built, without adequate drainage.Pools of stagnant water are breeding grounds for disease.Human and industrial <b>waste</b> <b>end</b> up in the channels of the Wouri, reducing its rate of flow.River floods and sea incursions may cause rises of water level from 2 m to 5 m within a few minutes, destroying buildings and washing raw sewage into the wells.

40|$|This {{engineering}} {{feasibility study}} compared three possible technical options and their economic viability of processing plutonium-bearing sludges containing 0. 6 MT of weapons-grade Pu accumulated at the Mining and Chemical Combine (MCC) at Krasnoyarsk. In Option 1, the baseline, the sludges are processed by extraction and purification of plutonium for storage using existing technologies, and the non-soluble radioactive residues generated in these processes undergo subsequent solidification by cementation. Options 2 and 3 involve the direct immobilization of plutonium-bearing sludges into a solid matrix (without any Pu extraction) using a microwave solidification {{process in a}} metal crucible to produce a glass, which is boron-silicate in Option 2 and phosphate glass in Option 3. In all three options, the solid radioactive <b>waste</b> <b>end</b> products will be placed in storage for eventual geologic disposal. Immobilization of residual plutonium into glass-like matrices provides both safer storage over the lifetime of the radionuclides and greater security against unauthorized access to stored materials than does the extraction and concentration of PuO{sub 2 }, supporting our efforts toward non-proliferation of fissile materials. Although immobilization in boron-silicate glass appears now to be marginally preferable compared to the phosphate glass option, a number of technical issues remain to be assessed by further study to determine the preferable immobilization option...|$|E
40|$|The waste {{fractions}} {{offered to}} households in Sweden differ {{depending on where}} you live. The responsibility for the waste are grounded by the Swedish law where the municipality are responsible for the collection of household waste and FTI are responsible for collecting all packages and papers that the households sorts out. A new waste regulation is under consideration where the responsibility for the household waste may change. The bulky waste from households is collected at recycling centers where the households leave it in different containers for different fractions. These recycling centers are formed different and the fractions offered in them also differ depending on in what municipality they are located. The reason for the difference seems to depend on the opportunity to recycle the fraction and cross-border cooperation does not seem to exist in any larger scale. The waste fraction offered as FNI also differ depending on municipality where some are offering different fractions while other only offers compostable and combustible waste fractions. The municipality has reached different levels on their work towards better waste management according to the waste stair where reuse and recycling are preferred before another disposal. This often lead to energy recycling of the waste where over half of the Swedish treated <b>waste</b> <b>end</b> up. Materials that are often transported to energy recycling are textiles and thermosetting plastic where the plastic can be and are recycled in about 20 municipalities. The authorities and some companies are investigating the possibility to recycle textiles and they {{have found a way to}} recycle cotton fibres but in order to build a factory for that there need to collect larger volumes than are collected today. I will investigate if there is a need for more fractions than those offered to the households today...|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} or four general {{categories}} of 2 ̆ 2 waste. 2 ̆ 2 There is 2 ̆ 2 municipal solid waste 2 ̆ 2 (the waste {{that comes out of}} households, hotels, restaurants, businesses, etc.), 2 ̆ 2 hazardous waste, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 nuclear waste, 2 ̆ 2 the latter of which is sometimes divided into low-level and high-level nuclear waste. (My remarks today will focus almost exclusively on municipal solid waste and hazardous waste). All of us are most familiar with municipal solid waste. Where does municipal solid <b>waste</b> <b>end</b> up? The vast majority of U. S. municipal solid waste - 57 percent - goes to landfills. Twenty-two percent of U. S. municipal solid waste is recycled, fifteen percent is incinerated, and six percent is composted. Over thirty million tons of that waste - that is, over 11 percent of the total waste stream - crosses state lines each year. Eighty percent of that waste goes to a neighboring state; going through one state to take the trash to another is much less common. Why does waste move across boundaries both between states and between Canada and the United States? People are trying to dispose of their waste at the lowest cost, and there are several reasons why we might move trash across the border. It might be more convenient; the closest landfill may not be within your state or province, but just across the border. It may also be that you have a shortage of landfills in your home state or province. Another reason that waste can move is because of differences in regulatory regimes between jurisdictions. In fact, a study commissioned by the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation found that the increased level of hazardous waste exports from the United States to Canada between 1993 and 1998 was attributable to the lower standards for the disposal of hazardous waste in Ontario and Quebec...|$|E

This study has investigated the legislative, contractual and operational practices governing the management of five hazardous waste streams emanating from retailers in a dedicated shopping centre.

However, much of the equipment is outdated, and in poor condition. In a survey of 11 municipalities in the Drina river basin, the land fills being used did not comply with EU sanitation regulations. The landfills have also reached their capacity. This has led to illegal waste dumping, and in turn has caused many smaller landfills created by residents of the municipalities and located in rural, uninhibited areas close to the Drina. In this way, the eco-syststem of the Drina has been jeopardized. Annual packaging waste amounted to about 240.000 tones in 2010. Only about 5% of total waste is recycled.
