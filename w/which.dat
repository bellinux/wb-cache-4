50|$|<b>Whicher</b> {{concentrated}} {{his investigation}} on the missing nightgown belonging to 16-year-old Constance Kent, the murdered child's older half-sister from their father's first marriage; {{there was also}} circumstantial evidence against her. The magistrates ordered her arrest and gave <b>Whicher</b> seven days to prepare his case. <b>Whicher</b> then requested {{the assistance of a}} detective-sergeant from Scotland Yard, becoming the first police inspector to make such a request. Her father Samuel Saville Kent (1801-1872) engaged the services of an experienced barrister to defend his daughter. Constance Kent was released on bail and the case against her was later dropped due to lack of evidence. The nightgown, a crucial piece of evidence, was never found, and Superintendent Foley never told <b>Whicher</b> about its original discovery. The national newspapers strongly supported the young Constance and were critical of <b>Whicher.</b> He returned to London where he was seen as a failure because he had failed to solve the case and thus damaged the reputation of the Detective Branch. It took some time for his reputation to recover.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Whicher</b> {{was born}} in 1814 in Camberwell, London, the son of Rebecca and Richard <b>Whicher,</b> a gardener. He was baptised on 23 October 1814 at the church of St Giles in Camberwell. After working as a {{labourer}} he passed the physical and literacy tests and joined the Metropolitan Police on 18 September 1837 as a police constable with the number E47 (Holborn Division). <b>Whicher</b> was 5' 8" [...] tall, with brown hair, pale skin and blue eyes. He married Elizabeth Harding (born 1818), {{and they had a}} son, Jonathan <b>Whicher</b> (born 1838), who died young. By 1841 he was living in a police dormitory at a stationhouse in Gray's Inn Lane in St Pancras. In August 1842 he and seven other men joined the newly formed Detective Branch at Scotland Yard. <b>Whicher</b> received the new number A27 (Whitehall Division) and was promoted to detective-sergeant shortly after.Whicher was reportedly described by a colleague as the [...] "prince of detectives". Charles Dickens, who met him, described him as [...] "shorter and thicker-set" [...] than his fellow officers, marked with smallpox scars and possessed of [...] "a reserved and thoughtful air, as if he were engaged in deep arithmetical calculations". William Henry Wills, Dickens's deputy editor at Household Words magazine, saw <b>Whicher</b> involved in police work in 1850 and described him as a [...] "man of mystery".|$|R

5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will <b>which</b> acts from duty.

This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts <b>which</b> are performed out of duty.|$|E
