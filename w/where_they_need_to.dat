500|$|DJ Hero has {{received}} positive reviews from the gaming press, who consider the title as a fresh restart {{of the music}} genre given {{the large number of}} titles based on guitar play. The turntable peripheral was considered to be well designed {{to meet the needs of}} the game. The unit's weight, size, and shape, and ability to cater to both left- and right-handed players was commended. Many reviewers noted a need to alter the action of the crossfader, either by having better physical feedback to the player to indicate the center of the knob's track, or by reducing the width of the track to better handle the rapid crossfade maneuvers. Reviewers also noted that there was a certain weight to the turntable portion of the controller which made scratching imprecise, particularly with the inner blue button where only minimal torque can be applied. The learning curve of the game across the various mixes was highly commended by reviewers for helping players to get used to the new controller. When progressing from [...] "Medium" [...] to [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] levels and encountering more complex mixes, reviewers thought the game felt transformed, bringing a difficult but more rewarding experience to the player as they begin emulating every part of a real DJ's motions. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer considered that while the learning curve is steep, with the [...] "Easy" [...] difficulty being [...] "less thrilling and engaging" [...] compared to Guitar Hero, the game was [...] "structured fabulously to nudge you gradually closer to the summit" [...] with each successive career set and difficulty mode. Cam Shae of IGN Australia felt that the changes in [...] "Hard" [...] mode over [...] "Medium" [...] were somewhat excessive, introducing both more crossfade effects and button-pressing, and felt these could have been introduced separately in [...] "Hard" [...] and [...] "Expert" [...] modes. [...] Richard Li of 1UP.com noted that the inability to fail a song is both [...] "a bane and a boon"; newer players would not feel frustration at trying to get used to the controller and would be able to quickly unlock all the sets in the game's career mode, but without knowing where they failed, they would not have an idea of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> hone their skills to improve their performance at the game. The omission of a practice mode was noted by Daemon Hatfield of IGN, believing it would help in some of the more complex mixes by the DJ celebrities. Reviewers believed that the small faults in DJ Hero can be easily fixed for potential sequels.|$|E

[...] CraveOnline's William Bibbiani called the episode [...] "an odd duck".

2500|$|Entoptics {{are another}} feature of {{abstraction}} technology and consist of various visual layers interpolated into human sight {{at some point}} between the viewer's cornea and visual cortex. These effects can either be created by a single person (e.g., the projection of the appearance of clothing, glowing tattoos, etc.) or an authority (e.g., public visual displays [...] "projected" [...] into mid-air {{without the use of}} any actual display devices). While some forms of abstraction, especially those in use during the Belle Epoque, were profoundly immersive and based on wireless networking between sophisticated brain implants and local computer architecture, entoptics by themselves could be technologically quite simple, with convincing visual phantoms being produced solely within ordinary ocular implants, or artificial eyes. The Conjoiners developed the first Entoptics early in their history, used in [...] "Great Wall of Mars". By the time of The Prefect, much of humanity was engaged in abstraction in some form. Most of the characters in Reynolds' novels participate in abstraction through the use of neural implants, though after the advent of the Melding Plague, when complex cybernetics became liable to dangerous infections, many characters choose simply to use entoptics without engaging in the more intimate forms abstraction could take. Others, such as the Prefects of Panoply, a police force charged with defending the universal enfranchisement championed by Demarchists, are explicitly denied access to abstraction implants as part of their job, in order to foreclose potential avenues for the manipulation or obstruction of justice. Instead, Prefects carry with them simple pairs of goggles which simulate entoptics for use in situations <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> be privy to activity within local abstraction, without having it broadcast immediately into their nervous systems.|$|E
