Following her wedding day, the pig-faced woman's new husband was granted the choice of having her appear beautiful to him but pig-like to others, or pig-like to him and beautiful to others. When her husband told her that the choice <b>was</b> <b>hers,</b> the enchantment was broken and her pig-like appearance vanished. These stories became particularly popular in England, and later in Ireland.|$|E

25|$|In October 2009, workmen {{clearing}} vegetation {{from the}} bottom of the M5 at Junction 14 discovered human bones in a black bin bag dumped in the bushes at the side of the motorway. The police were called soon after, and it was soon established that the bones were those of a young female. A few days later, DNA found on the remains confirmed that the body was that of Melanie Hall, who disappeared in June 1996 after a night out in Bath, Somerset, and who had been declared dead in absentia in 2004. Dental records confirmed that the body <b>was</b> <b>hers,</b> and the police began a formal investigation into her murder. As of 2016 no one has been prosecuted in connection with this case.|$|E
25|$|Miller's second novel, , {{was written}} in 1927–28, {{initially}} {{under the guise of}} a novel written by June. A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it <b>was</b> <b>hers.</b> The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death. Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan. A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which upset him greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later. Kronski committed suicide around 1930.|$|E
25|$|Hugo Gressmann {{has found}} 22 similar stories in world {{folklore}} and literature, especially in India {{and the far}} east. One Indian version is a Jataka story dealing with Buddha {{in one of his}} previous incarnations as the sage Mahosadha, who arbitrates between a mother and a Yakshini who is {{in the shape of a}} woman, who kidnapped the mother's baby and claimed he <b>was</b> <b>hers.</b> The sage announced a tug war: He drew a line on the ground and asked the two to stand on opposite sides of the line, one holding his feet and the other his hands – The one who would pull the baby's whole body beyond the line would get him. The mother, seeing how the baby suffers, released him and let the Yakshini take him, weeping. When the sage saw that, he turned the baby back to the hands of the true mother, exposed the identity of the Yakshini and expelled her. In other Indian versions the two women are widows of one husband. Another version appears in the Chinese drama The Chalk Circle (in this version the judge draws a circle on the ground), which has been widespread all over the world and many versions and reworkings were made after it, among them The Caucasian Chalk Circle, a play by Bertolt Brecht.|$|E

25|$|The defense {{strategy}} was to impeach {{the testimony of the}} key prosecution witnesses: Lloyd and Weichmann. It also wished to show that she was loyal to the Union, her trips to Surrattsville were of an innocent nature, and she had not been aware of Booth's plans. There were 31 witnesses who testified for the defense. George H. Calvert testified that he had pressed Surratt to pay a debt, Bennett Gwynn said Surratt had sought payment from John Nothey to satisfy the Calvert debt, and Nothey agreed that he had received a letter from Surratt for him to appear at the tavern on April 11 to pay what was owed. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14) and implied that he could not have remembered that day clearly. (However, Lloyd had testified that he repaired a broken spring on Surratt's wagon, which rebutted the claims.) Augustus Howell, a Confederate agent, testified that Surratt's eyesight was poor and that Weichmann was an untrustworthy witness, as he had sought to become a Confederate spy himself. (The prosecution had attempted to show that Howell was a Confederate spy and should not be trusted.) Anna Surratt testified that it was Weichmann who had brought Atzerodt into the boarding house, that the photograph of Booth <b>was</b> <b>hers</b> (given to her by her father in 1862), and that she owned photographs of Union political and military leaders. Anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in the boarding house, and she said that while Booth visited the house many times, his stays were always short. Anna explained her mother's failure to recognize Powell by asserting she could not see well. Honora Fitzpatrick was called back to the stand and testified to Mary's poor eysight as well. A former servant and a former slave both said her eyesight was failing and that she had given Union soldiers food. Numerous witnesses were called {{at the end of the}} defense's case to testify to her loyalty to the Union, her deep Christian faith, and her kindness. A number of Catholic priests were called to the stand to testify about Surratt's faith, good character, and incorruptibility. Portraying Surratt as a good Christian woman incapable of committing the crimes for which she was accused was a large part of the {{defense strategy}}. During the prosecution's rebuttal, government lawyers called four witnesses (P.T. Ransford, John Ryan, Frank Stith, and James Young) to the stand, who testified as to Weichmann's unimpeachable character.|$|E
500|$|In 1916, Landis {{presided over}} the [...] "Ryan Baby" [...] or [...] "Baby Iraene" [...] case. The recent widow of a {{prominent}} Chicago banker, Anna Dollie Ledgerwood Matters, had brought a baby girl home from a visit to Canada and claimed {{that the child was}} her late husband's posthumous heir. Matters had left an estate of $250,000. [...] However, a shop girl from Ontario, Margaret Ryan, claimed the baby <b>was</b> <b>hers,</b> and brought a writ of habeas corpus in Landis's court. Ryan stated that she had given birth to the girl in an Ottawa hospital, but had been told her baby had died. In the era before blood and DNA testing, Landis relied on witness testimony and awarded the child to Ryan. The case brought comparisons between Landis and King Solomon, who had judged a similar case. Landis was reversed by the Supreme Court, which held he had no jurisdiction in the matter. A Canadian court later awarded the child to Ryan.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, McCracken and Dunphy both {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} {{roles in the}} dance ensemble of the new Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Away We Go. Agnes de Mille, who had just staged Aaron Copland's Rodeo for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staging the production. The show went into rehearsals in early 1943. Like her husband, McCracken was cast in an anonymous dance role in the chorus. Early in out-of-town tryouts, she began to distinguish herself, and her dancing was noticed by reviewers. By {{the time of the}} Broadway opening of the show, now named Oklahoma!, [...] de Mille a she had developed her comic performance in the role of Sylvie, with McCracken taking a comic pratfall in the [...] "Many a New Day" [...] dance number. She became known as [...] "The Girl Who Fell Down". Sources differ as to whether the role's distinctive fall was devised by McCracken or de Mille. McCracken has said the ideas <b>was</b> <b>hers,</b> while de Mille and others recall it as being the choreographer's. Celeste Holm, a member of the original cast, attributed the idea to composer Richard Rodgers.|$|E

500|$|The {{purpose of}} {{marriage}} between the medieval elites was to secure land. Girls {{were married in}} their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age. There is a popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, {{and that it was}} dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the image of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domestic life is a neglected facet. The lady was given a dower of her husband's estates– usually about a third– which <b>was</b> <b>hers</b> for life, and her husband would inherit on her death. It was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land. Despite generally being excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influence within the medieval household, women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises {{the role of women in}} applying [...] "a refined aristocratic taste" [...] to castles due to their long term residence.|$|E
500|$|Disney had {{originally}} considered casting actress Jodi Benson, who famously voiced Ariel in The Little Mermaid, as Belle, but ultimately {{felt that she}} sounded [...] "too American" [...] and young, opting for a [...] "more classical ... womanly" [...] voice instead. Describing the character as [...] "a woman that was ahead of her time," [...] the filmmakers wanted Belle to sound [...] "more like a woman than a girl." [...] However, Benson voiced Belle in a few episodes of Disney's House of Mouse. Director Kirk Wise was particularly interested in casting an actress capable of [...] "creat a character completely with her voice", envisioning a voice {{similar to that of}} American entertainer Judy Garland. American actress and singer Paige O'Hara was performing on Broadway when she first read about Disney's then-upcoming animated project Beauty and the Beast in an article in The New York Times. Upon discovering that the studio was holding auditions for the lead role of Belle and, at the behest of lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken, specifically recruiting Broadway performers, O'Hara immediately insisted that her agent get her an audition. Familiar with O'Hara's Broadway stint as Ellie May Chipley in the musical Show Boat; Ashman had already been eyeing O'Hara for the part. O'Hara auditioned for the role five times, competing against approximately 500 other actresses. First auditioning solely for casting director Albert Taveres, O'Hara's next two auditions simply required the actress to mail audio recordings of her voice to the studio in Los Angeles. Required to perform a song of her choice, O'Hara sang [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] from the musical Chess. At her first legitimate audition, O'Hara spoke and sang in a higher register than her own in an effort to mimic Snow White from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but the filmmakers insisted that she use her own voice instead. In addition to Ashman and Menken, O'Hara's last few auditions were attended by directors Wise and Gary Trousdale, and producers Katzenberg and Don Hahn. O'Hara recalled that the songwriters would first close their eyes and listen to her before finally watching her perform. An hour after her fifth and final audition, O'Hara received a telephone call from Disney on her birthday informing her that she had been cast. The actress was fairly confident that the role <b>was</b> <b>hers</b> before she was officially cast, and credits the fact that Ashman enjoyed her performance on the cast recording of the musical Show Boat. O'Hara admitted, [...] "I'm not usually confident about auditions ... but I just understood (Belle) so much." ...|$|E

The commission comprised four of the most eminent men in the country: Prime Minister Lord Grenville, the Lord Chancellor Lord Erskine, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales Lord Ellenborough and the Home Secretary Lord Spencer. Lady Douglas testified that Caroline herself had admitted to her in 1802 that she was pregnant, and that Austin was her son. She further alleged that Caroline had been rude about the royal family, touched her in an inappropriately sexual way, and had admitted that any woman friendly with a man was sure to become his lover. In addition to Smith, Manby and Canning, artist Thomas Lawrence and Henry Hood (the son of Lord Hood) were also mentioned as potential paramours. Caroline's servants could or would not confirm that these gentlemen were her lovers, nor {{that she had been}} pregnant, and said that the child had been brought to Caroline's house by his true mother, Sophia Austin.

2500|$|In 2012, Thanwarin's It Gets Better is {{marketed to}} a more {{mainstream}} audience, and was admitted by the film committee. The film portrays {{the story of a}} young boy whose father forces him to become a monk after he catches him wearing his mother's clothes and dancing around effeminately in his room. At first the boy resists, but is then captivated by the beauty of the monk who comes out of the temple, and so immediately changes his mind. The story runs alongside two other narratives, one of a man returned to Thailand to sell his father's business and the other of a woman whose purpose seems unclear throughout the story until the very end. We find out that the monk is the woman, who has come back to see her father but is killed by a thief before she can make amends with him. It turns out the bar/dance club <b>was</b> <b>hers</b> and her death is the reason for her son's return to Thailand; his father's identity was kept from him his whole life, but after he learns everything from his biological father's office, he goes to see his grandfather and the story ends.|$|E
