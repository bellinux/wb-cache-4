25|$|One Folgers {{television}} ad from 1985 became particularly {{associated with}} the Christmas holidays. A student named Peter returns home from college, the smell of freshly brewed coffee awakening his parents and alerting them to their son's arrival. The Cunningham & Walsh spot aired yearly until 1998, then in edited form in 2004 and 2005. In 2009, a similar theme was employed, a son coming home from West Africa and <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the smell of coffee.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, he {{suffered}} a mystery blackout, <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find himself in a gutter in Scarborough. The incident suddenly revitalised him as a cricketer, and his county performances earned him a recall to the England team for the series against the West Indies. He had a successful series, contributing useful runs at numbers seven and eight, and becoming an important member of the pace-bowling attack, including dismissing Brian Lara for his first golden duck of his Test career. His bowling had improved {{to such an extent}} that he was capable of using reverse swing and reaching speeds of 90mph off a short run-up.|$|E
25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1908, Girault vividly described {{an encounter with}} bedbugs in 1907 {{in a hotel room}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant to sleep on the bed after discovering the bedbugs as he entered the room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie across the bed without getting under the covers. He slept fitfully, constantly <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find bedbugs scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on a rocking chair. Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the bedbugs, the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects.|$|E
500|$|... "Manic Monday" [...] {{is a song}} by the American pop {{rock band}} The Bangles, and the first single {{released}} from their second studio album, Different Light (1986). It was written by American musician Prince, using the pseudonym [...] "Christopher". Originally intended for the group Apollonia 6 in 1984, he offered the song to The Bangles two years later. Lyrically, it describes {{a woman who is}} <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go to work on Monday, wishing it were still Sunday where she could relax.|$|E

500|$|James Ingram later {{described}} {{working with}} Jackson and Jones {{as being in}} The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. [...] "It's almost like I {{got the chance to}} go to Oz and Quincy was the Wizard of Oz and Michael Jackson was who he was dealing with in his world. Their work ethic is unbelievable." [...] He noted how Jones would fall asleep on the board, <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> answer a question. [...] "He works in the Alpha state a lot", Ingram added. Two of Jackson's sisters, Janet and La Toya, provided backing vocals in the guise of the P.Y.T.s. The two sisters sang [...] "na na na" [...] back at their brother {{towards the end of the}} song. It has a tempo of 126 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's fastest songs.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s, Vinnie is {{the leader}} of a gang named [...] "the Stompers". His best friend, Crazy Shapiro, is subject to {{multiple}} murder attempts by Crazy's detective father, Solly. While in an old basketball court, Vinnie reunites with an old flame named Rozzie, but their reunion is abruptly interrupted by Rozzie's protective Jewish father, who chains her to her bed so she won't meet with Vinnie. Vinnie and Crazy spend the evening drinking, meet up with two prostitutes and go to sleep on the beach, <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find themselves close to a group of showering women and their mobster husbands. While Crazy inches over to the ladies, Vinnie finds a dead body buried in the sand. The screams of Vinnie and the women alert the mobsters, who beat up Crazy. It's later seen that Crazy has killed off the mobsters.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the series' success, Peter Jackson has become {{a major player in the}} film {{business}} (sometimes called a mogul) in the mold of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, in the process befriending some industry heavyweights like Bryan Singer and Frank Darabont. Jackson has since founded his own film production company, Wingnut Films, as well as Wingnut Interactive, a video game company. He was also finally given a chance to remake King Kong in 2005. The film was a critical and box office success, although not as successful as The Lord of the Rings series. Jackson has been called a [...] "favourite son" [...] of New Zealand. In 2004, Howard Shore toured with The Lord of the Rings Symphony, playing two hours of the score. Along with the Harry Potter films, the series has renewed interest in the fantasy film genre. Tourism for New Zealand is up, possibly due to its exposure in the series, with the country's tourism industry <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> an audience's familiarity.|$|E

500|$|The video {{starts out}} showing Little Italy, {{an icon of}} the Madonna and Child, and then Gaga riding a Vespa. The first twenty seconds are mainly full of camera shots of {{different}} men, Gaga, and the city. The singer roams around with some friends, laughing and joking in a restaurant, while she stands on the seat. Gaga then comes from around the block walking with her friends in pace and singing in the camera. Next, she is shown sleeping in a bed, and <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> reveal pink high-heeled shoes. She sings and cooks for {{a man in a}} house while dancing. She irons clothes while the man is on phone screaming at someone. The two harlequin Great Danes who appear at the start of her [...] "Poker Face" [...] music video, also appear in this one. Finally she lies on a sofa with her legs up on the man. One of the last scene shows her in a yellow dress made of flowers and wearing a yellow watch while singing to the song with a unique hairstyle which shows her hair pulled up and folded over. Then the camera quickly goes back to her in bed.|$|E
500|$|... "Power Hungry" [...] {{was written}} by {{consulting}} producer Jason Cahill and playwright Julia Cho, each of which {{would go on to}} write other first season episodes. Christopher Misiano directed the installment. According to Fringe co-creator Roberto Orci, series writers often approached episodes' fringe cases by coming up with an idea and then asking science consultants to [...] "justify it scientifically." [...] For [...] "Power Hungry", Cho and others brainstormed the concept of a computer virus being able to spread to humans. She explained, [...] "And through kneading that idea over and over again, we {{came up with the idea}} of a character, Joseph, who would start <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> this power of his to be able to actually control electronic- or computer-driven devices." [...] New Media consultant and scientist Glen Whitman, who later co-wrote some Fringe episodes, noted that the science depicted in the episode was not totally impossible. [...] "It is true that human beings as a result of the electrical activity in our brains, we do all have a very very weak magnetic field around our heads," [...] he said. [...] "And that's in part what is sensed by an EEG. So the notion was, 'how can you amplify that'"? ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 3 January 2008, Speight called emergency services after <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> discover Natasha Collins's body in the bath at their St John's Wood flat, in north-west London. Speight told police that he and Collins had spent the previous evening [...] "partying", drinking wine and vodka, and taking cocaine and sleeping pills. Speight was questioned by police and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of murder and of supplying class A drugs, but was released on bail until {{the first week of}} February. Because of this, the BBC cancelled the Saturday repeat edition of SMart. An inquest, which opened on 8 January 2008, heard that the death was not thought to be suspicious but should be [...] "subject to further investigation". At that point, police were awaiting results of toxicology tests after a postmortem examination was inconclusive. The BBC cancelled repeat broadcasts of SMart and SMarteenies until further notice, and on 28 February Speight announced he was quitting SMart, because the [...] "tragic loss" [...] of Collins had left him unable to continue with the show. Speight denied any involvement with Collins's death, and on 19 March it was reported that the police were no longer considering Speight as a suspect.|$|E

500|$|The Michigan State Highway Commission {{canceled}} the northern {{section of the}} highway, originally planned to continue northward from Novi to a point near Davisburg and Clarkston, on January 26, 1977, after it spent $1.6 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) the year before purchasing land for the roadway. This northern section was not planned as an Interstate Highway at that time, bearing the designation M-275 instead. Opposition to construction came from various citizens' groups and different levels of local government. Additionally, both The Detroit News and Detroit Free Press opposed the project. The Detroit City Council, led by then-Chairman Carl Levin, opposed the plan. Levin said at the time, [...] "At last I think people are <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the dangers of more and more expressways. At some point we've got to say enough. And I think we've reached it." [...] The US Department of the Interior reviewed the state's environmental impact study {{of the project and}} stated that the project, [...] "will cause irreparable damages on recreation lands, wetlands, surface waters and wildlife habitat."

500|$|After {{the break}} up of Kara's Flowers, Levine, along with Carmichael, left Los Angeles to pursue further studies at Five Towns College in New York. On MTV News, in 2002, he said: [...] "That's when I started <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the whole hip-hop, R thing. We had friends named Chaos and Shit. It was not Brentwood High". After {{dropping}} out of Five Towns College, in Dix Hills, Long Island, New York, where he and Jesse Carmichael spent a semester, they reunited with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form a band once more. They experimented with several styles, including country and folk, before deciding groove-based music would become their genre. Levine explained {{the need for a}} makeover for the band: [...] "We were just so sick of being a typical rock 'n'roll band ... I felt like I needed to look elsewhere for vocal inspiration." [...] The band put together a demo that was rejected by several labels, before falling into the hands of Octone Records executives James Diener, Ben Berkman, and David Boxenbaum. [...] Following Berkman's advice, the band added a fifth member, James Valentine, and was renamed Maroon 5. In an interview with HitQuarters, Berkman explained that Levine [...] "seemed to be a very shy, shoe-gazing type ... a fifth member could play the guitar to free up the singer , so he could be the star I perceived him to be".|$|E
500|$|A freeway running {{north of}} Novi to the Davisburg area was {{included}} in the original Interstate Highway plans for Michigan.

500|$|The tracks [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Bird Flu" [...] use urumee drums, a {{signature}} instrument of Gaana, a Tamil genre of music, with which M.I.A. was familiar from her time spent living in Sri Lanka. She later worked on these tracks in Trinidad, where she absorbed influences from the country's love of soca music. The lyrics of [...] "Boyz" [...] {{deal with the}} artist's time in Jamaica, and reference Jamaican dance moves. The song [...] "Hussel" [...] began as an image in M.I.A.'s head of refugees being smuggled in boats, which she expressed musically by imagining how [...] "if they banged that beat {{on the side of}} a boat, what would it sound like? [...] That's why it's all echo-y and submarine-y". The sounds on the intro were recorded from Keralan [...] fishermen chanting as they pull their fishing boats into the water. [...] "World Town" [...] used instrumentation from the temple music she recalled <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> as a child in Sri Lanka. After playing the track to children in Liberia, she expressed a desire to record a video for the song there. M.I.A.'s [...] "flat, unaffected vocals and delivery of lyrics" [...] on some songs drew comparisons to British post-punk bands such as Delta 5 and The Slits. She says it [...] "was just what was happening to me naturally...I wanted it to be difficult and raw and not get into it so much".|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei {{as a chance to}} develop a game with the company's brand on it. The main staff included director Yōsuke Niino, producer Hideyuki Yokoyama, programmer and future Megami Tensei director Kouji Okada, writers Ryutaro Ito and Kazunari Suzuki, and composer Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko worked on multiple aspects of the game, including character and sprite design, the world's concept and visual design, and the creation of visual assets. Atlus saw the game as a remake of the previous game in the Megami Tensei series, [...] As such, the staff knew what would happen with the story, so development went smoothly. An early factor in the game was the inclusion of a Law Hero and a Chaos Hero, and a protagonist who would initially be neutral and whose actions would affect their alignment. Kaneko defined this blending of different alignments as [...] "a sort of hodgepodge" [...] when compared to future games in the series. When designing it, the team slowly decided that they wanted to break the then-current gaming status quo using its aesthetic and content. That feeling, along with granting it a sense of reality through use of dark imagery, would later define the series. The main theme of Shin Megami Tensei was a person <b>waking</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> inevitable destruction and being able to do nothing but rely on their own abilities. The scenario {{took a long time to}} finalize, being revised a number of times by multiple staff members. During earlier drafts, it was planned that the finale of the story would take place in Israel after an extensive journey across Japan.|$|E

Other freeway projects cancelled during the 1970s included an extension of the US131 freeway northward to Petoskey, an extension of the US23 freeway from Standish to Alpena, and a freeway running across the southern Lower Peninsula toward Chicago. These ventures, along with the I-275 extension, were dropped over concerns related to rising construction costs, the environment and the Arab Oil Embargo. Even with these cancelled highways, several proposals were left to be completed.|$|E
