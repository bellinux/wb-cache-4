25|$|Today I have {{experienced}} my hardest combat. But {{at the same}} time it has been my most wonderful experience of comradeship in the air. We were eight Messerschmitts in the midst of an incredible whirling mass of enemy fighters. I flew my 109 for my life. I worked with every gram of energy and by the time <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> I was foaming at the mouth and utterly exhausted. Again and again we had enemy aircraft fighters on our tails. I was forced to dive three or four times, but I pulled up again and rushed back into the turmoil. Once I seemed to have no escape; I had flown my 109 to its limits, but a Spitfire still sat behind me. At the last moment Marseille shot it down, 50 metres from my 109. I dived and pulled up. Seconds later I saw a Spitfire behind Marseille. I took aim at the enemy— I have never aimed so carefully— and he dived down burning. At the end of the combat only Marseille and I were left in the dogfight. Each of us had three kills. At home we climbed out of out planes and were thoroughly exhausted. Marseille had bullet holes in his 109 and I had 11 hits in mine. We embraced each other, but were unable to speak. It was an unforgettable event.|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} of the song, Gaga was reluctant to add any dance-oriented beats to the song, and insisted on keeping its original rock version. However, music producer Rob Fusari convinced her that a drum machine would not hurt her integrity, telling her that Queen, {{who was one of}} Gaga's musical inspirations, used it in their music. Fusari commented, [...] "I think that's what finally got her to give it a shot, [...] <b>We</b> <b>finished</b> 'Beautiful, Dirty, Rich' that day. It's one of the songs on her debut album." ...|$|E
500|$|Stock markets reacted {{strongly}} to the ECB rate cuts. The German DAX index, for example, {{set a record}} high the day the new rates were announced. [...] Meanwhile, the euro briefly fell to a four-month low against the dollar. [...] However, due to the unprecedented nature of the negative interest rate, {{the long-term effects of}} the stimulus measures are hard to predict. [...] Bank president Mario Draghi signalled the central bank was willing {{to do whatever it takes}} to turn around the eurozone economies, remarking [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>finished?</b> The answer is no." [...] He laid the groundwork for large-scale bond repurchasing, a controversial idea known as quantitative easing.|$|E
500|$|The last {{scene in}} the film was {{arranged}} for {{the last day of}} filming. Initially, the language was supposed to be more somber and classical, but Meyer made some last minute changes. Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, {{there was a sense of}} irritation. We raised a glass of champagne, but everybody was actually a little antsy." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Smith's {{personal}} favourite is {{the cover}} recorded by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr., which was released {{as a single}} in the UK in 1989 (and 1990 in the US). Dinosaur Jr.'s version has a faster tempo and showcases the band's loud and distortion-heavy sound. The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> it we {{liked it so much}} we didn't want to give it to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate. It was fantastic. I've never had such a visceral reaction to a cover version before or since", and even said the cover has [...] "influenced how we play it live".|$|E
500|$|On tour {{following}} {{the release of}} Dog Beats, Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan, but were delayed by a blizzard. After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that [...] "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} shock and awe. <b>We</b> <b>finished</b> our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned"; they later learned that the concert was supposed to occur earlier in the evening, and that they were performing in the wrong building.|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow. Who knows {{what would have happened}} in that next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– <b>we</b> <b>finished,</b> we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, {{it was a very}} difficult scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably more than a hundred times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{recorded}} most of Hail to the Thief in two weeks, {{with additional}} recording and mixing at Radiohead's studio in Oxfordshire, England in late 2002 and early 2003. In {{contrast to the}} relaxed Los Angeles sessions, which Godrich described as [...] "very fruitful", mixing and sequencing the album created conflict. Yorke said: [...] "We had massive arguments {{about how it was}} put together and mixed ... For the first time it was really good fun to make a record... but <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> it and nobody could let go of it. 'Cause there was a long sustained period during which we lived with it but it wasn't completely finished, so you get attached to versions and we had big rows about it." [...] Godrich estimated that rough mixes from the Los Angeles sessions were used for a third of the final album.|$|E
500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. <b>We</b> <b>finished</b> three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E

500|$|After {{finishing}} a tour to promote Evanescence's previous album, The Open Door, Amy Lee {{said that she}} [...] "just sort of took off and didn't know what I {{was going to do}} next." [...] According to Lee, she was unsure at the time when—or if—Evanescence would continue. After taking a break from music for 18 months, she decided she wanted to work with the band members and it [...] "became more of a group project". Lee admitted to an identity crisis: [...] " [...] Fallen happened really fast, and it was just go, go, go for a couple years, and we went right into writing and wrote the next record. By the time <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> touring with The Open Door, I just needed to go, 'Who am I as an adult? During her hiatus, Lee began painting, attended concerts and museums and listened to folk and indie music.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{abruptly}} ended Band of Gypsys performance and their subsequent dissolution, Jeffery made arrangements to reunite the original Experience lineup. Although Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding were interviewed by Rolling Stone in February 1970 as a united group, Hendrix {{never intended to}} work with Redding. When Redding returned to New York in anticipation of rehearsals with a re-formed Experience, {{he was told that}} he had been replaced with Cox. During an interview with Rolling Stone Keith Altham, Hendrix defended the decision: [...] "It's nothing personal against Noel, but <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> what we were doing with the Experience and Billy's style of playing suits the new group better." [...] Although the lineup of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Cox became known as the Cry of Love band, after their accompanying tour, billing, advertisements, and tickets were printed with the New Jimi Hendrix Experience or occasionally just Jimi Hendrix.|$|E
500|$|The album's themes {{revolve around}} events {{which took place}} in 2015, such as the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the British media's {{handling}} of the United Kingdom general election, {{as well as on the}} state of humanity. Lead writer Higgs spent a year writing the album, time he spent watching rolling news and enveloping himself in current events. Pritchard told the London Evening Standard that [...] "we're in an age where we're more conscious of [...] you're constantly bombarded by information". Speaking to Chris Parkin of Red Bull, Higgs explained the songwriting process provided a kind of catharsis following the year's events: [...] "It wasn't until after <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> that I looked back and thought, bloody hell, I was feeling that very heavily and I didn't realise until it was out of me." [...] He later described the album as a [...] "horror bible".|$|E

500|$|The end of {{the legal}} {{disputes}} coincided with the willingness and availability of Cameron, Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton {{to participate in the}} sequel; Schwarzenegger, who portrayed the Terminator in the first film, commented: [...] "I always felt we should continue the story of The Terminator, I told Jim that right after <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> the first film." [...] He and Hamilton reprised their respective roles from the first Terminator film. After an extensive casting search, 12-year-old Edward Furlong was selected from hundreds of candidates to portray John Connor; Robert Patrick was chosen to play the T-1000 Terminator because his agility would emphasize the disparity between the advanced T-1000 and Schwarzenegger's older T-800 (Cameron characterized the two as [...] "a Porsche" [...] and [...] "a human Panzer tank" [...] respectively). Patrick had previously appeared in the action feature Die Hard 2, but Furlong had no formal acting experience. Joe Morton was picked to portray Miles Dyson, a Cyberdyne scientist who helped develop the new CPU for the T-800 Terminators.|$|E
500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that {{inspired}} Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{aired on}} Thanksgiving Day 1983, {{a year after}} Lee's final {{appearance}} as Mr. Hooper at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade. [...] The producers chose to air it {{the first week of}} the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it. [...] The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. [...] Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. [...] Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>finished</b> that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears", even Spinney underneath his costume. [...] Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although Spinney later said, [...] "There was nothing wrong with that take. [...] It was perfect". [...] Cameraman Frankie Biondo was touched by the performance.|$|E
