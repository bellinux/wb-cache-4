5|$|For a given tonnage, {{the second}} factor which governs the ship's {{dimensions}} {{is the size of}} the ports and waterways it will travel to. For example, a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> in its beam and draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|The MESSENGER {{space probe}} may provide {{evidence}} regarding vulcanoids. Its opportunities <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> because its instruments {{need to be}} pointed away from the Sun at all times to avoid damage.

5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E

5|$|On {{this section}} of the line, there is Communications-based train control (CBTC) {{equipment}} on the southbound express track between Fourth Avenue and Church Avenue, as part of the automation of the New York City Subway. The total cost is $99.6 million, with $15 million coming from the 2005–2009 capital budget (phase one) and $84.6 million from the 2010–2014 capital budget (phase two). The installation is a joint venture between Siemens and Thales Group, and is used to test the track's new signaling on R143s and R160s that are already equipped with CBTC. The estimated completion date was scheduled for March 2015; the installation is expected to be permanent. If Culver Line express service is implemented in 2017 as it was proposed, the express service would not initially use CBTC, and testing of CBTC on the express track <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to off-peak hours. The local tracks in this section would also get CBTC as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.|$|E

25|$|Most 32-bit PCI cards will {{function}} {{properly in}} 64-bit PCI-X slots, but the bus clock rate <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to the clock {{frequency of the}} slowest card, an inherent limitation of PCI's shared bus topology. For example, when a PCI 2.3, 66-MHz peripheral is installed into a PCI-X bus capable of 133MHz, the entire bus backplane <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to 66MHz. To get around this limitation, many motherboards have multiple PCI/PCI-X buses, with one bus intended for use with high-speed PCI-X peripherals, and the other bus intended for general-purpose peripherals.|$|E
