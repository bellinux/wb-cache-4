40|$|Neural fuzzy {{systems can}} improve motion {{estimation}} and compensation for video compression. Motion estimation and compensation are key parts of video compression. They help remove temporal redundancies in images. But most motion estimation algorithms neglect the strong temporal correlations {{of the motion}} field. The search <b>windows</b> <b>stay</b> the same through the image sequences and the estimation needs heavy computation. A neural vector quantizer system can use the temporal correlation of the motion field to estimate the motion vectors. First- and second-order statistics of the motion vectors give ellipsoidal search windows. This algorithm reduced the search area and entropy and gave clustered motion fields. Motion-compensated video coding further assumes that each block of pixels moves with uniform translational motion. This often does not hold and can produce block artifacts. We use a neural fuzzy system {{to compensate for the}} overlapped block motion. This fuzzy system uses the motion vectors of neighboring blocks to map the prior frame's pixel values to the current pixel value. The neural fuzzy system used 196 rules that came from the prior decoded frame. The fuzzy system learns and updates its rules as it decodes the image. The fuzzy system also improved the compensation accuracy. The Appendix derives both the fuzzy system and the neural learning laws that tune its parameters...|$|R
40|$|New {{results are}} {{reported}} from large scale lattice simulations of a frequently discussed strongly interacting gauge theory with a fermion flavor doublet in the two-index symmetric (sextet) {{representation of the}} SU(3) color gauge group. We find that the chiral condensate and the mass spectrum of the sextet model are consistent with chiral symmetry breaking {{in the limit of}} vanishing fermion mass. In contrast, sextet fermion mass deformations of spectral properties are not consistent with leading conformal scaling behavior near the critical surface of a conformal theory. A recent paper could not resolve the conformal fixed point of the gauge coupling from the slowly walking scenario of a very small nearly vanishing β-function (DeGrand et al. [3]). It is argued that overall consistency with our new results is resolved if the sextet model is close to the conformal <b>window,</b> <b>staying</b> outside with a very small non-vanishing β-function. The model would exhibit then the simplest composite Higgs mechanism leaving open the possibility of a light scalar state with quantum numbers of the Higgs impostor. It would emerge as the pseudo-Goldstone dilaton state from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance. We will argue that even without association with the dilaton, the scalar Higgs-like state can be light very close to the conformal window. A new Higgs project of sextet lattice simulations is outlined to resolve these important questions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of “Navez Portaels” area revalorization, Schaerbeek Commune {{invested}} in few constrained plots {{in order to create}} housing. Princesse Elisabeth’s plot is peculiar because of the narrow dimensions, shallow depth and high neighbours. Behind the static brick walls and in the heart of this dense city block, a park offers large spaces and makes the back of the plot more attractive: calm, greenery, a relief from the busy city life. In order {{to take advantage of this}} situation, all the living spaces are oriented in the park direction. This orientation also happens to be in favour of the sunlight exposure of the building. Given the limited width of the parcel and the footprint of the staircase, we propose to alternate simplexes and duplexes. This allows a mix of different dwelling sizes, as well as a fitting adaptation to the site particularities. The duplexes dispose of bedrooms on both levels, making them suitable for intergenerational housing. The street level is occupied by an office for a neighbourhood social organisation. The two façades contrast with each other. On the street, the <b>windows</b> <b>stay</b> narrow and similar to the neighbourhood ones in order to guarantee an efficient insulation and integrate the street pattern. On the contrary, the back façade is designed with large windows, giving the impression of walking in the park from the living room. The façade is realised with insulated tiles work. This technique helps to realise a high thermal insulation and maintain the façade as thin as possible. With its high energetic and thermal insulation performance, a good air tightness and a mechanical ventilation with heat recuperation, the construction is efficient enough to be passive. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The Oman Ophiolite in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) {{was formed}} in a supra-subduction zone {{environment}} at about 95 Ma andwas almost immediately obducted onto the eastern margin of Arabia. The timing of obduction is well constrained, but the post-obduction tectonic, uplift and exhumation history of the ophiolite and associated rocks are less well understood. We present twenty-one new fission track and (U–Th) /He analyses of apatite and zircon from the Hajar Mountains. The data show that the Oman Ophiolite had a complex exhumation history to present exposure levels in the Khor Fakkan and Aswad Blocks, resulting from at least three distinct exhumation events: 1) initial ophiolite obduction between ca. 93 and 83 Ma is characterised by tectonic exhumation and rapid cooling, as revealed by zircon (U–Th) /He and apatite fission-track data, {{but it is not}} associated with major erosional exhumation; 2) data from {{the lower part of the}} ophiolite and the metamorphic sole document a second exhumation event at ca. 45 – 35 Ma, interpreted to represent an early phase of the Zagros orogeny that led to reactivation of pre-existing structures and the differential exhumation of the Khor Fakkan Block along the Wadi Ham Shear Zone. This event led to significant erosional exhumation and deposition of a thick sedimentary succession in the Ras Al Khaimah foreland basin; and 3) Neogene exhumation is recorded by ca. 20 – 15 Ma apatite (U–Th) /He data and a single apatite fission track date from the lowermost part of the metamorphic sole.

After retaining the older models (1977 for the GM makes, and 1979 for Ford and Dodge) through 1980, for the 1981 season the wheelbase requirement was reduced to 110 in, which the newer model cars could be stretched to meet without affecting their appearance.

Using immunohistochemical techniques, we compared the localization of HOXA- 10 and HOXA- 11 proteins in the implantation window between the study and control groups. We observed statistically significantly decreased HOXA- 10 and HOXA- 11 transcript levels (p = 0. 003, p = 0. 012 respectively) in infertile patients compared to controls. There was no significant decrease in HOXA- 10 protein levels between these groups (p = 0. 074). However, we observed a significantly higher level of HOXA- 11 protein in the endometria of infertile patients compared to controls (p = 0. 015).
