50|$|In 1933, {{with the}} {{creation}} of signed routes, portions of LRN 57 and LRN 58 <b>would</b> be <b>signed</b> as Route 178. LRN 58 <b>would</b> be <b>signed</b> between Route 33 and US 99, and LRN 57 <b>would</b> be <b>signed</b> between US 99 and US 6. Later, in 1947, LRN 212 was created, and defined to run from LRN 23 (signed as US 6) near Inyokern, east to the Nevada state line. It was an unsigned route.|$|R

5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} {{approached}} on 1 July 2008, Näslund {{made it clear}} that the style of play and the player personnel of a team would be important factors in determining which team he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E
5|$|It is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the most important and pivotal of his early compositions because his performance of the song at an April 15, 1972, live radio concert at Sigma Studios on WMMR in Philadelphia, and the subsequent airplay this live version received on the station, brought him to the attention of major record labels, including Columbia, with whom he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> a recording contract in 1973.|$|E

5|$|Just as the team's {{competitive}} {{season was}} nearing its end, Lance Armstrong {{announced that he}} planned to return to competitive cycling in 2009 after a four-year absence. As Bruyneel was Armstrong's team manager for all seven of his Tour de France victories, there was much speculation immediately that Armstrong <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> with Astana in his comeback, which he eventually did.|$|E
5|$|After manager Ronald Koeman's departure, Benfica {{immediately}} {{searched for}} a replacement. Media speculated the club <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> Sven-Göran Eriksson and later Carlos Queiroz, but Benfica signed the former Porto and Sporting CP manager Fernando Santos. Santos was the first manager since Fernando Riera to manage all of Portugal's Big Three clubs. In the transfer market, Benfica brought back Rui Costa and recruited other notable players including Katsouranis and David Luiz. Fabrizio Miccoli had his loan renewed for a second year, while Geovanni, Manuel Fernandes and Ricardo Rocha left the club during the season.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft, Hammonds {{indicated}} that he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> if offered a $1.8 million signing bonus, which caused Hammonds to fall to the fourth overall selection, where the Baltimore Orioles selected Hammonds with their first-round draft pick. Frank Robinson, then the Orioles' assistant general manager (GM), met Hammonds at that year's College World Series while scouting, and advised Orioles GM Doug Melvin to pick Hammonds. The Orioles, regarded as frugal, held a hard line with Hammonds in negotiations, refusing to give a signing bonus as large as $1 million.|$|E

5|$|Football League clubs Bristol City, Swansea City, Swindon Town and Walsall {{all made}} {{enquiries}} for Constable in November 2005. He eventually signed for League One team Walsall on 21 November 2005 on loan until 1 January 2006, when he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> permanently {{for a fee}} of £4,000 on a contract until June 2007, having made 14 appearances and scored 8 goals for Chippenham {{up to that point}} in 2005–06. He made his debut as an 82nd-minute substitute in a 1–0 victory over Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy on 22 November 2005. This was followed by his Football League debut four days later after being introduced as an 89th-minute substitute in a 3–1 victory over Rotherham United.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Senators <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, {{the largest}} rookie salary in League history, which {{would lead to}} a cap on rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E
5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 {{million for the}} charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

5|$|President Sadat {{believed}} that Egypt's economic, political, social and military problems were {{a result of}} the Six Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing the humiliation of the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem. In return Egypt <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> a peace treaty with Israel and reestablish relations with the United States. However Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{were indeed}} relegated {{at the end}} of the 2007–08 season. Despite intense {{speculation}} that he would move to Rangers, with Rangers fans taunting Hibs fans that Brown <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> for them, Brown agreed a move to Celtic. Willie McKay commented that Brown was excited about playing for such a successful club and the chance to play in the UEFA Champions League. Brown was transferred for £4.4 million, the largest transfer fee exchanged between two Scottish clubs. The previous record was the £4 million transfer of Duncan Ferguson from Dundee United to Rangers. Brown scored in his final appearance for Hibs, against Celtic, for whom he had agreed to sign the previous week. During the game he was cheered by both sets of supporters.|$|E
5|$|When {{the media}} asked King Juan Carlos if he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> {{the bill that}} was being debated in the Cortes Generales, he {{answered}} {{that he was the}} King of Spain, not of Belgiuma reference to King Baudouin of Belgium, who refused to sign the Belgian law legalising abortion. For the King to withhold his royal assent, it would effect a veto of the legislation. However, the King gave his royal assent to Law 13/2005 on 1 July 2005, and the law was gazetted in the Boletín Oficial del Estado on 2 July, and came into effect on 3 July. The King received criticism by Carlist and other far right conservatives for signing the legislation.|$|E

5000|$|Key word signing is a {{technique}} of simultaneous communication whereby the communication partner of the user will use both natural speech and also produce signs for the words that carry the most important information. Key word signing puts emphasis on the pertinent words in a sentence or a phrase, rather than signing every word like you <b>would</b> for American <b>Sign</b> Language (ASL). For example, if someone said, [...] "Go wash your hands" [...] the key words that <b>would</b> be <b>signed</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "wash" [...] and [...] "hand".|$|R
5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} of {{questions}} related to the Mexican Cession, acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically infeasible in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{scored the}} only goal in a 1–0 away victory over Rushden. Mansfield agreed to extend Graham's loan until January 2010, when he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> {{for the club}} permanently. Goals from Carruthers and Brodie gave York a 2–1 home win over Wrexham, a result that equalled the club record for {{successive}} victories in all competitions with eight. Youth-team defender Dean Lisles was promoted to the first-team squad, to provide cover for the injured Sangaré, O'Hare and Purkiss. York drew 0–0 away to Hinckley United {{in the first round}} of the FA Trophy, and the replay at home was won 3–1, in which Brodie scored his second hat-trick of 2009–10. York beat fellow play-off contenders Mansfield 3–0 on Boxing Day, Brodie (2) and Gash scoring. Berry was released after failing to make an appearance, while Emmerson was loaned out to Ossett Town of the Northern Premier League Premier Division.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{signed for}} newly {{promoted}} League Two club York City on 30 August 2012 {{on a contract}} lasting until January 2013, having previously turned down a contract offer from Northampton. He made his debut two days later in York's 3–1 victory at home to Oxford United. On 19 November 2012, Carlisle re-signed for Northampton on loan until January 2013, when he <b>would</b> <b>sign</b> permanently, having made 14 appearances for York. He made his second debut the following day in Northampton's 3–0 home win over Morecambe. After making five appearances on loan, Carlisle completed his permanent move to Northampton on a one-and-a-half year contract on 4 January 2013. He played for Northampton in their 3–0 defeat to Bradford in the 2013 League Two play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 18 May 2013.|$|E
