40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how Europe (in NATO and the EU) has responded to changes in US announced and operational strategic and military policy and what the principal factors are for explaining European responses to what is perceived as a new form of American hegemony. The discussion is centered around {{the question of whether the}} United States has altered it conception of hegemony from one based on consent to one based on 2 ̆ 018 a preponderance of force 2 ̆ 019, and therefore to have abandoned the crucial process of consensus building through persuasion, which has formed the foundation for the post-war Euro-Atlantic community. If so, then the problem relates more to the fundamental question of maintaining the security community during significant international change and perceived changes in European and American interests than it does to the specific policy content of American foreign policy. European reactions to the perceived change in American foreign policy have been varied in style and rhetoric, but can be divided into those that have been concerned with safeguarding the achievements of the post-war era by following the United States <b>wherever</b> <b>it</b> may <b>choose</b> to go, or those who see a need for constructing a different relationship with the United States based on a more independent European foreign policy stance...|$|R
