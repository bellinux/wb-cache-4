The movement was represented by its promoters as a Restoration, probably with {{about the same amount}} of truth as in 1867. At the latter date, there was restoration so far as the power of the Mikado was concerned, but innovation as regards the introduction of Western ideas.

County Executive Isiah Leggett, who supported the bill, said the fees would have helped close the budget gap and help fund improvements to the county's emergency services.

25|$|The Curia Urbis or the Vicariate of the City of Rome {{was divided}} into four {{departments}} (officia), of which the second is again divided into four sections. The first department (officium) has under its care all the church services and the Apostolic visitation of the diocese. The second department watches over the behaviour of the clergy and the Christian people. Judicial matters are settled in the third department, and the fourth department {{is devoted to the}} economic administration of the entire vicariate. The head of all these bureaus is the cardinal who is the vicar-general of the pope in Rome. His office and the extent of his power are always the same and are permanent, so that they do not cease even when the Papal See is vacant. This fact distinguishes the cardinal vicar as he is called, for the designation is not an official title, from all other vicars-general in the world, and gives him his peculiar legal position. In the same way it is a noticeable exception that the four departments can carry on their customary business, even when the vicar is not able to supervise <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> on account of the conclave or of some other impediment. Even should the vicar die the work of the departments goes quietly on. Formerly {{this was not the case}} to so large a degree, as is shown by the deputation of 17 December 1876, on the death of Cardinal Vicar Patrizi.|$|E
