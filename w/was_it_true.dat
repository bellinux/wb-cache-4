25|$|Many reports erroneously {{stated that}} Borel's room {{was full of}} Nazi-insignia, and rumors he was sympathizing with fascist {{ideologies}} were spurred even more {{by the fact that}} his stepfather had attended several meetings of the Front National in 1989. But besides a picture of Adolf Hitler cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a swastika on his door, a few books on World War II, as well as a documentary about David Koresh and the Waco siege, no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics. Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, {{who was supposed to be}} his pregnant girlfriend. However, the sister in question did not exist, nor <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> that his father had died of cancer shortly before his rampage.|$|E
2500|$|This harsh {{critique}} made {{a strong}} impact on Yinshun. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> that the Buddha Dharma had become useless in dealing with people and events {{in the lives of}} the people? [...] Yin Shun felt that Buddhism seemed to have been transformed into a paper bag flying in the sky of 2,500 years ago—it could easily be blown away in a gust of wind.|$|E
6000|$|I left her. As I walked home, I fancied {{the people}} were looking at me, and smiling. Once I {{was on the verge}} of going up to a man, and asking him why he laughed, but I {{contained}} myself. How I was suffering! I remembered that Giulia had not seemed so pleased to see me; at the time I chid myself, and called myself exacting, but <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true?</b> I fancied she turned away her lips when I was imprinting my passionate kisses on them. I told myself I was a fool, but <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true?</b> I remembered a slight movement of withdrawal when I clasped her in my arms. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true?</b> Oh God! <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true?</b> ...|$|E

6000|$|Three reporters poured {{questions}} on him. How far had he flown? Was this really his first ascent by himself? What were his sensations? How had his motor stopped? <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> {{he was a}} mining engineer, a wealthy motorist? ...|$|E

60|$|Despite his {{conviction}} that it was useless to struggle longer against such injustice, he lived through the night, and came down late to breakfast, which he found stale, and without the compensating advantage of finding himself alone at the table. Some ladies had lingered there to clear up on the best authority the distracting rumors concerning him which they had heard the day before. <b>Was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> that he had intended {{to spend the rest}} of the winter in logging? and <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> that he was going to give up the Free Press? and <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> that Henry Bird was going to be the editor? Bartley gave a sarcastic confirmation to all these reports, and went out to the printing-office to gather up some things of his. He found Henry Bird there, looking pale and sick, but at work, and seemingly in authority. This was what Bartley had always intended when he should go out, but he did not like it, and he resented some small changes that had already been made in the editor's room, in tacit recognition of his purpose not to occupy it again.|$|E

6000|$|But in the meanwhile, {{why were}} our forefathers--heathens though they were, and sinners in many things, being truly {{children}} of wrath, fierce, bloodthirsty, revengeful, without {{the grace of}} Christ, which is Love and Charity--nevertheless a people prepared for the Lord?

60|$|The coachman, an Irishman, {{was closely}} questioned.

6000|$|I {{thought of}} going to Matteo, but I could not. He knew her before her marriage; {{he would be willing}} to accept the worst that was said of her. How could I be so {{disturbed}} at the slanders of a wicked, jealous woman? I wished I had never known Claudia, never given her reason to take this revenge on me. Oh, it was cruel! But I would not believe it; I had such trust in Giulia, such love. She could not betray me, when she knew what passionate love was poured down upon her. It would be too ungrateful. And I had done so much for her, but I did not wish to think of that.... All that I had done had been for pure love and pleasure, and I required no thanks. But surely if she had no love, she had at least some tender feeling for me; she would not give her honour to another. Ah no, I would not believe it.
