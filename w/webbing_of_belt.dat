5000|$|In between filopodia—much {{like the}} <b>webbing</b> <b>of</b> the hands—are the [...] "lamellipodia". These are flat regions of dense actin {{meshwork}} instead of bundled F-actin as in filopodia.

In growth cones, new filopodia usually emerge from these inter-filopodial veils.|$|R

25|$|Children often face medical issues very {{different}} from the experiences of an adult patient.

30|$|It is {{possible}} to slowly stretch out the <b>webbing</b> <b>of</b> the knee using circular external fixators (e.g., Ilizarov frame) [10]. However, {{in a study by}} Kim et al., even though a tenotomy of the ischio-calcaneal band at the ischial tuberosity and a z-lengthening of the flexor hallucis longus was performed, a recurrence was observed at 2  years [11]. Other studies have shown good short-term results but with recurrence [12].|$|R
30|$|Discussion: Fenton’s {{procedure}} is the long-standing standard operation for problems with posterior vaginal fourchette skin flaps and {{revision of the}} scarred perineum. However this technique can be less than satisfactory, particularly with perineal scarring and distortion following childbirth.
