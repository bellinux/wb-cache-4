40|$|The {{relationship}} between production rates of large diameter geothermal production wells, and slimholes, is studied. The analysis {{is based on}} wells completed in liquid-dominated geothermal fields, where flashing occurs either in the wellbore or at the surface. Effects of drawdown in the reservoir, and pressure drop in the wellbore, are included; heat losses from the wellbore to the formation are not presently included in our analysis. The study concentrates {{on the influence of}} <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> on production rate. For situations where the pressure drop is dominated by the reservoir, it is found that the mass flowrate varies with diameter according to W - D{sup {alpha}}, where the exponent {alpha} is a function of reservoir outer radius, <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> and skin factor. Similarly, when pressure drop in the wellbore is dominant, the scaling exponent was found to be a function of <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> and pipe roughness factor. Although these scaling laws were derived for single-phase flow, numerical simulations showed them to be reasonably accurate even for cases where flashing occurs in the wellbore...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{an amount}} of methane was {{produced}} with hot water in the Ammerlaan geothermal field. The presence of methane influences fluid properties and fluid flow in the well, leading {{to changes in the}} pressure and temperature drop in the producing well. This study presents a model for non-isothermal two-phase flow in geothermal wells. In this model, two-phase flow regimes and their corresponding temperature and pressure drop calculations are coupled. The pressure drop, temperature drop and the flow regime are calculated for different well parameters for the Ammerlaan field. The simulation results are used to give a general overview of optimal <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> and well inflow rate. Furthermore, the impact of two-phase flow regimes is shown in these simulations. We found that for a larger <b>well</b> <b>diameter,</b> pressure drop decreases. Pressure drop increases drastically when slug or even churn flow is reached. Smaller well inflow leads to a decrease in pressure drop. Based on the simulation results, the optimal combination of a <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> of 0, 3 meter and well inflow of 40 kg/s are found for the Ammerlaan field. Besides Ammerlaan, other fields with different salinity and gas contents are investigated in terms of pressure and temperature drop for two-phase flow in a geothermal well. It is found that fields with a low salinity and low gas content are more favorable for geothermal production. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

30|$|The {{drilling}} cost {{varies with}} the target depth, reservoir rock type, rate of penetration, and a mission of the well. In general, the deep drilling operation may constitute up to 60 % of the whole project funds (Lukawski et al. 2014). The geothermal wells usually have larger <b>well</b> <b>diameters,</b> higher rock temperature and pressure, and applied to aggressive geo-fluid causing corrosion and erosion of the well completion (Lukawski et al. 2014; Kubik 2006). That is why the geothermal drilling prices are, usually, higher comparing with conventional oil and gas wells. Additionally to that, a geothermal energy power plant project takes longer time scale from a geological discovery to the power production. All of the above leads to financial failure of the LER projects (Kubik 2006).|$|R

40|$|A {{two-phase}} flow extended {{finite element method}} (XFEM) model is presented to analyze the injection and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in deep saline aquifers. Carbon sequestration is a multiscale problem, involving length scales over four orders of magnitude–from injection <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> scale to the aquifer scale. XFEM is introduced to accurately approximate near injection well pressure behaviour with elements significantly larger than the injection <b>well</b> <b>diameter.</b> We present a vertically averaged multiphase flow model that combines XFEM to approximate the pressure field, with a Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin / Finite Element / Finite Difference method (SUPG-FEM-FDM) to approximate the distribution of CO 2 in the aquifer. Near well enrichment functions are presented along with the solution procedure for the coupled problem. Two examples are presented; in the first, CO 2 injection into a perfectly horizontal aquifer is model with both XFEM and FEM-based methods. It is shown that the XFEM provides improved accuracy in the prediction of pressure. The impact and selection of the stabilization coefficient of the SUPG-FEM-FDM is also discussed.

40|$|Final <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> and casing {{program in}} both oil and mining {{industries}} {{are directly related}} to production volume. Solutions to enhance production volume and increase income are always of great value. This thesis is working out how final diameter and casing program may improve from the previous presented casing program of the geothermal well SCH 2 - 1 located near Sebechleby, Slovakia. Particularly the <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> at bottom of the volcanic formation is of interest. The issues with the expected corrosive and acid environments are considered in designing casing program. Suggestions of kick off points for sidetrack wells are provided before thesis start, alternative to these kick off points as well as work plan for the sidetrack well are studied here. Karst caverns are predicted in this formation and bridging these caverns to keep them intact is of importance for the production of the well. Research of these topics has shown that expandable or combinations of conventional and expandable casing programs are highly able to improve <b>well</b> <b>diameter,</b> both at bottom of volcanic formation and {{at the bottom of the}} well. The most promising suggestion is providing inner diameters of casing that is 18. 01 ? and 14. 49 ?, at bottom of the volcanic formation and at final well depth, respectively. Less expensive solutions with lesser casing diameter is presented. All casing suggestions are designed and compared to anticipated pressures. Material behavior and properties is calculated for all suggestions, both during and after expansion. Study of expandable casing versus corrosion and acid environment shows that the material corrosion resistivity not a concern. The expansion process does not have a significant impact on the material corrosion properties. An alternative kick off point has been suggested and a work plan using monobore liner system for the sidetrack is presented. The monobore liner system will cost more than conventional liner, but study of monobore does not present any length limitations of the sidetrack. Bridging of karst caverns solution is presented using expandable liners. If the wellbore size is sufficient small, monobore would prove most promising for this task. Theoretical calculations, backed by a literature study on the topic are implying that expandable casing systems should be used in production enhancing for this well. </p...|$|E

40|$|The work {{explores the}} {{efficacy}} of a biochemical remediation of a nitrate-contaminated aquifer {{by a combination of}} nanoscale zero-valent iron (NZVI) and bacteria supported by carbon substrates. Nitrate removal was first assessed in batch tests, and then in a laboratory bench-scale aquifer model (60 cm length× 40 cm width× 50 cm height), in which a background flow was maintained. Water and natural sandy material of a stratified aquifer were used in the tests to enhance the reliability of the results. An array of non-pumping-reactive wells (NPRWs) filled with NZVI (d 50 = 50 nm, and SSA= 22. 5 m(2) /g) mixed with carbon substrates (beech sawdust and maize cobs) was installed in the bench-scale aquifer model to intercept the flow and remove nitrate (NO 3 (-) conc. = 105 mg/l). The NPRW array was preferred to a continuous permeable reactive barrier (PRB) since wells can be drilled at greater depths compared to PRBs. The optimal <b>well</b> <b>diameter,</b> spacing among the NPRWs and number of wells in the bench-scale model were designed based on flow simulations using the semi-analytical particle tracking (advection) model, PMPATH. An optimal configuration of four wells, 35 mm diameter, and capture width of 1. 8 times the <b>well</b> <b>diameter</b> was obtained for a hydraulic conductivity contrast between reactive materials in the wells and aquifer media (KPM/Kaq= 16. 5). To avoid excessive proximity between wells, the system was designed so that the capture of the contaminated water was not complete, and several sequential arrays of wells were preferred. To simulate the performance of the array, the water that passed through the bench-scale NPRW system was re-circulated to the aquifer inlet, and a nitrate degradation below the limit target concentration (10 mg/l) was obtained after 13 days (corresponding to 13 arrays of wells in the field). The results of this study demonstrated that using the NZVI-mixed-carbon substrates in the NPRW system has a great potential for in-situ nitrate reduction in contaminated groundwater.
