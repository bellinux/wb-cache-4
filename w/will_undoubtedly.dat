25|$|Neuroethics {{encompasses}} the myriad {{ways in which}} developments in basic and clinical neuroscience intersect with social and ethical issues. The field is so young that any attempt to define its scope and limits now <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> be proved wrong in the future, as neuroscience develops and its implications continue to be revealed. At present, however, we can discern two general categories of neuroethical issue: those emerging from {{what we can do}} and those emerging from what we know.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but {{significant}} differences exist. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression {{as part of his}} doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.|$|E
25|$|Under proper guidance, in {{the course}} of the final {{solution}} the Jews are to be allocated for appropriate labor in the East. Able-bodied Jews, separated according to sex, will be taken in large work columns to these areas for work on roads, {{in the course}} of which action doubtless a large portion will be eliminated by natural causes. The possible final remnant will, since it <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> consist of the most resistant portion, have to be treated accordingly, because it is the product of natural selection and would, if released, act as the seed of a new Jewish revival (see the experience of history.)... The evacuated Jews will first be sent, group by group, to so-called transit ghettos, from which they will be transported to the East.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Yuga Purana, the Yavanas {{thereafter}} retreated following internal conflicts: [...] "The Yavanas (Greeks) will command, the Kings will disappear. (But ultimately) the Yavanas, intoxicated with fighting, {{will not}} stay in Madhadesa (the Middle Country); there <b>will</b> be <b>undoubtedly</b> {{a civil war}} among them, arising {{in their own country}} (Bactria), there will be a terrible and ferocious war."

25|$|Agriculture and {{forestry}} {{is an area}} {{of opportunity}} for the country. “Angola requires 4.5 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55% of the corn it needs, 20% of the rice and just 5% of its required wheat”(African economic Outlook) but “less than 3 percent of Angola's abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited” (World Bank). From this fact we can appreciate the capacity that Angola has to increase production for not only for the national market but also the international one. Investing in this sector can help reduce unemployment and more specifically in the rural areas. This <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> have consequences on the living standard of rural civilians.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that some exoplanets may have moons with solid surfaces or liquid oceans that are hospitable. Most of the planets so far discovered outside the Solar System are hot gas giants thought to be inhospitable to life, so it is not yet known whether the Solar System, with a warm, rocky, metal-rich inner planet such as Earth, is of an aberrant composition. Improved detection methods and increased observation time <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> discover more planetary systems, and possibly some more like ours. For example, NASA's Kepler Mission seeks to discover Earth-sized planets around other stars by measuring minute changes in the star's light curve as the planet passes between the star and the spacecraft. Progress in infrared astronomy and submillimeter astronomy has revealed the constituents of other star systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{public sector}} effort {{continues}} {{with the goal}} to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled {{from all of this}} raw material, it <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but {{a lot of hard work}} remains.|$|E
30|$|The {{performance}} of a proactive routing protocol considerably decreases in very dynamic networks. In other words, proactive routing protocols select the best possible path based on the pre-calculated routes and some routing metrics. When a source node sends a packet to a destination and a link on the considered path fails, the packet <b>will</b> be <b>undoubtedly</b> lost. Hence, this type of routing protocol is not suitable for dynamic networks where links fail or nodes move continually. High path failure rate considerably degrades the video quality on nodes.|$|R

His most memorable moment at TCU <b>will</b> almost <b>undoubtedly</b> be {{what has come to}} be known as [...] "The Great White Hit". In the fourth quarter of a home game against rival Texas Tech, White hit Red Raiders' receiver Robert Johnson so hard that his helmet came off, and Johnson was removed from the game due to injury.|$|R

25|$|Iran is the last, large {{untapped}} {{emerging market}} in the world. According to many experts, the economy of Iran has many investment opportunities, particularly on its stock exchange. The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes with huge amounts of idle money entering the housing market. However, if the stock market grows stronger, it <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> attract idle capital. In terms of investment, the domestic rival markets of the bourse are the Iranian real estate market, cars and gold (with gold {{being used as a}} store of value, a hedging tool against hyperinflation and the devaluation of the Rial). According to Goldman Sachs, Iran is forecast to reach the highest economic growth between 2015 and 2025 and join the world's largest economies (world's 12th economy by 2025). Since 2012, TSE has served as a safe heaven against international sanctions and inflation.|$|E
25|$|While some {{mutations}} in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, see table 1, {{at least one}} mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Others include {{the introduction of a}} sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased calcium permeability. When mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability. While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca2+ leads to ACHM, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1 region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface. Such loss of function <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> negate the cone cell's ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1 region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.|$|E
25|$|Buildings {{have gone}} up and been torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been {{demolished}} six or seven times since the mid-19th century, and <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> reach an eighth or ninth cycle in short order. No single architectural style dominates the region. Instead, the cities have a mish-mash of different designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once a great many stone buildings constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). Minneapolis City Hall is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types—including personal residences such as the James J. Hill House—were similarly designed. A few decades later, Art Deco brought several structures that survive today, including St. Paul City Hall, the Foshay Tower, and the Minneapolis Post Office. The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, the trend has been buildings with sleek lines and modern glass facades while St. Paul tends to follow a more traditional style of buildings so as to better accompany its older structures.|$|E

The Mayor, Cr Sandra Wilson, called for truck bans on Millers Road except for vehicles that start or terminate their journey at Brooklyn or Altona North, due to the EES traffic modelling showing that there would 7,000 extra truck movements per day on Millers Road. Cr Wilson said:“These functions <b>will</b> all <b>undoubtedly</b> be affected by the proposed increase of 7000 truck movements per day resulting from toll avoidance and the City of Maribyrnong truck bans.” ...|$|R

25|$|According to {{that work}} the {{majority}} of the Ashkenazi mtDNA lineages can be assigned to three major founders within haplogroup K (31% of their total lineages): K1a1b1a, K1a9 and K2a2. The absence of characteristic mutations within the control region in the PPNB K-haplotypes allow discarding them as members of either sub-clades K1a1b1a or K2a2, both representing a 79% of total Ashkenazi K lineages. However, without a high-resolution typing of the mtDNA coding region it cannot be excluded that the PPNB K lineages belong to the third sub-cluster K1a9 (20% of Askhenazi K lineages). Moreover, {{in the light of the}} evidence presented here of a loss of lineages in the Near East since Neolithic times, the absence of Ashkenazi mtDNA founder clades in the Near East should not be taken as a definitive argument for its absence in the past. The genotyping of the complete mtDNA in ancient Near Eastern populations would be required to fully answer this question and it <b>will</b> <b>undoubtedly</b> add resolution to the patterns detected in modern populations in this and other studies.|$|E
