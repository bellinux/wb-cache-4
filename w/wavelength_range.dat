5|$|Blue phases are {{liquid crystal}} phases {{that appear in}} the {{temperature}} range between a chiral nematic phase and an isotropic liquid phase. Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with lattice periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective Bragg reflections in the <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> of visible light corresponding to the cubic lattice. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to quasicrystals.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

25|$|For {{high output}} power and broader <b>wavelength</b> <b>range,</b> tapered {{amplifiers}} are used. These amplifiers {{consist of a}} lateral single-mode section and a section with a tapered structure, where the laser light is amplified. The tapered structure leads to a reduction of the power density at the output facet.|$|E
25|$|People cannot {{perceive}} UV directly, {{since the}} lens of the human eye blocks most radiation in the <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> of 300–400nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea. Nevertheless, the photoreceptors of the retina are sensitive to near-UV, and people lacking a lens (a condition known as aphakia) perceive near-UV as whitish-blue or whitish-violet.|$|E

25|$|VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer). The Visible and IR {{spectrometer}} {{is able to}} make {{pictures of}} the nucleus in the IR and also search for IR spectra of molecules in the coma. The detection is done by a mercury cadmium telluride array for IR and with a CCD chip for the visible <b>wavelength</b> <b>range.</b> The instrument was produced in Italy, and improved versions were used for Dawn and Venus Express.|$|E
25|$|The general {{shape of}} the {{ultraviolet}} through near-infrared (0.125 to 3.5 μm) extinction curve in our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is fairly well characterized by the single parameter R(V) (which is different along different lines of sight through the galaxy), but there are known deviations from this single parameter characterization. Extending the extinction law into the mid-infrared <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> is difficult {{due to the lack}} of suitable targets and various contributions by absorption features.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} any {{optically}} transparent device requires {{the selection of}} materials based upon knowledge of its properties and limitations. The Lattice absorption characteristics observed at the lower frequency regions (mid IR to far-infrared <b>wavelength</b> <b>range)</b> define the long-wavelength transparency limit of the material. They {{are the result of}} the interactive coupling between the motions of thermally induced vibrations of the constituent atoms and molecules of the solid lattice and the incident light wave radiation. Hence, all materials are bounded by limiting regions of absorption caused by atomic and molecular vibrations (bond-stretching)in the far-infrared (>10µm).|$|E

2500|$|Dispersion {{occurs when}} {{different}} frequencies of light have different phase velocities, due either to material properties (material dispersion) {{or to the}} geometry of an optical waveguide (waveguide dispersion). The most familiar form of dispersion is a decrease in index of refraction with increasing wavelength, which is seen in most transparent materials. This is called [...] "normal dispersion". It occurs in all dielectric materials, in <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges</b> where the material does not absorb light. In <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges</b> where a medium has significant absorption, the index of refraction can increase with wavelength. This is called [...] "anomalous dispersion".|$|R
25|$|Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs {{single crystal}} {{exhibits}} much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO2). Considering the atomic arrangement is different along the (100) and (110) plane, {{one might think}} the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> from 880–1,600nm. Based on the large Faraday rotation, one {{might be able to}} use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the terahertz electromagnetic wave which requires very fast response time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.|$|E
25|$|Measurement of the star's {{spectrum}} show it {{to match}} a stellar classification of G1.5V, which {{is close to the}} Sun's spectral class of G2V. In the <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> 3200–8800Â, the energy emission of this star is very similar to the Sun, and thus it is considered a solar analog. The luminosity class 'V' means this is a main sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of the outer envelope of HD 44594 is 5,840K, which is giving it the characteristic yellow hue of a G-type star.|$|E
25|$|A Class 3B laser is {{hazardous}} if the eye {{is exposed}} directly, but diffuse reflections such as those from paper or other matte surfaces are not harmful. The AEL for continuous lasers in the <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> from 315nm to far infrared is 0.5W. For pulsed lasers between 400 and 700nm, the limit is 30mJ. Other limits apply to other wavelengths and to ultrashort pulsed lasers. Protective eyewear is typically required where direct viewing of a class3B laser beam may occur. Class-3B lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Class3B lasers are used inside CD and DVD writers, although the writer unit itself is class1 because the laser light cannot leave the unit.|$|E

50|$|Microwave and Optical Technology Letters is {{a monthly}} peer-reviewed {{scientific}} journal published by Wiley-Blackwell. The editor-in-chief is Kai Chang (Texas A&M University). The journal covers technology that operates in <b>wavelengths</b> <b>ranging</b> from radio frequency to the optical domain.|$|R
25|$|Spatially encoded {{frequency}} domain OCT (SEFD-OCT, spectral domain or Fourier domain OCT) extracts spectral information by distributing different optical frequencies onto a detector stripe (line-array CCD or CMOS) via a dispersive element (see Fig. 4). Thereby the information {{of the full}} depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR (signal to noise ratio) advantage of ~10 dB at much higher speeds. This is {{not much of a}} problem when working at 1300nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this <b>wavelength</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
25|$|Raman {{amplifiers}} {{have some}} fundamental advantages. First, Raman gain exists in every fiber, {{which provides a}} cost-effective means of upgrading from the terminal ends. Second, the gain is nonresonant, which means that gain is available over the entire transparency region of the fiber ranging from approximately 0.3 to 2µm. A third advantage of Raman amplifiers is that the gain spectrum can be tailored by adjusting the pump wavelengths. For instance, multiple pump lines {{can be used to}} increase the optical bandwidth, and the pump distribution determines the gain flatness. Another advantage of Raman amplification {{is that it is a}} relatively broad-band amplifier with a bandwidth > 5 THz, and the gain is reasonably flat over a wide <b>wavelength</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet A (UVA) {{radiation}} {{is in the}} <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> 320 to 400nm. It is present more uniformly throughout the day, and throughout the year, than UVB. Most UVA is not blocked by the atmosphere's ozone layer. UVA causes the release of existing melanin from the melanocytes to combine with oxygen (oxidize) to create the actual tan color in the skin. It is blocked less than UVB by many sunscreens, but is blocked to some degree by clothing. UVA is known both to cause DNA damage and to be carcinogenic. However, it operates not by inducing direct DNA damage, but by producing reactive oxygen species which damage DNA indirectly. UVA (see above) induces a cosmetic tan but little extra melanin protection against sun damage, sun burn, or cancer.|$|E
25|$|Both {{visible and}} {{ultraviolet}} light cause photoinhibition, ultraviolet wavelengths being much more damaging. Some researchers consider ultraviolet and visible light induced photoinhibition as a two different reactions, while others stress {{the similarities between}} the inhibition reactions occurring under different <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
30|$|The C–SiO 2, C–ZnO and C–NiO {{samples were}} {{prepared}} by sol–gel techniques whose details are presented elsewhere [6, 7]. FTIR reflectance spectroscopy studies {{were performed on}} the samples using a Bomem DA 8 spectrometer in the near infrared and the infrared <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges</b> (2.5 – 20 μm) and a Lambda 900 spectrophotometer in the ultraviolet and visible <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges</b> (0.3 – 2.5 μm). Raman spectroscopy was also used to study these samples using a Jobin-Y von T 64000 Raman spectrometer. The observations from the FTIR and Raman spectroscopy studies have been corroborated, wherever possible, by structural analysis techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), cross-sectional high resolution transmission electron microscopy (X-HRTEM), and {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED).|$|R
50|$|The INFITEC or Wavelength Multiplex Technology (WMT) {{is based}} on the fact that the visible light {{spectrum}} can be divided into different <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges</b> using steep-edged optical filters. Some of these <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges</b> are presented to the left eye, the others to the right eye. By an appropriate design of the transmission spectra of the filters it can be ensured that both eyes are reached by wavelengths in the red, green, and blue range of the visible light, so both eyes will see a fully colored image. Such multi-bandpass optical filters can currently be made only as so called interference filters. The WMT requires filters for the glasses as well as for the projectors (except laser projectors).|$|R
25|$|The {{classification}} of a laser {{is based on}} the concept of accessible emission limits (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> and exposure time that passes through a specified aperture stop at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 μm, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It {{is the responsibility of the}} manufacturer to provide the correct {{classification of}} a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate warning labels and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or attenuator, and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an emergency stop or interlock.|$|E
25|$|Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) will {{measure the}} {{mid-infrared}} <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> from 5 to 27 micrometers. It contains both a mid-infrared camera and an imaging spectrometer. MIRI was {{developed as a}} collaboration between NASA and a consortium of European countries, and is led by George Rieke (University of Arizona) and Gillian Wright (UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Edinburgh, part of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)). MIRI features similar wheel mechanisms as NIRSpec which are also developed and built by Carl Zeiss Optronics GmbH under contract from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg. The completed Optical Bench Assembly of MIRI was delivered to Goddard in mid-2012 for eventual integration into the ISIM. The temperature of the MIRI must not exceed 6 Kelvin (K): a helium gas mechanical cooler sited on the warm side of the environmental shield provides this cooling.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{location}} of the upper two cloud layers is somewhat controversial. Methane clouds were directly detected by Voyager 2 at 1.2–1.3bar by radio occultation. This result was later confirmed by {{an analysis of the}} Voyager 2 limb images. The top of the deeper ammonia/hydrogen sulfide clouds were determined to be at 3bar based on the spectroscopic data in the visible and near-infra spectral ranges (0.5–1μm). However a recent analysis of the spectroscopic data in the <b>wavelength</b> <b>range</b> 1–2.3μm placed the methane cloudtops at 2bar, and the top of the lower clouds at 6bar. This contradiction may be resolved when new data on methane absorption in Uranus's atmosphere are available. The optical depth of the two upper cloud layers varies with latitude: both become thinner at the poles as compared to the equator, though in 2007 the methane cloud layer's optical depth had a local maximum at 45°S, where the southern polar collar is located (see below).|$|E
3000|$|If RS is {{constant}} for small <b>wavelength</b> <b>ranges</b> and the exponential approaches 1, {{meaning that the}} absorption is low, {{it can be seen}} that dR/d 0.5 em [...] is directly dependent on the distance that the light travels in the material, namely δ.|$|R
