500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{of the basic}} instrumental tracks for Wrapped in Red took place in Kurstin's Echo Studio in Los Angeles while orchestral sessions were recorded at EastWest Studios in Hollywood and featured vocals recorded in The Barn studio in Nashville. In recording tracks for the album, Clarkson and Kurstin wanted to showcase as many different styles as they could by experimenting in various sounds and styles to create fresh, contemporary sound to classic-sounding music. Kurstin recalled: [...] "It {{was a lot of}} fun for us because <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to our roots. When Kelly started singing, it was clear she had the chops and had been trained to do anything." [...] He further added: [...] "We really experimented. It was so much fun and liberating. And it pays off." [...] Kurstin, who studied with jazz musician Jaki Byard at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, recruited various jazz and soul musicians such as James Gadson, Kevin Dukes, Roy McCurdy, and Bill Withers to perform on the record to resonate a Memphis soul sound. He also collaborated with Joseph Trapanese to arrange and conduct a chamber orchestra.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{composition}} begun after Strange Music label-mate ¡Mayday! sent Tech N9ne {{the song}} with their and Kendall Morgan's vocals on it. He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

60|$|It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a {{grindstone}} nuther; but {{we allowed}} we'd tackle it. It warn't quite midnight yet, so we cleared {{out for the}} mill, leaving Jim at work. We smouched the grindstone, {{and set out to}} roll her home, but it was a most nation tough job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time. Tom {{said she was going to}} get one of us, sure, before we got through. We got her half way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat. We see it warn't no use; <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and fetch Jim. So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck, and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom superintended. He could out-superintend any boy I ever see. He knowed how to do everything.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the things}} that made The Spice Trail so watchable was the enthusiasm - the effusiveness - of all involved. No one looked like they'd been kowtowed into it by some executive.

But yeah, we’ve been cool since probably first grade, but the birth of The Doppelgangaz took place around 2008, and between 2009 and 2011 is when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> balls deep and that’s what we plan to do from here on out.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} was filmed in Rhodes, Greece. The video shows the group partying whilst holidaying at a resort. Speaking to Capital FM, Frankie Sandford said, It was Saturdays' first two-day video shoot which was cool. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away to Rhodes with First Choice, which was great. It {{just so happens}} {{the one that we}} had to shoot on the beach was {{stretched}} over two days, which was no bad thing!The video was released on 29 June 2014.

5000|$|It is also notable {{that the}} {{programme}} lasted {{just short of}} 3.5 hours. This was mainly due to the extremely long voting procedure, where 39 countries voted, reading out every single score. Many people, including United Kingdom commentator Terry Wogan, noticed this and commented about the marathon-like voting procedure, when Russia voted he stated [...] "How many more countries have <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go?</b> What time is it?". Because the show overran so badly, the EBU changed the way the votes were announced in 2006 into a much shorter method, where only the top 3 scores were read out (the rest appeared on the scoreboard automatically).|$|E
5000|$|Reflecting on {{the album}} in a 2016 {{interview}} with Alternative Press, guitarist Ben Bruce commented on the significant change in atmosphere upon recording their newest record, The Black, in comparison to From Death to Destiny, stating he felt the band were [...] "in a different mindset than we were for From Death To Destiny. Danny clearly didn’t {{want to be in}} the band and it was just a struggle the whole time. On From Death To Destiny, Danny just flat out refused to sing or scream over the songs we would write, so we had to make some huge compromises with that record. The Black <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to our roots. It was a lot of fun doing Black." ...|$|E
5000|$|Beck {{exploded}} {{onto the}} NHL {{scene with the}} Rockies, racking up 22 goals (a higher total {{than he had ever}} achieved in junior) which set an NHL rookie record for goals by a defenceman. More importantly, the Rockies secured their first-ever playoff berth. Beck capped off the successful season by being the runner up to Mike Bossy for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's top first year player. [...] Beck thoroughly enjoyed his time in the Mile High State. [...] "There wasn't any pressure on me (in Colorado)," [...] Beck recalled. [...] "For one thing, there was hardly any media coverage, and there weren't very many fans. The first year was great. We'd just party and have a good time. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to all the nice bars, I could buy a nice car, and we had a great apartment (he roomed with Randy Pierce). I think when you are 21 that is about as good as it can get. When we made the playoffs that year, it was even more exciting!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> nearly <b>to</b> the gate, I says: 'We {{might meet}} {{somebody}} now, Andy. I reckon you better take 'em off, and--' Hey?

6000|$|Sewell nodded. [...] "Our {{friend has}} hit it; <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> slow," [...] he said.

Walker responded jokingly, [...] "Well, we did it before, if we need to do it again, I don't have a qualm about it." [...] Later, Walker met with the editors of the Greensboro News & Record to tell them, [...] "Being someone who is not a career politician, I’ve learned there are different environments that are a little more heated in context.

40|$|On January 18, 2016, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Democratic presidential {{candidate}} Bernie Sanders told a boisterous crowd in Birmingham, Alabama, that <b>we</b> “have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>to</b> our white working class friends… and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>to</b> {{our brothers and}} sisters there and say, ‘Stop voting against your own best interest. ’” Why did these white working class southerners stop voting for the Democratic Party in the first place? To answer this question, we have to turn to the 1970 s, when a post-segregationist order emerged in the southern states. On the one hand, the era tells us the story of racial reconciliation and economic prosperity in the Sunbelt South. Southern voters began electing progressive Democrats to office, such as Dale Bumpers in Arkansas, Reubin Askew in Florida, Bill Waller in Mississippi, and John West in South Carolina. On the other, it was a period when the traditions of the Jim Crow South still had a powerful voice. The classical phase {{of the civil rights movement}} (1954 - 1965) has often been dubbed the Second Reconstruction. Did the seventies usher into the Second Redemption, when minority interests were pushed aside for national reconciliation between North and South? Why were the liberal southern politicians elected in the early and mid- 1970 s unable to hold their ground? My paper examines the eventual failure of progressive political change in a region that showed promise for such a metamorphosis once the last vestiges of institutionalized segregation collapsed there at the end of the 1960 s...|$|R

We told her a little of the truth, and a little, I'm afraid, which was an exaggeration. Anyhow, we kept her quiet, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> England for us with Toquet. They had a very narrow shave down at Runton, by the by." ...|$|R
