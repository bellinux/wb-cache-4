The SDG, which became the most powerful paramilitary formation in eastern Slavonia, and Ražnatović gained notoriety for <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> and ethnic cleansing.

Ražnatović was never charged for any <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> committed by the SDG in Erdut. The ICTY only charged him with several <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> committed in or near Sanski Most.
