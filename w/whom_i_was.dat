"For an eighteen-year-old bowler I {{was unusually}} fast, and enjoyed terrorising our opponents, be they schoolboys (8 wickets for 2 runs and 7 for 11 {{stick in the}} memory) or, better still, the {{teachers}} in the annual staff match. This, I gather, used to be a friendly affair until I turned up, and I relished the chance to settle a few scores on behalf of my friends – for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the equivalent of a hired assassin – as well as for myself." ...|$|E

500|$|Unable {{to return}} to Lichfield Grammar School, Johnson was enrolled, {{with the help of}} Ford and his {{half-brother}} Gregory Hickman, into the King Edward VI grammar school at Stourbridge. The headmaster was John Wentworth, and he took care to work with Johnson on his translation exercises. Because the school was located near Pedmore, Johnson was able {{to spend more time with}} the Fords and get to know his other relatives in the area. During this time he began writing poems and produced many verse translations. However, he spent only six months at Stourbridge before returning once again to his parents' home in 1727. When Boswell was writing his Life of Samuel Johnson, he was told by Johnson's school friend Edmund Hector Johnson's leaving the Stourbridge school was due in part to a fight Johnson and Wentworth had over Latin grammar. For companionship, Johnson spent time with Hector and John Taylor, two of his schoolfriends, and he soon fell in love with Hector's younger sister, Ann. This first love was not to last, and Johnson later claimed to Boswell, [...] "She was the first woman with <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in love. It dropped out of my head imperceptibly, but she and I shall always have a kindness for each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|From an {{interview}} with Louella Parson in 1922: I {{will be out in}} California when Mr. DeMille begins operations. [...] Under my old contract I furnished eight continuities a year; now that I work only for William DeMille I only write four. [...] That gives me an opportunity to see my work through from the story to the screen. [...] It makes it possible for me to go over my script scene by scene with the producer, so he can make the picture with almost no changes. [...] In the old days I had to keep my nose to the grindstone continually so as to finish the eight pictures in time for the different directors for <b>whom</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> writing.|$|E
