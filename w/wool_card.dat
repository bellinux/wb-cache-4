50|$|Iron wire {{had many}} uses, perhaps none more {{important}} than the making of <b>wool</b> <b>cards</b> which were essential to Britain’s important wool industry. However, at this time, the methods for producing iron wire in England were traditional ones, inferior to methods that had been long been in use on the European Continent. The main technical barrier was a lack of knowledge about how to produce ‘Osmond iron,’ a high-quality iron essential to producing fine, relatively thin and malleable iron wire.|$|R

With this knowledge he redesigned and invented machinery and techniques for modern use to make the mill more productive.

Later he added curry cards (combs for cattle), <b>wool</b> <b>cards,</b> ice cream freezers, and Shaker-style pantry boxes.|$|R
50|$|Wire {{was drawn}} in England from the medieval period. The wire {{was used to}} make <b>wool</b> <b>cards</b> and pins, {{manufactured}} goods whose import was prohibited by Edward IV in 1463.

His wife also spun linen thread in the same mill. The Clarks sold their mill to James Horsley in 1804 and moved to Canada. By this time Clark's grist mill had been fitted with a <b>wool</b> <b>carding</b> machine, installed by Bethuel Harris and Abel Twitchell.
