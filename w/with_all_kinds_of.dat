25|$|The young {{science of}} archaeology, has also benefited from many Danish contributions, with {{prominent}} {{scholars such as}} Sophus Müller (1846-1934), Georg F.L. Sarauw, J.J.A. Worsaae and Peter Glob. The contributions have often been of a fundamental nature, such as the discoveries of kitchen middens or bog bodies and their great potential for advancing archaeology. Christian Jürgensen Thomsen refined and introduced the now universally recognized three-age system, dividing eras of prehistory into the well-known Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age respectively. Danish archaeologists have contributed with many defining archaeological discoveries, such as the Kongemose culture, Maglemosian culture and the Ertebølle culture of the Nordic Stone Age {{and of course the}} Viking Age. With a great international engagement and a long tradition for interdisciplinary collaborations with anthropologists, geologists, zoologists, botanists, antiquarians and historians, Danish archaeologists have been, and still are, involved <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> cultural archaeology around the globe, including the Middle East (Peter Glob, Peter Rowley-Conwy), the Mediterranean region (Peter Oluf Brøndsted, Jörgen Zoega) the Americas (Peter Wilhelm Lund, Frans Blom, Rane Willerslev) and the Arctic region (Therkel Mathiassen, Erik Holtved, Eigil Knuth).|$|E

Commentators have broadly agreed that the work has had a greater impact in the concert hall than it has on the stage; many of Stravinsky's revisions to the music were made with the concert hall rather than the theatre in mind. The work has become a staple in the repertoires of all the leading orchestras, and has been cited by Leonard Bernstein as [...] "the most important piece of music of the 20th century".|$|E

500|$|Mackendrick {{assumed that}} Odets would need {{only two or}} three weeks to polish the script, but he took four months. The {{director}} recalled, [...] "We started shooting with no final script at all, while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern". The plot was largely intact, but in Mackendrick's biography he is quoted from Notes on Sweet Smell of Success: [...] "What Clifford did, in effect, was dismantle the structure of every single sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex, had much greater tension and more dramatic energy". This process took time, and the start date for the production could not be delayed. Odets had to accompany the production to Manhattan and continued rewriting while they shot there. Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> rituals as he worked at a furious pace, with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day. Mackendrick said, [...] "So we cut the script there on the floor, with the actors, just cutting down lines, making them more spare – what Clifford would have done himself, really, had there been time".|$|E

[...] Amidst the amount of heavier tracks and themes Grohl decided to include the song [...] "Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)", described as [...] "the most light-hearted, melodic song of all" [...] which [...] "seemed like a little ray of hope in the middle of all this despair." [...] Grohl added that there was a bigger focus on melodies even in heavier tracks such as [...] "The Pretender", [...] "Let It Die" [...] and [...] "Erase/Replace", and that album closer [...] "Home", a ballad featuring Grohl on the piano, was [...] "the best song I've ever written".|$|E

500|$|When {{brainstorming}} {{ideas for}} the new Far Cry game, the development team originally planned on developing a direct sequel to Far Cry 3. The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would extend upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as Far Cry 3s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not {{what they wanted to}} achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a “we want it all” approach, in which they hoped to experiment <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> ideas. Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's verticality. The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with [...] "exotic mountainsides" [...] and [...] "unique culture". This led to the concept of a mountainous setting and the introduction of elephants in the game. The developers aimed for players to consider Far Cry 4 a standalone experience, and therefore they avoided bringing back any characters from Far Cry 3 except for Hurk. The decision to bring Hurk back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated [...] "Director Peter Jackson, at home <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> excess in New Zealand, keeps {{everything}} spinning nicely, {{not even}} losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times enjoyed The Frighteners, but [...] "walked out the theater with mixed emotions," [...] she commented that [...] "Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert, imaginative effects than for his live actors anyhow. These lively touches would leave The Frighteners {{looking more like}} a more frantic Beetlejuice if Jackson's film weren't so wearyingly overcrowded. The Frighteners is not immune to overkill, {{even though most of}} its characters are already dead." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News praised the acting in the film, with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular, but said that there were also [...] "bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things to a screeching halt", and that if [...] "Jackson had used the restraint he showed in Heavenly Creatures, the movie could have [...] "been the best of its kind". Critic Christopher Null praised the film, as he described it as a mixture between Ghostbusters and Twin Peaks. Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film wouldn't make Jackson's top five of movies, it [...] "is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you'll enjoy casually watching from time to time". The Frighteners received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson's native country, New Zealand.|$|E
