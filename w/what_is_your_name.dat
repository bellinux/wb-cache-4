40|$|Sorry, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> again, {{or how to}} {{overcome}} the tip-of-the tongue problem {{with the help of}} a computer? A speaker or writer has to find words for expressing his thoughts. Yet, knowing a word does not guarantee its access. Who hasn’t experienced the problem of looking for a word he knows, yet is unable to access (in time) ? Work done by psychologists reveals that people being in this so called tip-of-the-tongue state (TOT) know a lot about the word: meaning, number of syllables, origine, etc. Speakers are generally able to recognize the word, and if they produce an erroneous word, that token shares many things with the target word (initial/final letter/phoneme, part of speech, semantic field, etc.). This being so, one might want to take advantage of the situation and build a program that assists the speaker/writer by revealing the word that’s on his/her mind (tongue/pen). Three methods will be presented, the first one being implemented. 1 The context or starting point I’m currently involved in a project (PA-PILLON) 1 whose goal is to build a huge multilingual lexical data-base (English-French-Japanese, Thai) from which one can extract digital bilingual dictionaries. The latter can be customized to fit different needs: dictionaries to be used by people vs. dictionaries to be used by machines (e. g. automatic translation). One of the ideas is to enhance this dictionary by adding certain functions, in order to capitalize on the data. Rather than being...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, of course," [...] {{she replied}} lightly; [...] "I have friends everywhere. Their {{political}} views {{have nothing to}} do with me.

You see, citizen St. Just, I never inquired of you <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>your</b> views. <b>Your</b> <b>name</b> and kinship would proclaim you a partisan of citizen Robespierre, yet I find you in the company of M. de Batz; and you tell me that you live in England." ...|$|R
