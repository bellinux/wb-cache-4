5|$|For {{more than}} eight decades, the Toronto Argonauts Football Club was the sole {{property}} of its namesake rowing club. By the 1950s, the team's complex management structure made the arrangement increasingly awkward. Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking, the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John Bassett, Eric Cradock, and Charlie Burns in 1957. Each held about 20% share in the company, with the balance made up by small investors <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> affinity with the club; the initial agreement called for a long-term debenture of $400,000 {{to be set up}} that would sustain the rowing club in the absence of its football income. Bassett was the operating head of the franchise and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos, but Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive. He would sell his share to Len Lumbers just two years into his tenure in part because of Bassett's controlling nature. Bassett arranged a complete buyout of the other shareholders for $2.31 million in 1971 through his holdings in Baton Broadcasting.|$|E

5|$|Theophilos now sent {{a second}} embassy to the caliph, {{headed by the}} tourmarches of Charsianon, Basil, bearing gifts and an apologetic letter, and {{offering}} to ransom the high-ranking prisoners for 20,000 Byzantine pounds (about 6,500kg) of gold and to release all Arabs held captive by the Byzantines. In reply, Mu'tasim refused the ransom, saying that the expedition alone had cost him over 100,000 pounds, and demanded the surrender of Theophobos and the Domestic of the Schools, Manuel the Armenian, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> years ago deserted from Arab service. The Byzantine ambassador refused to comply to this and indeed could not, as Theophobos was in revolt and Manuel had died, according to some accounts, from wounds received at Anzen. Instead, Basil handed over a second, much more threatening letter by Theophilos. Mu'tasim, angered by this, returned the emperor's gifts.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the surrealists of London and Birmingham improved greatly with the arrival in London in mid-1938 of the Belgian E. L. T.

25|$|Among the {{individuals}} who had briefly abandoned Jamestown was John Rolfe, a Sea Venture survivor who had lost {{his wife and son}} in Bermuda. He was a businessman from London <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> untried seeds for new, sweeter strains of tobacco with him, as well as some untried marketing ideas. It would turn out that John Rolfe held the key to the Colony's economic success. By 1612, Rolfe's new strains of tobacco had been successfully cultivated and exported, establishing a first cash crop for export. Plantations and new outposts sprung up, initially both upriver and downriver along the navigable portion of the James, and thereafter along the other rivers and waterways of the area. The settlement at Jamestown could finally be considered permanently established.|$|E

25|$|Tryon showed {{concern for}} the {{wellbeing}} of his men and the better ordering of the Navy. Before Raleigh had left England, thirty men had deserted from the ship, and more {{took the opportunity to}} escape from ships of the squadron at Montevideo. Tryon wrote a memo to the Admiralty recommending that the penalties for desertion should be reduced, suggesting that a number of those deserting were of little use to the navy and should be let go, while others who were good seamen, but <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> urgent personal reason for absconding, were afraid to return later because of the severe penalties. He also instituted a programme of weighing his men and ensuring they got enough food, noting that if, as frequently happened on board ship, the men weighed less by the end of a tour than at the start, then likely their strength and fitness was reduced too. He instituted a 'dry canteen' on board to try to improve their diet.|$|E
25|$|In July 1309, Pope Clement V {{confirmed}} Henry's election. He {{agreed to}} crown Henry Emperor at Candlemas 1312 personally, the title having been vacant {{since the death}} of Frederick II. Henry in exchange, swore an oath of protection to the Pope, agreed to defend the rights and not attack the privileges of the cities of the Papal States, and also agreed to go on Crusade once he had been crowned emperor. Yet the newly crowned king had local issues to deal with before he could seek the imperial crown. Henry was approached by part of the Bohemian nobility and some important and influential ecclesiastics to intervene in Bohemia. Unhappy with the rule of Henry of Carinthia, and wary of the claims of the Habsburgs <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> legitimate claim on the crown, they convinced Henry to marry his son John I, Count of Luxemburg to Elizabeth, the daughter of Wenceslas II, and so establish a claim to the Bohemian crown. In July 1310 he engineered the removal of Henry of Carinthia. On 15 August 1309, Henry VII announced his intention to travel to Rome, having sent his ambassadors to Italy to prepare for his arrival, and so consequently expected his troops to be ready to travel by 1 October 1310. Prior to leaving Germany, he sought to smooth relations with the Habsburgs, who had been forced against their will to accept the accession of Henry’s son in Bohemia, cowed by the threats of making the Duchy of Austria dependent on the Bohemian crown. He therefore confirmed them in their imperial fiefs by October 1309; in exchange, Leopold of Habsburg agreed to accompany Henry in his Italian expedition, and to provide a body of troops as well.|$|E
500|$|On February 6, Grant wired Halleck: [...] "Fort Henry is ours.... I shall {{take and}} destroy Fort Donelson on the 8th {{and return to}} Fort Henry." [...] This self-imposed {{deadline}} was overly optimistic due to three factors: miserable road conditions on the twelve-mile march to Donelson, the need for troops to carry supplies away from the rising flood waters (by February 8, Fort Henry was completely submerged), and the damage that had been sustained by Foote's Western Gunboat Flotilla in the artillery duel at Fort Henry. If Grant {{had been able to}} move quickly, he might have taken Fort Donelson on February 8. Early in the morning of February 11, Grant held a council of war in which all of his generals supported his plans for an attack on Fort Donelson, with the exception of Brig. Gen. John A. McClernand, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> reservations. This council in early 1862 was the last one that Grant held {{for the remainder of the}} Civil War.|$|E

500|$|On page 17 of the book, Jolyon Wagg {{mentions}} Castafiore's Emerald to be a gift from, {{in his own}} words, [...] "some character, Marjorie {{something or}} other...", to which Castafiore corrects Wagg by saying {{it was from the}} Maharajah of Gopal. The Maharajah of Gopal does not make an appearance in The Adventures of Tintin, but {{is one of the main}} characters in The Valley of the Cobras (1956), which is a part of another Franco-Belgian comics series created by Hergé, The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko (1935-1958). Hergé also introduced the Romani people, members of whose community had previously appeared in Destination New York (1951), another book from The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko. The idea of including them in the story was inspired by an occasion on which Hergé came across a Romani gypsy camp near to his country home in Céroux-Mousty. To ensure that his depiction of them had some accuracy, he approached Father Rupert in Verviers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> experience with the community, reassuring him that [...] "The episode with the Romas will not pain you".|$|E
500|$|Sophia Brittan {{inherited}} {{the house and}} land from her late husband. Initially, {{it was left to}} her son Frank to run the farm. In 1868, there were rumours that William Sefton Moorhouse would resign as Canterbury Superintendent, and Rolleston was encouraged to make himself available. He returned to Christchurch, whilst his wife Mary and their two children remained in Wellington. Rolleston was elected unopposed on 22 May 1868. And on 8 June, he was elected to Parliament in the [...] in the [...] electorate. Late in 1868, the Rollestons moved back to Christchurch to live at Linwood House. [...] This was a delicate affair, as this made conditions cramped (Sophia, her sons Joe and Frank, the Rollestons with their two children, plus servants made for cramped living in the eight rooms), and there has always been tension between William Rolleston and Frank Brittan. Mary Rolleston arranged for her oldest brother Joe, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>some</b> disability, to live with his aunt, Mrs Fooks. Charles Fooks was imprisoned at that time, and it was good for Mrs Fooks to have a male live with her. The Rollestons paid rent, which helped Sophia Brittan service the mortgage. With Rolleston Superintendent until the abolition of Provincial Government at the end of 1876, Linwood House hosted many important social and political functions.|$|E
