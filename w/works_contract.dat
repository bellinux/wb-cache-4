Newport were unbeaten throughout that campaign, which was later dubbed their [...] "invincible" [...] season. Gould captained Newport between 1893–94, when the team lost only three games, and in the 1894–95 season, in which the club lost only to Llanelli. During his first period as captain, 1893–94, Gould scored 37 tries in 24 games, a club record that still stands as of 2013. Although records before 1886 are incomplete, Newport RFC acknowledge Gould's scoring record at the club between the 1882–83 and 1898–99 seasons as 159 tries, 66 conversions, 61 dropped goals and a single penalty, over 231 appearances.|$|E

40|$|Non-renewable {{fixed-term}} {{and agency}} <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> {{are becoming more}} used instead of the traditional Russian model of open-ended employment. The authors examine the influence of institutional and organizational factors {{on the use of}} two forms of non-standard <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> in Russia with data from a Survey covering 3313 enterprises for the years 2009 to 2011. Probit and Tobit regressions are used to test several hypotheses about the use of non-standard <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> derived from the literature. The results indicate that state-owned and unionized enterprises are more likely to use fixed-term contracts; and a high level of perceived dismissal protection for permanent workers is positively associated with fixed-term contracts use. The incidence and intensity of fixed-term and agency <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> are lower at enterprises with flexible wages. A significant impact of organizational factors is confirmed only for fixed-term contracts. Enterprises use less fixed-term contracts, if they have workers with tenure from 5 to 10 years and high job complexity...|$|R

2500|$|He {{lost his}} {{position}} in March 1899, following Sturdza's fall from power over a scandal involving relations between Romanian and Austria-Hungary. Consequently, he welcomed the remaining [...] "generous ones" [...] inside the PNL as the PSDMR was dissolved (April 1899); those socialists who remained independent continued to consider Stere the main instigator of the move. At the time, he relied on what he interpreted as Ion I. C. Brătianu's promise that a PNL cabinet was going to enforce both universal suffrage and land reform, and hoped to exercise an influence on the party's Left. With Pherekyde, Petre Poni, Toma Stelian and Spiru Haret, Stere was soon involved in public protests against the successive Conservative cabinets of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino and Petre P. Carp— provoked by the Hallier Affair— involving a French firm which used its government connections to regain a public <b>works</b> <b>contract</b> in the port of Constanța, although it had failed to respect its obligations—, and the [...] "Law on spirits" [...] (or [...] "law on țuica")— which established homebrewing tax, engendering violence in the countryside.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} tap the Awali River to the Southeast of Beirut to provide the growing capital with 90 million m3/year of additional water, {{more than double the}} current resources. The project involves the construction of a dam at Bisri, a 3km tunnel from the river to a new water treatment plant at Ouardaniye, and a second 22km tunnel to Khalde south of Beirut, from where water will be transported through two twin pipelines, one going North to the center of Beirut and the second northeast to Baabda. The Islamic Development Bank has agreed to finance the construction of Bisri dam in 2008, while the World Bank has approved a US$200m loan [...] in December 2010 to partly finance the transmission tunnels and pipelines. Lebanese critics of the project argue that the Awali River and especially the Litani River, from which water is diverted to the Awali River upstream of the planned intake, are highly polluted. They also say that less expensive alternatives, such as the less polluted Damour River that is also closer to Beirut, were not considered by the government and the World Bank. As of December 2013, less than 1 percent of the loan has been disbursed and no civil <b>works</b> <b>contract</b> has been awarded.|$|E

40|$|Great social {{inequality}} {{has been one}} of the worrisome features of economic development in Latin America. This study focuses on Chile, one of Latin America's fastest growing economies with one of the highest levels of income inequality during the 1990 s. Using micro-level data from the 1994 and 2000 Encuestas de Caracterizacion Socio-Economica, this article examines the role of <b>work</b> <b>contracts</b> in explaining male and female earnings and earnings inequality among wage and salary workers over the second half of the 1990 s. The analysis distinguishes between wage and salary work without a <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> - referred to as 'informal' work, and wage and salary work with a <b>work</b> <b>contract.</b> Within the latter group, the study further differentiates by the type of <b>work</b> <b>contract</b> held, such as permanent and a variety of contingent <b>work</b> <b>contracts.</b> The findings reveal that the majority of employees in informal and contingent wage and salary work arrangements earned significantly less than their permanent counterparts. Additionally, informal and contingent wage and salary work arrangements accounted for a small, although increasing, fraction of male and female earnings inequality from 1994 to 2000. Finally, the proliferation of seasonal, fixed-term, and informal wage and salary work arrangements {{has been one of}} the few economically significant factors in explaining changes in male and female earnings inequality over the second half of the 1990 s. ...|$|R

Further, pattern of returns to education for casual labourers were found to decrease with increasing educational levels and was negative for higher education. Such a trend was no t noticed among wage employees, where pattern that was similar with other studies focusing on the whole labour market. returns to education, wages, particular labour markets, Labor and Human Capital, J 3, J 4,...|$|R
