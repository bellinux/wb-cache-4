5|$|The Song dynasty (960–1279 AD) was a {{culturally}} rich and sophisticated age for China. There was blossoming of and advancements {{in the visual}} arts, music, literature, and philosophy.

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming.

Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston to take over this training for all pilots destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands. Conversion training for Flying Boats was also given there.|$|E

5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation).

In 2011 Lawrence Manker, Jr., an Imperial Sugar worker <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> 70 surgeries for burns covering 85% of his body after the plant explosion, settled his lawsuit with the company for an undisclosed amount.

5|$|Residents of Madagascar could accuse {{one another}} of various crimes, {{including}} theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, {{for which the}} ordeal of tangena was routinely obligatory. On average, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of those <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> the ordeal died. In the 1820s, the tangena ordeal caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861. In 1838, {{it was estimated that}} as many as 100,000 people in Imerina {{died as a result of}} the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population.

5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from the clutches of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{reported}} beneficial effects of spirituality {{on the lives}} of patients with schizophrenia, major depression, and other psychotic disorders.

25|$|The breast implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed breast cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the breast implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study Breast Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed breast cancer after undergoing breast augmentation, when compared to breast cancer patients who had not undergone breast augmentation. The metadata study Breast Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage Breast Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that breast augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from breast cancer. Although the use of implants for breast reconstruction after breast cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|E

25|$|Gene therapy {{had been}} {{considered}} a possibility for curative treatment for OTC deficiency, and clinical trials were taking place at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1990s.

Currently, the only option for curing OTC deficiency is a liver transplant, which restores normal enzyme activity. A 2005 review of 51 patients with OTC deficiency <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> liver transplant estimated 5-year survival rates of greater than 90%. Severe cases of OTC deficiency are typically evaluated for liver transplant by 6 months of age.|$|E
25|$|In the past, LGS {{patients}} were considered de facto as non eligible for epilepsy curative surgery, as scientists were thinking the LGS was a fully generalized epilepsy in all cases.

Two studies on LGS patients series <b>who</b> <b>underwent</b> curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom (Engel class I) for 80% {{of these patients}} below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Nevertheless, like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur {{in the years following}} surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period.|$|E
