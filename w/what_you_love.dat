500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You {{have to watch out}} for those curves. [...] music comes out, and how do you stay true to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>love?</b> I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, but you should never take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E

2500|$|I wouldn't {{know what}} to do with [...] Colour to me is too real. It's limiting. It doesn't allow too much of a dream. The more you throw black into a colour, the more dreamy it gets... Black has depth. It's like a little egress; you can go into it, and because it keeps on {{continuing}} to be dark, the mind kicks in, and a lot of things that are going on in there become manifest. And you start seeing what you're afraid of. You start seeing <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>love,</b> and it becomes like a dream.|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{pressure}} of matching [...] "Call Me Maybe"'s success, Jepsen recorded an entire indie-folk album during her run on Cinderella {{as an act of}} [...] "rebellion". The effort was scrapped as Jepsen felt like it was developed for the wrong reasons: [...] "I think there is a natural rebellion when you have success in one area to completely rebel against that. I needed to get that out of my system, I think. I made really weird music." [...] Her work on the musical provided valuable perspective in terms of being defined by a singular song, particularly from her costar Fran Drescher: [...] "Everyone still calls her 'the Nanny'. I realized you can't give in to other people's perception of you. Everyone's gonna be known for something."" [...] had to not be about trying to prove something. I feel like if you're writing music just to have a different identity in the public's eye, it's sort of the wrong motive. It's gotta be coming from a place of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> and what you're passionate about."Jepsen sketched many of the album's demos on her tour bus while supporting Kiss, completing three by June 2013. Of these, [...] "Boy Problems" [...] would eventually finalize its form with Sia and Greg Kurstin. [...] "I Didn't Just Come Here to Dance" [...] existed as early as 2011 according to matching lyrics on a tweet authored by Jepsen. It would eventually be presented to Max Martin after the pair finished work on [...] "Tonight I'm Getting Over You" [...] in 2012; intending to cease their session at midnight, the song compelled Martin to stay for two extra hours. It was confirmed that she had worked with Josh Ramsay, Ryan Stewart, Benny Blanco and Stargate, though none of these producers appeared on the finalized project.|$|E
2500|$|Richie {{said that}} about halfway through the reveal episode, Alfie [...] "resigns himself {{to the fact that}} it's over between Kat and Alfie, there is no going back", and said that Neilson said halfway through the 15-minute scene that Alfie would be thinking, [...] "I {{understand}} you've done this with somebody... We can get over this... What do you mean... it's been going on for months? We can get over it, because I know you don't love him... <b>What,</b> <b>you</b> <b>love</b> this guy? It's someone we know? Someone in the pub...?", and said that Alfie needs to know who it is for his own peace of mind, though [...] "his whole life just crumbles in his hands". Richie said that viewers would be surprised by the final reveal, stating that [...] "it's really interesting about how we play the Branning card as to which one of them it is. The way it's worded, you believe it's one brother in particular and then that all changes and you go, 'oh it's him!' Because we make people believe it's another Branning—the way its worded, the way I face up to one of them. The audience will all think it's one person in particular, but then I throw a curve ball and it all kicks off. It's great." [...] Richie said that Alfie cannot understand why Kat is having an affair with Derek, which [...] "makes him sick". He also stated that viewers would find out in January 2013 why Kat had the affair with the person she did. He said: [...] "It's an ongoing story, which is really interesting, to see why Kat was with Alfie and why she went for this bloke because they both offer her different things." [...] Richie speculated that the reason Kat had an affair with Derek is [...] "because Derek is the total polar opposite of Alfie" [...] and Kat is [...] "attracted to danger", which is not like Alfie, and Kat is [...] "used to danger, she's used to excitement. What she got from Alfie was the fairytale, what she wanted was the nightmare". However, the reasons for Kat having the affair were never explained on screen.|$|E

6000|$|L. My dear, do {{you think}} any teacher could be worth your {{listening}} to, or anybody else's listening to, who had learned nothing, and altered his mind in nothing, from seven and twenty to seven and forty? But that second volume is very good for you {{as far as it}} goes. It is a great advance, and a thoroughly straight and swift one, to be led, as it is the main business of that second volume to lead you, from Dutch cattle-pieces, and ruffian-pieces, to Fra Angelico. And it is right for you also, as you grow older, to be strengthened in the general sense and judgment which may enable you to distinguish the weaknesses from the virtues of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>love,</b> else you might come to love both alike; or even the weaknesses without the virtues. You might end by liking Overbeck and Cornelius as well as Angelico. However, I have perhaps been leaning a little too much to the merely practical side of things, in to-night's talk; and you are always to remember, children, that I do not deny, though I cannot affirm, the spiritual advantages resulting, in certain cases, from enthusiastic religious reverie, and from the other practices of saints and anchorites. The evidence respecting them has never yet been honestly collected, much less dispassionately examined: but assuredly, there is in that direction a probability, and more than a probability, of dangerous error, while there is none whatever in the practice of an active, cheerful, and benevolent life. The hope of attaining a higher religious position, which induces us to encounter, for its exalted alternative, the risk of unhealthy error, is often, as I said, founded more on pride than piety; and those who, in modest usefulness, have accepted what seemed to them here the lowliest place in the kingdom of their Father, are not, I believe, the least likely to receive hereafter the command, then unmistakable, [...] "Friend, go up higher." ...|$|E
