5|$|According to {{the booklet}} Gandhi and Periyar Periyar <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> paper Kudi Arasu, in 1925, {{reporting}} {{on the fact that}} Gandhi was ousted from the Mahasabha, because he opposed resolutions for the maintaining of caste and Untouchability Laws which would spoil his efforts to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity. From this Gandhi learned the need of pleasing the Brahmins if anything was to be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Adler <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> memoir {{that the}} passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so that the role of Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.|$|E
60|$|What I {{still look}} at most, in {{connection}} with that Luggage, is the extraordinary quantity of writing-paper, and all written on! And not our paper neither,--not the paper charged in the bill, for we know our paper,--so {{he must have been}} always at it. And he had crumpled up this <b>writing</b> of <b>his,</b> everywhere, <b>in</b> every part and parcel of his luggage.

5|$|British {{documents}} {{show that the}} British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused {{about whether or not}} to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.|$|E
5|$|Gazan {{lawyer and}} church {{historian}} Sozomen, also {{a law student}} at Beirut, <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Historia Ecclesiastica about Triphyllius, a convert to Christendom who became the bishop of Nicosia. Triphyllius received juridic training in Beirut and was criticized by his teacher Saint Spyridon for his atticism and for using legal vocabulary instead of that of the Bible.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Scandinavia, Snorri Sturluson <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Prose Edda of ljósálfar and døkkálfar ('light-elves and dark-elves'), the ljósálfar {{living in}} the heavens and the døkkálfar under the earth. The {{consensus}} of modern scholarship is that Snorri's elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology.|$|E

5|$|While {{based on}} true events, {{a number of}} {{historical}} inaccuracies in the film have been noted. Early in the film, the four-man SEAL reconnaissance team is discovered by three goat herders—an elderly man and two teenage boys.

5|$|After the 2/48th Battalion {{completed}} its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica, they were moved further {{along the coast}} to Gazala. Then, just {{as they began to}} dig in, the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk in response to the German Afrika Korps' advance. They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> diary about his constant fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|Goodman {{was born}} and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where his father, George, was a printer and real estate agent. His mother, Ella, died of typhoid fever in early 1895 when Goodman was just three years old. He {{attended}} Central High School, graduating in 1909. He enjoyed writing and began keeping a detailed journal of daily activities during his senior year of high school, expressing his aspirations for the future along with occasional doubts. With several classmates, he began a literary club and published a newsletter, The Inkstand. He also showed interest in music, playing the piano and violin, and composed a song for his high school senior class. When it was not selected by the class officers, he <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> journal of his disappointment.|$|E

5|$|It was {{a serious}} {{allegation}} to make against a physician. Reich <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> diary that the mother had been attracted to him and had made the allegation to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's partners to do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Puerto Escondido, they {{continued}} {{up the coast}} to Loreto, where they restocked their supplies. They then visited the Coronado Islands, Concepcíon Bay and San Lucas Cove, collecting specimens at each stop. The work was exhausting; Steinbeck <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letters that he had little time for sleep because the collecting and preparation took so long. In the cramped quarters of the boat, all the equipment had {{to be set up}} and stowed each time the boat moved to a new anchorage, which made the work of cataloguing and processing the specimens doubly arduous.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski's wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski {{remarried}} soon after, {{taking the}} hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opalińska, daughter of future Crown Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage {{was the cause of}} his death; Joachim Jerlicz <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> diary that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac. His funeral was held in Brody on 30 April 1646.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with this at the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E
5|$|The British {{casualties}} were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but {{a member of}} Howe's staff <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> diary that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded. David McCullough gives much higher figures of 90 killed and 300 wounded. The Americans had about 30 killed and 100 wounded, including Knowlton and Major Andrew Leitch among the dead. The American victory raised morale in the ranks, even among {{those who had not}} been engaged. It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington's command.|$|E
5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had hurt them physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E
