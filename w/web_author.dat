Generally the classifiers ignore {{the minority}} instances while forming rule sets. The numerous real-world applications are affected by class imbalance problem wherein the number of samples in one class is very marginal compared to other classes [8 – 11]. Issues in fields related to software defect detection [12], threat supervision, medical judgment, <b>web</b> <b>author</b> identification [13] and similar have drawn attention towards concerns of multi-class imbalanced data sets. The representation of boundaries in imbalanced data sets is a difficult concern for learning algorithms. Skewed data partition is an integral issue for learning of classifiers.|$|E
40|$|Due to the web’s federated nature, users {{depend on}} the desktop to {{transfer}} data between sites. However, the desktop is centered around files, making it suboptimal for use with the web. We believe that in web-centric environments, users need new workspaces that enable a consistent interface for web data. As a step towards that goal, this paper proposes Cloudtop, a platform for building novel workspaces and expanding traditional drag-and-drop semantics {{for use in the}} cloud. Cloudtop introduces Webits, a data-type that promotes a uniform and extensible representation of web resources. Cloudtop uses plugins to extract semantic data from normal web pages to create Webits. Users drag and drop Webits between Cloudtop and the web to transfer data between sites.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} for personalized presentation of web-page content. The model {{is defined as a}} preference-based configuration process that is based on qualitative decision theory. This configuration process attempts to determine the optimal presentation of a web page while taking into account the preferences of the <b>web</b> <b>author</b> as well as viewer interaction with the browser. The preferences of the web-page author are represented by a CP-network, a graphical model developed in [2]. We present an implementation of our approach in a CPML system and discuss the implementation issues. 1 INTRODUCTION An important goal for web-page designers is the ability to provide viewer oriented personalization of web-page content. Two approaches to this problem are currently in use: (1) Learning user profiles; (2) Online information gathering by shared keywords. Both approaches are useful in particular applications, but as general solutions they have some important drawbacks: The [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We examine tagging {{behavior}} on Flickr, a public photosharing website. We build on previous qualitative research that exposed a taxonomy of tagging motivations, {{as well as}} on social presence research. The taxonomy suggests that motivations for tagging are tied to the intended target audience of the tags – the users themselves, family and friends, or the general public. Using multiple data sources, including a survey and independent system data, we examine which motivations are associated with tagging level, and estimate the magnitude of their contribution. We find that the levels of the Self and Public motivations, together with social presence indicators, are positively correlated with tagging level; Family & Friends motivations are not significantly correlated with tagging. The findings and the use of survey method carry implications for designers of tagging and other social systems on the <b>web.</b> <b>Author</b> Keywords Tags, Flickr, photo sharing, motivations, social presence...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse how author choices of journal in construction management are affected by quality and service perceptions. Seven journals were identified and for each 2006 article, one author e-mail address was extracted. A web based questionnaire was sent to 397 authors and 35 % responded. It was found that there were three journals regularly followed by at least half the respondents. Most of the other four journals have scopes broader than construction management and receive lower scores for characteristics such as impact on researchers. No open access journals were included, and authors in the field of construction management rarely post openly accessible copies of their manuscripts or publications on the <b>web.</b> <b>Author</b> ranking of journals for their next submission is found to be related to general criteria such as academic status, circulation figures and ISI indexation...|$|E

40|$|To {{discover}} how precisely links among researchers’ Web sites capture the ties of academic communities, this study conducts Web citation analysis. 3, 878 Web sites of computer scientists and their 8, 811 articles are assessed. 200 {{most frequently cited}} researchers from them are subjected to <b>Web</b> <b>author</b> cocitation analysis and compared to bibliographical data. As a result, a cluster of researchers on the Web becomes a superset of bibliographical one, that is, a community representing a larger research field. We then develop Web link ontology that defines various relationships among researchers to apply metadata annotation to the links among 200 sites. Findings: 1) since intellectual ties analysis separates off sociocognitive ties, it results into a better approximation of bibliographical author cocitation, 2) since sociocognitive ties analysis can utilize various links not only coauthor networks, diverse kinds of social connections can be found, 3) merging intellectual ties and sociocognitive ties analyses detect gatekeepers who bridges research fields on social networks. 1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>authoring</b> environments enable {{end-users}} {{to create}} applications that integrate information from other web sources. Users can create web sites that include built-in components to dynamically incorporate, for example, weather information, stock-quotes, or {{the latest news}} from different web sources. Recent surveys conducted among end-users have indicated an increasing interest in creating such applications. Unfortunately, <b>web</b> <b>authoring</b> environments do not provide support beyond a limited set of built-in components. This work addresses this limitation by providing end-user support for “clipping ” information from a target web site to incorporate it into the end-user site. The support consists of a mechanism to identify the target clipping with multiple markers to increase robustness, and a dynamic assessment of the retrieved information to quantify its reliability. The clipping approach has been integrated as a feature into a popular <b>web</b> <b>authoring</b> tool on which we present the results of two preliminary studies...|$|R

40|$|In {{the rapid}} {{emergence}} of globalization, e-commerce, and internet accessibility in remote {{parts of the}} world, ongoing feedback and participation from site visitors are essential for attaining clear and effective communication on a web site. This thesis presents a computational experiment for optimizing design of a webpage in an evolutionary manner. Webpage personalization {{is viewed as a}} configuration problem whose goal is to determine the optimal presentation of a webpage while taking into account the preference of the <b>web</b> <b>author</b> (designer), layout constraints (web design/editing language: HTML, CSS), and viewer interaction with the browser. The study proposes use of genetic algorithm-driven Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to assist the process of webpage design optimization. This method will engage visitors to remotely modify and enhance the style (type, layout and color) of web site to fit their aesthetic and functional representation of well-received design. The preference feedback from user will be stored in an application server for automated evolutionary selection process and reinitialized {{for the next generation of}} users. Through the experimentation of web prototype and user evaluation test, the implementation of this method is examined and the derived design solutions are analyzed based on web aesthetics, standards, and accessibility...|$|E
40|$|HyperScout, a Web application, is an {{intermediary}} between a server and a client. It intercepts a page to the client, gathers information on each link, and annotates each {{link with the}} discovered information. This paper reports {{on the development of}} HyperScout var UniSA, a development of the HyperScout model and application, that dramatically extends static and dynamic link annotations. Annotations provide the user with additional information, which they use to make better navigational choices. On the web, it is common for long lists of hyperlinks to be presented to the user, from which they select links to follow or ignore. The user's mental state in this situation is termed cognitive overhead, a potentially overwhelming condition. To assist the user in making their choice, various characteristics of a link may be presented to the user. Despite these characteristics being readily available from a number of sources, current web servers and browsers do not attempt to retrieve, let alone display, such attributes. To show that cognitive overhead is easily, and immediately, reducible, a number of techniques were explored. Development progressed from statically created annotations, through to dynamically generated annotations. The static annotations were implemented with a combination of tools available to every <b>web</b> <b>author.</b> It was found that, while simple enough for every author to implement, static annotations bearing static information would not be accurate or timely enough to guide the user. Therefore, information must be gathered dynamically. The solution is either {{an intermediary}} between server and client, or a more sophisticated browser...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 65 - 66). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Walden's Paths enables K- 12 teachers to incorporate Web-based information in their curriculum. However, most information on the Web requires some tailoring or contextualization in order to adapt it for curricular purposes. An annotated list of Web resources with a common thread that binds them is called a Path. Walden's Paths' Path Server is a presentation tool for viewing Paths over the Web. It provides a means for guided exploratory learning where the students can start with pages on the path and browse the Web unhindered, with a facility to return to the path at will. Providing GUI support for authoring paths presents many issues. The changes in the <b>Web,</b> <b>author</b> skills and work practices necessitate the need for Authoring Tools that support the new paradigms. This thesis describes {{the development of a new}} generation of authoring tools for Walden's Paths. The new tools separate the process of authoring of paths from publishing of paths. Authoring involves creation of paths, while publishing involves making the authored paths accessible to the intended audience. This separation helps provide authoring support for users while they do not have access to a network connection. The PathAuthor is a network-independent, platform-independent stand-alone tool with minimal overhead. The PathPublisher is a CGI tool that can be accessed via the Web to publish paths. Usability evaluation of an application determines its efficiency, ease of use and learnability. The usability of the PathAuthor and PathPublisher was evaluated by a group of K- 12 teachers. This thesis presents the results of this evaluation. The results are in three forms, observations made during the evaluation, questionnaires that were filled in by the teachers and views expressed by them during the discussion that was conducted after the evaluation. The thesis then outlines avenues for further development of the Walden's Authoring Tools...|$|E
