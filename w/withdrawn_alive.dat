40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess whether}} estrogen therapy (ET) {{reduces the risk of}} cognitive decline in women with cerebrovascular disease. Study design: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of estradiol 17 b versus placebo for secondary stroke prevention in 664 postmenopausal women with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 5 domain measures were obtained at baseline and exit. Results: Among 461 women <b>withdrawn</b> <b>alive</b> without stroke, ET did not {{have a significant effect on}} cognitive measures after an average of 3 years (relative risk of MMSE decline: 0. 74, 95 % CI, 0. 49 - 1. 13). In women with normal MMSE at entry, estrogen was associated with less decline (relative risk, 0. 46, 95 % CI, 0. 24 - 0. 87). Conclusion: In this study, estradiol did not have significant effects on cognitive measures. However, in women with normal function at baseline, there may be a benefit for ET in reducing the risk for cognitive decline. 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

40|$|Approximately 1, 000 {{coronary}} bypass procedures were performed at New York University between February 1968 and December 1973. This report reviews all elective operations performed for angina between 1968 and 1972, {{a total of}} 448 patients. In this five-year period the percentage of diseased arteries bypassed rose from 40 % to 84 %, and operative mortality decreased from 28 % to less than 3 %. There were a total of 28 operative deaths, mostly from myocardial infarction and low cardiac output. Operability was nearly 95 %. The only fixed contraindication was chronic congestive failure. Over one-half of the patients had an abnormal ventriculogram, {{and there was some}} history of mild congestive failure in nearly 20 %. Elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure above 20 mm before operation was associated with a higher operative mortality, but the late mortality was similar to those with a normal preoperative end-diastolic pressure. In 383 surviving patients, angina was eliminated or greatly improved in 86 %, unimproved in 12 % and worse in 2 %. Late angiograms were performed on 201 patients, studying a total of 445 venous grafts with an overall patency rate of 71 %. Graft occlusion was sporadic and unpredictable, but over 90 % of patients with multiple grafts remained with at least one patent graft. A late myocardial infarction occurred in 32 out of 420 patients surviving operation, and was fatal in eight. The cumulative incidence over a period of five years was 17 %. Twenty-three deaths occurred following discharge from the hospital. Life-table analyses showed a five-year survival of 77 % when all deaths were included, and a five-year cardiac survival of 81 % when non-cardiac deaths were <b>withdrawn</b> <b>alive</b> at the time of death. The expected survival in a comparable population group without coronary disease was 92 %, while data published by Sones of patients treated without operation showed a five-year cardiac survival of 66 %. Current operative techniques have an operative mortality of 2 - 3 % and a subclinical infarction rate of 5 - 10 %. The ideal graft is yet evolving, but data with internal mammary artery grafts are most encouraging. A future goal should be a five-year graft patency of at least 80 %. Because many infarcts probably develop from a relatively small decrease in coronary blood flow, either during rest or mild activity, the likelihood that future data will demonstrate a marked increase in longevity with bypass grafting is great...|$|E
