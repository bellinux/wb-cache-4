Classic Original Series style uniforms were worn by some the main cast in the second installment, although as each vessel of that era had a slightly different Starfleet logo, one had to be designed for the Defiant as it hadn't previously been seen on screen. Bakula wore the wrap-around green uniform previously worn by Shatner in several episodes including [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles", while Trinneer, Keating and Montgomery donned red shirts. Bakula joked “Did <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> material for Jolene's skirt?” as Blalock wore the science-blue miniskirt in the style of that worn by Christine Chapel.

50|$|In {{the case}} of a miss in the cache, the purpose of using such a {{structure}} will be rendered useless and we will ultimately have to go to main memory to fetch the required data. The idea of using multiple levels of cache comes into picture here. This means that if we miss the cache closest to the processor, we will search for the data in the next closest level of cache and will keep on doing that until <b>we</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> levels of caches and will finally search the main memory. The general trend is to keep L1 cache small and at a distance of 1-2 CPU clock cycles from the processor with the lower levels of caches increasing in the size to store more data than L1 and hence have lower miss rate. This, in turn, results into a better AAT. The number of levels of cache can be designed by architects as per the requirement after checking for the trade-offs between cost, AATs, and size.|$|E
