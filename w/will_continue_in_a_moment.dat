40|$|Contemporary {{debate in}} health care {{resource}} management is tied to a central moral issue: how to achieve the optimum level of reasonable or appropriate treatment based on the medical condition of each patient. Failure to tackle and resolve this issue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> confident and forthright manner ensures that the present approach to health care decision-making <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of indecisiveness if not, indeed, lethargy. Undergirding this moral issue is the foundational economic dilemma of controlling costs while limiting {{access to health care}} resources. Crafting a just solution to an equitable distribution of finite health care resources is, indeed, a quandary, if not almost an impossibility. What this article seeks to do, nonetheless, is to undertake an examination of the principles, socio-economic values and public policies needed to formulate health care compromises necessary to achieve greater stability in the normative decision-making process. In turn, this will ensure, ideally, a level of distributive justice in the total allocative process...|$|R
40|$|Health service {{managers}} {{and policy makers}} are increasingly concerned about the sustainability of innovations implemented in health care settings. The increasing demand on health services requires that innovations are both effective and sustainable however {{research in this field}} is limited with multiple disciplines, approaches and paradigms influencing the field. These variations prevent a cohesive approach and therefore the accumulation of research findings <b>in</b> development of <b>a</b> body of knowledge. A theoretical framework serves to guide research, determine variables, influence data analysis and is central to the quest for ongoing knowledge development. If left unaddressed, health services research <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> ad hoc manner preventing full utilisation of outcomes, recommendations and knowledge for effective provision of health services. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide an integrative review of the literature and introduce a theoretical framework for health services innovation sustainability research based on integration and synthesis of the literature. Finally recommendations for operationalising and testing this theory will be presented...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{separated}} into two parts. In {{the first part}} a review of object representations is image analysis is presented. In the second part a new representation is proposed. The system presented here is {{one that can be}} used to project information describing the corners of an object from some storage area, down onto a network. The idea is to reinforce the detection of object boundaries performed by a Hopfield network. These networks are efficient in terms of detecting edges, but are less efficient at detecting corners. This is because the Hopfield network works by assuming that <b>an</b> edge <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> more or less straight line. A ripple filter is used; this projects ripples of vectors onto the areas where corners are expected.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of environmental, cost, and performance requirements on the design and management of automotive components through a case study involving instrument panels. To {{address the question of}} whether the environmental improvement of an instrument panel (IP) is highly constrained, a lifecycle inventory analysis is used to characterize the major environmental burdens associated with a generic IP defined from an average of three midsized vehicle models. A life-cycle cost analysis is also conducted to understand the market forces operating in the domains of the original equipment manufacturer; consumer; and end-of-life (EOL) vehicle managen. This study indicates that the existing set of environmental requirements, in conjunction with current cost drivers and the large set of manufacturing and use phase functional performance requirements, highly constrain opportunities for environmental improvement Specific improvement strategies-lightweighting, elimination of the painting operation, and reduction in material complexity-are examined in the context of existing system requirements. The near-term forecast for improvements is not optimistic.

40|$|If {{a highway}} {{investment}} policy instrument is to alter {{growth in the}} manner desired, two criteria must be satisfied: (1) the policy instrument must be implemented, and (2) the implementation must achieve the desired policy goal. A look at three decades of highway policy goals (slowing net population growth, reducing arterial congestion, and fostering city-specific population increases) and policy instruments (zoning and sewer restrictions, gridded networks, and highway facility construction or non-construction) provided insights regarding {{the extent to which}} Virginia's growth-oriented highway investment decisions satisfied these two criteria. Crucial to the first criterion is that a policy instrument will not be implemented if it lacks a supporting mechanism. For example, the policy instrument of gridded networks in this study lacked any ordinance, financial incentive, or training to facilitate its implementation. Crucial to the second criterion is that highway investments are not effective for achieving a growth-related policy goal.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} reveal the {{interactive}} learning for upgrading and growth in Indonesian fishery firms. The main question is how learning and innovation have occurred in Indonesian fishery firms. The {{study was conducted in}} two categories of fishery firms: fish processing and aquaculture (shrimp). The interfirm interactions contain knowledge flows and feedback in local production network involving local suppliers and foreign buyers. The study found that the model of interactive learning for upgrading and growth work as a coupling of three loops: the upgrading capability, the growth formation, and limiting elements. The upgrading capability is subject to growth formation, which is determined by limiting elements.  The limiting elements will control {{the quantity and quality of}} materials supply that affect inter-firm interaction. The model suggests that the dynamics of upgrading and growth through interactive leraning <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> stable manner by easing the constraints of limiting elements through: combating illegal fishing, encouraging interaction with universities, shifting to higher added value products, institutional support for global trading,  preventing shrimp disease, providing infrastructure, business facilities, and regulation information.   Key words: upgrading, growth, limiting elements, knowledge flows, production network, global market...|$|R
50|$|Main {{sequence}} stars accumulate helium {{in their}} cores {{as a result}} of hydrogen fusion, but the core does not become hot enough to initiate helium fusion. Helium fusion first begins when a star leaves the red giant branch after accumulating sufficient helium in its core to ignite it. In stars around the mass of the sun, this begins {{at the tip of the}} red giant branch with a helium flash from a degenerate helium core and the star moves to the horizontal branch where it burns helium in its core. More massive stars ignite helium in their cores without a flash and execute a blue loop before reaching the asymptotic giant branch. Despite the name, stars on a blue loop from the red giant branch are typically yellow giants, possibly Cepheid variables. They fuse helium until the core is largely carbon and oxygen. The most massive stars become supergiants when they leave the main sequence and quickly start helium fusion as they become red supergiants. After helium is exhausted in the core of <b>a</b> star, it <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shell around the carbon-oxygen core.|$|R
