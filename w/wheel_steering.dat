5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

25|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{made from}} welded 4130 steel tube and the aircraft has conventional landing gear with tail <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> connected to the rudder pedals. The main landing gear utilises sprung-tubes for suspension and absorbing landing loads.|$|E
25|$|The Ascender III-A {{is similar}} to the {{original}} Pterodactyl Pfledge. It lacks a canard and pitch control is by weight shift, although it incorporates some refinements, such as nose <b>wheel</b> <b>steering.</b> The 2003 price was USD$6800.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration {{and all three}} sprung gear legs are made from 4130 chrome-molybdenum steel alloy. The nose wheel is free-castering. On early versions the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> was by differential braking via two finger-controlled brake handles mounted on the centre console. On later versions more conventional toe brakes were installed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{suspension}} used wishbones with coilover-damper {{units on}} all corners. The brakes were disks {{on all four}} <b>wheels.</b> <b>Steering</b> was by rack-and-pinion.|$|R
50|$|There are two wheels, {{the larger}} driving wheel for {{travelling}} in a forward direction, and a trailing <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and 90 degrees to this one. Both the drive <b>wheel</b> and the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> however are constructed of multiple smaller 'planet' wheels {{that allow the}} wheel to be moved laterally. When moving forward the main wheel will be powered and the smaller planet <b>wheels</b> on the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> will rotate to avoid the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> dragging. To turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is rotated. To balance from side to side, or to self-balance laterally, the planet wheels on the drive wheel will be powered appropriately.|$|R

25|$|On November 28, 2004, {{the nose}} landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The {{nose landing gear}} leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E
25|$|If {{an engine}} fails during taxiing or takeoff, the thrust yawing moment will force the {{aircraft}} {{to one side}} on the runway. If the airspeed is not high enough and hence, the rudder-generated side force is not powerful enough, the aircraft will deviate from the runway centerline and may even veer off the runway. The airspeed at which the aircraft, after engine failure, deviates 9.1m from the runway centerline, despite using maximum rudder but {{without the use of}} nose <b>wheel</b> <b>steering,</b> is the minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG).|$|E

25|$|In 1994 the Toyota Curren came in two models, the ST206 and the ST207. The ST206 {{had four}} {{different}} trim levels. The FS, XS, ZS and the ZS Sport Selection. The FS and XS models were both {{powered by the}} 140hp 3S-FE engine, whereas the ZS models were powered by the 170-180hp 3S-GE engine. The ZS Sport Selection had {{the added benefit of}} a limited slip differential and a leather steering wheel. The ST207 only came in the XS Touring Selection, which was powered by the 3S-FE and came equipped with four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and Toyota's active suspension package called TACS.|$|E
25|$|The 1904 models had 2470cc, four-cylinder, water-cooled, overhead-valve engines {{featuring}} pressure lubrication, {{very unusual}} at the time, {{and were now}} mounted with the epicyclic gearbox between the front seats rather than centrally resulting a design with the driver sitting well forwards and no bonnet. Six-cylinder models joined the line up in 1906. The specification started to become more conventional with <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> as an option from 1908, becoming standard {{from the end of}} 1911, and pedals and gear lever replacing the original two-lever system of gear changing. George Lanchester was now in charge, Frederick having resigned in 1913, and the engine moved further forward to a conventional position in the sporting, side-valve, 5.5-litre six-cylinder Forty but very few were made before the outbreak of World War I. A distinctive feature of the engine's valves was their use of leaf springs, rather than coil springs. Frank Lanchester ran the London sales office.|$|E
25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of windscreen wipers and washers, direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates. Also rolled out in 2005 {{was the creation of}} the 'Automated Test Bay' this differs from traditional testing by adding additional equipment to the bay to negate the use of an assistant during the test; 2012 – checks of secondary restraint systems, battery and wiring, ESC, speedometers and steering locks.|$|E

25|$|Guests board an Enhanced Motion Vehicle (EMV) {{intended}} {{to appear as}} a battered military troop transport. EMVs ride on neoprene filled tires (for operational precision) driven by hydraulic rotors that provide forward motion, hydraulic pressure is applied on-board each vehicle at 3,000 psi using DC pressurizers. The vehicle has four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> atop {{the surface of a}} slotted roadbed. The track has only three switches: a left/right split switch just before loading/unloading, a left/right combine switch just after safety check station/dispatch and a compound switch to swap vehicles in/out of the maintenance bay, behind the mirrors. Beneath the slot a tubular guideway guides the front wheelset and a damper for the rear wheelset, and three electrical buss bars provide the EMV 480 volts AC. The power is divided among the two motion systems, control, safety and audio systems. Each transport can accommodate twelve guests with three rows of seats, four across, with the front left seat behind a non-operational steering wheel.|$|E
500|$|On August 26, 2011, at PAX Prime it was {{announced}} that Turn 10 would include the UNSC Warthog from Microsoft Studios' Halo series in Forza Motorsport 4s Autovista mode. The model of Warthog used in Forza Motorsport 4 is identical to the version in the then-upcoming Halo 4, although the vehicle is not drivable. Turn 10 has cited the vehicle's exaggerated four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system, fictional futuristic technology and excessive height as reasons for its exclusion, stating [...] "One, it's got some technology that's built into Halo {{that would have been a}} big investment for us to then build into the game only to support one vehicle.

50|$|In vehicle {{steering}} systems a {{clock spring}} or clockspring is a spiral-wound special rotary electrical connector which allows a vehicle's <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to turn while still making an electrical {{connection between the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> airbag and/or the vehicle's horn and other devices and the vehicle's electrical systems. The clockspring is located between the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and the <b>steering</b> column.|$|R
50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio {{means that the}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned more to get the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so the steering ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. The <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R
30|$|Also {{criterion}} C 3, regarding {{preservation of}} individual behaviour {{appears to be}} valid. Using paired sample correlation, itwas shown that test subjects keep their steering characteristics very well (r values close to 1) regarding maximum <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angles and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rates. They do not, however, preserve their characteristics regarding SWRRs. Arguably, thecriterion can still {{be considered to be}} valid, since SWRRs are less important compared to maximum <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> angles and <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rates when considering the outcome of the steering behaviour, i.e. avoiding the collision. It should alsobe pointed out that there were, as stated for the previous criterion, no significant differences in SWRRs between testsettings on the population level.|$|R
2500|$|... 1997 {{marked the}} last year of the four <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> ST207 model. The rest of the models {{remained}} unchanged until it was discontinued from production in June 1998. In September 1998, sales for Toyota Curren ended with the total of 44,686 productions.|$|E
2500|$|For taxiing {{and during}} the {{beginning}} of the take-off, aircraft are steered by a combination of rudder input as well as turning the nosewheel or tailwheel. [...] At slow speeds the nosewheel or tailwheel has the most control authority, but as the speed increases the aerodynamic effects of the rudder increases, thereby making the rudder more and more important for yaw control. [...] In some aircraft (mainly small aircraft) both of these mechanisms are controlled by the rudder pedals so there is no difference to the pilot. [...] In other aircraft there is a special tiller controlling the <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> and the pedals control the rudder, and a limited amount of <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> (Usually 5 degrees of nosewheel steering). [...] For these aircraft the pilots stop using the tiller after lining up with the runway prior to take-off, and begin using it after landing before turning off the runway, to prevent over correcting with the sensitive tiller at high speeds. The pedals may also be used for small corrections while taxing in a straight line, or leading in or out of a turn, before applying the tiller, to keep the turn smooth.|$|E
2500|$|The car {{also had}} {{computer-controlled}} all <b>wheel</b> <b>steering</b> system {{referred to as}} HICAS. The HICAS system activated when the vehicle exceeded [...] and controlled the steering of the rear wheels {{in the same direction}} as the front to improve turn in on entry to corners. It should be noted however that this feature is often seen as more of a hindrance than help in race applications. The system tends to favor less advanced drivers, and can make the rear suspension unstable during high speed cornering. For this reason many kits are available to override this system. These kits usually loop the hydraulic lines back on themselves on the R32. Kits for the R33/34 models use a simple lock out bar—or a Tomei kit, which also alters the electrical control system ( [...] the 33 and 34 had electronic HICAS). These modifications strive to make the car more predictable when driving at the limit of traction.|$|E
