5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, {{even to the point}} of actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the team.|$|E
5|$|Soule was {{promptly}} given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore. The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds (like wind blowing and ocean waves) {{into the music}} and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound. Part {{of the reason for}} this was that the sound program used in Evermore was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it, forcing him to work creatively within his limitations. When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company, Humongous Entertainment, and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles, Soule quit Square to score Gilbert's children's adventure game series, Putt-Putt; he was the company's third employee. Soule composed the soundtracks to 11 children's games over the next three years, with multiple titles in the Putt-Putt, Pajama Sam, Freddi Fish and Spy Fox series.|$|E

Eager to display his big band ensemble in studio, Charles enlisted premier jazz arrangers Gerald Wilson and Gil Fuller, while Marty Paich, who {{was active in the}} West Coast jazz scene, was hired to arrange the lush strings and chorus numbers. Despite enlisting a roster of professional arrangers and musicians, Charles intended to control the artistic direction of the recordings. To indicate specific licks he wanted emphasized for certain songs, Charles would put together voice-and-piano demos and pass them along to the arrangers, informing them of what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> specific sounds. According to Feller, at one point during recording, Charles rewrote an entire botched arrangement and dictated the parts to each of the 18 backing musicians.|$|E

He was a very religious man and influenced Stewart towards missionary work. Stewart had a desire from a young age to go to Africa.

In writing [...] "Lost and Running", the band was influenced by bands that they have cited as being influences on their music from early on, including David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Neil Young. In an interview with The Courier Mail, Fanning noted that the song was a very simple one, stating [...] "the actual style of song is quite different as it has very little movement. There are literally only three chords in the song."" [...] He notes that the song's premise is reflective on how the group approached the recording of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, in that they were unsure of what they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the album.|$|E

In 1914, they built the new bridge just upstream for the reason that it would not have to move much track for better service. As soon as the new bridge was finished, DL put the former one up for sale. Demand for second-hand bridges were not high at the time, and when Henry V.B.

500|$|On {{expanding}} {{the characters in}} the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outside of Avengers films, Feige stated, it's about [...] "teaching the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. Just like comic readers have been doing for decades and decades ... people sort of are accepting that there's just a time when they should be together and there's a time when they're not." [...] In April 2014, Feige revealed that Edgar Wright's pitch for Ant-Man in 2006 helped shape the early films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, [...] "We changed, frankly, some of the MCU to accommodate this version of Ant-Man. Knowing what we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Edgar and with Ant-Man, going years and years back, helped to dictate what we did with the roster for Avengers the first time.
