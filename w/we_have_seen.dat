5|$|Regardless of the {{historian}} (I might add) <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in our {{youth in the}} streets of Gniezno a wooden chapel, which in the vernacular lenguage is called vestibule, where exist two great stones in the shape of millstones reddened with the blood of that lady, who are completely worn and faded, and were deposited in her tomb at Gniezno cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell you or how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E
25|$|The same {{evolution}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in Buddhist architecture {{can be seen}} in {{the roofs}} of several Shinto architectural styles it influenced. The kasuga-zukuri, nagare-zukuri, hachiman-zukuri, hie-zukuri all followed the evolution path <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> All extant examples of the ancient shinmei-zukuri, taisha-zukuri and sumiyoshi-zukuri styles however show no sign of a hidden roof.|$|E

25|$|As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> Hachiman {{played an}} {{important}} role in the evolution of temple-shrines, and is still the tutelary kami of many important temples, among them Tōdai-ji, Daian-ji, Yakushi-ji and Tō-ji.|$|E
25|$|Science uses computing. Computing uses science. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the {{development}} of Computer Science. There are not many who can bridge all three of these. One effect is that repeatability has become problematic, especially when results rely heavily upon computational approaches.|$|E
25|$|If we use regular subdivisions and {{left-hand}} or right-hand Riemann sums, {{then the}} two terms on the left are equal to zero, since every endpoint except 0 and 1 will be irrational, but as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the term on the right will equal 1.|$|E
30|$|Setting α=l= 1 in (2.12) and (2.13), respectively, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> (<b>see</b> [13], p. 2786, Theorem  8) the following.|$|R
60|$|Of {{one thing}} I was certain, however, that the Shades I {{had seemed to}} visit had their being {{in the circle of}} her own {{imagination}} and intelligence. There Umslopogaas was right; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> no dead, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> only <b>seen</b> pictures and images that she drew and fashioned.|$|R
30|$|To {{continue}} the discussion, {{we still need}} to verify condition (d) in Lemma  2. Indeed, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> (<b>see</b> [11]) the following.|$|R
25|$|O {{banks of}} the Rhine! <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> you covered with gore, inasmuch as the swords of {{retribution}} were drawn against you; and you shall have another turn. And We hear the lamentations of Berlin, though she be today in conspicuous glory.|$|E
25|$|The Boolean algebras <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> so {{far have}} all been concrete, {{consisting}} of bit vectors or equivalently of subsets of some set. Such a Boolean algebra consists of a set and operations on that set which can be shown to satisfy the laws of Boolean algebra.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> {{above that}} the Cantor set {{is a totally}} {{disconnected}} perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense {{it is the only}} one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See Cantor space for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.|$|E
60|$|Lady Angela and I {{exchanged}} glances. I {{think that}} <b>we</b> should both <b>have</b> laughed {{but for the}} tears which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{showed us}} slaughters more terrible in their {{destruction}} of life, more devastating in their engines of war, than any <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{vanished}} {{away and}} Yva, appearing to wake from {{some kind of}} trance, smiled, and in her natural voice asked if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> enough.|$|R
25|$|In {{many ways}} Ronald's work {{provides}} us {{with the history of}} both how <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> ourselves and how we have constructed and reconstructed our past(s) over time, and how we continue to do so. He has a very pragmatic, creative attitude, recognising that factual error can still produce beneficial results.|$|E
25|$|Whatever else Childs is doing, he is {{not taking}} us 'back to the canon', for {{no one has ever}} been aware of the canon in this way before. It is only after <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> how varied and {{inconsistent}} the Old Testament really is that we can begin to ask whether it can nonetheless be read as forming a unity.|$|E
25|$|The {{responsible}} government minister, King O'Malley, {{drove the}} first survey peg in the Canberra area on 20 February 1913 to mark commencement {{of work on}} the new city. As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> on 12 March that same year, the city was formally named by the Governor-General's wife, Lady Denman, at a ceremony held on Capital Hill, the site of Australia's current Parliament House.|$|E
60|$|Indeed it was {{a memorable}} night. Gradually the {{realization}} that they were rich sank securely home into {{the souls of the}} pair, then they began to place the money. If <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> looked out through the eyes of these dreamers, <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> their tidy little wooden house disappear, and two-story brick with a cast-iron fence in front of it take its place; <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> a three-globed gas-chandelier grow down from the parlor ceiling; <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the homely rag carpet turn to noble Brussels, a dollar and a half a yard; <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the plebeian fireplace vanish away and a recherche, big base-burner with isinglass windows take position and spread awe around. And <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> other things, too; among them the buggy, the lap-robe, the stove-pipe hat, and so on.|$|R
6000|$|... "And whose are the {{writings}} {{on the wall}} of the caves through which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> passed on the road?" [...] I asked, referring to the Egyptian-like sculptures that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|R
60|$|They were pretty. They {{were not}} very large, but were beautifully polished, and of a {{delicate}} gray color, the first <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> of the kind.|$|R
25|$|We {{have found}} no signs of ivory-billed woodpeckers. No sightings, double knocks or calls, no replies to our many double-knock imitations. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> a few {{cavities}} of the appropriate size and shape for ivory-bills, but these can be old, or exceptionally large pileated woodpecker cavities, or mammal-enlarged pileated woodpecker cavities.… Given the results, it is unlikely a population of any meaningful size of ivory-billed woodpeckers exists in south Florida.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that forcing {{can be done}} using Boolean-valued models, by {{constructing}} a Boolean algebra with ultrafilter from a poset with a generic subset. It is also possible to go back the other way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a poset P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a generic ultrafilter on B restricts to a generic set on P. So the techniques of forcing and Boolean-valued models are essentially equivalent.|$|E
25|$|The {{anomalous}} {{dimensions in}} certain two-dimensional CFTs {{can be related}} to the typical fractal dimensions of random walks, where the random walks are defined via Schramm–Loewner evolution (SLE). As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> above, CFTs describe the physics of phase transitions, and so one can relate the critical exponents of certain phase transitions to these fractal dimensions. Examples include the 2d critical Ising model and the more general 2d critical Potts model. Relating other 2d CFTs to SLE is an active area of research.|$|E
60|$|We waited, and we waited, and waited, {{until it}} was well on in the morning, and still we saw no other sail. The one <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>had</b> {{disappeared}} entirely.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about a sail-boat," [...] said I. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> one leave here, <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> gone home in her. Why did you take our boat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Life is {{a strange}} {{compound}}. Peterkin used to say of it that it beat a druggist's shop all to sticks; for whereas {{the first is a}} compound of good and bad, the other is a horrible compound of all that is utterly detestable. And indeed the more I consider it, the more I am struck with the strange mixture of good and evil that exists, not only in the material earth, but in our own natures. In our own Coral Island <b>we</b> <b>had</b> experienced every variety of good that a bountiful Creator could heap on us. Yet {{on the night of the}} storm <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> how almost, in our case-- and altogether, no doubt, in the case of others less fortunate--all this good might be swept away for ever. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the rich fruit-trees waving in the soft air, the tender herbs shooting upwards under the benign influence of the bright sun; and the next day <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> these good and beautiful trees and plants uprooted by the hurricane, crushed and hurled to the ground in destructive devastation. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> lived for many months in a clime, for the most part, so beautiful that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> often wondered whether Adam and Eve had found Eden more sweet; and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the quiet solitudes of our paradise suddenly broken in upon by ferocious savages, and the white sands stained with blood and strewed with lifeless forms, yet among these cannibals <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> many symptoms of a kindly nature. I pondered these things much, and while I considered them there recurred to my memory those words which I had read in my Bible: [...] "The works of God are wonderful, and His ways past finding out." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{this case}} {{there are two}} pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit mixed {{strategies}} (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%,100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player is (50%, 50%).|$|E
25|$|As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> Wagner {{sketched out}} {{the theme for}} the Ride of the Valkyries on 23 July 1851; other than this, the {{earliest}} musical sketches for Die Walküre date from the summer of 1852. But {{it was not until}} 28 June 1854 that Wagner began to transform these into a complete draft of all three acts of the opera. This preliminary draft (Gesamtentwurf), which was completed by 27 December 1854, was written in pencil and shows a greater degree of orchestral elaboration than the corresponding draft of Das Rheingold.|$|E

60|$|The {{man whom}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> known as Douglas turned {{up his own}} coat and cuff to show a brown {{triangle}} within a circle exactly like that which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> upon the dead man.|$|R
