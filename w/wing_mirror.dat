5|$|En {{route to}} his weekly squash game, a traffic {{diversion}} reminds Perowne of the anti-war protests occurring that day. After being allowed through the diversion, he collides with another car, damaging its <b>wing</b> <b>mirror.</b> At first the driver, Baxter, tries to extort money from him. When Perowne refuses, Baxter {{and his two}} companions become aggressive. Noticing symptoms in Baxter's behaviour, Perowne quickly recognises the onset of Huntington's disease. Though he is punched in the sternum, Perowne manages to escape unharmed by distracting Baxter with discussions of his disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part, Nico Rosberg was fastest, {{half a second}} faster than {{teammate}} Hamilton, and 1.7 seconds clear of the pole position lap time from the year before. Both McLarens had shown promising pace, but nevertheless dropped out of contention in 12th and 14th, while Daniil Kvyat was the last driver to secure a place in Q3, demoting Carlos Sainz Jr. to 11th. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo also progressed, albeit suffering a failure of his <b>wing</b> <b>mirror,</b> which hung {{off the side of}} his vehicle during his last timed lap. Eliminated at the back were both Haas drivers, along Nico Hülkenberg, who was unable to follow his teammate Pérez into Q3 and qualified 13th.|$|E

Derek is quick to rough him up a little to make him realise he's not to be messed with. The confrontation really shocks AJ but he's not going to be pushed around by some bullying bloke he's just met."

500|$|Asashōryū {{received}} {{criticism from}} Sumo Association {{officials and the}} media throughout his yokozuna career for various other infractions of the strict code of conduct expected of top sumo wrestlers, both on the dohyō and off it. His breaches of etiquette during tournament bouts ranged from merely accepting the prize money with the wrong hand, and raising his arms in victory after clinching the championship, to giving opponents an extra shove after the bout was already over (such as Hakuhō in May 2008), and appealing to judges to overturn the referee's decision. In July 2003, he pulled on fellow Mongolian Kyokushūzan's mage (traditional Japanese top knot) during their bout on day five of the tournament, resulting in an immediate hansoku-make, or disqualification. He was the first yokozuna to be disqualified from a bout. They reportedly brawled in the communal bath afterwards, and Asashōryū was also accused of breaking the <b>wing</b> <b>mirror</b> of Kyokushūzan's car. Some Japanese fans called on him to [...] "go back to Mongolia" [...] after this incident. During the same year, Asashōryū was taking interviews from journalists when he called a Korean journalist a , sparking controversy within South Korean newspapers. He also had an uneasy relationship with his stablemaster Takasago. In July 2004, he apologized after a row with Takasago over his wedding arrangements resulted in him being seen drunk in public and damaging stable property, and his tendency to return to Mongolia without informing his stablemaster led to embarrassments like being unable to attend the funeral of Takasago stable's previous head coach Fujinishiki in December 2003. He was also sometimes seen in public {{in a business suit}} or in casual dress instead of the traditional kimono that wrestlers are expected to wear.|$|E

2500|$|Vettel pitted for {{his second}} stop on lap 39 and was clearly pushing very hard, running over a kerb on his out lap and {{damaging}} the underside of his car, having already lost his right <b>wing</b> <b>mirror.</b> However, worse was to come, as on lap 40 the stewards handed him a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane. [...] This left Hamilton 9.2 seconds ahead of Glock, who was in turn 7.6 seconds ahead of Alonso as Vettel served his penalty on lap 43.
