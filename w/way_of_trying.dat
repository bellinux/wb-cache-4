5|$|In 1999, Herren {{signed to}} the British label Warp under two aliases, Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas, after Warp staff {{had heard a}} {{previous}} record of Herren's which had sparked their interest in his work. Herren {{was familiar with the}} label through artists Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but chose to sign to Warp as he was a fan of the group Broadcast who had released an EP through the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives features rapping from Mikah 9, Aesop Rock and MF Doom, and vocals from Sam Prekop of the indie rock band the Sea and Cake. The vocalists did not work directly with Herren, but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings. Herren later commented on having Prekop sing on the album, noting that having an indie rock artist on the album was his <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to get his sound out to a new audience.|$|E
5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing it to them, but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E
25|$|Drug addiction, alcoholism, {{a mental}} disability, bio-chemical changes and PTSD can all {{lead to a}} person {{committing}} an aggressive act against another person. Not having sufficient skills {{on how to handle}} oneself when faced with aggression can lead to very undesirable outcomes. These factors are typically associated with a heightened chance of anger, but there are other, less-known factors that can lead to people acting in a negative way. Prolonged or intense anger and frustration contributes to physical conditions such as headaches, digestive problems, high blood pressure and heart disease. Problems dealing with angry feelings may be linked to psychological disorders such as anxiety or depression. Angry outbursts can be a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to cope with unhappiness, or depression.|$|E

25|$|Since its foundation, {{the socialist}} party has opposed every war – {{including}} both World War I and World War II. Although, in its early years, party writers frequently would contrast the numbers of dead in wars with the numbers killed and maimed in industrial incidents (by <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to contrast the passions and efforts put into war {{with the lack of}} response to the conditions of capitalism) the party argued that wars in capitalism were fought {{in the interests of the}} capitalist class and – as with their case against nationalism – the workers did all the dying for no gain for themselves. Further, they emphasised that while the press and politicians tried to call for strike moderation, the capitalists would continue the class war despite hostilities, forcing down wages and up consumer good prices. During both wars, some members won Conscientious objector status.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the lyrics {{on the album}} as [...] "just whatever {{is going on in}} my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, [...] "our <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, [...] "Those guys don’t have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too," [...] he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences [...] "will always be there" [...] because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as [...] " [...] to so much stuff it just gets lost".|$|E
500|$|The track {{received}} mixed {{response from}} music critics. Dan Martin from NME gave a positive review, {{saying that the}} bilingual language song proved that the overstylization of the composition worked in its favor, {{making it one of}} Gaga's best outputs. Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone found [...] "Americano" [...] as hilarious, noting it as the [...] "campiest song Gaga's recorded yet". She deciphered the location of the song's storyline as being in East Los Angeles. In their 2011 ranking of Gaga's music catalog, [...] "Americano" [...] was listed at number 18, with the description as [...] "The greatest Anglo-Latina lesbian marriage story ever set to a disco-cabaret beat". Billboards Keri Mason found the composition to be Gaga's <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to imitate [...] "Alejandro"'s chart success. Ian White from BBC Music found essences of musical theatre in the futuristic composition of [...] "Americano".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series creator Rob Thomas, marking his seventh writing credit and second and final directing credit for the series (after [...] "Donut Run"). Starting with this episode, Thomas and the crew's plan for the season changed—while they had initially scheduled three major story arcs for the season, this number was now bumped down to two, while the last few episodes would be standalone. The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one; Thomas elaborated, [...] "One feeling is that the big mysteries keep away the casual TV viewers, and the other is the thing that has been the least successful since season one [...] the big mysteries." [...] Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season that was because Lilly had been murdered, everyone had a stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season; Thomas thought that the new format would be a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to return to a more emotionally driven format.|$|E

A {{lot of them}} are more - I wouldn't say spiritual, but they relate more to the {{imagination}} and the individual. But for me socialism is a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to put far-fetched ideas into everyday use, {{trying to find a way}} to bridge the gap between that fantasy and reality, and reaching out across that gap to the people who can actually do something to make the change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many cull opponents cite {{vaccination}} of badgers {{and cattle}} as a better alternative to culling. In Wales, where {{a policy of}} vaccination in 2013 was into its second year, Stephen James, who is the National Farmers Union Cymru's spokesperson on the matter, argues that the economics of badger culling are [...] "ridiculous" [...] saying the cost per badger was £620. [...] "That's a very expensive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to control this disease when we know full well, from experience from other countries, that there are cheaper ways of doing it...if you vaccinate in the clean areas, {{around the edges of}} the endemic areas, then there's a better chance of it working." ...|$|E

2500|$|... {{and each}} time a Hamiltonian {{operator}} acts it does so by adding a new edge at the vertex. The summation over different sequences of actions of [...] can be visualized as a summation over different histories of 'interaction vertices' in the 'time' evolution sending the initial spin network to the final spin network. This then naturally {{gives rise to the}} two-complex (a combinatorial set of faces that join along edges, which in turn join on vertices) underlying the spin foam description; we evolve forward an initial spin network sweeping out a surface, the action of the Hamiltonian constraint operator is to produce a new planar surface starting at the vertex. We are able to use the action of the Hamiltonian constraint on the vertex of a spin network state to associate an amplitude to each [...] "interaction" [...] (in analogy to Feynman diagrams). See figure below. This opens up a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> to directly link canonical LQG to a path integral description. Now just as a spin networks describe quantum space, each configuration contributing to these path integrals, or sums over history, describe 'quantum space-time'. Because of their resemblance to soap foams and the way they are labeled John Baez gave these 'quantum space-times' the name 'spin foams'.|$|E
