2500|$|Another type {{of still}} life, known as ontbijtjes or [...] "breakfast paintings", {{represent}} both a literal presentation of delicacies that {{the upper class}} might enjoy and a religious reminder to avoid gluttony. [...] Around 1650 Samuel van Hoogstraten painted {{one of the first}} wall-rack pictures, trompe-l'œil still-life paintings which feature objects tied, tacked or attached in some other fashion to a <b>wall</b> <b>board,</b> a type of still life very popular in the United States in the 19th century. Another variation was the trompe-l'œil still life depicted objects associated with a given profession, as with the Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrecht’s painting [...] "Painter’s Easel with Fruit Piece", which displays all the tools of a painter’s craft. Also popular {{in the first half of}} the 17th century was the painting of a large assortment of specimens in allegorical form, such as the [...] "five senses", [...] "four continents", or [...] "the four seasons", showing a goddess or allegorical figure surrounded by appropriate natural and man-made objects. The popularity of vanitas paintings, and these other forms of still life, soon spread from Holland to Flanders and Germany, and also to Spain and France.|$|E
50|$|Another large non-food starch {{application}} {{is in the}} construction industry, where starch {{is used in the}} gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> manufacturing process. Chemically modified or unmodified starches are added to the stucco containing primarily gypsum. Top and bottom heavyweight sheets of paper are applied to the formulation, and the process is allowed to heat and cure to form the eventual rigid <b>wall</b> <b>board.</b> The starches act as a glue for the cured gypsum rock with the paper covering, and also provide rigidity to the board.|$|E
50|$|Lath {{and plaster}} has been mostly {{replaced}} with solid drywall or plasterboard (also {{a type of}} gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>board,</b> although a bit thicker), since it is faster and less expensive to install.|$|E
50|$|There were {{generally}} two reasons that builders {{of the period}} hewed the exterior and/or {{the interior of the}} timbers into a flat surface. One reason was to remove the bark and sapwood layers which, over time, promoted rotting, and the second reason was to apply weatherboard siding on the exterior or <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> on the interior. The cabin likely had both interior <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> and exterior weather strip siding.|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "stave church" [...] {{is unknown}} in Old Norse, presumably {{because there were}} no other types of wooden churches. When Norway's churches after the Reformation were {{constructed}} in log, there was a need for a separate word for the older churches. In written sources from the Middle Ages, there is a clearl distinction between [...] "stafr" [...] (posts) and [...] "þili" [...] or [...] "vægþili" [...] (<b>wall</b> <b>boards).</b> However, in documents from the 1600-1700s, [...] "stave" [...] was also used for <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> or panels. Emil Eckhoff in his Svenska stavkyrkor (1914-1916) also included wood frame church buildings without posts.|$|R
50|$|In fabric, scale, and design, the {{building}} has not changed since {{the completion of the}} 1950s renovations. Much original joinery in {{the building}} survives basically intact, as does much of the original interior linings, including the stamped steel ceilings and beaded tongue and groove <b>wall</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Eventually {{the wood}} laths became less common, and were {{replaced}} with rock lath (also known as [...] "button board"), {{which is a}} type of gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> with holes spaced regularly across it, usually in sheets sized 2 ft by 4 ft (60 cm by 120 cm). The purpose of the four-foot length is so that the sheet of lath reaches exactly across three wall studs, which are spaced 16 in apart on center (United States building code standard measurements). The holes serve the same purpose as the spaces between the wood lath strips, allowing plaster to ooze through the board when the plaster is applied, making the keys to hold the plaster to the <b>wall</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
50|$|On July 17, 2015, Women of the <b>Wall</b> <b>board</b> member Rachel Cohen Yeshurun {{was arrested}} by police in the prayer section of the Kotel after {{smuggling}} in a Torah Scroll to the Kotel {{in the early morning}} before the Rosh Hodesh service began.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the Saint John Shipbuilding {{services}} has been terminated and all work has been sent to the Halifax yards. The former dry dock cranes have been removed and the building is now Irving <b>Wall</b> <b>board</b> services.

50|$|In 1922, using <b>wall</b> <b>boards,</b> house paint, and {{anything}} else he had on hand, Frost began creating his works.

Since Ms. Blum never receives visitors and no longer has a nurse, she too dies.|$|R
50|$|Shortlines {{generally}} {{exist for}} one of three reasons: to link two industries requiring rail freight together (for example, a gypsum mine and a <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> factory, or a coal mine and a power plant); to interchange revenue traffic with other, usually larger, railroads; or to operate a tourist passenger train service. Often, short lines exist for {{all three of these}} reasons.|$|E
50|$|Barco Industries (1983-2016+), Reading, PA - {{established}} in 1983, Barco acquired Kelly’s dies and brand names in 1987. Barco {{is now part}} of Phoenix Forge Group of companies. Barco’s tool catalog lists the following PFG products: light duty camp axe; light duty hatchet; Kelly Perfect Axes; Kelly Woodslasher Axes; fire axe; sport/camp axe; half hatchets; and other specialty hatchets (broad, lathing, box, rig builder, <b>wall</b> <b>board).</b> Except possibly for Kelly axes, production locations are unknown.|$|E
50|$|Homasote is a {{brand name}} {{associated}} with the product generically known as cellulose based fiber <b>wall</b> <b>board,</b> which is similar in composition to papier-mâché, made from recycled paper that is compressed under high temperature and pressure and held together with an adhesive.

50|$|Interest in {{the tournament}} was unusually high for a chess event in the United States, with over 500 spectators {{attending}} most sessions. The 17th-round game between tournament leaders Spassky and Fischer drew over 900 spectators, with many turned away. Positions of the games in progress were displayed to the crowds using a novel projection system devised by Jacqueline Piatigorsky rather than the usual <b>wall</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor has a central hall leading to the rear dining and kitchen area, a public bar on the south and a lounge on the north. The {{building}} has rendered <b>walls,</b> <b>boarded</b> ceilings, and a timber staircase with turned balustrade and newel posts. The public bar and kitchen have been recently refitted, and the lounge and dining area have undergone earlier alterations.|$|R
50|$|Many {{building}} {{materials such as}} paints, adhesives, <b>wall</b> <b>boards,</b> and ceiling tiles slowly emit formaldehyde, which irritates the mucous membranes and can make a person irritated and uncomfortable. Formaldehyde emissions from wood {{are in the range}} of 0.02-0.04 ppm. Relative humidity within an indoor environment can also affect the emissions of formaldehyde. High relative humidity and high temperatures allow more vaporization of formaldehyde from wood-materials.|$|R
50|$|Another {{carpentry}} method {{which is}} sometimes called plank <b>wall,</b> <b>board</b> wall, plank-on-plank, horizontal plank frame is the stacking of horizontal planks or boards to form a wall of solid lumber. Sometimes the planks were staggered or spaced apart to form keys for a coat of plaster. This method was recommended by Orson Squire Fowler for octagon houses in his book The Octagon House: A Home for All in 1848. Fowler mentions he had seen this wall type being built in central New York state while traveling in 1842.|$|E
50|$|In United Kingdom homeowner's {{insurance}} policies, trace {{and access}} cover refers to insurance {{cover of the}} costs to detect and repair {{the source of a}} water leak. While most policies will cover the cost to repair water damage caused by a leak, many UK policies specifically or implicitly exclude trace and access cover, leaving the homeowner to foot the bill for finding and repairing the leaking pipe or other source of water incursion into the home. Without trace and access coverage, any damage done to the home to locate the leak (removing <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> or floor boards to access plumbing, etc.) is not covered.|$|E
50|$|In cold climates, a sun-tempered {{building}} {{is the most}} basic type of direct gain passive solar configuration that simply involves increasing (slightly) the south-facing glazing area, without adding additional thermal mass. It {{is a type of}} direct-gain system in which the building envelope is well insulated, is elongated in an east-west direction, and has a large fraction (~80% or more) of the windows on the south side. It has little added thermal mass beyond what is already in the building (i.e., just framing, <b>wall</b> <b>board,</b> and so forth). In a sun-tempered building, the south-facing window area should be limited to about 5 to 7% of the total floor area, less in a sunny climate, to prevent overheating. Additional south-facing glazing can be included only if more thermal mass is added. Energy savings are modest with this system, and sun tempering is very low cost.|$|E
50|$|Mini Graff stencils {{and prints}} images onto {{a variety of}} media (<b>walls,</b> <b>boards,</b> vinyl, paper, rarely canvas) which {{strongly}} relate to the given environment and community, transforming an anonymous repetitive urban landscape into a unique and personal aesthetic experience. Parody, humor and social commentary are common themes in Graff's work - notions that are translated into experiments with scale in public space - from discrete interventions to large scale installations.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{section of}} the house was {{completed}} by at least 1641, based on dendrochronology of several beams in the house. The summer beam has been dated to 1637, and other <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> and beams were dated to 1638, 1640 and 1641. Other American houses claiming to be older have yet to be scientifically dated, and the Fairbanks House is almost universally regarded as the oldest house in New England.|$|R

50|$|An {{article in}} Architecture {{magazine}} in 1943 described the building as:"of locally made cream bricks with a tile roof. The {{plan is a}} long rectangle with an apse at the east end and a vestry off one side. The entrance is on the south, towards the west end; it {{is marked by a}} square tower with a colonnaded lantern at the top surmounted by a weathervane carrying the symbol of St Peter. The organ gallery is above the entrance, whence it is approached by a stair, and opens on to a gallery overlooking the nave. The font is placed immediately opposite the entrance in a gap in the seating, which leaves a few seats between it and the west wall for use at christenings. The pulpit is in brick, and is placed in the south-east corner... The windows have steel frames, and are glazed with heat-resisting glass with a slightly greenish tinge, which helps to give a cool appearance to the interior. The ceiling is of <b>wall</b> <b>board,</b> set out in panels, the sides of the recesses being brilliantly coloured to tone with the windows and the ceiling of the eastern apse."The furnishings, altar, pews and other fittings, designed by the architects, were made from local hardwood. The cost of building was £2,755 19s 5d.|$|E
50|$|To {{accomplish}} these aims, {{many different}} types of materials are employed in the design and construction of systems. For instance, common endothermic building materials include calcium silicate board, concrete and gypsum wallboard. During fire testing of concrete floor slabs, water can be seen to boil out of a slab. Gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>board</b> typically loses all its strength during a fire. The use of endothermic materials is established and proven to be sound engineering practice. The chemically bound water inside these materials sublimes. During this process, the unexposed side cannot exceed the boiling point of water. Once the hydrates are spent, the temperature on the unexposed side of an endothermic fire barrier tends to rise rapidly. Too much water can be a problem, however. Concrete slabs that are too wet, will literally explode in a fire, which is why test laboratories insist on measuring water content of concrete and mortar in fire test specimens, before running any fire tests. PFP measures can also include intumescents and ablative materials. The point is, however, that whatever the nature of the materials, they on their own bear no rating. They must be organised into systems, which bear a rating when installed in accordance with certification listings or established catalogues, such as DIN 4102 Part 4 or the Canadian National Building Code.|$|E

40|$|Fire {{resistance}} of light-gauge steel frame (LSF) walls {{can be enhanced}} by lining them with single or multiple layers of <b>wall</b> <b>boards.</b> This research {{is focused on the}} thermal per-formance of Magnesium Oxide (MgO) <b>wall</b> <b>boards</b> in comparison to the conventional gypsum plasterboards exposed to standard fire on one side. Thermal properties of MgO board and gypsum plasterboard were measured first and then used in the finite element heat transfer models of the two types of panels. The measured thermal property results show that MgO board will perform better than the gypsum plasterboards due to its higher specific heat values at elevated temperatures. However, MgO board loses 50 % of its ini-tial mass at about 500 °C compared to 16 % for gypsum plasterboard. The developed finite element models were validated using the fire test results of gypsum plasterboards and then used to study the thermal performance of MgO board panels. Finite element analysis re-sults show that when MgO board panels are exposed to standard fire on one side the rate of temperature rise on the ambient side is significantly reduced compared to gypsum plas-terboard. This has the potential to improve the overall thermal performance of MgO <b>board</b> lined LSF <b>walls</b> and their fire resistance levels (FRL). However, full scale fire tests are needed to confirm this. This paper presents the details of this investigation and the results...|$|R

40|$|Wall inscriptions, i. e. "inscriptions, symbols, slogans, or {{pictures}} {{painted on}} building <b>walls,</b> brick <b>walls,</b> <b>board</b> fences, {{and in public}} places", {{as part of the}} written language of an urban youth subculture, are seldom the subject of linguistic research and belong to the genre of the street artistic work referred to as graffiti. The phenomenon of graffiti can be regarded not only as a type of art (some murals can be found in New York galleries) but also as a sort of mass social communication, especially at the level of words, i. e. the strictly linguistic one. The urban space – <b>walls,</b> <b>boards,</b> public service vehicles (the underground, trains) – become a specific medium and a special means of subcultural social communication in that way. Wall inscriptions visually organise the urban space of interpersonal communication. Vital features of that genre are humour and hybridity in respect of form – the message may be a solely verbal one, a word may be accompanied by an image, but the message may also be a drawing only (graphic form). All those features enable establishing graffiti as a separate text genre of the urban written Polish language, whose feature, distinguishing it from other types of expression, is its unique illocutionary power. Through that act of illocution, authors of inscriptions want, at all cost, to achieve something in various spheres of reality, and in particular to draw other people’s attention to what those other people allegedly do not notice themselves...|$|R
