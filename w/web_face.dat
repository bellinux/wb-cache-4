40|$|The task of {{indexing}} {{and searching}} {{information in the}} World-Wide <b>Web</b> <b>face</b> scale problems with Web size and growth. We argue that this is due, in part, to the centralized nature of Web indexing systems currently in use. This paper proposes an open distributed Web View-based system {{to deal with these}} problems. The concept of Web View is introduced, the system architecture is presented, and it is shown how the system is able to effectively build, store and search distributed indices. The components of the system modules are then described, and a working prototype is presented. 1. INTRODUCTION Two basic strategies are currently used to build World-Wide Web (Web) indices: manually updated resource lists (e. g., [Yahoo!]), and mechanically updated index bases (e. g., [Altavista] and [Excite]). The available implementations of both strategies are essentially centralized as their processes of collecting information, and storing and searching indices are performed into/from a single database or [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Information {{available}} on the web is huge & it covers diversified fields. Nowadays most of search engines use essentially keyword based search techniques. We simply specify a set of keywords or query as a request and a reference we get a list of pages, ranked based on similarity of query. Currently searching <b>web</b> <b>face</b> with one problem that many times outcome is not satisfactory because of irrelevance of the information. Searching the exact information from such a huge repository of unstructured web data is still main area of research interest. One solution to achieve this is Semantic Web. Ontology is an effective concept commonly used for the Semantic Web. Ontology is “an explicit specification of a conceptualization”. There are two main pillars of semantic Web one is Problem Solving Methods & another is Ontology. Ontology building is a tedious job and a time consuming task for user.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} large scale, unconstrained, {{open set}} face recognition, which exhibits {{the properties of}} opera-tional face recognition scenarios. Most of the existing face recognition databases have been designed under controlled conditions or have been constructed from the images col-lected from the <b>web.</b> <b>Face</b> images collected from the web are less constrained than a mug-shot like collection. How-ever, they lack information about the imaging conditions and have no operational paradigm. In either case, most of the databases and evaluation algorithms have taken the form of ”closed set ” recognition, in which all testing classes {{are assumed to be}} known at training time. A more realistic scenario in face recognition is an ”open set, ” where lim-ited knowledge is available at training time and unknown classes can be present at test time. The database we provide supports the open set paradigm, which more closely mimics actual usage than classic closed set testing. The database also exhibits the natural variability among the face images such as pose, illumination, scale, expressions, occlusion, etc. Our goal is to provide around 100, 000 images of more than 1, 000 people. Also, with this paper, we release part 1 of the database, which consists of 6, 337 images from 308 subjects. The paper discusses the details of the database followed by the challenges and results of baseline algorithms. ...|$|E
40|$|Scaling machine {{learning}} methods to massive datasets has attracted considerable attention in recent years, thanks to {{easy access to}} ubiquitous sensing and data from the <b>web.</b> <b>Face</b> recognition is a task of great practical interest for which (i) very large labeled datasets exist, containing billions of images; (ii) the number of classes can reach tens of millions or more; and (iii) complex features are nec-essary in order to encode subtle differences between subjects, while maintaining invariance to factors such as pose, illumination, and aging. We present an elab-orate pipeline that consists of a crucial network compression step followed by a new bootstrapping scheme for selecting a challenging subset of the dataset for efficient training of a higher capacity network. By using this approach, {{we are able to}} greatly improve face recognition accuracy on the widely used LFW bench-mark. Moreover, as performance on supervised face verification (1 : 1) benchmarks saturates, we propose to shift the attention of the research community to the unsu-pervised Probe-Gallery (1 :N) identification benchmarks. On this task, we bridge between the literature and the industry, for the first time, by directly comparing with {{the state of the art}} Commercially-Off-The-Shelf system and show a sizable leap in performance. Lastly, we demonstrate an intriguing trade-off between the number of training samples and the optimal size of the network. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{investigation}} presented is the characterisation of the nonlinear cyclic behaviour of steel joints between I profile beams to hollow section columns with welded reverse channel. When compared with other steel shapes, tubular profiles show a privileged structural behaviour due {{to their ability to}} withstand axial loads, bending in several directions and torsion, besides considerable advantages in terms of maintenance and aesthetics. The welded reverse channel connection is a good solution since it allows for a bolted joint between I beam to hollow column. Furthermore, this type of joint detail has a reasonable construction cost, is easy to implement and possesses large ductility through the deformation of the web panel. In this paper a comparison is made between experimental and numerical finite element model results. The main focus will be on the results concerning the main components of the reverse channel, i. e. <b>web</b> <b>face</b> in bending, flanges panels in shear, compression and tension. The main objective of these tests is determining the strength, stiffness and rotation capacity of the main components of the reverse channel joining detail. In the experimental program the characteristics of the nonlinear behaviour of the principal reverse channel components is assessed by means of bending tests (monotonic and cyclic). The parameters which have been varied in the tests are the geometry of the loaded area and the dimensions of the flanges and web of the U shaped element.

The system consists of three parts: 1) a centralized service of health ontologies with tools, 2) a semantic content creation channel based on several distributed health organizations, and 3) an intelligent semantic portal aggegating and presenting the contents from intuitive and health promoting end-user perspectives. The system demontrates how semantic web techniques {{can be applied to}} solving problems of distributed content creation, discovery, linking, aggregation, and reuse in health information on {{a national}} level, from end-users’, content publishers’, and machine processing viewpoints.

Specifically, we propose to limit Adaboost search within a subset of the huge feature space, while evolving this subset following a Genetic Algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed GAdaboost is up to 3. 7 times faster than Adaboost.

However, let us assume that given your application architecture only 2 of these 10 servers are really <b>web</b> <b>facing</b> while the rest are used for storage, search, database or other internal functions then the provider that allows bandwidth pooling would let you consume overall 20 TB of bandwidth as incoming or outbound or both depending on their policy.

40|$|Query {{refinement}} {{in information}} retrieval over repositories on the <b>Web</b> <b>faces</b> problems {{when trying to}} adapt a purist database approach. Needed semantics and brokering facilities differ significantly when compared, for instance, with traditional SQL-like query schemes. Therefore, we propose an interaction model, adapted to Web sources, and based on constraints and {{on the notion of}} so-called "virtual answers". Our model extends both the basic pull and push models, but proposes virtual answers as a powerful means for further interactions from a given answer: typically, query refinement. A major contribution of this paper is the discussion of the issues of information combination (brokering) and of soundness and completeness of information retrieval engines (semantics) in the framework of this new model. We make the simplifying assumption that sources evolve monotonically. Strictly speaking, this may look irrealistic {{in the context of the}} Web, but it approximates many real situations, where changes in the sources occur on a larger time-scale than user sessions, or where clients check the validity of returned items before actually making use of them...|$|R

We propose an overlapping slicing method for handling high into more than one column; we protect privacy by breaking the association of uncorrelated attributes and preserve data utility by preserving the association between highly correlated attributes.

In particular, Cyclosa ginnaga and C. argenteoalba always face upwards, and C. octotuberculata always face downwards, whereas some C. confusa face upwards and others face downwards or even sideways. These spiders provide a unique opportunity to examine why most spiders face downwards and have asymmetrical webs. We found that upward-facing spiders had upside-down webs with larger upper parts, downward-facing spiders had normal webs with larger lower parts and sideways-facing spiders had more symmetrical webs. Downward-facing C. confusa spiders were larger than upward- and sideways-facing individuals. We also found that during prey attacks, downward-facing spiders ran significantly faster downwards than upwards, which was not the case in upward-facing spiders. These results suggest that the spider's orientation at the hub and web asymmetry enhance its foraging efficiency by minimizing the time to reach prey trapped in the web...|$|R
