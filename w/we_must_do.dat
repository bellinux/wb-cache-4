5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> is understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

We cannot be crowded into matters, however great might be the blessing attending such procedure. We cannot be forced into living a celestial law; <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> this ourselves, of our own free will. And whatever we do in regard to the principle of the United Order, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> it because we desire to do it.|$|E

25|$|In June 1921 Lloyd George {{complained that}} he could “never get a sane discussion” with Wilson. When Wilson told him (5 July) that he “did not speak to murderers” and would hand de Valera over to the police on his {{forthcoming}} visit to London the Prime Minister replied “Oh nonsense. In public life <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> these things”. This {{appears to have been}} the final break between Wilson and Lloyd George – despite the urgings of Worthington-Evans Wilson did not meet the Prime Minister again until 10 February 1922, Wilson sending deputies to Cabinet when asked for his advice. In October 1921 Lloyd George complained that Wilson was “very difficult” and he was not sad that his term of office was almost up. Lord Derby thought Wilson had allowed his personal feelings to get the better of his duties as a soldier. Wilson thought the Irish Treaty (6 December 1921) a “shameful & cowardly surrender to the pistol” by a “Cabinet of Cowards” and, correctly predicting civil war in Ireland, was keen to get out before “one set of murderers” (the Irish government) asked for British military aid against “another set of murderers”.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} {{published}} in The Hill, Higgins and fellow Alliance for Charitable Reform co-founder Dan Peters responded to discussion of legislative regulatory proposals, saying that, [...] "ACR believes that every dollar of tax increases on foundations {{is to the}} federal government rather than a dollar to charities, and the ACR is troubled by that notion.... We cannot adopt a one-size-fits-all solution that disadvantages smaller organizations. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> everything possible to encourage philanthropy and not create barriers to charitable giving." ...|$|E

500|$|Of greater {{detriment}} to {{the project}} in the long term, Harrison's business manager, Allen Klein, had neglected to register the concerts as UNICEF fundraising benefits before they had taken place. As a result, the American and British tax departments were demanding {{a share of the}} proceeds from the live album and Saul Swimmer's concert film, ignoring Harrison's appeals that an exception be made in the case of this humanitarian disaster. Until India's defeat of Pakistan on 16 December, America continued to supply arms and financial aid to the Pakistani army, led by General Yahya Khan, despite reports of genocide being committed against the Bangladeshis. In reply to a New Yorker's offer to start a petition to make the US Treasury scrap its tax on the Concert for Bangladesh album, Harrison wrote: [...] "Until the [...] become human, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> our service to others without their help." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of August 1797, after six weeks of {{constant}} easterly winds that kept his ships trapped in their harbour, De Winter decided that an attempt to join the French at Brest as {{the first stage of}} an invasion of Ireland was impractical and he abandoned the plan. In part this decision was due to the strength of Duncan's reconstituted fleet, which had increased to 17 ships of the line with the addition of the vessels returned from the Nore. Duncan's men were also better trained and more experienced than their Dutch counterparts, having spent considerably longer at sea and having been taught to fire three rounds a minute to the Dutch two. In addition to his concerns about the proficiency of his men, De Winter was also worried about their loyalty: the dominion of France over the Batavian Republic and the country's enforced participation in distant theatres of warfare were unpopular among the Dutch people. Although De Winter was an avowed republican, who had fought in the French Army against the Netherlands between 1793 and 1795, support for the House of Orange remained strong among the Dutch population and with the fleet's sailors. Wolfe Tone wrote in frustration that [...] "The destiny of Europe might have been changed for ever [...] [...] [...] the great occasion is lost, and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>do</b> as well as we can." ...|$|E
