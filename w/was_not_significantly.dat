5|$|As the Telephone Building {{was being}} {{completed}} in 1925, {{a group of}} Methodist Episcopalians came to Pflueger, asking him to design a new skyscraper containing both a church and a hotel for them at 100 McAllister Street. After a dispute, Miller and Pflueger were fired from the project {{to be replaced by}} Lewis P. Hobart. Miller and Pflueger sued for $81,600, alleging that Hobart's design <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> changed from Pflueger's original. Three months after the hotel and church opened in January 1930, Miller and Pflueger won $38,000 in court, equivalent to $ today.|$|E
5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> {{enhanced}} in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E
5|$|HMS Collingwood was {{the lead}} ship of her class of ironclad battleships built for the Royal Navy during the 1880s. The ship's {{essential}} design became the standard {{for most of the}} following British battleships. Completed in 1887, she spent the next two years in reserve before she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet for the next eight years. After returning home in 1897, the ship spent the next six years as a guardship in Ireland. Collingwood <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> damaged during an accidental collision in 1899 and was paid off four years later. The ship was sold for scrap in 1909 and subsequently broken up.|$|E

5|$|Kasuga and Nisshin {{participated in}} the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, but only played a minor role {{as they were in}} the rear of the Japanese battleline. During the battle, the ship's {{executive}} officer was Kantarō Suzuki, later Prime Minister of Japan. Kasuga <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> damaged, although she was hit three times with 11 crewmen wounded. Kasuga fired 33 ten-inch shells along with an unknown number of eight-inch shells during the battle. After the battle the sisters returned to Pigeon Bay where they engaged the Russian fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York {{and the removal of}} the baggage of a passenger who decided not to board the jet. The instrument approach landing was uneventful and the jet <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate.|$|E
5|$|A Company <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> {{delayed by}} the German patrols it {{encountered}} later, although {{the presence of}} cheering Dutch crowds delayed the whole battalion as it passed through Oosterbeek. As they approached the railway bridge, C Company detached to capture it, but German engineers blew the bridge just as the British were starting to cross it. A Company now encountered enemy armoured cars, but successfully skirted them by manoeuvering through the back gardens of the houses {{on either side of}} the road At 8pm, as darkness fell, Grayburn's platoon led A Company into Arnhem centre and under the main ramp of Arnhem road bridge. Tatham-Warter deployed his platoons around the ramp; 2 Platoon covered both sides of the northernmost extreme of the ramp where it fed into the town centre.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, Commodore sales were {{beginning}} to decline. Holden's six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> more fuel-efficient or better performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by {{the time of}} the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Despite high review {{scores for}} the Dreamcast version, the GameCube version {{released}} six months later received poorer reviews: respective Metacritic and GameRankings scores of 73 percent and 72.33 percent. Critics generally felt that although the game was still enjoyable, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> improved from the Dreamcast original. However, Shane Bettenhausen of GameSpy saw Battle as noticeably superior; {{in addition to its}} upgrades, its action was better suited to the GameCube's controller than the Dreamcast's. The game sold almost 50,000 copies in its first week in Japan. By July 2006, it had sold 1.2 million copies and earned $44 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 42nd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. It sold 1.44million copies in the United States by December 2007, {{making it one of the}} best-selling GameCube games.|$|E
5|$|Habsburg saw {{action at}} the Battle of Lissa in July 1866, though she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> engaged during the battle. In 1870, she was used {{in a show of}} force to try to prevent the Italian {{annexation}} of Rome while the city's protector, France, was distracted with the Franco-Prussian War, though the Italians took the city regardless. The ship's armament was revised several times in the 1870s and 1880s, before she was ultimately withdrawn from frontline service and employed as a guard ship and a barracks ship in Pola in 1886. She served in this role until 1898 when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 18991900.|$|E

5|$|Improvements {{began in}} 1785 with an {{extension}} {{to the north}} designed by James Wyatt. Buildings close {{to the west and}} north sides were demolished, and John Foster prepared plans for the west façade. In 1786 Wood's square dome was demolished and plans were made by Wyatt for a new dome over the central courtyard. In 1795, before the new dome was built, the hall was seriously damaged by a fire. Wyatt's north extension <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> damaged, but Wood's original building was gutted. The building was reconstructed and Wyatt's new dome was added. The work was supervised by Foster and completed in 1802. Under the dome the central courtyard was replaced with a hall containing a staircase. In 1811 a portico was added to the south side. The construction and decoration of the interior was completed by about 1820.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a causal link between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E
5|$|Nürnberg saw {{relatively}} {{limited service}} during the war, {{due to her}} commissioning late in the conflict. She participated in Operation Albion in October 1917 against the Russian Navy in the Baltic. The following month, she was engaged in the Second Battle of Helgoland Bight, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> damaged during the engagement. She {{was assigned to the}} final, planned operation of the High Seas Fleet that was to have taken place in the closing days of the war, though a major mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. After the end of the war, the ship was interned in Scapa Flow. In the scuttling of the German fleet in June 1919, British ships managed to beach Nürnberg and she was later refloated and sunk as a gunnery target in 1922.|$|E

5|$|The ships, {{named after}} provinces of France, were never {{completed}} due to shifting production requirements after {{the outbreak of}} war in 1914. The first four ships were sufficiently advanced in construction to permit their launching to clear the shipyards for other, more important work. Many of the guns built for the ships were instead converted {{for use by the}} Army. After the war, the French Navy considered several proposals to complete the ships, either as originally designed or modernized to account for lessons from the war. The weak French post-war economy, however, necessitated that the first four ships be broken up for scrap. The last ship, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> advanced at the time work halted, was converted into an aircraft carrier in the 1920s. She remained in service in various capacities until the 1960s. The ship was ultimately scrapped in 1967.|$|E
5|$|While {{the number}} of losses {{incurred}} against German night fighters <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> large the psychological damage was substantial. A high number of crashes owed much to nervous British bomber pilots who did not feel safe over their own airfields and consequently landed too hard and fast or refused to go around a second time for fear of enemy intruders. Just as it appeared night intruder sorties were showing promise Adolf Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, {{he thought that the}} morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during The Blitz. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941. Kammhuber would unsuccessfully lobby to have intruder operations reinstated and his efforts to expand the intruder force beyond a single unit were thwarted by an uninterested High Command which was inundated with requests for reinforcements in other theatres.|$|E
5|$|The 173d Airborne Brigade {{was made}} part of Task Force Viking, a special {{operations}} {{task force that}} contained elements of the 10th Mountain Division and the 10th Special Forces Group. The use of the 173d {{as a part of}} a special operations task force was a unique first in U.S. Army history. This force was assisted by Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq and tasked with attacking key airfield and oil production positions deep in northern Iraq. The brigade would take off from Aviano Air Base in Italy, a 4½-hour flight from northern Iraq. As the preparations for the brigade were in their final stages, it moved 10 trains and 300 trucks worth of equipment to the air base, as well as 120 busloads of soldiers. Though the brigade's movement was impeded by Italian protestors, the Italian police provided escort operations to the brigade and ensured that it reached the Air Base without incident, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> delayed. Operation Iraqi Freedom began on 20 March with V Corps, consisting of the 101st Airborne Division, 82nd Airborne Division, and 3d Infantry Division making a forceful push from the south, beginning the Iraq War. A few days later, the 173d and 10th Special Forces Group departed for northern Iraq.|$|E
