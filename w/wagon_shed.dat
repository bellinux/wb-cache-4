25|$|Holmestrand was {{the main}} depot of HVB and {{included}} a series of operations buildings {{in addition to the}} company's administration. It consisted of a station building, a freight building, an outhouse, a locomotive depot, a <b>wagon</b> <b>shed,</b> a coal shed, a turntable and a guardhouse. The station had five tracks, of which three were spurs. Two of these connected to small turnstiles, which were only large enough to handle freight cars. North of the station the line connected to the Vestfold Line at Holmestrand Station. At Gausen there was en engine shed with two tracks. There were gradually built branch lines to major industrial facilities in town, such as the power company Holmestrand Elektrisitetsverk, Nordisk Aluminium and the fish market.|$|E
25|$|The station cost NOK27,300. The largest amount {{was for the}} depot, {{which cost}} NOK5,000. Other major posts were NOK3,000 for the freight house and NOK2,000 each for the station {{building}} and <b>wagon</b> <b>shed.</b> Signaling systems and inventory cost NOK2,000. HVB was officially opened on 2 October 1902. The shed at Gausen quickly proved to be too small and was expanded in 1906 with additional space for rolling stock and a carpenter's workshop, costing NOK1153.65. It was expanded further the following year for NOK322.60. The final expansion took place in 1910, when a shed for storing and drying wood was built. At first the station only had three tracks, increasing to four in 1907, costing NOK347.46. That year the station handled 68 tonnes of express cargo and 8,884 tonnes of regular cargo, in addition to 24 live animals. Later the station also received two additional spurs which each had a small turnstiles.|$|E

60|$|When {{the others}} arrived {{they found that}} Tom had carried poor Dick to the <b>wagon</b> <b>shed</b> and placed him {{on a pile of}} horse blankets, and was washing his wounded head with water. At the sight of her nephew lying there so still Mrs. Rover gave a scream.|$|E
60|$|Four {{times did}} Dick sail around the cornfield, {{the last time}} making such a wide circle that he went {{directly}} over the barn and the <b>wagon</b> <b>shed.</b> Then he shut off the engine and glided slowly to earth, coming {{down in the middle}} of the field with scarcely a jar.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{half an hour}} afterward, as Gale {{was leaving}} his room, he saw the Yaqui running up the path from the fields. It was {{markedly}} {{out of the ordinary}} to see the Indian run. Gale wondered what was the matter. Yaqui ran straight to Belding, who was at work at his bench under the <b>wagon</b> <b>shed.</b> In less than a moment Belding was bellowing for his rangers. Gale got to him first, but Ladd and Lash were not far behind.|$|E

"Well," [...] he went on, [...] "that being so, {{the next}} {{thing to do is}} to obtain the {{necessary}} cash to pay Janter his valuation and stock the place-- about four thousand would do it, or perhaps," [...] he added, with an access of generous confidence, [...] "we had better say five. There are about fifty acres of those low-lying meadows which want to be thoroughly bush drained--bushes are quite as good as pipes for that stiff land, if they put in the right sort of stuff, and it don't cost half so much-- but still it can't be done for nothing, and then there is a new <b>wagon</b> <b>shed</b> wanted, and some odds and ends; yes, we had better say five thousand." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two boys}} walked {{to where the}} biplane had been put together, in a large open <b>wagon</b> <b>shed</b> {{attached}} {{to the rear of}} the big barn. The biplane has a stretch from side to side of over thirty feet, and the shed had been cleaned out from end to end to make room for it. There was a rudder in front and another behind, and in the centre was a broad cane seat, with a steering wheel, and several levers for controlling the craft. Back of the seat was the engine, lightly built but powerful, and above was a good-sized tank of gasoline. The framework of the biplane was of bamboo, held together by stays of piano wire, and the planes themselves were of canvas, especially prepared so as to be almost if not quite air proof. All told, the machine was a fine one, thoroughly up-to-date, and had cost considerable money.|$|E
6000|$|The station {{consisted}} of a stable, a <b>wagon</b> <b>shed,</b> and a building containing three rooms. The first was fitted up with [...] "bunks" [...] or sleeping berths for the employees; the second was the kitchen; and the third and larger apartment was dining-room or sitting-room, and was used as general waiting-room for the passengers. It was not a refreshment station, {{and there was no}} [...] "bar." [...] But a mysterious command from the omnipotent Bill produced a demijohn of whiskey, with which he hospitably treated the company. The seductive influence of the liquor loosened the tongue of the gallant Judge Thompson. He admitted to having struck a match to enable the fair Pike Countian to find her ring, which, however, proved to have fallen in her lap. She was [...] "a fine, healthy young woman--a type of the Far West, sir; in fact, quite a prairie blossom! yet simple and guileless as a child." [...] She {{was on her way to}} Marysville, he believed, [...] "although she expected to meet friends--a friend, in fact--later on." [...] It was her first visit to a large town--in fact, any civilized centre--since she crossed the plains three years ago. Her girlish curiosity was quite touching, and her innocence irresistible. In fact, in a country whose tendency was to produce [...] "frivolity and forwardness in young girls, he found her a most interesting young person." [...] She was even then out in the stable-yard watching the horses being harnessed, [...] "preferring to indulge a pardonable healthy young curiosity than to listen to the empty compliments of the younger passengers." ...|$|E

50|$|On 6 June 1865 the London Gazette {{reported}} that Boaz Bloomer had bought out Davis’s {{share of the}} company, and would now run it with his son, Boaz Bloomer Jr. They also bought several coal mines, which in addition to selling coal as far afield as London, supplied the ironworks with the coal necessary to keep their engines running. They changed {{the name of the}} business to The Pelsall Coal and Iron Company. It grew into an extensive and highly profitable ironworks with two blast furnaces, forty puddling furnaces, seven mills and forges, a gashouse and gasometer, and a large tramway with locomotive and <b>wagon</b> <b>sheds.</b> The company exported all over the world, from the United States to China and India, with nails going to Canada, Norway and Sweden.

The miry cow yard, {{with the}} hollow trampled {{out around the}} horse trough, the disconsolate hens standing under the <b>wagons</b> and <b>sheds,</b> a pig wallowing across its sty, and for atmosphere the desolate, falling rain. It was so familiar he felt a pang of the old rebellious despair which seized him on such days in his boyhood.|$|R
50|$|The first {{buildings}} to be constructed on the Kelvin Grove Defence Reserve were an Infantry drill hall, {{consisting of a}} large drill space with eight offices along {{one side of the}} building, an associated toilet building, and an artificers workshop for Army mechanics, completed in 1914. This began an era of intense building activity at the site, precipitated by Australia's entry into World War I in August 1914. To enable the construction of further buildings, the site had to be made level, an activity costing over £3000. By October 1915, the levelling had been finished, and another building, the Engineer's depot, had been added to the site. This two-storey timber building was rectangular in shape, and was constructed to the design of Queensland Public Works Department architects. This building was completed at a cost of just over £1500 for the 23rd and 15th Engineer Companies, and included two <b>wagon</b> <b>sheds</b> and two harness rooms.|$|R
50|$|The {{roundhouse}} {{has since}} been converted into industrial units but since April 1987 the adjacent <b>wagon</b> repair <b>shed</b> {{has been used to}} service diesel locomotives, local passenger trains, and wagons used for china clay traffic.
