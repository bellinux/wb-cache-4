40|$|Field {{testing of}} the wagon health card was {{completed}} using the RailCorp AK Track recording car. The wagon health card device was installed on the AK Car to allow the device to be tested and compared with the measured track data and AK car vehicle responses. As <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> forces cannot be measured directly these were calculated using VAMPIRE simulation. An inverse model with parameters matching the AK Car was embedded in the wagon health card device. The inverse model had been developed in earlier research to predict <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> forces using only measurements of car body responses; lateral and vertical accelerations, roll, pitch and yaw angular velocities. The device tested was also a proof of concept test for an integrated device with all transducers mounted within the one small 'black box'. Testing was completed in January 2007 on the Parks-Cobar section in NSW. The following paper presents the results and discusses the difficulties in validation without direct wheel-rail contact forces measurements. The results for estimating vertical contact forces were quite encouraging and acceptable for a proof of concept device. There was significant difference in lateral predictions and hence L/V ratios probably due to differences between assumed and actual wheel profiles...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} tribological aspects and the latest type of laboratory equipment {{which is expected to}} offer particular new knowledge in the field of railway <b>wheel</b> - <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> phenomena diagnostics. The main considerations stated in this work imply that the coefficient of adhesion is among others dependent on contact temperature, and therefore it is possible to theoretically predict the value of the coefficient of adhesion. This fact has not been considered in the theory of adhesive contact so far. The entirely credible prognosis of the studied unfavourable effects is hardly satisfactorily solvable in theory. Hence, the authors present a new testing device by which the predicted effects will be verified. At the same time, the oscillation effect on the state of surface will be observed in the attached formulas. The work also implies that the effects evaluating possible initiations and local degradations of the contact area of railway <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> are closely bound to the tribological effects that are comprehended here as dynamic processes.

40|$|Abstract — Rail joints are use for {{the purpose}} of joining the two rails. Due to large number of {{drawbacks}} and for safety purpose the number of joint in mainline track has been minimized by the widespread use of continuously welded rail (CWR). For automated block signaling it is required to have sections of track electrically insulated from each other, disallowing the rail to be continuously welded as is done where possible,this joint is called as insulated rail joint(IRJ). The IRJ is however substantially weaker than the rail and so is subjected to large stresses, causing failure.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a {{numerical}} procedure for surface crack initiation analysis {{based on the}} critical plane approach is proposed. The complex stress/strain state of <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> (W/R) <b>contact</b> is analysed by means of submodelling approach together with the transient contact nodal loads obtained from dynamic W/R rolling contact analysis. Meanwhile, a novel refining method is developed and utilized to discretise the full- and sub- solid models. In these models, realistic <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> geometries and bilinear kinematic hardening material are both taken into account. The validity of the sub-modelling procedure has been successfully confirmed by simulation results comparison and cutting boundary stress ferification. Moreover, the crack initiation analysis are implemented with integration of three advanced fatigue life models. Based on the results, it can be noticed that the surface initial crack orientation may differ from each other under different critical plane definitions. Also, it is worth mentioning that the numerical procedure is effective and efficient enough for doing crack initiation analysis. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the {{calculation}} of the longitudinal location of a <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> point on the wheelset’s motion in a vehicle dynamic simulation. All current vehicle dynamic software programs assume that the contact between wheel and rail takes place in the vertical plane through the wheelset’s rolling axis. However, when the yaw angle of the wheelset is nonzero, the contact point is situated up to 10 ?mm from that plane. This difference causes a difference in the yaw moment on the wheelset which is used in the vehicle dynamic simulation. To such an end, an existing analytical method to determine the longitudinal method was validated using a numerical approach. Then vehicle dynamic simulations with both the classic and the new contact location were performed, concluding that using a more accurate contact point location results in a smaller wheelset yaw angle in a vehicle dynamic simulation, although the effect is small.

40|$|The rail–wheel contact generates plastic {{deformation}} and {{cracks in the}} top layer of a rail. Rolling contact fatigue (RCF) cracks in rail samples from track and from a full scale test rig were examined.

Thereby, the pearlite becomes anisotropic, and resistance to cracks is lower in certain directions. RCF cracks follow the weakest direction of the microstructure, which in pearlitic railway rails is the aligned pearlite structure or singular weaknesses such as pro-eutectoid ferrites or slags. The deformation of the microstructure is different depending on loading situation and original microstructure (rail grade). Once the {{plastic deformation}} is present, the cracks follow the path of the weakest crack resistance.

Reliability and dependability in complex mechanical systems can be improved by fault detection and isolation methods (FDI).

This work addresses FDI for a railway vehicle: The mechanical model is described as a multibody system, which is excited randomly due to track irregularities. The aim of this work is to detect faults in the suspension system of the vehicle. A Kalman filter is used to estimate the states. In order to detect and isolate faults, the detection error is minimized with multiple Kalman filters. A full scale train model with nonlinear <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>contact</b> and nonlinear suspension forces serves as an example for the described techniques.

40|$|One of {{the major}} costs {{incurred}} by railway companies is the maintenance of turnouts.

Such an insight can be obtained through a detailed model of the train-turnout interaction. Such models exist in the literature for vehicle-track interaction, but they have some shortcomings when it comes to train-turnout interaction. This leads to the following research questions: 1.

A quasi static approach has been presented and the results have been compared to results obtained through dynamic simulation. The analysis of the contact models in this dissertation will help researchers choose between the different contact models and their interaction with vehicle dynamic software. This should enable researchers to accurately model the contact in turnouts so that the deterioration mechanisms in turnouts can be understood.
