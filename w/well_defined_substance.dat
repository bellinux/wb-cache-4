40|$|The yellow substance, gilvin, is an {{important}} component of water quality in natural waters. Quantitative study of gilvin production is difficult since gilvin is not a <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> <b>substance.</b> In the present study, leaf litter from four common tree species of south-western Australia were exposed to rainy weather for 183 days and leachate properties were monitored. The gilvin leaching from litter was estimated using a ‘humic acid (HA) equivalent’ concept, derived by drawing an analogy between the spectrophotometric properties of gilvin and that of humic acid. Gilvin (g 440, m- 1) was leached from litter primarily during the first few weeks after the commencement of the wet season. On average, 13 % less gilvin was leached under ‘flooded’ conditions compared with ‘non-flooded’ conditions. Litter leaching in the presence of soil caused a significant time lag (about a month) for the peak load to occur, and reduced the total gilvin in the leachate through soil–litter interactions. Banksia menziesii leaves produced little gilvin, equivalent to 6. 6 % of that leached from the flooded gum. The Eucalyptus species, such as flooded gum and jarrah, common in wooded catchments in the region, appeared to be a major player producing yellow-coloured substances under annual rainfall conditions in south-western Australia...|$|E
40|$|The Friedel-Crafts {{reaction}} {{has been}} used in the preparation of thiophene ketones, some of which were hitherto unknown. Certain limitations of the reaction have been noted. The mercuration of thiophene ketones has been systematically investigated for the first time. Many new halogen derivatives of benzothienone have been synthesized. These were employed in the elucidation of the structure of a complex mercurial derived from this ketone. A new modification of an old reaction has been developed whereby benzothienone can be mercurated quickly and almost quantitatively. Interesting derivatives of this little known ketone have been synthesized. Chief among these are the previously inaccessible arsenicals, reasonably stable, <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> <b>substances,</b> which should merit further consideration. The mercuration of acetothienone is complicated by the presence of the reactive alpha hydrogens of the side chain. Although several mercurials have been obtained, true aromatic substitution has not been achieved successfully. The fact that two mercurials have been prepared from nitrothiophene is contrary to the observation of an earlier investigator who said, “ 2 -Nitrothiophen mit Sublimat reagieren nicht. ” Advisor: Cliff S.
