At the time, Maxwell {{was working as a}} gardener with the Department of the Interior in Canberra. The book was a success, but Maxwell soon spent <b>what</b> <b>money</b> he made from it. In the late 1930s, he wrote the manuscript for a second book entitled From the Hindenburg Line to the Breadline. The book was never published and the manuscript was lost when it was lent to someone to read.|$|E
5|$|The {{final results}} of the Italian {{campaign}} were limited {{in terms of the}} advantages gained by the Empire. The city of Ancona became a Byzantine base in Italy, accepting the Emperor as sovereign. The Normans of Sicily had been damaged and now came to terms with the Empire, ensuring peace for the rest of Manuel's reign. The Empire's ability to get involved in Italian affairs had been demonstrated. However, given the enormous quantities of gold which had been lavished on the project, it also demonstrated the limits of <b>what</b> <b>money</b> and diplomacy alone could achieve. The expense of Manuel's involvement in Italy must have cost the treasury a great deal (probably more than 2,160,000 hyperpyra or 30,000 pounds of gold), and yet it produced only limited solid gains.|$|E
25|$|These {{examples}} show that, in {{the absence}} of effective legal tender laws, Gresham's Law works in reverse. If given the choice of <b>what</b> <b>money</b> to accept, people will transact with money they believe to be of highest long-term value. However, if not given the choice, and required to accept all money, good and bad, they will tend to keep the money of greater perceived value in their possession, and pass on the bad money to someone else. In short, {{in the absence}} of legal tender laws, the seller will not accept anything but money of certain value (good money), while the existence of legal tender laws will cause the buyer to offer only money with the lowest commodity value (bad money) as the creditor must accept such money at face value.|$|E

500|$|As the {{definition}} of [...] "amateur" [...] varied by sport, many of the battles he engaged in concerned the question of <b>what</b> <b>money</b> or valuables could an athlete accept, while retaining his amateur status, with some sports more liberal than others—in 1948, tennis allowed expense payments of up to $600 per tournament, while boxing permitted valuable prizes as awards. Enforcement of these rules often fell to National Olympic Committees, and Brundage found them less than enthusiastic about rules which hampered their own athletes {{in the pursuit of}} medals.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute <b>what</b> <b>money</b> they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama will tell you how to dispose of it, and tell me all about it".|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois on December 20, 1954, the third of seven children. The only {{surviving}} daughter, she considered herself the [...] "odd number {{in a set of}} men". Cisneros's great-grandfather had played the piano for the Mexican president and was from a wealthy background, but he gambled away his family's fortune. Her paternal grandfather was a veteran of the Mexican Revolution, and he used <b>what</b> <b>money</b> he had saved to give her father, Alfredo Cisneros de Moral, the opportunity to go to college. However, after failing classes due to what Cisneros called his [...] "lack of interest" [...] in studying, Alfredo ran away to the United States to escape his father's anger. While roaming the southern United States with his brother, Alfredo visited Chicago where he met Elvira Cordero Anguiano. After getting married, the pair settled in one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. Cisneros's biographer Robin Ganz writes that she acknowledges her mother's family name came from a very humble background, tracing its roots back to Guanajuato, Mexico, while her father's was much more [...] "admirable".|$|E

500|$|Although the {{original}} referendum for a one-cent transit sales tax increase had failed in 1999, a half-cent sales surtax (Charter County Transit System Surtax) increase {{was passed by}} a two-to-one margin by Miami-Dade County voters in November 2002, with the intention being for the revenue to go fully towards the funding of new transit lines, including the Metrorail Orange Line, new bus routes, and increased service. Metrorail briefly ran a 24-hour hourly service from 12am to 5am and rush hour peak headways were reduced to 6 minutes, {{but the idea of}} the transit tax was sold to voters as being able to fund up to [...] of additional Metrorail track by the 2030 long range plan, beginning with a completion of an Orange Line north corridor and east–west line by 2016. As it turned out, Miami-Dade Transit was running a deficit and used some of the tax to close the books, as well as using some to hire new staff, pay rent, and buy furniture for their new headquarters at Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre Station. [...] By the late 2000s recession, it was realized that only the [...] AirportLink of the Orange Line would be funded, and after service cuts in 2008, Metrorail was running fewer trains than before the tax was passed. In response to all this, The Miami Herald published a comprehensive exposé titled [...] "Taken For A Ride, How the transit tax went off track", detailing all of the promises that were not kept as well as <b>what</b> <b>money</b> was misspent and how. Despite the service cuts, due to the rise in energy prices and ever-increasing congestion, as well as a significant amount of residential development in the downtown area, ridership continued to grow during the 2000s, averaging well over 60,000 weekday riders throughout 2011. However, this is still short of the 1985 estimate of 75,000 daily riders that were expected {{by the end of that}} year. The transit tax also funded improvements to the adjoining Metromover system, including removal of the 25 cent fare, with the idea that higher ridership on the system would lead to higher Metrorail ridership, as well as the realization that the cost of fare collection exceeded fare revenue.|$|E

2500|$|Money is a {{means of}} final payment for goods in most price system economies and the unit of account in which prices are {{typically}} stated. Money has general acceptability, relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elasticity in supply, and longevity with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It {{has been described as a}} social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others.

2500|$|Having {{recognized}} the area's historic character and importance, {{the city had}} big plans for the area. The Democratic political machine of Daniel P.

With <b>what</b> <b>money</b> they did have, they chose a plan that would, they hoped, [...] "revitalize" [...] the neighborhood and preserve what had been recognized as special about it.

2500|$|Our Mutual Friend, {{written in}} the years 1864–65, is the last novel {{completed}} by Charles Dickens {{and is one of}} his most sophisticated works, combining savage satire with social analysis.

[...] In the opening chapters a body is found in the Thames and identified as that of John Harmon, a young man recently returned to London to receive his inheritance. Were he alive, his father's will would require him to marry Bella Wilfer, a beautiful, mercenary girl whom he had never met. Instead, the money passes to the working-class Boffins, and the effects spread into various corners of London society.|$|E
2500|$|At the 1936 Winter Olympics in Bavaria, she met Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, a young German aristocrat. Prince Bernhard was a suave young businessman, {{and though}} not a playboy, {{certainly}} a [...] "man about town" [...] with a dashing lifestyle. However, his rank and religion were suitable; so Princess Juliana's royal engagement was arranged by her mother. Princess Juliana fell deeply {{in love with her}} fiancé, a love that was to last a lifetime and that withstood separation during the war and Bernhard's extramarital affairs and illegitimate children. The astute Queen Wilhelmina, by then the richest woman in the world, left nothing to chance. Wilhelmina had her lawyers draw up a prenuptial agreement that specified exactly what the German-born prince could and could not do, and <b>what</b> <b>money</b> he would receive from the royal estate. The couple's engagement was announced on 8 September 1936.|$|E
