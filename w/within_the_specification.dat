40|$|A 472 dimpled ball {{grid array}} (D-BGA) package has not been used in past space flight environments, {{therefore}} {{it was necessary to}} develop a process that would yield robust and reliable solder joints.

The evidence suggests that fixed-parameter rules are inflexible, leading to wide swings in performance both across commodities and time periods.

5000|$|Larger {{values of}} Ppk may be {{interpreted}} to indicate that a process is more capable of producing output <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> limits, though this interpretation is controversial. Strictly speaking, from a statistical standpoint, Ppk is meaningless if the process under study is not in control because one cannot reliably estimate the process underlying probability distribution, let alone parameters like \hat{\mu} and \hat{\sigma}. [...] Furthermore, using this metric of past process performance to predict future performance is highly suspect.|$|E

50|$|The {{expiration}} date printed on drug packaging will {{differ from the}} true {{expiration date}} of the drug. Before the true expiration of a drug, its active ingredient will retain its potency. Also before expiration, no components of the drug will degrade to become harmful. Since products continually change over time, the characteristics of any drug are not unchanging but instead estimated with assay measurements to be <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> required by the government regulator where the drug is sold. As a general estimate, a drug becomes unfit for use when 10% of the active ingredient is degraded.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} for UPnP networking is IP addressing. Each device must implement a DHCP client {{and search for}} a DHCP server when the device is first connected to the network. If no DHCP server is available, the device must assign itself an address. The process by which a UPnP device assigns itself an address is known within the UPnP Device Architecture as AutoIP. In UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.0, AutoIP is defined <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> itself; in UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.1, AutoIP references IETF RFC 3927. If during the DHCP transaction, the device obtains a domain name, for example, through a DNS server or via DNS forwarding, the device should use that name in subsequent network operations; otherwise, the device should use its IP address.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the strict}} {{mathematical}} formalism may be complex, {{in a simple}} interpretation the WCD is the maximum of all possible (i.e. being <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> limits) performance variances divided by {{the distance to the}} performance specification, given that the performance variances [...] are evaluated under the space spanned by the operating range range. Note: This interpretation is valid for normal (Gaussian) distributed variables and performances, luckily the [...] "specification-margin" [...] of a design is almost intuitively related to the yield, e.g. if we have a larger [...] "safety margin" [...] in our design to the limit(s) we are more on the safe side and the production will contain less fail samples. Actually the advantage of WCD is that it offers an elegant method to treat also non-normal and multi-variate distributions and still offerering a picturial, intuitive understanding! ...|$|E
