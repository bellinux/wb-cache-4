5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
5|$|Stanton wanted EVE {{to be at}} {{the higher}} end of technology, and asked iPod {{designer}} Jonathan Ive to inspect her design. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed.</b> Her eyes are modelled on Lite-Brite toys, but Pixar chose not to make them overly expressive as it would be too easy to have her eyes turn into hearts to express love or something similar. Her limited design meant the animators had to treat her like a drawing, relying on posing her body to express emotion. They also found her similar to a manatee or a narwhal because her floating body resembled an underwater creature. Auto was a conscious homage to HAL 9000 from , and the usage of Also sprach Zarathustra for the showdown between the captain and Auto furthers that. The manner in which he hangs from a wall gives him a threatening feel, like a spider. Originally, Auto was designed entirely differently, resembling EVE, but masculine and authoritative; the Steward robots were also more aggressive Patrol-bots. The majority of the robot cast were formed with the Build-a-bot program, where different heads, arms and treads were combined together in over a hundred variations. The humans were modelled on sea lions due to their blubbery bodies, as well as babies. The filmmakers noticed baby fat is a lot tighter than adult fat and copied that texture for the film's humans.|$|E

25|$|Heifetz visited much of Europe {{while still}} in his teens. In April 1911, Heifetz {{performed}} in an outdoor concert in St. Petersburg before 25,000 spectators; {{there was such a}} sensational reaction that police officers needed to protect the young violinist after the concert.

He was not the only one; the Count Gerolamo Riccati wrote several letters praising her compositions and musical talent. Another very famous performance was her theatrical debut, the Cantata Pastorale Il Ristoro d'Arcadia, in Milan at the Teatro Regio Ducal in 1747 where she dedicated her piece to various rulers of the surrounding areas of Saxony and Austria.|$|E

25|$|Nazimova {{helped start}} {{the careers of}} both of Rudolph Valentino's wives, Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova. Although she was {{involved}} in an affair with Acker, it is debated as to whether her connection with Rambova ever developed into a sexual affair. Nevertheless, there were rumors that Nazimova and Rambova were involved in a lesbian affair (they are discussed at length in Dark Lover, Emily Leider's biography of Rudolph Valentino) but those rumors have never been definitely confirmed. She <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> by Rambova's skills as an art director, and Rambova designed the innovative sets for Nazimova's film productions of Camille and Salomé.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Shu, Zhang Wen received {{a warm welcome}} and was invited to the imperial court to meet the Shu emperor, Liu Shan. He praised Liu Shan for having many talents in his imperial court, and compared him to the Shang dynasty ruler Wu Ding and King Cheng of the Zhou dynasty. He then explained that Wu actually wished to maintain friendly ties with Shu, but had to unwillingly submit to Wei because it lacked the military power to resist Wei. He also expressed his gratitude {{to the people of}} Shu for their hospitality. The Shu court <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with him and regarded him highly.|$|E
25|$|Sometime before 208, {{when the}} warlord Cao Cao wanted to recruit him {{to serve in}} the government, Sima Yi lied that he {{suffered}} from paralysis and stayed at home. One day, while Sima Yi was drying his books under the sun, there was a sudden downpour, so he immediately rushed out to collect his books. One of his maids saw what happened. Zhang Chunhua was worried that the maid would leak out news that Sima Yi was well and get their family into trouble, so she killed the maid to silence her. She then personally prepared meals for the family. Sima Yi <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with her.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Watson-Watt {{was asked}} to judge recent reports of a German radio-based death ray and turned the request over to Wilkins. Wilkins {{returned}} a set of calculations demonstrating the system was basically impossible. When Watson-Watt then asked what such a system might do, Wilkins recalled the earlier report about aircraft causing radio interference. This revelation led to the Daventry Experiment of 26 February 1935, using a powerful BBC shortwave transmitter as the source and their GPO receiver setup in a field while a bomber flew around the site. When the plane was clearly detected, Hugh Dowding, the Air Member for Supply and Research <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with their system's potential and funds were immediately provided for further operational development. Watson-Watt's team patented the device in GB593017.|$|E

25|$|Zhang Wen {{appeared}} in chapter 86 {{of the historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events {{before and during the}} Three Kingdoms period. Sun Quan ordered him to accompany Deng Zhi back to Shu after Deng successfully negotiated for peace between Wu and Shu and renewed the Wu–Shu alliance. Zhang Wen met the Shu emperor Liu Shan. Before he left, Liu Shan prepared a farewell banquet for him and ordered Zhuge Liang and the Shu ministers to see him off. During the feast, Zhang Wen had a debate with the Shu official Qin Mi. Qin Mi replied Zhang Wen's questions tactfully, but Zhang was unable to respond to Qin's question. He told Zhuge Liang later that he <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> that Shu had such talents.|$|E
25|$|Tytla {{returned}} to the United States with the attitude that he could become a great master of animation by incorporating his rich knowledge of art. Now animated shorts had sound which in turn brought a new enthusiasm and a need for talented animators. Paul Terry offered Bill a job right away. There he met animator Art Babbitt who became his close friend and roommate. Art eventually left to work for Walt Disney because of the challenging work and good working conditions. For two years Art tried to entice Bill {{to come out to}} Hollywood, but Bill did not want to leave his family and a well paying job during the Great Depression. Finally in 1934 Tytla flew to Hollywood. He <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> and accepted the job even at a lower salary than he was being paid at Terrytoons.|$|E

The morale of Cao Cao's army started falling but Cao Ren helped to raise the soldiers' spirits by encouraging and inspiring them.

25|$|In 207, Zhang Liao {{followed}} Cao Cao on {{a campaign}} against Yuan Shang, who had allied with the Wuhuan tribes in northern China. When Cao Cao was preparing to attack the enemy in Liucheng (柳城; present-day Xingcheng, Liaoning), Zhang Liao warned him that Jing Province's Governor Liu Biao take advantage of his absence from Xu to send Liu Bei to attack Xu and {{take control of the}} capital. However, Cao Cao felt that Liu Biao would not send Liu Bei to attack Xu because he did not trust Liu Bei, so he proceeded with the campaign against Yuan Shang and the Wuhuan. When they encountered the enemy, Zhang Liao displayed great fervour and strongly urged Cao Cao to launch an attack. Cao Cao <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with Zhang Liao and he passed him his personal signal flag. Zhang Liao led the assault on the Wuhuan at White Wolf Mountain (白狼山; near present-day Lingyuan, Liaoning), defeated them and executed the Wuhuan chieftain Tadun.|$|E
25|$|Parnell first worked {{successfully}} to have Fenians who {{missed out on}} Gladstone’s earlier amnesty freed, including Michael Davitt, who <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> by Parnell. After his release in 1877, Davitt travelled to America to meet John Devoy, the leading Irish-American Fenian and raise funds. During 1878 Parnell also met with leading members of the Irish American Fenians. In October Devoy agreed to a New Departure of separating militancy from the constitutional movement {{in order to further}} its path to Home Rule. Throughout 1879 Parnell continued to campaign for land reform and when Davitt founded the Irish National Land League in October 1879 Parnell was elected president, but did not take control of it, favouring to continue to hold mass meetings. Isaac Butt died of strain later that year and Parnell held back in grabbing control of the party. Instead he too travelled to America with John Dillon on a fund raising mission for political purposes and to relieve distress in Ireland after a world economic depression slumped the sale of agricultural produce.|$|E
25|$|After {{his third}} pilgrimage to Mecca, Ibn Battuta decided to seek {{employment}} with the Muslim Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad bin Tughluq. In {{the autumn of}} 1330 (or 1332), he set off for the Seljuq controlled territory of Anatolia {{with the intention of}} taking an overland route to India. He crossed the Red Sea and the Eastern Desert to reach the Nile valley and then headed north to Cairo. From there he crossed the Sinai Peninsula to Palestine and then travelled north again through some of the towns that he had visited in 1326. From the Syrian port of Latakia, a Genoese ship took him (and his companions) to Alanya on the southern coast of modern-day Turkey. He then journeyed westwards along the coast to the port of Antalya. In the town he met members of one of the semi-religious fityan associations. These were a feature of most Anatolian towns in the 13th and 14th centuries. The members were young artisans and had at their head a leader with the title of Akhis. The associations specialised in welcoming travellers. Ibn Battuta <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>impressed</b> with the hospitality that he received and would later stay in their hospices in more than 25 towns in Anatolia. From Antalya Ibn Battuta headed inland to Eğirdir which was the capital of the Hamidids. He spent Ramadan (June 1331 or May 1333) in the city.|$|E
