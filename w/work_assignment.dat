25|$|The book {{opens with}} a female {{character}} named Aomame as she catches a taxi in Tokyo {{on her way to}} a <b>work</b> <b>assignment.</b> When the taxi gets stuck in a traffic jam, the driver suggests that she {{get out of the car}} and climb down an emergency escape in order to make it to her important meeting, though he warns her that doing so might change the very nature of reality. Aomame makes her way to a hotel in Shibuya, where she poses as a hotel attendant in order to kill a hotel guest. She performs the murder with a tool that leaves almost no trace on its victim, leading investigators to conclude that he died a natural death from a heart failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{prisoners are}} {{assigned}} numbers for easy identification {{and in an}} effort to dehumanize them; Ivan Denisovich's prisoner number is Щ-854. Each day, the squad leader receives their <b>work</b> <b>assignment</b> for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced to work together and pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad will be punished. Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra bowls of porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their work site. Indeed, only through such solidarity can the prisoners do anything more than survive from day to day.|$|E

500|$|The first escape {{attempt to}} shatter Alcatraz's {{reputation}} as an [...] "escape-proof" [...] prison was made on December 16, 1937 by Theodore Cole and Ralph Roe. During their <b>work</b> <b>assignment</b> {{in one of the}} workshops, they cut the flat iron bars of the window and climbed into the bay waters to escape. It was a stormy day and the bay water was highly turbulent. As the escapees were not found, they were declared drowned by the prison authorities as it was conjectured that they drowned in the bay and their bodies swept out into the sea due to the turbulent bay currents.|$|E

2500|$|Efforts made in 1975 {{to improve}} {{educational}} quality were unsuccessful. By 1980 it appeared doubtful that the politically oriented admission criteria had accomplished even {{the purpose of}} increasing enrollment of worker and peasant children. Successful candidates for university entrance were usually children of cadres and officials who used personal connections {{that allowed them to}} [...] "enter through the back door." [...] Students from officials' families would accept the requisite minimum two-year <b>work</b> <b>assignment</b> in the countryside, often in a suburban location that allowed them to remain close to their families. Village cadres, anxious to please the parents/officials, gladly recommended these youths for university placement after the labor requirement had been met. The child of an official family was then on his or her way to a university without having academic ability, a record of political activism, or a distinguished work record.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{indicators}} of stable employment is education. Studies of women in state correctional facilities reveal {{a positive relationship between}} educational level and probability of employment. Furthermore, higher education has been shown to increase self-esteem. The high regard for post-secondary is not reflected in prison programming. Over 90 percent of state prisons provide educational programs that focus on GED preparation and adult basic education, but only a few prisons offer programming in post-secondary education. Furthermore, participation in educational programs is relatively lower than participation in vocational training, and <b>work</b> <b>assignments.</b> The challenge to complete coursework appears specifically when competing with participation in paid <b>work</b> <b>assignments.</b> In a comparative study of women's participation in programming, less than half, 34 percent of women participated in educational programming, while 70 percent of women had <b>work</b> <b>assignments.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cooperative Education (Co-Op) - Co-Op at Auburn University is {{a planned}} and {{supervised}} program alternating semesters of full-time college classroom instruction with semesters of full-time paid <b>work</b> <b>assignments.</b> These <b>work</b> <b>assignments</b> {{are closely related}} to the student's academic program. Thousands of Auburn University graduates, especially engineering majors, have supported themselves financially while studying at Auburn by participating in Co-op.

2500|$|The third {{function}} is {{the selection and}} assignment of the most appropriate type of response resource, such as an ambulance, from the closest or the most appropriate location, depending {{on the nature of}} the problem, and ensuring that the crew of the response resource receive all of the appropriate information. [...] The EMD is responsible for the management and <b>work</b> <b>assignment</b> (physicians and supervisors provide work direction) for all of the response resources in the EMS system. [...] In many cases, the EMD is responsible for multiple response resources simultaneously, and these may include ALS, BLS, or some mix of skills, ambulances, 'fly-cars', and other types of resources. In a quiet, rural setting, such resources may be at a fixed point, in quarters, most of the time, while in other cases, such as urban settings, all or many of the resources may be mobile. [...] It is not uncommon, in a large urban centre, for an EMD to manage and direct as many as 20 response resources simultaneously. [...] It is the job of the EMD to analyze the information and ensure that it leads to the right resource being sent to the patient in the shortest appropriate time. [...] This requires a constant level of awareness of the location and status of each resource, so that the closest available and appropriate resource may be sent to each call. Particularly in larger, urban settings, the mental demands and stress level may be comparable to those of an air traffic controller, and 'burn-out' rates may be quite high. [...] This has been eased somewhat in recent years through the use of Automatic Vehicle Locating (AVL), permitting the EMD to monitor the location and status of all assigned resources using a computer screen instead of by memory.|$|E

It displays the on-going German research project “KapaflexCy” within the CPS will be developed. Further the possibilities and impacts of a flexible labour utilisation will be researched in three case studies. The approach of the project is to involve employees in the personnel planning and scheduling. The core components of the CPS are a matching and voting board for mobile communication devices, a central planning and scheduling instance and a rule base with a comprehensive set of priority and eligibility rules for <b>work</b> <b>assignments.</b> The rules are guiding the process of matching and voting for <b>work</b> <b>assignments.</b> They limit the possible <b>work</b> <b>assignments</b> within a legal and economical justified corridor for flexible working hours. The paper will highlight in particular the rule base of the CPS to be developed within the project...|$|R
