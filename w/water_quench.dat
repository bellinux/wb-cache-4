5000|$|Steel Qualities and Quenchant: Blacksmith skill {{aside and}} {{specific}} heat treatment aside, the 1 versions (higher carbon) are harder, more wear resistant, more fragile {{and harder to}} forge, harder to sharpen, and harder to straighten.. The 3 versions (lower carbon, at the eutectoid point) are not necessarily softer, but often tougher, easier to sharpen, and easier to make. Blue steel {{is more difficult to}} forge, sharpen, and straighten (because the [...] "soft" [...] steel covered by clay still hardens). To perform traditional <b>water</b> <b>quench</b> on this steel can exacerbate the formation of cracks because of its deeper hardening. White steel 1 is difficult to forge and to quench from its higher carbon and can become harder and more brittle than White 2. A <b>water</b> <b>quench</b> with these traditional steels and processes will result in a blade that is harder, stiffer, sharper with longer lasting sharpness but that is harder to sharpen and relatively less tough. An oil quench with the same steels will result in a blade that is marginally less hard, stiff, sharp with less lasting sharpness but that is easier to sharpen and more tough. The choice of quenchant depends on user preference of blade qualities.|$|E

50|$|Quenching: A paste {{is applied}} to the blade using water, charcoal, clay, ground natural {{sharpening}} stone, and other ingredients in a proprietary way and composition. This thicker paste goes on the blade spine on both sides and traditionally mimics the wavy hamon of nihonto. A thinner slip goes on the hard edge to help heat transfer there. It then must dry in air or over heat. The quench water or oil is prepared and brought to the right temperature. The forge is heated. Lights are turned off and the room shut from the outside. Once ready, the blade is buried and shuffled around in the charcoal and when it reaches the correct temperature it is thrust into water and moved forward and back (so as to prevent lateral distortion) and then after a couple seconds side to side. The knife could also be brought up slightly above temperature and then held in the room to the correct temperature before quench. The quench could be interrupted toward the end for more rough grinding or to correct distortion. The blade is tempered either immediately over fire, or in oil, or in an oven.
