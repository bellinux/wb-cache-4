5|$|In the end a {{total of}} 28 {{architectural}} firms registered their intent to submit entries to the competition—a lower number than expected, but Richardson suggests {{this may have been}} due to work on proposals for the new Adelaide railway station. Out of those 28, {{a total of}} 26 firms submitted designs by the deadline. On 10 November 1924, before judging could be completed, the Richards Building in Currie Street was destroyed by fire, taking <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> 26 proposals.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January, the Japanese convoy {{carrying}} Okabe's force {{set out for}} Lae from Rabaul. Forewarned by Ultra, USAAF and RAAF aircraft spotted, shadowed {{and attacked}} the convoy, which was shielded by low clouds and Japanese fighters. The Allies claimed to have shot down 69 Japanese aircraft {{for the loss of}} 10 of their own. A P-38 pilot, First Lieutenant Richard Bong claimed three, becoming an ace. A RAAF Catalina of No. 11 Squadron RAAF under the command of Flight Lieutenant David Vernon made a night bombing attack on the convoy which sank the transport Nichiryu Maru. Destroyers rescued 739 of the 1,100 troops on board, but the ship took <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> of Okabe's medical supplies. Another transport, Myoko Maru, was so badly damaged at Lae by USAAF B-25s {{that it had to be}} beached. Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing about 4,000 troops. In all, the Allied Air Forces flew 416 sorties.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1968, {{the case}} was reargued. The tribe was again {{represented}} by Hobbs, who made the same basic argument that the hunting and fishing rights were not extinguished. The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, the Attorney General of Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the tribe, but extinguished the tribe and <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> treaty rights. He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that the tribe was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E

But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced.

5|$|In 1991, the Government of the Cook Islands {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a key reason why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the Cook Islands government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other grass roots development efforts. The Cook Islands Netball Association is the governing body for the sport in the Cook Islands, and historically, the sport has been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the Cook Islands Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E

Following the CBS and Blockbuster Spinoffs, Viacom consists of MTV Networks (MTV, Nickelodeon, VH1, Noggin etc.), music publishing (Famous Music) and Paramount Pictures.|$|E

He turns sharply to begin his run, jumps off at a great pace, throws up his arm high, and then makes a terrifying leap into the air—a leap which one feels should be accompanied by a yell. At the end of his over he snaps up the ball, if it is anywhere within reach, and passes it hurriedly to the colleague who is having at them at the other end. <b>With</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> his length was under control, and for a time the batsmen could make nothing of him.|$|E

This withdrawal was originally planned for the first night after the invasion, under cover of darkness, but due to the rapid German advance an immediate retreat was ordered at 06:45, to avoid 3rd Army Corps becoming entangled with enemy troops. The corps joined [...] "Brigade G", six battalions already occupying the Waal-Linge line, and was thus brought up to strength again. It would see no further fighting.|$|E

500|$|Coburn {{generated}} controversy {{after the}} race, {{when he said}} the current Triple Crown system allowed [...] "the coward's way out" [...] because fresh horses who had not run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who contested all three legs.
