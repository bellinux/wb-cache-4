5|$|The assassinations of Aurelian and Probus {{demonstrated}} that sole rulership <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to {{the stability of}} the empire. Conflict boiled in every province, from Gaul to Syria, Egypt to the lower Danube. It was too much for one person to control, and Diocletian needed a lieutenant. At some time in 285 at Mediolanum (Milan), Diocletian raised his fellow-officer Maximian to the office of caesar, making him co-emperor.|$|E

Rita, when she is insulted by white clerk during a visit to Stamps, reacts with defiance, but when Momma hears about the confrontation, she slaps Rita and sends her back to California. Rita feels that her personhood was being violated, but the practical Momma knows that her granddaughter's behavior <b>was</b> <b>dangerous.</b> Rita's grandmother is no longer an important influence on her life, and Angelou demonstrates that she had to move on in the fight against racism.|$|E
5|$|In 97 AD, Ban Chao sent an envoy named Gan Ying {{to explore}} the far west. Gan made his way from the Tarim Basin to Parthia and reached the Persian Gulf. Gan left a {{detailed}} account of western countries; he apparently reached as far as Mesopotamia, then {{under the control of the}} Parthian Empire. He intended to sail to the Roman Empire, but was discouraged when told that the trip <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> and could take two years. Deterred, he returned to China bringing much new information on the countries to the west of Chinese-controlled territories, as far as the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{politicians}} on {{both sides}} of the river began to seek funding to build a new road bridge across the river. The rail bridge, while still adequate for rail traffic, it proved to be a challenge for drivers. The western terminus of the bridge featured a curve which was navigated easily by wagons and early automobiles, but <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> for semi trucks. Governor Terry Branstad was convinced a new bridge was needed after riding in a railcar to view the underside of the road deck. The new, four-lane Keokuk–Hamilton bridge opened on November 23, 1985, nearly eight months ahead of schedule and under budget.|$|E

5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of water were pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E

Moxon had argued that Henson <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> based on comments critical of Scientologists he had posted on the Internet, and his knowledge in the fields of cryonics and explosives. Hoden received a temporary restraining order against Henson, but the Riverside Superior Court judge refused to make the restraining order permanent.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train other drivers, mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Rousseau was {{enthusiastic}} and sent his cycling editor, Victor Breyer, {{to find a}} route. Breyer travelled to Amiens in a Panhard driven by his colleague, Paul Meyan. The following morning Breyer— later deputy organiser of the Tour de France and a leading official of the Union Cycliste Internationale - continued by bike. The wind blew, the rain fell and the temperature dropped. Breyer reached Roubaix filthy and exhausted {{after a day of}} riding on cobbles (setts). He swore he would send a telegram to Minart urging him to drop the idea, saying it <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to send a race the way he had just ridden. But that evening a meal and drinks with the team from Roubaix changed his mind.|$|E

The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1–1 draw with Hull. Widnes were then defeated {{for the second time}} in two weeks in the tourists' last match in northern England.|$|E

5|$|The Patterson Post Office {{underwent}} several re-locations {{throughout the}} years. After the Lloyd Lumber Company {{moved to a}} larger building along NY311, the post office occupied the smaller structure; both were situated {{on the east side}} of the New York Central tracks. Residents complained that the new location was inadequate, claiming that parking was insufficient at nearby companies, and that walking along a busy road to reach the post office <b>was</b> <b>dangerous.</b> After a bidding process to determine the future location, the office was again moved to a former car service station along Front Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of the British blockade was such that communication and reinforcement between France and her colonies <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> for the ships involved and so was severely limited. This led to shortages and disaffection among the French colonists, especially in the Caribbean, where they were surrounded by hostile British harbours and constantly raided and blockaded by British ships. The island of Martinique {{was one of the}} more important French islands in the West Indies, but by late 1808 the island's economy had been crippled by the British blockade, and food stocks, military supplies and morale were all running low. In the summer a French dispatch vessel was intercepted by British warships, warning of the desperate state of the island's defences; similar messages that did reach France safely prompted an urgent response by the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's ideas became {{associated}} {{with her life}} story and women writers felt that it <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> to mention her in their texts. Hays, who had previously been a close friend and an outspoken advocate for Wollstonecraft and her Rights of Woman, for example, did not include her {{in the collection of}} Illustrious and Celebrated Women she published in 1803. Maria Edgeworth specifically distances herself from Wollstonecraft in her novel Belinda (1802); she caricatures Wollstonecraft as a radical feminist in the character of Harriet Freke. But, like Jane Austen, she does not reject Wollstonecraft's ideas. Both Edgeworth and Austen argue that women are crucial {{to the development of the}} nation; moreover, they portray women as rational beings who should choose companionate marriage.|$|E

5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director <b>was</b> <b>dangerous</b> while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E
5|$|At 13:10, the RAF {{formation}} {{flew over}} the mud flats {{to the west of}} Cuxhaven and Wesermünde and came under heavy ground fire from the German flak positions, 214, 244 and 264. As Kellett turned west towards the Jade Estuary and over Wilhelmshaven anti-aircraft units 212, 222, 252, 262 and 272 opened fire. Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and all the other naval ships in the dock opened fire in support. In the distance, at Schillig Point, the bombers could see German fighters taking off from a camouflaged airstrip. In a quick briefing, JG 1's commander had told his pilots to make a beam attack as it was a blind spot for the Wellington. A stern attack <b>was</b> <b>dangerous,</b> as the gunners could then target an attacking fighter with a coordinated and concentrated cone of fire. One weakness also noted was that early types of Wellingtons lacked self-sealing fuel tanks. This meant if the German fighters hit the wings, the bomber was liable to burn.|$|E
5|$|By late April, {{the war was}} {{effectively}} over. On 1 May 1945, Galland attempted {{to make contact with}} United States Army forces to negotiate the surrender of his unit. The act itself <b>was</b> <b>dangerous.</b> SS forces roamed the countryside and towns executing anyone who was considering capitulation. The Americans requested that Galland fly his unit and Me 262s to a USAAF controlled airfield. Galland declined citing poor weather and technical problems. In reality, Galland was not going to hand over Me 262 jets to the Americans. Galland had harboured the belief that the Western Alliance would soon be at war with the Soviet Union, and he wanted to join American forces and to use his unit in the coming war to free Germany from Communist occupation. Galland replied, making his whereabouts known to the Americans, and offering his surrender once they arrived at the Tegernsee hospital where he was being treated. Galland then ordered his unit, which had then moved to Salzburg and Innsbruck, to destroy their Me 262s. At the time of his surrender, Galland had filed claims for 104 Allied aircraft shot down. His claims included seven with the Me 262.|$|E
