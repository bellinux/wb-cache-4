5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} studies on climate change and bees examined the species, B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK. The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed, these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments. Geographically and climatically <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> this, as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes, as this has already been seen within desert oases. Europe has done significant work in tracking bee colony changes within regions. Additional longitudinal surveillance must be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species to build the body of research on the impact of climate change on bees.|$|E

By identifying these types of “driver” indicators, {{it may be possible to}} simplify the assessment task. Lastly, <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> that with a rather small number of indicators it would be possible to conduct a SIA, capable of giving reliable, understandable and comprehensive results of sustainability of the forest-based bioeconomy in Finland.|$|R

25|$|The arms of spiral galaxies rotate {{around the}} galactic centre. The {{luminous}} mass density of a spiral galaxy decreases as one goes from the centre to the outskirts. If luminous mass {{were all the}} matter, then we can model the galaxy as a point mass in the centre and test masses orbiting around it (similar to the solar system). From Kepler's Second Law, <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> that the rotation velocities will decrease with distance from the centre, similar to our solar system. This is not observed. Instead, the galaxy rotation curve remains flat as distant from the centre as the data is available.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, the theorem only {{applies to}} a class of {{mathematical}} functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or sample rate) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces {{the concept of a}} sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are bandlimited to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process. It expresses the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples.|$|E
25|$|Kirkpatrick has {{developed}} this approach further {{in connection with}} computer, or video games. In his Aesthetic Theory and the Video Game {{he argues that the}} aesthetic appeal of games does not lie where <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to find it – in sumptuous on-screen imagery – but in the physical sensations of gameplay. Because most video game analysis is informed by conventional media theory it tends to interpret games in terms of their ‘content’, or message, viewing the game as a sign system. This overlooks {{the most important part of}} the experience of gameplay and the fact that we can often enjoy a game without ever thinking about what it, or the activity of playing it, ‘means’. In his second book on games, Computer Games and the Social Imaginary, Kirkpatrick presents a history of digital games that links their rise to the spread of neo-liberalism, a version of capitalism that fosters and relies upon a playful disposition on the part of its subjects.|$|E

30|$|There {{were several}} {{predictions}} {{for the current}} study. First, <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> musicians to outperform non-musicians on working memory ability and inhibitory control. In terms of working memory, <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> musicians to have better accuracy than non-musicians on both executive and phonological working memory tasks, because musical training involves manipulation and maintenance of multiple symbols and codes. In terms of inhibitory control, <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> musicians to have faster response times on tasks that require suppression of interfering stimuli, {{as well as on}} tasks that require stopping an automatic response, because musical training involves ignoring irrelevant symbols and sounds as well as suddenly pausing and restarting performance when required, particularly in group musical performance.|$|R

25|$|Suppose that a Brownian {{particle}} of mass M {{is surrounded}} by lighter particles of mass m which are traveling at a speed u. Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be mu/M. This ratio is {{of the order of}} 10−7cm/s. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 1016 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> that there will be 1020 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 108 to 1010 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.|$|E

30|$|Specifically, {{the study}} aimed firstly to {{determine}} whether {{and the extent to}} which biological sex is associated with gender identity and entrepreneurs’ business growth intentions. <b>We</b> <b>expected</b> that the correlation between entrepreneurs’ sex and gender identity to be strong such that male entrepreneurs are most likely to exhibit a stereotypical masculine orientation and female entrepreneurs are most likely to exhibit a stereotypical feminine orientation. Secondly, we aimed to test whether, {{and the extent to which}}, gender identity mediates biological sex effects on business growth intentions. <b>We</b> <b>expected</b> that gender identity would at least partially mediate biological sex effects on growth intentions; <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> the effect of masculinity on growth intentions to be stronger compared to the effect of femininity. Finally, we examined the moderating influences of independent self-construal that constitute boundary conditions of the theory. <b>We</b> <b>expected</b> that independent self-construal would moderate the relationship between sex and gender identity and between gender identity and growth intentions. To our knowledge the present study is one of the first to examine within-culture individual-level cultural orientations as antecedents to business growth intentions in some depth.|$|R
