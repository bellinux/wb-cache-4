40|$|Debit {{cards are}} {{the fastest growing}} {{consumer}} payment method despite being more expensive and less convenient than credit cards. We present a model and show empirical evidence explaining this phenomenon. Checking account evidence shows that debit cards are used {{as a tool to}} restrain overspending. We also test whether the overspending is behavioral or cost-based. In the rational model, consumers use debit to avoid costly budgeting, thus spending control is a cost-driven motivation for using debit cards. In the behavioral model, some consumers <b>simply</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> control spending without a restraining device. The data supports spending control as a motive for debit use, however, the data does not provide conclusive evidence for the rational or behavioral explanations...|$|R

Neopolyploids arise in a diploid population by merging of two unreduced gametes or through "triploid bridge". However establishment of a new polyploid in the current population is not easy. Polyploid has to overcome through various mechanisms (like a self-pollination, nonrandom pollination, etc.) "the minority cytotype exclusion" and increase their frequency in the population. Diploids and polyploids differ in ecological demands and competition abilities. There is no correlation between ploidy and wide ecological amplitude or competition abilities.
