5|$|Fallen is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Evanescence. After {{releasing}} several EPs and a demo CD, the group signed to <b>Wind-up</b> in January 2001. Writing songs for Fallen started near {{the time of}} the band's formation; several of the songs that would feature on the album appeared on the band's earlier releases. Fallen was recorded between August and December 2002 in several locations, including Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. This was followed by a two-week period of mixing at Conway Recording Studios in North Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Fallen was {{released}} on March 4, 2003, on <b>Wind-up</b> and Epic Records. Fallen is Evanescence's most commercially successful album to date, selling more than seven million copies in the United States and over 17 million copies worldwide.

5|$|Although both Futurama and The Simpsons {{were created}} by Matt Groening, overt {{references}} to the latter are mostly avoided in Futurama. One of the few exceptions to this rule is the appearance of Blinky, a three-eyed orange fish seen on The Simpsons, as Fry is going through the tube. A running gag of the series is Bender's fondness for Olde Fortran malt liquor, named after Olde English 800 malt liquor and the programming language Fortran. The drink was first introduced in this episode and became so {{closely associated with the}} character that he was featured with a bottle in both the Rocket USA <b>wind-up</b> toy and the action figure released by Moore Action Collectibles.|$|E
5|$|The Open Door is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Evanescence. It was {{released}} on September 25, 2006, through <b>Wind-up</b> Records. The initial date for the record to be made available for purchase was in March 2006, but was changed {{as a result of}} guitarist Terry Balsamo's stroke, the loss of the band's former manager, and Will Boyd's and Ben Moody's departure from the group. The record symbolizes a new beginning for the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including gothic rock, symphonic rock and pop music as well as the use of choirs on several songs. The writing process for the album took over 18 months to complete; most of the songs were written by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo, while production was handled by Dave Fortman.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{pitchers}} throw with a three-quarter or sidearm motion, Koufax threw with {{a pronounced}} over-the-top arm action. This may have increased his velocity, but reduced the lateral movement on his pitches, especially {{movement away from}} left-handed hitters. Most of his velocity came from his strong legs and back, combined with a high kicking <b>wind-up</b> and long forward stretch toward the plate. Throughout his career, Koufax relied mostly on two pitches. His four-seam fastball gave batters the impression of rising as it approached them, due to underspin. It not only appeared to move very late but also might move two or three distinct times. His overhand curveball, spun with the middle finger, dropped vertically 12 to 24inches due to his arm action. Rob Neyer called it the best curve of all time. He also occasionally threw a changeup and a forkball.|$|E

5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil <b>wind-up</b> robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Wind-Up</b> Bird Chronicle (1995) is a {{novel that}} fuses the {{realistic}} and fantastic, and contains elements of physical violence.

50|$|As a {{coach and}} manager, Baker {{was known for}} his {{proficiency}} at detecting the type of pitch an opposing pitcher was about to deliver and tipping off his team's batter with verbal signals. He carefully observed each pitcher's idiosyncrasies, looking, he said, “for all the little quirks, details and tell‐tales.” He found that many pitchers concealed the ball poorly before delivery, allowing him to see their grip. Others telegraphed their curve balls by bending their wrists, or subtly altering their <b>wind‐ups.</b> “There are also facial telltales. I know pitchers who, when they throw a curve, bite the lip or stick out the tongue,” he said.|$|R
25|$|A grotesquely ugly man {{hired by}} Sakigake to {{investigate}} Tengo and, later, Aomame. He becomes a point-of-view character in part {{three of the}} novel.

The same character appears in another Murakami story, The <b>Wind-Up</b> Bird Chronicle.|$|E
25|$|Nociceptors {{have two}} {{different}} types of axons. The first are the Aδ fiber axons. They are myelinated and can allow an action potential to travel {{at a rate of about}} 20 meters/second towards the CNS. The other type is the more slowly conducting C fiber axons. These only conduct at speeds of around 2 meters/second. This is due to the light or non-myelination of the axon. As a result, pain comes in two phases. The first phase is mediated by the fast-conducting Aδ fibers and the second part due to (Polymodal) C fibers. The pain associated with the Aδ fibers can be associated to an initial extremely sharp pain. The second phase is a more prolonged and slightly less intense feeling of pain as a result of the acute damage. If there is massive or prolonged input to a C fiber, there is a progressive build up in the spinal cord dorsal horn; this phenomenon is similar to tetanus in muscles but is called <b>wind-up.</b> If <b>wind-up</b> occurs there is a probability of increased sensitivity to pain.|$|E
25|$|Besides being {{far easier}} to handle, the wax {{recording}} media also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality. The Graphophone designs initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings which were then replaced by more convenient <b>wind-up</b> clockwork drive mechanisms and which finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank that was used on Edison's phonograph. The numerous improvements allowed for a sound quality that was significantly better than Edison's machine.|$|E

25|$|Haruki Murakami's 1995 novel The <b>Wind-Up</b> Bird Chronicle deals greatly with Manchukuo {{through the}} {{character}} of Lieutenant Mamiya.

While the period covered in these recollections extends over many years, {{the focus is on the}} final year of the war and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.
