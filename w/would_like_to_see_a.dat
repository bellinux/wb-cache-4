We urge all parties involved to show full respect for international agreements, including the UN Charter, the 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and the OSCE Final Act. The Government in Kyiv should do everything possible to be inclusive, and a dialogue with Eastern and Southern interlocutors must be a priority. We call for a balanced solution respecting Ukraine’s territorial integrity. All concerns Russia has with regards to the security and human rights situation in Ukraine can be addressed through negotiations or international monitoring.

2500|$|Labor for Victory: [...] In April 1942, Time {{magazine}} {{reported that}} the AFL (AFL) and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) had agreed to a joint radio production, called Labor for Victory. [...] NBC agreed to run the weekly segment as a [...] "public service". The AFL and CIO presidents William Green and Philip Murray agreed to let their press chiefs, Philip Pearl and Len De Caux, alternate weeks between them to narrate. [...] The show ran on NBC radio on Saturdays 10:15–10:30 PM, starting on April 25, 1942. [...] Time wrote, [...] "De Caux and Pearl hope to make the Labor for Victory program popular enough for an indefinite run, using labor news, name speakers and interviews with workmen. Labor partisanship, they promise, is out." [...] Writers for Labor for Victory included: Peter Lyon, a progressive journalist; Millard Lampell (born Allan Sloane), later an American movie and television screenwriter; and Morton Wishengrad, {{who worked for the}} AFL. [...] For entertainment on CIO episodes, De Caux asked Woody Guthrie to contribute to the show. [...] "Personally, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> phonograph record made of your [...] "Girl in the Red, White, and Blue."" [...] However, the title appears in at least one collection of Guthrie records. [...] Guthrie consented and performed solo two or three times on this program (among several other WWII radio shows, including Answering You, Labor for Victory, Jazz in America, and We the People). [...] On August 29, 1942, he performed [...] "The Farmer-Labor Train", with lyrics he had written to the tune of [...] "Wabash Cannonball". (In 1948, he transformed the [...] "Wabash Cannonball" [...] again into [...] "The Wallace-Taylor Train" [...] for the 1948 Progressive National Convention, which nominated former U.S. Vice President Henry A. Wallace for president.) [...] The Almanac Singers (of which Guthrie and Lampell were co-founders) did appear (as they did on the U.S. Navy's (or U.S. Treasury's) The Treasury Hour and CBS Radio's We the People, later a television show). (Also, Marc Blitzstein's papers show that he made unclear contributions to four CIO episodes (dated June 20, June 27, August 1, August 15, 1948) of Labor for Victory.) [...] While Labor for Victory was a milestone in theory as a national platform, in practice it proved less so. [...] Only 35 of 104 NBC affiliates carried the show. [...] Episodes included the announcement that the show represented [...] "twelve million organized men and women, united in the high resolve to rid the world of Fascism in 1942". [...] Speakers included Donald E. Montgomery, then [...] "consumer's counselor" [...] at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.|$|E
