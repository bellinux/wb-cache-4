500|$|Lord Carteret read {{passages}} from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the Irish Privy Council and claimed that they were treasonable. It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for {{the identity of the}} Drapier. Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an [...] "unfortunate accident" [...] and he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> in such a way. Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, when did so when he wrote, [...] "to provoke England to that degree as some have endeavoured to do, is not the true way to keep them out". Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were [...] "ludicrous and satyrically writ". However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.|$|E

6000|$|This is to {{wish you}} a brand-New Year, and to wish it very affectionately--and to wish it of not more than usual length but of more than usual fulness. I have had an {{unacknowledged}} letter from you longer than is decorous. But I have shown you ere this that epistolary decorum is a virtue I have ceased to pretend to. And during the last month I have not pretended to any other virtue either--save an endless patience and an heroic resignation, as I have been, and still am, alas, in the sorry position of having in rehearsal a little play--3 acts--which is to be produced on Saturday next, at the St. James's Theatre, as to which I beg you heartily to indulge for me, about 8.30 o'clock on that evening, in very fervent prayer. It is a little [...] "romantic" [...] play of which the action is laid (in England) {{in the middle of}} the last century, and it will be exquisitely mounted, dressed &c., and very creditably acted, as things go here. But rehearsal is an écœurment is the right spelling] and one's need of heroic virtues infinite. I have been in the breach daily for 4 weeks, and am utterly exhausted. To-night (the theatre being closed for the week on purpose) is the first dress rehearsal--which is here of course not a public, as in Paris, but an intensely private function--all for me, me prélassant dans mon fauteuil, alone, like the King of Bavaria at the opera. There are to be three nights more of this, to give them ease in the wearing of their clothes of a past time, and that, after the grind of the earlier work, is rather amusing--as amusing as anything can be, for a man of taste and sensibility, in the odious process of practical dramatic production. I may have been meant for the Drama--God knows!--but I certainly wasn't meant for the Theatre. C'est pour vous dire that I am much pressed and am only sending you mes vœux très-sincères in a shabbily brief little letter. There are a number of interesting things in your last to which I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond.</b> I send you also by post 3 or 4 miserable little (old) views of Tunbridge Wells, which I have picked up in looking, at rare leisure moments, for one good one for you. I haven't, alas, found that; but I think I am on the track of it, and you shall have it as soon as it turns up. Accept these meanwhile as a little stop-gap and a symbol of my New Year's greeting.... I hope you are in good case and good hope. We are having here an excellent winter, almost fogless and generally creditable. Write me a little word of hope and help for the 5th; I shall regard it as a happy influence for yours forever, ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{important}} {{advance in}} the development of attachment questionnaires was the addition of a fourth style of attachment. Bartholomew and Horowitz presented a model that identified four categories or styles of adult attachment.

Specifically, attachment styles depended on whether or not people judge their partners to be generally accessible and responsive to requests for support, and whether or not people judge themselves {{to be the kind of}} individuals towards which others <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> and lend help.

5000|$|While in prison, al-Hudaybi {{is said to}} have {{completed}} the manuscript for Du’at la Qudat, which was published after his death in 1977.

Although Du'at la Qudat does not mention Qutb by name and only criticizes Indian Islamist Abul A'la Maududi, it argues against takfir - the practice of declaring another Muslim a non-believer - that Qutb employed.

To be modern, I said, is to experience personal and social life as a maelstrom, to find ones world and oneself in perpetual disintegration and renewal, trouble and anguish, ambiguity and contradiction: {{to be part of a}} universe in which all that is solid melts into air. To be a modernist is to make oneself somehow at home in the maelstrom, to make its rhythms one’s own, to move within its currents in search of the forms of reality, of beauty, of freedom, of justice, that its fervid and perilous flow allows.|$|E

Blank brags about how respectable and well-connected he is, and he guarantees that he will get away with his crime. He confidently goes to the phone to report Delaney for breaking and entering. Delaney shoots Blank in the head with the Luger pistol as Blank is speaking with the police operator on the telephone.

50|$|The Adult Consumer Survey is {{completed}} {{with a minimum}} of 400 individuals (per participating state) who are 18 years of age or older and receiving at least one paid service in addition to case management.

The survey has three components; background data, and two interview sections. The background data is most frequently completed by service coordinators prior to the face-to-face survey and includes information about general demographics; where people live, work, health information, etc. The interview part of the survey must be conducted {{face to face with the}} individual receiving services. The first section can only be answered by the individual.

I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.Donald Glover guest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized as tokenism in response to the initial backlash from the first season.|$|E
