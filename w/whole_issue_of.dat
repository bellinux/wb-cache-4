60|$|With {{these few}} plain {{indications}} in our minds, {{it will not}} be improper to reconsider the conduct of the enemy together with our own, from the day that a question of peace has been in agitation. In considering this part of the question, I do not proceed on my own hypothesis. I suppose, for a moment, that this body of Regicide, calling itself a Republic, is a politic person, with whom something deserving the name of peace may be made. On that supposition, let us examine our own proceeding. Let us compute the profit it has brought, and the advantage that it is likely to bring hereafter. A peace too eagerly sought is not always the sooner obtained. The discovery of vehement wishes generally frustrates their attainment, and your adversary has gained a great advantage over you when he finds you impatient to conclude a treaty. There is in reserve not only something of dignity, but a great deal of prudence too. A sort of courage belongs to negotiation, as well as to operations of the field. A negotiator must often seem willing to hazard the <b>whole</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> his treaty, if he wishes to secure any one material point.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith {{respect to}} {{copyright}} law, periodicals have followed a different trajectory from books, {{and much of}} that difference {{has to do with}} the heterogeneous nature of newspapers and magazines. In the early twentieth century, periodicals in the United States and Great Britain obtained blanket copyrights that covered most of their contents, but this logic did not apply in the much more fluid textual universe of the nineteenth century U. S. In the absence of clear copyright legislation for newspapers and magazines, authors and editors debated what could be copied and how such copied material should be acknowledged or given “credit. ” Meanwhile, changes in the newspaper and magazine industries led some publishers to claim copyright over individual articles or <b>whole</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> their periodicals. The timing of these claims, and the reactions that they elicited, varied according to the genre and subject matter of the texts in question: serial novels and essays were treated differently than news paragraphs and price lists. Changes in the copyright statute only came later, after individuals had experimented with existing laws and tried to create new norms for the republication of texts. The examples discussed here suggest the need for an approach to copyright history that moves beyond the chronology of legislation and case law to consider the changing practices of writers, editors, and publishers...|$|R
