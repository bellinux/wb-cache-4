500|$|While {{still out}} at sea, Ismael brought [...] waves to Southern California, though waves {{from the storm}} were less than expected. One person was swept away at a beach. The {{remnants}} of the storm later moved over the region, resulting in moderate rainfall. The Yucca Valley was the worst hit by the storm, where nearly every road was washed out. Almost 50,000residents were isolated due to rains. A tornado was spotted near Los Angeles, causing minor damage. In San Bernardino, many buildings were destroyed. Around 80,000homes were left without power across the Inland Empire. Moreover, three interstates were closed. In all, minor injuries were reported, three people died in San Bernardino when their car swept into a channel, and an engineer was killed returning to China Lake when her car was swept into a <b>wash.</b> <b>Damage</b> in the region totaled $19million (1983USD). After affecting California, {{the remnants of the}} hurricane moved into Nevada. Many parking lots in Laughlin were flooded; two small towns in Clark County were also isolated. Furthermore, several major streets along the outskirts of Las Vegas were closed because of flooding.|$|E

40|$|In {{past years}} an {{extensive}} and experimental investigation {{was carried out}} in the Lagoon of Venice and at the University of Trieste on behalf of the Town Administration of Venice, to classify the lagoon motorboats and define the specific navigation rules in Venice and in its lagoon, as regards the wave pattern generation and potential <b>wash</b> <b>damage.</b> Twenty five boats were tested on full scale and fifteen models were built and tested in resistance experiments, in two different load conditions and, for some models, the investigation was extended also to the direct wave-making calculation. Some models were tested also in shallow water. A preliminary result given by this investigation is a verification of the existing criteria for the classification of the existing boats as for their potential environmental damage, calculated by taking into account the wave generated heights and the residual and the wave resistance components. The investigation then suggested the need of defining new lines for some classes of boats...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, the {{investigation}} {{considered the possibility}} that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT could have been the ignition source. Testing by the NTSB and the British Defence Evaluation and Research Agency demonstrated that when metal of the same type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, there was petalling of the surface where the charge was placed, pitting on the adjacent surfaces, and visible hot gas <b>washing</b> <b>damage</b> in the surrounding area. Since none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics, and none of the areas of missing wreckage were large enough to encompass all the expected damage, {{the investigation}} concluded that this scenario was [...] "very unlikely." ...|$|R

50|$|During a {{storm on}} 31 December 1924, {{there was a}} partial failure of the dam when the {{downstream}} side was <b>washed</b> out. The <b>damage</b> was kept fairly secret, and rebuilding it provided more useful work for the tramway.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} area was known as Beau-desert (beautiful desert), the {{droughts}} and the floods were continuous problems in the area.

40|$|Development of an {{appropriate}} scheme to accurately sample root biomass {{is essential for}} accurate estimation of biomass and carbon budget of grassland. This study evaluated measurement accuracy of the monolith and core methods with different sample sizes and positions in a temperate grassland ecosystem in Inner Mongolia, China. The {{results indicated that the}} small core method (3. 8 -cm-diameter) significantly underestimated total root biomass compared with the large core method (10 -cm-diameter), small monolith method (0. 25 m 2) and large monolith method (1 m 2). Total root biomass estimated from the small core method was about 52 % less than that from the large monolith method (1 m 2). At 95 % confidence interval, 10 % relative precision could be obtained with five small monoliths, 15 large cores and 65 small cores. The coefficient of variation (CV) for total root biomass decreased logarithmically with increasing sample size for both the monolith and core methods. Compared with the stratified random sampling, core sampling with different fixed positions could not provide reliable estimate of total root biomass. <b>Washing</b> <b>damage</b> and soil lost during extraction might be the major factors controlling the measurement accuracy of total root biomass by core method with small sample size...|$|R
50|$|This canal—11 miles without locks {{into the}} centre of Glasgow—was an ideal {{situation}} for this venture. It was found that once the boat was planing, the <b>wash</b> that <b>damaged</b> the canal banks largely disappeared and by 1835 flat iron boats of up to 65 feet made 323,290 passenger trips at 10 mph in a year. Services were established on the Forth and Clyde and on the Shropshire Union Canal flyboats with a single horse pulled 22 ton loads at 10 mph as late as 1847. They were also called swift boats or gig boats.|$|R
50|$|While moving near western Jamaica, the {{hurricane}} produced strong winds of about 80 mph (130 km/h), which wrecked about 90% of the banana crop. One plantation lost 500 banana trees, {{and there was}} also damage to corn, coffee, and yams. Many houses were wrecked or washed away, leaving hundreds homeless. The storm cut power and telegraph lines and blocked roads, limiting communication. Rail lines were cut, and small bridges were <b>washed</b> away. <b>Damage</b> was estimated at $3 million, and there were 23 deaths. The storm also produced strong winds and rainfall in Cuba.|$|R
50|$|Despite their {{prevalence}} in Europe, previous {{attempts to}} bring a fast ferry to Japan had failed due to wake <b>wash</b> and wave <b>damage</b> in the Japanese coastal areas.

50|$|Eight {{people were}} {{reported}} to have died in the floods, most of them on the main island, and thousands of people were displaced, with some 3,500 people placed in temporary shelters.

50|$|Bylaws {{provide that}} from Ballingdon bridge (Sudbury) to Great Henny, boats with engines may be used, but {{are subject to}} a strict speed limit of 4 mph, which does not create <b>wash</b> or <b>damage</b> to the banks. However, boats with engines are precluded from using the river below Great Henny, unless they were {{licensed}} {{at the time of}} the Anglian Water Act 1977. Currently, only boats light enough to maneuver around many the obstacles may use the river below Great Henny. This restricts most of the river to canoes although, even for such small craft, the river is not sufficiently navigable to allow easy passage along its entire lower section.|$|R
50|$|Portions of the Delaware Canal towpath were <b>washed</b> away or <b>damaged</b> during {{successive}} {{floods in}} 2004, 2005 and 2006.

5|$|Hundreds of {{residents}} were stranded in Hatteras following {{the formation of}} the new inlet created by rising waters. Many parts of North Carolina Highway 12 were partially <b>washed</b> or <b>damaged,</b> which slowed recovery efforts and the return of homeowners in the Outer Banks. Sections of the highway were closed to one lane. The ferry between Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island was temporarily closed due to damage after the hurricane, though a small passenger ferry remained available for Hatteras Village residents and emergency workers. People who were not residents were not allowed to be on the Outer Banks for two weeks after the hurricane due to damaged road conditions. When visitors were allowed to return, many ventured to see the new inlet, despite a 1-mile (1.6km) walk from the nearest road.|$|R
25|$|Early bridges were {{vulnerable}} to floods, and in 1309 many bridges were <b>washed</b> away or <b>damaged</b> by severe winter floods, including Hethbeth Bridge.

50|$|Although many {{aircraft}} {{are capable of}} moving themselves backwards on the ground using reverse thrust (a procedure {{referred to as a}} powerback), the resulting jet blast or prop <b>wash</b> may cause <b>damage</b> to the terminal building or equipment.

50|$|In late October 2012, Hurricane Sandy <b>washed</b> out and <b>damaged</b> {{a portion}} of the road at the S-curves north of Rodanthe on the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge.

A state of emergency was declared and $20.8 million of emergency federal funding was secured to construct a more permanent repair.|$|R
50|$|Life Paint is {{the trade}} {{name of a}} highly-reflective spray paint {{developed}} by Volvo to increase the visibility of cyclists during trips after dark.
