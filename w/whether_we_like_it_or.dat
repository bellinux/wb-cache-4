500|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} and poorly understood situations related to the charging of an error occurs when an outfielder misjudges the flight of a ball and allows the ball to drop out of his reach. This is usually considered to be a [...] "mental mistake" [...] by the outfielder, so the batter is usually credited with a hit. On that topic Bill Shannon, who was an official scorer for the New York Yankees, said [...] "That's a base hit <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not. As a practical matter, we don't charge errors on those plays. No one says that baseball is entirely fair." [...] Outfielders are generally charged with an error on a fly ball when they arrive at the ball's destination with sufficient time to make a catch with an ordinary effort, but simply miss the catch or drop the ball.|$|E
500|$|In 1927 Holst was {{commissioned}} by the New York Symphony Orchestra to write a symphony. Instead, he wrote an orchestral piece Egdon Heath, inspired by Thomas Hardy's Wessex. It was first performed in February 1928, a month after Hardy's death, at a memorial concert. By this time the public's brief enthusiasm for everything Holstian was waning, and the piece was not well received in New York. Olin Downes in The New York Times opined that [...] "the new score seemed long and undistinguished". The day after the American performance, Holst conducted the City of Birmingham Orchestra in the British premiere. The Times acknowledged the bleakness of the work but allowed that it matched Hardy's grim view of the world: [...] "Egdon Heath {{is not likely to}} be popular, but it says what the composer wants to say, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not, and truth is one aspect of duty." [...] Holst had been distressed by hostile reviews of some of his earlier works, but he was indifferent to critical opinion of Egdon Heath, which he regarded as, in Adams's phrase, his [...] "most perfectly realized composition".|$|E

Betty Allen, president of The Harlem School of the Arts, admittedly loathed the piece, and Grace Bumbry, who excelled in the 1985 Metropolitan Opera production as Bess, made the often cited statement: I thought it beneath me, I felt I had worked far too hard, that we had come far too far to have to retrogress to 1935.

60|$|Well, one day I {{was seated}} in my {{quarters}} playing cards with young Morat, of the horse chasseurs, {{when the door opened}} and in walked Lasalle, who was our Colonel. You know what a fine, swaggering fellow he was, and the sky-blue uniform of the Tenth suited him to a marvel. My faith, we youngsters were so taken by him that we all swore and diced and drank and played the deuce <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> or no, just that we might resemble our Colonel! We forgot that it was not because he drank or gambled that the Emperor was going to make him the head of the light cavalry, but because he had the surest eye for the nature of a position or for the strength of a column, and the best judgment as to when infantry could be broken, or whether guns were exposed, of any man in the army. We were too young to understand all that, however, so we waxed our moustaches and clicked our spurs and let the ferrules of our scabbards wear out by trailing them along the pavement in the hope that we should all become Lasalles. When he came clanking into my quarters, both Morat and I sprang to our feet.|$|R

So usually we started with just drums and piano, {{and if it was}} strong as a two-man project, then we'd go to next level and bring in the band. We would riff ideas, nonsensical words, then flesh that out once we had format down, and then Elvis would come back with lyrics and vocal parts intact. We started last August and, through December, {{once or twice a week}} he'd stop by. Initially we were emailing tracks, but we wanted real-time exchange. We recorded a lot of it in our tiny little dressing room at 30 Rock, not a traditional studio, but Elvis had no hang-ups about that." [...] Questlove {{spoke about the}} recording process, saying: [...] "We have like 4000 tracks in a database, so we gave a drum track to Elvis, and days later he came back with a full-fledged demo. We tried two more, then three more, and the next thing you know, we had something on our hands. With no label and no deadlines, the process could stay really relaxed." [...] Elvis Costello also explained the recording process, saying: [...] "We didn’t know what form it might take, whether it was a song or an EP or what. But ideas kept tumbling out, and they seemed connected by an approach to rhythm and lyric writing. I don't know the name for this music. It's a cauldron full of powders and potions, frogs and fingers, and that's what I call rock and roll—because that's what it was, originally. I'm not much bothered about the labels, though.

5000|$|Warburg left {{government}} in 1934, having come to oppose certain {{policies of the}} New Deal. He was opposed to political non-interventionism, however, and re-entered government service in 1941 as Special Assistant to the Coordinator of Information, William Joseph Donovan. In 1942, when propaganda responsibilities were transferred to the Office of War Information, he became its Overseas Branch Deputy Director. After {{the end of the}} war, he wrote numerous books on U.S. foreign policy and was an outspoken advocate for nuclear disarmament.In 1963, along with Sears heir, Philip Stern, he helped to found the Washington-based Institute for Policy Studies.

He gained some notice in a February 17, 1950, appearance before the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in which he said, [...] "We shall have world government, <b>whether</b> or not <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> The question is only whether world government will be achieved by consent or by conquest." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Blumenthal's view, {{experiments}} such {{as these}} show that our appreciation of food is subjective, determined by information sent by the senses to the brain: [...] "the {{ways in which we}} make sense of what we are eating and decide <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not depend to a large extent on memory and contrast. Memory provides us with a range of references – flavours, tastes, smells, sights, sounds, emotions – that we draw on continually as we eat." [...] His dishes, therefore, tend to be designed to appeal to the senses in concert, and through this to trigger memories, associations and emotions. Thus the Nitro-poached Green Tea and Lime Mousse on the Fat Duck menu is served with spritz of ‘lime grove’ scent from an atomiser; and the Jelly of Quail dish includes among its tableware a bed of oak moss, as well as being accompanied by a specially created scent of oak moss that is dispersed at the table by means of dry ice.|$|E
2500|$|The ethical and/or moral {{premises}} of healthcare {{are complex and}} intricate. To consolidate such {{a large segment of}} moral philosophy, it becomes important to focus on what separates healthcare ethics from other forms of morality. And on the whole, {{it can be said that}} healthcare itself is a [...] "special" [...] institution within society. With that said, healthcare ought to [...] "be treated differently from other social goods" [...] in a society. It is an institution of which we are all a part <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not. At some point in every person's life, a decision has to be made regarding one's healthcare. Can they afford it? Do they deserve it? Do they need it? Where should they go to get it? Do they even want it? And it is this last question which poses the biggest dilemma facing a person. After weighing all of the costs and benefits of her healthcare situation, the person has to decide if the costs of healthcare outweigh the benefits. More than basic economic issues are at stake in this conundrum. In fact, a person must decide whether or not their life is ending or if it is worth salvaging. Of course, in instances where the patient is unable to decide due to medical complications, like a coma, then the decision must come from elsewhere. And defining that [...] "elsewhere" [...] has proven to be a very difficult endeavor in healthcare philosophy.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} convention, the city hall in Syracuse, New York was {{selected}} as the site. Because Syracuse was nearer to Seneca Falls (two days' travel by horse, several hours' journey by rail), more of the original signers of the Declaration of Sentiments were able to attend than the previous two conventions in Massachusetts. Lucretia Mott was named president; at one point she felt it necessary to silence a minister who offended the assembly by using biblical references to keep women subordinate to men. A letter from Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read and its resolutions voted on. At sessions taking place September 8–10, 1852, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage made their first public speeches on women's rights. Ernestine Rose spoke denouncing duties without rights, saying [...] "as a woman has to pay taxes to maintain government, she has a right to participate in the formation and administration of it." [...] Antoinette Brown called for more women to become ministers, claiming that the Bible did not forbid it. Ernestine Rose stood up in response, saying that the Bible should not be used as the authority for settling a dispute, especially as it contained much contradiction regarding women. Elizabeth Oakes Smith called for women to have their own journal so that they could become independent of the male-owned press, saying [...] "We should have a literature of our own, a printing press and a publishing house, and tract writers and distributors, as well as lectures and conventions; and yet I say this to a race of beggars, for women have no pecuniary resources."

40|$|OVER JUST ONE generation, {{there have}} beenmany changes in {{organizational}} develop-ment, management, and consulting. These changes have not {{occurred in a}} vacuum. Along with scientific and technological advances, there are major social, economic, and environmental pressures for change. Different terms {{have been used to}} describe this change: from modernity to postmodernity, from the Industrial to the Informa-tion age, from the Machine to the Systems age. But there is little question that we are rapidly shifting toward a very different world. As many business leaders and consultants point out, in this new world, the old stand-bys of order, control, prediction, and clearly defined tasks are less reliable. In the old machine model of industry, beyond simply operating in the assembly line-like reliable machine-like parts, the only demand made of workers was obedience. In the new world, we speak of pro-active, “empowered” workers, “knowledge workers ” who add value by being change-agents. But even as the world around us is changing, with clear effects on the economy and the work-place, we have to ask ourselves <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> where <b>it’s</b> going. Is there a vision of what a more desirable world might look <b>like?</b> Can <b>we</b> think about this process differently, so that rather than merely “adapt ” to what we think is happening in the world, we can actually co-create it in ways that reflect our values, hopes, and aspirations?

50|$|All {{of these}} {{statutes}} are {{contrary to the}} common law and to the procedure in force {{in many of the}} states, but they are binding upon the courts of this state. For this reason it is an utter waste of time for lawyers in their briefs and oral arguments to cite and discuss decisions from states which have different statutes. It is not a question as to <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> these statutes. <b>It</b> is enough for us to know that they are the law of Oklahoma. This court is not a forum of legislation. Our duty is ended when we obey the law, and we should either do this or resign and allow others to take the places which we occupy, who will regard the obligation of their oaths of office. The great trouble with the judiciary of the entire country is that many judges try to so twist and evade statutes as to enable them to substitute their own private views for regularly enacted statutes. This evil has become so great that there is now more judge-made law in the United States than there is law enacted by the people. If the courts do not correct this evil, no one can tell what the result will be. It will end in one of three things, viz., peaceable reformation, bloody revolution, or a judicial oligarchy. This court proposes to do its duty by rendering a ready and willing obedience to the regularly enacted laws of Oklahoma, and by doing all in its power to see that they are followed by the trial courts of this state.|$|R
2500|$|Vallabhbhai Patel {{was one of}} {{the first}} Congress leaders to accept the {{partition}} of India as a solution to the rising Muslim separatist movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He had been outraged by Jinnah's Direct Action campaign, which had provoked communal violence across India and by the viceroy's vetoes of his home department's plans to stop the violence on the grounds of constitutionality. Patel severely criticised the viceroy's induction of League ministers into the government, and the revalidation of the grouping scheme by the British without Congress approval. Although further outraged at the League's boycott of the assembly and non-acceptance of the plan of 16 May despite entering government, he was also aware that Jinnah did enjoy popular support amongst Muslims, and that an open conflict between him and the nationalists could degenerate into a Hindu-Muslim civil war of disastrous consequences. The continuation of a divided and weak central government would in Patel's mind, result in the wider fragmentation of India by encouraging more than 600 princely states towards independence. Between the months of December 1946 and January 1947, Patel worked with civil servant V. P. Menon on the latter's suggestion for a separate dominion of Pakistan created out of Muslim-majority provinces. Communal violence in Bengal and Punjab in January and March 1947 further convinced Patel of the soundness of partition. Patel, a fierce critic of Jinnah's demand that the Hindu-majority areas of Punjab and Bengal be included in a Muslim state, obtained the partition of those provinces, thus blocking any possibility of their inclusion in Pakistan. Patel's decisiveness on the partition of Punjab and Bengal had won him many supporters and admirers amongst the Indian public, which had tired of the League's tactics, but he was criticised by Gandhi, Nehru, secular Muslims and socialists for a perceived eagerness to do so. When Lord Louis Mountbatten formally proposed the plan on 3 June 1947, Patel gave his approval and lobbied Nehru and other Congress leaders to accept the proposal. Knowing Gandhi's deep anguish regarding proposals of partition, Patel engaged him in frank discussion in private meetings over the perceived practical unworkability of any Congress-League coalition, the rising violence and the threat of civil war. At the All India Congress Committee meeting called to vote on the proposal, Patel said:I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [...] Nobody likes the division of India and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts. We cannot give way to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid of one thing, that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste or prove unfruitful. My nine months in office has completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honorable exceptions, Muslim officials from the top down to the chaprasis (peons or servants) are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the Mission Plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. <b>Whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> not, de facto Pakistan already exists in the Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances I would prefer a de jure Pakistan, which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 percent of India, which we can make strong with our own genius. The League can develop the rest of the country.Following Gandhi's denial but Congress' approval of the plan, Patel represented India on the Partition Council, where he oversaw the division of public assets, and selected the Indian council of ministers with Nehru. However, neither he nor any other Indian leader had foreseen the intense violence and population transfer that would take place with partition.|$|E

Furthermore, it takes conscious choice {{to become part of}} a theatre audience. One must come together as part of a group in a physical space that is reserved especially for that purpose. And then one must remain alert and engaged with the story throughout, usually through quietly listening and watching, and occasionally by following instructions for some sort of participation. The flexibility of stopping and starting the event does not exist as it does in film and television. And there are commercials. Theatre audiences have made a commitment to participate in an event. Yet, this participation is lacking by today's networked and collaborative standards. Other modes of storytelling, such as the plethora of free and low cost social networking platforms and the increasingly elaborate worlds of video game technology provide "the ability to insert yourself directly into the story.

40|$|Because {{there has}} been {{particular}} interest in {{a report on the}} documentary work done in the Centre de Documentation at Laval University, and especially in its use of the Miracode machine, I will give a general account of our experience at Laval in setting up this documentation center which operates {{under the auspices of the}} University Library. The documentation center is designed to assist both teachers and those engaged in research. Its function is not, as some may imagine, primarily to collate documents not in the possession of the library, but rather to extract from books, periodicals, and other documents information which may be needed for purposes of teaching and research by the various faculties and institutes of the University. Before discussing the work of the center perhaps observations would be in order. some background In France, when a professional librarian attains a rank equivalent to that of a "senior librarian " in America, he is given the title of "conservateur " (i. e., conserver). I believe, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> to admit <b>it</b> or not, it is indisputable that a major, if not principal, function of the professional librarian has long been and still is the conservation of books. The first criterion of the quality of a library, for example, is still the over-all quantity of volumes it contains. Even in our day, this criterion takes precedence over most others. I know one university library that refused for three years to give up a collection of one hundred thousand law books which logically belonged in the library of the faculty of law, because by surrendering them, the general library would have fallen below its boasted one million volumes. Also, as a member of a study group on scientific and technical information in Canada, I have recently participated in public meetings held at a 1 number of Canadian universities, and conducted numerous interviews with faculty members, researchers, graduate students, librarians and directors of data processing centers. Since the official report of the group is not yet published, I am at this time in no position to offer any predictions concerning its findings and recommendations.
