While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother.

Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> time with her daughter for Mother's Day.
