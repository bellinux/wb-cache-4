40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of flashlamp-pumped, Nd:glass. Brewster-angle slab amplifiers intended to be deployed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF). To verify performance, we tested a full-size, three-slab-long, NIF prototype amplifier, which {{we believe to be}} the largest flashlamp-pumped Nd:glass amplifier ever assembled. Like the NIF amplifier design, this prototype amplifier had eight 40 -cm-square apertures combined in a four-aperture-high by two-aperture-wide matrix. Specially-shaped reflectors, anti-reflective coatings on the blastshields, and preionized flashlamps were used to increase storage efficiency. Cooling gas was flowed over the flashlamps to remove <b>waste</b> <b>pump</b> heat and to accelerate thermal wavefront recovery. The prototype gain results are consistent with model predictions and provide high confidence in the final engineering design of the NIF amplifiers. Although the dimensions, internal positions, and shapes of the components in the NIF amplifiers will be slightly different from the prototype, these differences are small and should produce only slight differences in amplifier performanc...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a cost-effective method for accelerating the thermal wavefront recovery and shot rate of large, flashlamp-pumped, Nd:glass, Brewster-angle slab lasers of the type used for studying inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and laser-plasma interactions. This method removes <b>waste</b> <b>pump</b> heat by flowing slightly-chilled, turbulent gas over the flashlamps and blastshields after each shot, with the cooled blastshields serving as heat sinks for radiatively extracting residual heat deposited in the laser slabs. We performed both experiments and modeling to characterize residual optical distortions arising from both temperature gradients within the laser slabs {{as well as from}} buoyantly-driven convection currents in the amplifier cavity and attached beam tubes. The most rapid thermal recovery was achieved by reducing the temperature of the cooling gas by 0. 5 - 1 C below the ambient temperature for about two hours after the shot. Model predictions for the 1. 8 -MJ National Ignition Facility (NIF) laser now being built at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) show that such chilled-gas cooling would increase the thermal-distortion-limited shot rate from about one shot every eight hours to one shot every three to four hours, thus significantly increasing the potential scientific productivity of this major Department of Energy (DOE) facility...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 51) Sites impacted with {{chlorinated solvents}} present unique technical challenges {{when compared to}} most other groundwater contaminants. Chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs) such as such as tetrachloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), or 1, 1, 1 - trichloroethane (1, 1, 1 -TCA) generally do not degrade naturally in the environment. Therefore, more aggressive source depletion methods such as enhanced in-situ bioremediation (EISB) may be implemented to treat the groundwater plume. EISB involves injection of an electron donor to promote reducing conditions followed by inoculation of groundwater with dechlorinating bacteria. When conditions are favorable, the dechlorinating bacteria sequentially remove chlorine ions from the chlorinated solvent compound until an innocuous end product is produced. This process creates unique and {{dramatic changes in the}} natural geochemistry of the aquifer system. A CVOC-impacted site located at Naval Air Station North Island (NASNI) was used as a test case for this study. NASNI is an active military base located adjacent to the City of Coronado in San Diego County, California. The site, or Operable Unit 24 (OU 24), is a chlorinated solvent groundwater plume which may have originated from an acid <b>waste</b> <b>pump</b> station associated with a historic industrial waste pipeline. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the geochemical changes that occur during EISB and how they relate to the effectiveness of remediation. An evaluation of the redox conditions present in groundwater and the observed reduction in CVOC concentrations was used to evaluate the effectiveness of EISB. In addition, geochemical modeling was performed to develop an understanding of the effect of redox conditions on observed dissolved inorganic constituent concentrations due to precipitation or dissolution of minerals present in the aquifer. Based on the results of the geochemical evaluation, groundwater generally became more reducing and VOC concentrations decreased following implementation of EISB. In addition, minerals containing Fe, Mn, and SO 4 were sensitive to redox transformations. Conversely, Ca, Mg, Na, and some Mn-containing minerals were not sensitive to redox conditions. Reduced minerals FeS, FeS 2, and H 2 S have the potential to precipitate and oxidized Fe and Mn minerals have the potential to dissolve as groundwater becomes more reducing. This can create problems with groundwater treatment systems that expose groundwater to oxygen. When reduced groundwater containing high concentrations of dissolved Fe and Mn is exposed to oxygen, the Fe and Mn hydroxide minerals will precipitate and may foul remediation equipment. Additionally, redox transformations can potentially mobilize toxic metals such as arsenic, chromium, lead, and mercury through oxidation and reduction processes...|$|E
