5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each {{had a number of}} tickets which they could give to those people who they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to <b>work</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E

5|$|During the shutdown, some 19,000 state {{employees}} were laid off.

Laid-off employees were immediately eligible for unemployment benefits, and continued to receive health insurance, costing the state millions a week.|$|E
5|$|Each {{apprentice}} was to {{be given}} two sets of clothing, suitable linen, stockings, hats, and shoes, and a new set each year thereafter.

5|$|Heathen festivals {{can be held}} on {{the same}} day each year, {{although}} they are often celebrated by Heathen communities on the nearest available weekend, so that those practitioners who <b>work</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> week can attend. During these ceremonies, Heathens often recite poetry to honor the deities, which typically draw upon or imitate the Early Medieval poems written in Old Norse or Old English. Mead or ale is also typically drunk, with offerings being given to deities, while fires, torches, or candles are often lit. There are also regional meetings of Heathens known as Things. At these, religious rites are performed, while workshops, stalls, feasts, and competitive games are also present. In the U.S., there are two national gatherings, Althing and Trothmoot.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, an {{exhibition}} in the Grand Palais of Paris {{was devoted to}} his <b>work,</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> annual salon of the Société des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Society) of France.

5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actors were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories.

However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may {{have been designed to}} work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and have been easy to defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction <b>work</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E
