5|$|As {{the tunnels}} were constructed, they were {{generally}} supported by wooden beams and posts. Once the mine had been finished, the internal space {{was filled with}} combustibles, such as brushwood, firewood, resin, and other incendiary substances; once ignited, these <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> the supporting props, causing the mine to collapse, bringing down with it the structures lying above. From the 15th century, gunpowder was also used, although the aim remained to burn the props.|$|E
5|$|STAC {{stated that}} an SST would have {{economic}} performance similar to existing subsonic types. Although they <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> more fuel in cruise, {{they would be}} able to fly more sorties in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Philistines were infuriated by the riddle. The thirty groomsmen told Samson's {{new wife}} that they <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> {{her and her}} father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to the riddle and tell it to them. At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, and she told it to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E

500|$|Mostly in {{the early}} seasons, Smithers had a catchphrase, which comes from a {{recurring}} joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is. Smithers and <b>Burns</b> <b>would</b> watch Homer (usually over a security camera feed) and <b>Burns</b> <b>would</b> ask, [...] "Who is that man?", to which Smithers would reply, [...] "That's Homer Simpson, sir, one of your [...] from sector 7G."

5|$|When the Natchez {{began to}} protest the seizure of their land for the plantation, Chépart said he <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> down the temple that {{contained}} their ancestors' graves. In response to this threat, the Natchez seemed to promise to cede the land, wrote Dumont de Montigny, {{but only if they}} were given two months to relocate their temple and graves. Chépart agreed to give them the time in exchange for pelts, oil, poultry, and grain—a request the Natchez promised to fulfill later.|$|E
5|$|Accounts vary, but historians {{estimate}} that by spring 1903, between 700 and 1,000 men {{arrived in the}} Tanana Valley. This put an enormous strain on Barnette's stock of food, which rapidly rose in price with demand. Miners objected to Barnette charging $12 per bag of flour and requiring them to buy cases of canned food. They gathered outside his store and demanded he lower his prices or they <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> it down. He responded that he had riflemen inside the building, and both groups reached a compromise. Shortly afterward, Barnette headed south with his wife on a dog team, intending to gather investors to purchase more supplies.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the film}} was {{temporarily}} shut down after a fire destroyed several soundstages at Paramount Studios, {{one of which was}} adjacent to the set for the Genesis planet. Initially, the set's pyrotechnics were suspected of causing the fire, but the cause was ruled to be arson. Shatner was among the cast members who grabbed fire hoses to stop the flames. Correll hoped the place <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> down so that he would get his chance to film in Hawaii. While most of the set was undamaged, holes {{in the side of the}} building had to be covered with heavy black curtains to prevent outside light from leaking in.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, if {{the density}} in the {{universe}} were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> out, leaving white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach absolute zero—a Big Freeze. Moreover, if the proton were unstable, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting Hawking radiation. The entropy of the universe would increase {{to the point where}} no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.|$|E
5|$|Han {{farmers in}} the Yangzi River region of {{southern}} China often maintained paddy fields for growing rice. Every year, they <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> the weeds in the paddy field, drench it in water, sow rice by hand, and around harvest time cut the surviving weeds and drown them a second time. In this system, the field lays fallow {{for much of the}} year and thus did not remain very fertile. However, Han rice farmers to the north around the Huai River practiced the more advanced system of transplantation. In this system, individual plants were given intensive care (perhaps in the same location as the paddy field), their offshoots separated so that more water could be conserved, and the field could be heavily fertilized since winter crops were grown while the rice seedlings were situated nearby in a plant nursery.|$|E
5|$|Much {{time was}} spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of {{experimentation}} among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand-built cigar-box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple; this method also inspired Simon while arranging the songs. Smith <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> Simon a compact disc each evening of the day’s session, and he would return {{the next day with}} notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, rather than {{at the end of the}} process. Simon and Ramone often listened to their recordings while driving around, noting what would need changes.|$|E

5|$|The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and {{the dancers}} fled the {{building}} as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre, and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon. This too, <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> {{to the ground in}} 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, {{the height}} of the Cold War, several {{buildings}} on this site were used for mock atomic attacks to enable rescue workers to gain experience.

25|$|Charcoal {{does not}} consist of pure carbon; rather, it {{consists}} of partially pyrolyzed cellulose, in which the wood is not completely decomposed. Carbon differs from ordinary charcoal. Whereas charcoal's autoignition temperature is relatively low, carbon's is much greater. Thus, a black powder composition containing pure carbon <b>would</b> <b>burn</b> similarly to a match head, at best.|$|E
