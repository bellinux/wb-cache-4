5|$|The plans {{launched}} by the city administration most closely resembled the Environmental Tram, with slight changes. The initial plans involved {{a line from the}} city center via Nesttun to the airport at Flesland. It became part of a political compromise, the Bergen Program, which ensured a number of road investments {{at the same time as}} the light rail system, all financed through the toll ring. However, a lack of funds made it necessary to build the line to Nesttun only, instead of all the <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> The initial decision was taken by Bergen City Council on 13 March 2000, in the Parliament of Norway in 2002, and with the financing secured, by the city council in 2005. Only the Progress Party and the Pensioners' Party voted against light rail. Forty per cent is financed by the state, the remainder by the county, the municipality and through the toll ring.|$|E
