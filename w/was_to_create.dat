5|$|From 1883-1884, Thompson {{stayed in}} Cambridge as {{so-called}} Junior Demonstrator in physiology, teaching students.

The plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a breakwater on the bar, which would stop the build-up of sand, and the railway would transport sand from the nearby dunes to where it was needed for agricultural purposes elsewhere in the south west.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Knott {{defeated}} Republican Thomas Z. Morrow {{by a margin}} of nearly 45,000 votes. During his term in office, he asked the legislature to conduct a thorough reform of the state's tax system, but the legislators' only response <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a board of equalization charged with making equitable tax assessments. The legislature also refused to grant the Railroad Commission all the powers Knott had requested.|$|E

This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.|$|E
5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> tension from dialogue scenes, {{and he often}} reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete was a scene where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{the song}} was a {{collaborative}} effort between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's intent <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He conceptualized a song that had an emotional message.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{contemplated}} recording more {{tracks to}} make up a double album in a similar manner, but following an earthquake, he decided to relocate to New York City and hold a live recording session at the Record Plant with session players. The basic idea <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> songs with sing-along choruses. Rundgren did not pre-plan who would play on the sessions, but simply wanted anyone who happened to be in or near the studio to turn up and learn the material.|$|E
5|$|Soma Bringer was the {{creation}} of producer and studio co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi. Initially a standard role-playing game before transitioning to action role-playing due to hardware restrictions, the aim <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an engaging multiplayer experience: this resulted in the gameplay being developed before the story, a reversal of the development style used for earlier Monolith Soft titles. It featured returning staff from Takahashi's earlier titles, including Xeno series writer Soraya Saga, and Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Development took approximately two years.|$|E

Residents however forced the highway to the east banks of the lake after voicing their concerns. Residents {{on the east side of}} the lake voiced similar concerns and the plan was later dropped.|$|E

The group's lawyer stated that the organizational structure among regional airlines was 15 years out of date and that the group would take market shares in a growing market, especially by starting new niche direct services.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{was originally}} established in 1860 by Jews of German background.
