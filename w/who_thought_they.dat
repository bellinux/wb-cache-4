5|$|Beyond the band's {{specific}} {{legal issues}} and {{insight into the}} making of the new album, the film also examines the state of the modern music industry as a whole, focusing on the complex relationships between major labels and their artists. Other musicians give their first-hand accounts of their own experiences in the business. The logistics and economics of how a record company works are explained by music industry insiders, including former EMI employees, music producers and music journalists. They trace the impact of the growing American economic recession on the industry, wherein many companies were taken over by larger groups <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> could save them. In this instance, Terra Firma Capital Partners sought to rescue EMI despite having little experience in music management.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride would be dangerous to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch period {{ended in}} 1662 when Ming loyalist forces of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) drove out the Dutch and {{established}} the short-lived Zheng family kingdom on Taiwan. The Zhengs brought 70,000 soldiers to Taiwan and immediately began clearing {{large tracts of}} land to support its forces. Despite the preoccupation with fighting the Qing, the Zheng family was concerned with aboriginal welfare on Taiwan. The Zhengs built alliances, collected taxes and erected aboriginal schools, where Taiwan's aborigines were first introduced to the Confucian Classics and Chinese writing. However, {{the impact of the}} Dutch was deeply ingrained in aboriginal society. In the 19th and 20th centuries, European explorers wrote of being welcomed as kin by the aborigines <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were the Dutch, who had promised to return.|$|E

5|$|The song {{features}} the lead pair singing amidst a flower farm as mridangam and flute players accompany {{them in the}} background. It was choreographed by Raju Sundaram who also appears in a cameo, playing a harmonium. As part of their roles, the male supporting actors who appear in the song were required to wear a panjakkacham and angavastram, leaving most of their body exposed to the freezing cold. The shoot began as early as 5:30 AM and the locals, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> should be out of their mind to be dressed so, came {{up to them and}} warned that they might freeze to death.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} destruction caused to {{the city}} by the tornado was to the town's business district, a three-block stretch of Main Street between First and Fourth Street lined with stores, offices and tenements built of brick and stone. Because of the direction the storm had approached the city from and the angle at which it entered the city, the tornado virtually swallowed the entire business district. It was here that {{a large majority of}} the fatalities occurred, as many of those <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would be safe {{within the confines of the}} reinforced structures were killed by cascades of falling debris as the buildings on Main Street were swept away. A 1.5-ton safe from the city bank was thrown a full block away. Probably one of the greatest demonstrations of the tornado's strength was seen at the Nicollet Hotel, a newly constructed three-story brick building located adjacent to the Willow River. The tornado swept the building clean down to the foundation, killing at least five people. Almost simultaneously, the town's Methodist Church was completely obliterated, the only remnant being the 1.1-ton cast iron bell, which was found nearly 200 feet from the church foundation. As the tornado cleared Main Street, it tore the iron-frame bridge spanning the Willow River from its fitting and onto the adjacent riverbank in a twisted heap. The City Hall was completely flattened, the adjacent water tower sent toppling to the northeast and dumping its contents into First Street and transforming it into a muddy deluge. The tornado then moved into the east side of New Richmond, where many of the city's working class residents lived. As many as forty homes in this neighborhood were completely obliterated, leaving the neighborhood virtually unrecognizable. Within a period of roughly seven to ten minutes, over half of New Richmond was laid to ruins.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} and belief of consumption influenced emotion detection in ten second clips. Participants <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had consumed an alcoholic beverage rated one facial expression (approximately 3% {{of the facial}} expressions they saw) more in each clip as happy compared to the control group. Thus, impression formation may be affected by even the perception of alcohol consumption.|$|E

25|$|When Madison {{left office}} in 1817 at age 65, he retired to Montpelier, his tobacco {{plantation}} in Orange County, Virginia, {{not far from}} Jefferson's Monticello. Dolley, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> would finally {{have a chance to}} travel to Paris, was 49. As with both Washington and Jefferson, Madison left the presidency a poorer man than when elected. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due to the continued price declines in tobacco and also due to his stepson's mismanagement.|$|E
25|$|Resorts may ban persons {{convicted of}} sex, drug, or violent crimes. Policies vary, but might include doing a {{criminal}} record check or checking a sex offender registry. However, minor crimes related to naturism are usually excluded, even {{if the person is}} required by law to register. (Requirements vary substantially from one jurisdiction to the next.) An example would be someone <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were in a secluded area while nude bathing with no lewd intent, but were charged with a crime anyhow.|$|E
25|$|The {{partisan}} rangers proved controversial among Confederate army regulars, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> encouraged desertion {{as well as}} morale {{problems in}} the countryside as potential soldiers would favor sleeping in their own (or friendly) beds and capturing booty to the hardships and privations of traditional military campaigns. Mosby was thus enrolled in the Provisional Army of the Confederate States and soon promoted to lieutenant colonel on January 21, 1864, and to colonel, December 7, 1864. Mosby thus carefully screened potential recruits, and required each to bring his own horse.|$|E

25|$|Along {{the pursuit}} by the Australian Mounted Division and 5th Cavalry Division, and the 4th Cavalry Division, wounded and {{increasing}} numbers of sick were held in collecting stations. They waited evacuation by returning supply motor lorries. At a monastery above {{the shore of the}} Sea of Galilee north of Tiberias, monks cared for sick Australians <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> were at home; the shore for half a mile beyond a little jetty was planted with eucalyptus. They ate freshly picked bananas from a nearby grove, oranges and fresh fish.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probably}} {{fair to say}} that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> knew exactly what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.|$|E
25|$|According to Sicko, almost {{fifty million}} Americans are uninsured while the remainder, who are covered, are often victims of {{insurance}} company fraud and red tape. Furthermore, Sicko says the U.S. health {{in general is}} ranked 37 out of 191 by the World Health Organization with certain health measures, such as infant mortality and life expectancy, equal to countries with much less economic wealth. Interviews are conducted with people <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> had adequate coverage but were denied care.

500|$|Two of {{the ships}} {{anchored}} in Young's Bay, near Calliaqua, while the third anchored off Kingstown. The ships flew no national colours, leading to local speculation as to their intent. Local planters <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> might be merchant vessels expected {{to pick up the}} sugar harvest prevented a sentry at one of the island's coastal fortifications from firing a signal cannon, and one man sent out to one {{of the ships}} was taken prisoner. As the French began landing their troops, a small company under Captain Percin de la Roque was landed on the eastern shore to mobilise the Caribs. [...] These irregular forces, which grew to number about 800, quickly overran British settlements near the borders between the British lands and those of the Caribs, while du Rumain led his main body of troops toward Kingstown.|$|E
500|$|The {{introduction}} of midi-chloriansmicroscopic organisms that mediate {{use of the}} Forcein the film has been controversial among fans. Some viewed it as a concept that negates the Force's spiritual quality, although the film still portrays the Force as a mysterious entity using the midi-chlorians to communicate with living beings. Film historian Daniel Dinello says [...] "Anathema to Star Wars fanatics <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> reduced the Force {{to a kind of}} viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy." [...] Religion expert John D. Caputo writes [...] "In the 'Gospel according to Lucas', a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled...The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis, even if its ways are mysterious: their bodily cells have a heavier than usual concentration of 'midi-chlorians'." ...|$|E
