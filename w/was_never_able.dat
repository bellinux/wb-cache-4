5|$|Considered washed-up, the 34-year-old Tittle {{was traded}} to the Giants {{following}} the 1960 season. Over the next four seasons, he won multiple NFL MVP awards, twice set the league single-season record for touchdown passes, and led the Giants to three straight NFL championship games. Although he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to deliver a championship to the team, Tittle's time in New York is regarded among the glory years of the franchise.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{assistance}} from his friends, he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> {{to secure a}} permanent salaried position such as a curatorship in a museum. To remain financially solvent, Wallace worked grading government examinations, wrote 25 papers for publication between 1872 and 1876 for various modest sums, and was paid by Lyell and Darwin to help edit {{some of their own}} works.|$|E
5|$|In critic Gary Giddins' view,Kelly <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> {{to exploit}} his gifts {{when he went}} out on his own. His quartet with Wes Montgomery should have {{developed}} into a major force, but the same commercial interests that shanghaied Montgomery saddled Kelly with the fashionable soul-funk of the mid-'60s. Unlike Montgomery, his career went nowhere, and he didn't {{live long enough to}} find himself again.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} was {{formally}} announced on 2 April after an LM convention.

5|$|At {{some point}} after 1605 {{her career as}} a courtesan came to an end when she married the playwright and bureaucrat Shen Defu. She was married several times (making many of the {{proposals}} herself) but none of these unions lasted. As well as Shen Defu, her husbands included General Li Hualong, art critic Li Rihua and, in later life, an unnamed (but wealthy) merchant from Suzhou. Although she wanted children, she <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to have any.|$|E
5|$|British {{military}} leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, suffered a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in his approach at Queenston Heights, <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> {{to live up to}} Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to America in 1924 {{to appear in}} The Passing Show of 1924 which ran for four months beginning in September. Also in this timeframe he became a featured attraction with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus and toured London, Brussels and Berlin. It was during an engagement at the London Palladium that Barbette was found engaged in sexual activity with another man. His contract was cancelled and he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to obtain a work permit for England again.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services, the Australian Army's {{most senior}} medical officer, with {{the rank of}} major general. He oversaw the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the capital cities. In 1944 he accepted a commission to edit the medical series volumes of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1939–1945 but <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to do so as {{he was killed in}} a plane crash in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Kann {{asserts that}} she {{nevertheless}} possessed qualities appreciated in a monarch: warm heart, practical mind, firm determination and sound perception. Most importantly, {{she was ready}} to recognise the mental superiority of some of her advisers and to give way to a superior mind while enjoying support of her ministers even if their ideas differed from her own. Joseph, however, <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to establish rapport with the same advisers, even though their philosophy of government was closer to Joseph's than to Maria Theresa's.|$|E

5|$|Some historians see Władysław as {{a dreamer}} {{who could not}} stick to one policy, and upon running into first difficulties, ditched it and looked for another opportunity. Perhaps {{it was due to}} this lukewarmness that Władysław <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to inspire those he ruled to support, at least in any {{significant}} manner, any of his plans. Władysław Czapliński in his biography of the king is more understanding, noting the short period of his reign (16 years) and the weakness of the royal position he was forced to deal with.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and was twelve years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to recover.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E

5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} that Mary had ongoing developmental issues. She <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to walk, nor did she ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation {{at a time when}} some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
5|$|Laurer had a {{strained}} {{relationship with her}} family. She last saw her mother {{at the age of}} 16, and she claimed that her father <b>was</b> <b>never</b> <b>able</b> to get over her decision not to pursue a career in law enforcement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She also alleged that her father took out several student loans in her name without her knowledge, leaving her with $40,000 in debt. On an episode of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew in 2008, Laurer claimed to have a bad relationship with all of her family members, including her siblings. In September 2010, Laurer was hospitalized after overdosing on sleeping medication. As of February 2015, Laurer had re-established a good relationship with her mother; her father died in May 2014.|$|E
