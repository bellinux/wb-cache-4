5|$|Like the Fastra I, the Fastra II uses a Lian Li PC-P80 Armorsuit case, {{which has}} 10 {{expansion}} slots. The motherboard in the Fastra II {{was at that}} time the only <b>workstation</b> motherboard that had seven full-sized PCI Express x16 slots.|$|E
5|$|Smart Studios had {{upgraded}} their {{mixing console}} to a Trident A-Range model, which the band used extensively. The band tracked directly onto analogue tape using a Studer tape machine, {{which was then}} dumped into Pro Tools digital audio <b>workstation.</b> Overdubs and mixing were carried out in Pro Tools.|$|E
5|$|Apple's {{business}} {{philosophy is}} to acquire small companies {{that can be}} easily integrated into existing company projects. For instance, Apple acquired Emagic and its professional music software, Logic Pro, in 2002. The acquisition was incorporated {{in the creation of the}} digital audio <b>workstation</b> software GarageBand, now part of the iLife software suite.|$|E
50|$|The Koffler Technology Center is Bryant's {{computer}} center. More than 200 terminals, microcomputers, and <b>workstations</b> {{are located}} here. Facilities offer individual <b>workstations</b> for hands-on learning and shared <b>workstations</b> for group projects.|$|R
50|$|Companies should design <b>workstations</b> {{that are}} conducive to good health. <b>Workstations</b> should allow workers {{to choose between}} several working {{positions}} and to move easily between them. Additionally, workers {{should be able to}} adjust the height of their <b>workstations</b> to fit their body size. Other helpful aspects of <b>workstations</b> are footrests, elbow rests, and seats so workers can sit when they need to.|$|R
50|$|The ThinkStation {{products}} from Lenovo are professional <b>workstations</b> designed for high-end computing. In 2008, Lenovo expanded {{the focus of}} its “THINK” brand to include <b>workstations,</b> with the ThinkStation S10 being the first model released. In 2014, Lenovo introduced the P Series <b>workstations.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Mac Pro is {{a series}} of <b>workstation</b> and server {{computers}} manufactured by Apple Inc. The Mac Pro, in most configurations and in terms of speed and performance, is the most powerful computer that Apple offers. It is the high-end model of the three desktop computers in the current Mac lineup, the other two being the iMac and Mac Mini.|$|E
5|$|The Revival is {{the second}} studio album by American R group Tony! Toni! Toné!, {{released}} on May 8, 1990, by Wing Records. It is the follow-up to their modestly successful debut album Who? (1988). The album was produced and arranged primarily by Tony! Toni! Toné!, with additional production by Foster & McElroy, who previously produced Who?. The group recorded The Revival at several studios in California and used a Synclavier music <b>workstation.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her <b>workstation</b> there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E

5|$|Jobs was {{intrigued}} by Berg's concept of a <b>workstation</b> and contemplated starting a higher education computer company {{in the fall of}} 1985, amidst increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs' division did not release upgraded versions of the Macintosh and most of the Macintosh Office. As a result, sales plummeted, and Apple was forced to write off millions of dollars in unsold inventory. Apple's chief executive officer (CEO) John Sculley ousted Jobs from his day-to-day role at Apple, replacing him with Jean-Louis Gassée in 1985. Later that year, Jobs began a power struggle to regain control of the company. The board of directors sided with Sculley while Jobs took a business visit to Western Europe and the Soviet Union on behalf of Apple.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the main}} {{characters}} in the game hold a significant grudge against the Empire and, in particular, Kefka Palazzo, who serves {{as one of the}} game's main antagonists along with Emperor Gestahl. The supporting character Ultros serves as a recurring villain and comic relief throughout the game. A handful of Final Fantasy VI characters have reappeared in later games, such as Secret of Evermore. Additionally, Final Fantasy SGI, a short tech demo produced for the Silicon Graphics Onyx <b>workstation,</b> featured polygon-based 3D renderings of Locke, Terra, and Shadow.|$|E
5|$|The game centres around Donkey Kong and {{his nephew}} Diddy Kong, who must recover their stolen hoard of bananas from King K. Rool and the Kremlings. Development {{of the game}} first began shortly after Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper ran {{experiments}} with a Silicon Graphics <b>workstation,</b> rendering realistic 3D sprites. Nintendo became interested in Rare's work and soon acquired 49% of the company which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology for the SNES console. The Stamper brothers expressed an interest to create a standalone Donkey Kong game, and assembled a team of 12 to work on the game over an 18-month development cycle.|$|E
5000|$|NeXT's first {{operating}} system was NeXTSTEP, a sophisticated Mach-UNIX based {{operating system}} that originally ran only on NeXT's Motorola 68k-based <b>workstations</b> {{and that was}} then ported to run on 32-bit Intel x86-based [...] "IBM-compatible" [...] personal computers, PA-RISC-based <b>workstations</b> from Hewlett-Packard, and SPARC-based <b>workstations</b> from Sun Microsystems.|$|R

5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 <b>workstation</b> card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E
5|$|Before Donkey Kong Countrys production, Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper {{invested}} and programmed {{experiments with}} a Silicon Graphics Challenge <b>workstation,</b> with their initial focus centred on a boxing game. Although never reaching beyond {{the stages of}} initial development, senior Nintendo staff who visited their Twycross studio were impressed with their progress after being shown a working demo. Genyo Takeda was dispatched to Japan to advise then-president of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi on securing a deal with Rare. Following talks between Yamauchi and Rare staff, Nintendo acquired 49% of the company, which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology and the addition of Rare as a second-party developer. The Stampers expressed interest in making a game based on Donkey Kong and were given Nintendo's permission.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same <b>workstation</b> satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take us from the traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E
