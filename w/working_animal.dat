5|$|Native ponies {{existed in}} Wales before 1600 BC, and a Welsh-type cob {{was known as}} early as the Middle Ages. They were {{influenced}} by the Arabian horse, and possibly also by the Thoroughbred and the Hackney horse. In 1901, the first stud book for the Welsh breeds was established in the United Kingdom, and in 1907 another registry was established in the United States. Interest in the breed declined during the Great Depression, but revived in the 1950s. Throughout their history, the Welsh breeds have had many uses, including as a cavalry horse, a pit pony, and as a <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> on farms.|$|E
25|$|Domesticated ponies of all breeds {{originally}} developed {{mainly from the}} need for a <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> that could fulfill specific local draft and transportation needs while surviving in harsh environments. The usefulness of the pony was noted by farmers who observed that a pony could outperform a draft horse on small farms.|$|E
40|$|In mix crop {{livestock}} systems, farmers {{derive their}} livelihoods using natural resources based strategies and off farm income. In these system livestock {{is both a}} source of food, fiber cash income and draught power valued in agricultural production and transport. Using the sustainable livelihood framework the contribution of <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> to income, food security and poverty alleviation is discussed {{in the context of}} rural West Africa. We use data collected in selected communities to test empirically the impact of ownership of <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> on poverty alleviation. Specifically, a poverty index is developed based on asset ownership and income from different sources including forest and off farm income. Then, this index is regressed on ownership of <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> and other important socio-economic determinants to provide evidence of the role of draught animals in poverty alleviation. Additional discussion also addresses the issues of constraints to the optimal contribution of <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> to the livelihoods and strategies to further improve the role of these <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> are highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Présentation de l'éditeur : There {{are more}} than 400 million draught animals in the world. They {{significantly}} improve working conditions on smallholdings, provide for greater efficiency and productivity, and increase agricultural output. In less developed countries, much of the energy used to till the soil is provided by human manual labour. Animals complement other power sources. Draught animals are of considerable benefit {{as a source of}} appropriate renewable energy {{in a world in which}} fuel prices continue to rise. Animal power for agriculture and transport can contribute directly to poverty elimination and wealth creation. Animal traction is increasing and diversifying in many countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and the Pacific, providing increasing opportunities for environmentally friendly economic development. This book reviews and builds upon previous experience and presents many long-standing and well-proven technologies. It also includes analyses of recent experiences relating to agricultural extension, animal welfare and non-governmental organisation (NGO) activities. It covers types of <b>working</b> <b>animals,</b> training, nutrition, welfare, housing and health, with detailed practical advice on harnesses and yokes, agricultural implements and modes of transport. It also deals with using <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> for soil management and the wider benefits associated with draught animals. Contents: 1. Working animals in the world. 2.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of horse remains in human settlements in regions {{where they had}} not previously been present is another indicator of domestication. Although images of horses {{appear as early as}} the Upper Paleolithic period in places such as the caves of Lascaux, France, suggesting that wild horses lived in regions outside of the Eurasian steppes prior to domestication and may have even been hunted by early humans, concentration of remains suggests animals being deliberately captured and contained, an indicator of domestication, at least for food, if not necessarily use as a <b>working</b> <b>animal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The donkey or ass (Equus africanus asinus) is a domesticated {{member of}} the horse family, Equidae. The wild {{ancestor}} of the donkey is the African wild ass, E. africanus. The donkey {{has been used as}} a <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> for at least 5000 years. There are more than 40 million donkeys in the world, mostly in underdeveloped countries, where they are used principally as draught or pack animals. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Small numbers of donkeys are kept for breeding or as pets in developed countries.|$|E
25|$|The donkey {{has been}} used as a <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> for at least 5000 years. Of the more than 40 million donkeys in the world, about 96% are in {{underdeveloped}} countries, where they are used principally as pack animals or for draught work in transport or agriculture. After human labour, the donkey is the cheapest form of agricultural power. They may also be ridden, or used for threshing, raising water, milling and other work. Working donkeys are often associated with those living at or below subsistence levels. Some cultures that prohibit women from working with oxen in agriculture do not extend this taboo to donkeys, allowing them to be used by both sexes.|$|E

50|$|In {{respect to}} pasture access, the Regulament divided peasants into three wealth-based categories: fruntași ("foremost people"), who, by definition, owned 4 <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> {{and one or}} more cows (allowed to use around 4 {{hectares}} of pasture); mijlocași ("middle people") - two <b>working</b> <b>animals</b> and one cow (around 2 hectares); codași ("backward people") - people who owned no property, and not allowed the use of pastures.|$|R

25|$|People who are {{unfamiliar}} with horses may confuse an adult pony with a young, immature horse. While foals that {{will grow up}} to be horse-sized may be no taller than some ponies in their first months of life, their body proportions are very different. A pony can be ridden and put to work, while a foal is too young to be ridden or used as a <b>working</b> <b>animal.</b> Foals, whether they {{grow up to be}} horse or pony-sized, can be distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs and slim bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Furthermore, in most cases, nursing foals will be in very close proximity to a mare who is the mother (dam) of the foal. While ponies exhibit some neoteny with the wide foreheads and small size, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse.|$|E
2500|$|A pet or {{companion}} animal is an animal kept primarily for a person's company, protection, or entertainment {{rather than as}} a <b>working</b> <b>animal,</b> livestock, or laboratory animal.

2500|$|A gelding is a {{castrated}} horse {{or other}} equine, {{such as a}} donkey or a mule. Castration, {{as well as the}} elimination of hormonally-driven behavior associated with a stallion, allows a male horse to be calmer and better-behaved, making the animal quieter, gentler and potentially more suitable as an everyday <b>working</b> <b>animal.</b> [...] The gerund and participle [...] "gelding" [...] and the infinitive [...] "to geld" [...] refer to the castration procedure itself.|$|E

2500|$|The Dartmoor pony is a horse breed {{that has}} lived in south western England for centuries and is used {{for a variety of}} disciplines. Because of the extreme weather {{conditions}} experienced on the moors, the Dartmoor is a particularly hardy breed with excellent stamina.

2500|$|During {{the early}} nineteenth century, the draft horse became the primary <b>working</b> <b>animal</b> in the farming areas of Northern Scotland, {{replacing}} oxen in the hinterland of Aberdeen and the Moray Firth and ponies in Caithness and Orkney. As a result, the ability to raise and control these animals became a valued skill and people possessing this ability were in high demand. This created a desirable form of well paid and respectable work. The historian Timothy Neat characterised the horsemen as being largely [...] "serious, practical men", while according to the esoteric publisher Ben Fernee, [...] "unmarried ploughmen lived hard lives, drank hard, played rough and chased women." ...|$|E
