40|$|The article {{examines}} the jurisdictional <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> international development banks (IDB’s) that have their seat in the United States of America. The terms of agreement of these institutions include a clause <b>of</b> <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> for any acts performed in the international financial markets. This broad waiver constitutes a special clause {{in regard to the}} general regime <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> <b>of</b> international organizations, that grants protection for all acts performed in the exercise of their statutory functions. Before this legal background, this article analyzes the case-law of the U. S. courts when applying the <b>waiver</b> clauses <b>of</b> the IDB’s terms of agreement. The study of this case-law allows for affirming that U. S. courts do not interpret the clauses in accordance with relevant norms of treaty interpretation. Instead these courts follow strictly the restrictive criteria for <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> set forth by the Department of State, thus blurring the separation of powers between the executive and the judicial branches, {{while at the same time}} not applying with precision the IDB’s terms of agreement.

50|$|The United States has waived {{sovereign}} immunity {{to a limited}} extent, mainly through the Federal Tort Claims Act, which waives the immunity if a tortious act of a federal employee causes damage, and the Tucker Act, which waives the immunity over claims arising out of contracts to which {{the federal government is}} a party.

Finally, Part IV exalts the continuing value of holding government accountable for its tortious conduct, treating such accountability as a legitimate means to encourage responsible government and achieve individual justice.

40|$|<b>Waiver</b> <b>of</b> State <b>Immunity</b> from Measures <b>of</b> Constraint and Access to Justice in Some Recent Judgments of the French Cour de Cassation. The French Supreme Court {{in three}} recent {{judgments}} of 28 March 2013 has interpreted restrictively {{the rules of}} general international law concerning <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> State <b>immunity</b> from measures <b>of</b> constraint. Assuming that those rules were to be considered as mirrored by {{the provisions of the}} United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional <b>Immunities</b> <b>of</b> States and Their Property adopted on 2 December 2004, which is not yet in force, and providing a particularly narrow reading of the relevant rules which is not supported by a consistent State practice, the Cour de cassation considered a general <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> from execution, as contained in contracts for the issue of Argentine bonds subscribed by private investors, as inapplicable in respect of property of a foreign State to be used for governmental purposes, absent a specific mention of such property within the waiver clause. In extending to any category of State property to be used for governmental purposes a rule which is generally observed only in respect of specific categories of property, such as property pertaining to diplomatic or consular missions and military assets, the French Supreme Court unduly extended the scope <b>of</b> State <b>immunity</b> from measures <b>of</b> constraint, thereby facing the risk of having France being held liable for a violation of the right of access to a court, as guaranteed by Article 6, par. 1, European Convention of Human Rights. Pursuant to the consistent case law of the European Court of Human Rights, such a right, which extends to post-judgment enforcement measures and up to a certain extent can be considered likely to extend to pre-judgment measures of constraint as well, may suffer limitations which, as concerns State immunity, are to be considered as proportionate only insofar as they reflect the existing rules of customary international law...|$|R

With the <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity,</b> sovereign debtors who already face severe disruption from short-term creditors grabbing their currency reserves are also exposed to litigious creditors trying to seize what assets they can in a ‘race of the vultures’. Shielding sovereign debtors from inter-creditor conflict by authorised standstills on payments doubt-less runs some risk of debtor’s moral hazard. But the lack of an orderly procedure for resolving sovereign liquidity crises means that the IMF is de facto forced to bail out countries in trouble.

40|$|Embassy bank {{accounts}} {{are among the}} properties of statesmost widely presentin foreign states. Accordingly, they constitute an ideal target for attachment by creditors. International instruments have largely upheld state immunity from execution regarding {{bank accounts}}, however. Likewise, state practice largely – and apparently increasingly – supports state <b>immunity</b> from measures <b>of</b> attachment, by applying a presumption that funds in embassy bank accounts are used for governmental non-commercial purposes. This approach is overly deferential to the state. Instead, {{it is argued that}} domestic courts should require that the state, at least partially, discharge the burden of proof regarding the nature (commercial/sovereign) of the funds in the bank account. A failure to discharge this burden should result in a rejection <b>of</b> <b>immunity.</b> Only such an approach adequately balances the interests of states and creditors, and does sufficient justice to the creditor’s right of access to a court. In addition, it is argued that such a balance is also brought about by construing literally general <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> from attachment, as not requiring an additional specific waiver regarding embassy bank accounts...|$|R

40|$|A very {{important}} judicial divide has begun {{in regards to}} Indian tribal sovereign immunity under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (hereafter 2 ̆ 2 IGRA 2 ̆ 2). The point of debate between these courts is whether IGRA permits an Indian tribe and state to negotiate a <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> the tribe 2 ̆ 7 s sovereign immunity to allow for personal injury suits by visitors to tribal gaming facilities. Such debate includes an all important jurisdictional component, as these courts further disagree about whether this waiver can include state court jurisdiction over such personal injury suits brought against the Indian tribe. The stakes in this debate are enormous, including everything from Indian tribal autonomy and the hope for self-sufficiency through the opportunities that gaming provides, to the personal safety of millions of gaming visitors and {{an opportunity for a}} meaningful remedy in the case of injury. The economic ramifications for Indian tribes number in the billions, with the conclusion of this debate potentially giving states the power to hold such vast sums of money for ransom in exchange for a <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> such tribal <b>immunity.</b> This article will analyze the cases which comprise this growing divide along with the relevant portions of IGRA and its legislative history which must form the basis of a conclusion on this very significant legal question. Such analysis of IGRA and its legislative history, when considered in relation to well established presumptions favoring the protection of Indian tribal sovereign immunity, will provide the conclusion that IGRA cannot be interpreted to allow an Indian tribe and state to negotiate a <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> and jurisdiction regarding personal injury suits against the tribe...|$|R
