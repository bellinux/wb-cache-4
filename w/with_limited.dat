5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design <b>with</b> <b>limited</b> radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965.

Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont.
