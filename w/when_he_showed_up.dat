In turn, when Fulgencio Batista was in power, Trujillo initially supported anti-Batista supporters of Carlos Prío Socarrás in Oriente Province in 1955, however weapons Trujillo sent were soon inherited by Fidel Castro's insurgents when Prío allied with Castro. After 1956, when Trujillo saw that Castro was gaining ground, he started to support Batista with money, planes, equipment, and men.

2500|$|As part of {{the treaty}} signed by the Portuguese and King Chambanga, the King had agreed to provide {{one of his sons}} to the Jesuits so they could take him back to Goa, where he would be taught Catholicism, as well as about [...] "the customs and grandeur" [...] of the Portuguese. Unfortunately, within 6 weeks of the arrival of the Portuguese, what had begun so well {{deteriorated}} rapidly as Captain da Costa and the Jesuit priests became increasingly frustrated over King Chambanga's unwillingness to give them his son as he had agreed to in the treaty he'd signed. Chambanga did offer to provide them with a younger, more distant relative instead, but Captain de Costa felt this was an [...] "affront" [...] to Portuguese [...] "honor and name" [...] and ordered his crew to go get Chambanga's 12-year-old son, Andriandramaka (Drian-Ramaka), and bring him aboard his ship, using force if necessary. According to Larson (2007), it was only {{at this point in time}} when the Jesuits started to blame King Chambanga for having killed at least a [...] "third" [...] of the Portuguese who had been shipwrecked in Anosy in the previous century. Chambanga's response was to deny he had killed any Europeans or that he'd agreed to send his son with the Portuguese. Captain de Costa then had his soldiers and sailors seize Drian-Ramaka <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> with his father at Ranofotsy bay and they rowed him out to their ship. Chambanga first had his soldiers try to attack the ship, but when they were driven back by cannon and musket shots fired from the ship, he tried to pay a ransom for him, but the Portuguese refused this as well, shouting towards shore they'd return his son in several years, once he had completed his religious studies in Goa.

2500|$|Lewis {{returned}} to the pop charts with [...] "Me and Bobby McGee" [...] in 1971 and [...] "Chantilly Lace" [...] in 1972, and this turn of events, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage rock and roll, inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of gifted British and Irish musicians, including Rory Gallagher, Kenney Jones, and Albert Lee. [...] By all accounts the sessions were tense. [...] The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut [...] "Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee" [...] would be the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the Billboard country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. [...] The Session would be Lewis's highest pop charting album since 1964's Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis, hitting number 37. [...] It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. [...] Later that same year, he went to Memphis and recorded , a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. [...] According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, [...] "the Killer" [...] was in a foul mood <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> at Trans Maximus Studios in Memphis to record: [...] "During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog." [...] During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue Southern Roots: The Original Sessions, Meaux asks Lewis, [...] "Do you wanna try one?", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies [...] "If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it." [...] Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. [...] His last big hit with Mercury was [...] "Middle Age Crazy," [...] which made it to number 4 in 1977.|$|E
