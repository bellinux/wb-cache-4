40|$|Nowadays many {{students}} from Universities, High Schools, Elementary Schools and even professionals have been frustrated {{when they tried}} to learn English for this reason <b>they</b> don <b>t</b> want to listen to anything that relates with English and it is due to the way that their teachers taught them in the first basic grade, their teachers didn t motivate them to learn English or didn t apply the correct methodologies or techniques. One of the most important aspects in teaching children to foreign language is motivation, because <b>they</b> don <b>t</b> know what it is, what it is for, why learn it, so the teacher must find the ways how to teach them. Everybody has the wrong idea that the new teachers must teach the lower grades because <b>they</b> aren <b>t</b> difficult to teach, but if we analyze it we can conclude that if the best teachers or the most experts taught kinder or garden students, <b>they</b> <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> hate to learn English like nowadays happens...|$|R

40|$|The {{past twenty}} years have seen the communitarian system of multi level {{governance}} (MLG) being established {{as a model of}} territorial policies governance. In the MLG, several levels of jurisdiction participate to decision making and Regions assume a relevant role in managing policies of development. This article highlights how such a system, mostly led by Public Institutions, cuts transaction costs being based on principles aimed at increasing the number of decision makers, as well as at making all governing levels and the processes of institutional coordination more effective. The article investigates two issues: a) to what extent the reorganization of the Italian system is compatible with the main characteristics of Communitarian MLG system in the governance of territorial policies; b) to what extent the decentralization in programming policies of development has gone with a transfer of capital expenses from a central (Central Administration) to local (Regional and Local Bodies) jurisdictions. The hypotheses to be tested refer to the decentralization process so far recorded in Italy: the first hypothesis is that such a process would not be fully shareable, neither with regard to the characteristics of the Communitarian MLG model, nor to the general considerations deriving by the theory of fiscal federalism; secondly, the process <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> seem suitably supported by a symmetrical transfer of the expenses from the Central Government s jurisdiction to local bodies. bagarani@unimol. i...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{you will}} already know {{the story about the}} four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and Nobody, but it is so illustrative of the need for this super new book that it is worth telling again. The story goes like this. There was an {{important}} job to be done and Everybody was sure that Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that, because it was Everybody s job. Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realised that Everybody <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> do it. It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done. In short, getting organised, teamwork, planning and joint decision-making are so important in strengthening local governance, eradicating poverty and building self-reliance and yet so difficult to achieve. This practical step-by-step and exercise-by-exercise field manual inspired by Zimbabwean realities could be a useful tool for this.

40|$|Around 2. 4 {{million people}} in the {{mountain}} areas of Papua New Guinea depend on subsistence farming. For a long time this way of farming has been avoided, and sometimes derided, by many authorities and developers worldwide. Shifting cultivation and slash and burn techniques, in combination with population pressure, was leading to deforestation and soil degradation. The general belief was that investing in such a farming system <b>wouldn</b> <b>t</b> get us anywhere. Not so, say the authors of Subsistence agriculture improvement, whose practical manual has won many admirers since it was published 10 years ago. Now available to CTA s subscribers, it offers a worthy collection of ways to improve subsistence farming. It explains how to build an A-frame for making terraces and contour-ridges and how to recognise zinc deficiency in citrus, beans and potatoes. In between it provides information about composting, crafting, drying, cooking, planting and protecting. In addition it contains a section on commonly known plants for the mid-mountain subsistence garden. All in all, a manual useful for other tropical mountainous areas as well. Finally, Sally Shaw did a great job with the many attractive, clear and clarifying illustrations. Subsistence Agriculture Improvement.
