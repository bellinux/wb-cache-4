The present-day use of Western blot (immunoblot) technology for the diagnosis of retroviruses prompted the development and evaluation of a <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> with whole-cell T. pallidum as the antigen. The assay detected antibodies in syphilitic serum or plasma from dilutions of specimens incubated overnight with test strips. A test was considered positive when at least three of four major antigens having molecular masses of 15. 5, 17, 44. 5, and 47 kDa were detected. The <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> had 93. 8 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for clinically defined samples. The <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> was compared with double-staining fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS (DS) ], which had a sensitivity and a specificity of 91. 7 and 92. 0 %, respectively. Dilution series studies of syphilis-positive specimens indicated that the <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> has an endpoint of reactivity at least 3 to 4 serial dilutions greater than that for FTA-ABS (DS). Overall, the greater than 95 % agreement between the <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> and FTA-ABS (DS) for clinically defined specimens indicates that the sensitivity of the <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> is equal to or greater than that of FTA-ABS (DS).

We {{carried out a}} retrospective serological survey of SIV infection from both wild and captive Sykes' monkeys from Kenya. We compared two commercially available, cross-reactive ELISA tests using HIV antigens with a novel SIVsyk antigen-specific <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> and analyzed the data by origin, subspecies, age and sex. Results The SIVsyk antigen-specific <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> detected more serum samples as positive than either of the cross-reactive ELISA assays. Using this assay, we found that seroprevalence is higher than previously reported, but extremely variable in wild populations (from 0. 0 to 90. 9 %). Females were infected more often than males in both wild and captive populations. Seropositive infants were common. However, no seropositive juveniles were identified. Conclusion We have developed a specific and sensitive <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay</b> for anti-SIVsyk antibody detection. Sykes' monkeys are commonly infected with SIVsyk, but with extremely variable prevalence in the wild. Higher infection prevalence in females suggests predominantly sexual transmission. High infection prevalence in infants, but none in juveniles, suggests maternal antibodies, but little or no vertical transmission. </p...|$|E

Subcellular localization was assessed by <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assays</b> of the cytosolic and membrane fractions of different cell populations studied: (1) spleen mononuclear cells, (2) T cell-enriched, (3) B cell- and M-enriched populations, and (4) peritoneal cells, processed in the presence of lactose. In broad agreement with immunocytochemical studies of nonpermeabilized and permeabilized cells, <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assays</b> suggest that this protein is localized mainly in the cytoplasmic compartment but also associated with the cell surface. By flow cytometric analyses we detected about a 14 % of ED! double-positive cells corresponding to M 4 s that constitutively express this galectin-like protein associated with their cell surface. The cytosolic fraction obtained from the M 4 -enriched cell population showed hemagglutinating activity specilhcally inhibited by-galactoside-related sugars. Moreover, this galectin-like protein was retained in a lactosyl-Sepharose matrix and specifically eluted with lactose. In this work, evidence is also provided to show that different stimuli are able to modulate the expression of the galectin-like protein. Expression was upregulated in inflammatory and activated M 4 s, revealing a significant increase in phorbol ester-and formylmethionine oligopeptide-treated cells.

Microfluidic implementation of electrophoretic separations reduces sample and reagent consumption and offers seamless integration of multiple functionalities. This dissertation reports the application and optimization of photopatterned polyacrylamide gels to improve the effectiveness of electrophoretic separations in microfluidic devices. Specifically, we demonstrate microfluidic implementation of two assays for protein analysis: a homogeneous immunoassay to quantify protein biomarker concentrations and a <b>western</b> <b>blotting</b> <b>assay</b> to report protein sizes and antibody-binding characteristics. To realize efficient homogeneous electrophoretic immunoassays, we optimize photopatterned polyacrylamide gels that enable quantitative assay completion in separation lengths as short as 350 um in < 10 s. The demonstrated separation length is {{an order of magnitude}} shorter than the separation length previously reported for on-chip gel electrophoresis and two orders of magnitude shorter than that achieved using capillary electrophoresis. The required separation lengths translate to less than 3. 5 V for assay operation as compared to hundreds and thousands of volts currently in use for homogeneous immunoassays. A discontinuous gel sieving matrix architecture introduced in our work forms a key step towards realizing battery-operated electrophoresis systems for quantitation of protein biomarkers in near-patient environments. In our implementation of microfluidic <b>western</b> <b>blotting</b> <b>assay,</b> we developed a novel strategy for on-chip protein renaturation which utilizes electrophoretic separations to isolate denaturing detergents from proteins. Furthermore, photopatterning of polyacrylamide gels within a 2 D chamber enables seamless integration of protein renaturation with upstream sizing and downstream immunoaffinity recognition.

Testicular NO synthase (NOS) activity, assessed by measuring the synthesis of 3 H-L-citrulline from 3 H-L-arginine, and cytokine-inducible NO synthase (iNOS) levels, assessed by <b>western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay,</b> were increased significantly by 90 % and 70 %, respectively, in the old rats compared to that of young animals. Immunohistochemical analysis of age-related changes in the expression of iNOS in testes confirmed our findings based on <b>western</b> <b>blot</b> <b>assay.</b> Increased NO and germ-cell apoptosis during aging is further associated with cytosolic translocation of mitochondrial cytochrome c and poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, thus, suggesting the involvement of NO-mediated intrinsic pathway signaling in age-related increase in germ-cell apoptosis in male Brown-Norway rats. THE signaling events leading to caspase activation andapoptosis in mammalian cells can be divided into two principal pathways involving either mitochondria (intrinsic) or death receptors (extrinsic) (1 – 3).

40|$|Abstract Background The MEK-ERK {{signaling}} pathway and autophagy {{play an important}} role for enterovirus 71 (EV 71) replication. Inhibition of MEK-ERK {{signaling pathway}} and autophagy is shown to impair EV 71 replication. Berberine (BBR), an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from Berberis vulgaris L., has been reported to have ability to regulate this signaling pathway and autophagy. Herein, we want to determine whether berberine can inhibit EV 71 infection by downregulating the MEK/ERK signaling pathway and autophagy. Methods The antiviral effect of berberine was determined by cytopathic effect (CPE) <b>assay,</b> <b>western</b> <b>blotting</b> <b>assay</b> and qRT-PCR assay. The mechanism of BBR anti-virus was determined by <b>western</b> <b>blotting</b> <b>assay</b> and immunofluorescence assay. Results We showed that berberine does-dependently reduced EV 71 RNA and protein synthesis, which was, at least in part, the result of inhibition of activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Furthermore, we found that berberine suppressed the EV 71 -induced autophagy by activating AKT protein and inhibiting the phosphorylation of JNK and PI 3 KIII. Conclusions BBR inhibited EV 71 replication by downregulating autophagy and MEK/ERK signaling pathway. These findings suggest that BBR may be a potential agent or supplement against EV 71 infection...|$|R
