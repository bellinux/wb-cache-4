25|$|A fishing rod's main {{function}} is to bend and deliver a certain resistance or power: While casting, the rod acts as a catapult: by moving the rod forward, the inertia {{of the mass of}} the bait or lure and rod itself, will load (bend) the rod and launch the lure or bait. When a bite is registered and the fisherman strikes, the bending of the rod will dampen the strike to avoid line failure. When fighting a fish, the bending of the rod not only enables the fisherman to keep the line under tension, but the bending of the rod will also keep the fish under a constant pressure which will exhaust the fish and enable the fisherman to actually catch the fish. Also the bending lessens the effect of the leverage by shortening the distance of the lever (the rod). A stiff rod <b>will</b> <b>demand</b> lots of power of the fisherman, while actually less power is put on the fish. In comparison, a deep bending rod <b>will</b> <b>demand</b> less power from the fisherman, but deliver more fighting power to the fish. In practice, this leverage effect often misleads fisherman. Often it is believed that a hard, stiff rod puts more control and power on the fish to fight, while it is actually the fish who is putting the power on the fisherman. In commercial fishing practice, big and strong fish are often just pulled in on the line itself without much effort, which is possible because the absence of the leverage effect.|$|E

25|$|The Escort quest is a {{combination}} of slaying monsters to maintain the well-being of a non-player character (NPC), while exploring an area alongside that NPC. A typical escort quest would involve protecting a character as he or she moves through a monster-infested area. A majority of the time, the quest <b>will</b> <b>demand</b> the player to slay multiple monsters {{to ensure the safety of}} the NPC. Escort quests can be beneficial, forcing the player's to focus on a particular area, in order to play out a scene or reveal a section of the plot. Escort quests can also be used to funnel a character from one location to another, leading the player along a route or path. However, problems with this type of quest can occur if the artificial intelligence controlling the NPC causes the NPC to behave in unexpected or unmanageable ways. Because many escort quests are often perceived as being done wrong, they are very unpopular amongst the gaming community.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{international}} movement was, for {{the most}} part, strictly controlled, there was a steady loss through escapees {{who were able to}} use ingenious methods to evade frontier security. In East Germany, the term Republikflucht (fugitives from the Republic) was used for anyone wishing to leave to non-socialist countries. Republikflucht attempts to leave East Germany constituted a criminal act and carried severe penalties. Regarding the reasoning for such restrictions, a propaganda booklet published by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1955 for the use of party agitators outlined the seriousness of 'flight from the republic', stating [...] "leaving the GDR is an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity", and [...] "workers throughout Germany <b>will</b> <b>demand</b> punishment for those who today leave the German Democratic Republic, the strong bastion of the fight for peace, to serve the deadly enemy of the German people, the imperialists and militarists".

2500|$|It {{can also}} be argued that in a democracy, because the {{government}} is the party performing the act of imposing taxes, {{society as a whole}} decides how the tax system should be organized. The American Revolution's [...] "No taxation without representation" [...] slogan implied this view. For traditional conservatives, the payment of taxation is justified as part of the general obligations of citizens to obey the law and support established institutions. The conservative position is encapsulated in perhaps the most famous adage of public finance, [...] "An old tax is a good tax". Conservatives advocate the [...] "fundamental conservative premise that no one should be excused from paying for government, lest they come to believe that government is costless to them with the certain consequence that they <b>will</b> <b>demand</b> more government 'services'." [...] Social democrats generally favor higher levels of taxation to fund public provision {{of a wide range of}} services such as universal health care and education, as well as the provision of a range of welfare benefits. As argued by Tony Crosland and others, the capacity to tax income from capital is a central element of the social democratic case for a mixed economy as against Marxist arguments for comprehensive public ownership of capital.
