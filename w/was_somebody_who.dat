500|$|Hochuli {{was born}} on December 25, 1950, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and lived there until age eight before {{his family moved to}} Tucson, Arizona. He was the second child of six. He {{attended}} and later graduated from Canyon del Oro High School in the Tucson suburb of Oro Valley, Arizona in 1969. During his high school years, he participated in football (earning all-state honors twice), basketball, wrestling, and track. He attributes his competitive nature to having an older brother, Chip Hochuli. Ed Hochuli told Referee in a 2004 interview, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> wanted to be good and I wanted my brother to be proud of me, and I wanted my parents to be proud of me." [...] Following high school, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree with honors from UTEP in 1972. [...] While at UTEP, Hochuli played linebacker on the school's football team from 1969 to 1972. As a football player, he earned All-Western Athletic Conference academic honors in 1972. His father, Walter Hochuli, was involved with law as a wills and estate planner, which influenced Ed Hochuli to pursue a career in law. [...] He earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Arizona Law School in 1976. [...] While in law school, Hochuli served as a law clerk for two years under United States District Judge Carl Muecke. Upon completion of his education, Hochuli was admitted to the State Bar of Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|In {{one of his}} {{anonymous}} {{pieces for}} it, Beidas called upon the fathers of his society to prepare their children towards the 'age of freedom' (al-hurriyya), one where the free man <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> could make his own law (shar’ia) and guide himself (qiyadat nafsibi). Soon afterwards, in 1911, production was relocated to Jerusalem, where it was published on the printing presses of the Syrian Orphanage (Dar al-Aytam) in Jerusalem, founded by [...] (1820–1896).|$|E
2500|$|The website BuzzFeed {{interviewed a}} man named Ray, who {{was a friend of}} Mess and an {{acquaintance}} of Tsarnaev. Ray said: Tam wasn't there at the memorial service, he wasn't at the funeral, he wasn't around at all... And he was really close with Brendan. That's why it's so weird when he said, 'I don't have any American friends.' Ray continued: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was in contact with Brendan on a daily basis. Anybody like that you would think they would have been around." [...] Ray did not have any further contact with Tsarnaev after the murders.|$|E

2500|$|Assemblyman Bob L. Beers {{said that}} [...] "A brothel owner <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who,</b> {{when it gets}} down to the very essence, {{is nothing more than}} a slave-owner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw! {{perhaps it}} <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> {{was trying to}} spy on us," [...] put in Fred. [...] "If we tell the captain we will only be exposing ourselves, and I guess you all know what that means." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{doctor had}} arrived at eight o'clock, cheery as ever, and had come downstairs after seeing Ruth {{to ask him to}} {{telephone}} to Mrs. Porter. In his overwrought state, this had jarred upon Kirk. Here, he felt, <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> could help where he was useless.|$|E
60|$|It is not {{too much}} to say that he reeled before Joan's smile. It was so entirely unexpected. He {{clutched}} Mr. Peters' steamer trunk in his emotion. All his resolutions to be cold and distant were swept away. He had the feeling that in a friendless universe here <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was fond of him and glad to see him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you {{for saying}} that, Laura," [...] he returned, with much emotion. [...] "It's {{nice to know}} that there <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> won't go back on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|She bent {{her head}} in silent {{acknowledgment}} that it was so. Lady Janet pointed to Horace: [...] "Here <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> has <b>been</b> longing to see you, Grace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It must be Lane's last throw," [...] said Haldane quietly. [...] "Ah! The tide is turning. There <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> doesn't {{belong to}} us making {{a deal with}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very foolish of me, was it not? But {{there is}} no reason for such {{surprise}} that I should desire it; and I promptly discovered my folly. I also gathered there <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> might please her better. Now you have the simple fact, but as there is an inference you must listen still. How could I have guessed the truth--after what I saw at the Hallows Brig? It appeared impossible to me that any man who had won Miss Chatterton's approval could find pleasure in----" ...|$|E
60|$|With Mike it was different. There was no pitying {{smile on}} Adair's {{face as he}} started his run preparatory to sending down the first ball. Mike, on the cricket field, could not have looked {{anything}} but a cricketer if he had turned out in a tweed suit and hobnail boots. Cricketer was written all over him--in his walk, {{in the way he}} took guard, in his stand at the wicket. Adair started to bowl with the feeling that this <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> had more than a little knowledge of how to deal with good bowling and punish bad.|$|E
60|$|The {{person was}} {{obviously}} not the steward: he was still busy. It <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who,</b> since the light had been extinguished, had {{taken advantage of the}} gloom, to come from some dark recess in the brewhouse and stand upon the brickwork of the copper. The fear which had at first paralyzed her lessened with the birth of a sense that fear now was utter failure: she was in a desperate position and must abide by the consequences. The motionless person on the copper was, equally with Manston, quite unconscious of her proximity, and she ventured to advance her hand again, feeling behind the feet, till she found the key. On its return to her side, her finger-tip skimmed the lower verge of a trousers-leg.|$|E
50|$|Related {{terminology}} {{comes from}} the Portuguese language. A churrasqueiro <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> cooks churrasco style food in a churrascaria restaurant. A churrasqueira is a barbecue grill used for this style of cooking.|$|R
5000|$|... "If apioneer <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> breaks {{new ground}} {{and makes it}} easier forothers to go ahead, then I’m proud {{to be called a}} pioneer." [...] Suzanne Jenniches, on being labeled a pioneer.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variant of}} the aphorism replaces the last line with: [...] "To a Vermonter, a Yankee <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> still uses an outhouse". There are several other folk and humorous etymologies for the term.|$|R
60|$|He {{fingered the}} {{instruments}} and the control, half hoping and half fearing {{that he would}} alight upon the combination that would put the machine in flight. Often had he watched the British air-men soaring above the German lines and it looked so simple he was quite sure {{that he could do}} it himself if there <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> could but once show him how. There was, of course, always the hope that the white man who came in the machine and who had escaped from Numabo's village might fall into Usanga's hands and then indeed would he be able to learn how to fly. It was in this hope that Usanga spent so much time {{in the vicinity of the}} plane, reasoning as he did that eventually the white man would return in search of it.|$|E
6000|$|Razumov {{looked up}} amazed. The journey was decided--unavoidable. He had fixed {{the next day}} for his {{departure}} on the mission. And now he discovered suddenly {{that he had not}} believed in it. He had gone about listening, speaking, thinking, planning his simulated flight, with the growing conviction that all this was preposterous. As if anybody ever did such things! It was like a game of make-believe. And now he was amazed! Here <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> believed in it with desperate earnestness. [...] "If I don't go now, at once," [...] thought Razumov, with a start of fear, [...] "I shall never go." [...] He rose without a word, and the anxious Kostia thrust his cap on him, helped him into his cloak, or else he would have left the room bareheaded as he stood. He was walking out silently when a sharp cry arrested him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all,' Hilda {{answered}} {{in a tone of}} supreme conviction. 'I'm in favour of simply cutting our heads off once for all, and making our families pay all arrears of rent from the very beginning. That or nothing. Put the case another way. Suppose, Mr. Le Breton, there <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> had got a grant from a king a long time ago, allowing him to hang any three persons he chose annually. Well, suppose this person and his descendants went on for a great many generations extorting money out of other people by threatening to kill them and letting them off on payment of a ransom. Suppose, too, they always killed three a year, some time or other, pour encourager les autres--just to show that they really meant it. Well, then, if one day the people grew wise enough to inquire into the right of these licensed extortioners to their black mail, would you say, [...] "Don't deprive them of it too unexpectedly. Let them keep it during their own lifetime. Let their children hang three of us annually after them. But let us get rid of this fine old national custom in the third generation." [...] Would that be fair to the people who would be hanged for the sake of old prescription in the interval, do you think?' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{sample in}} [...] "Loser Cop" [...] ("All we {{represent}} to them man, <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> needs a haircut") {{is taken from}} the 1969 movie Easy Rider and is spoken by actor Dennis Hopper.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is curious, but I {{have been}} haunted by {{a feeling that}} we have met before to-day," [...] she said. [...] "If I am mistaken, it must have <b>been</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> {{strongly}} resembles you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr Blair said: [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> did {{an immense}} amount for Birmingham. One {{of the reasons}} Birmingham is such a vibrant and {{thriving}} European city {{is because of the}} work Dick Knowles did.".|$|R
6000|$|... "Earth covers, Olympus" [...] (heaven? or the Muses' Hill?) [...] "holds him {{who was a}} Nestor in counsel; in poetic art, a Virgil; a Socrates for his Daemon" [...] ("Genius"). As for the [...] "Genius," [...] or daemon of Socrates, and the {{permitted}} false quantity {{in making}} the first syllable of Socrates short; {{and the use of}} Olympus for heaven in epitaphs, it is sufficient to consult the learning of Mr. Elton. {186b} The poet who made such notable false quantities in his plays had no cause to object to another on his monument. We do not know who erected the monument, and paid for it, or who wrote or adapted the epitaph; but it <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> thought Shakespeare (or Bacon?) [...] "a clayver man." [...] The monument (if a trembling conjecture may be humbly put forth) was conceivably erected by the piety of Shakespeare's daughter and son- in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Hall. They exhibit a taste for the mortuary memorial and the queer Latin inscription. Mrs. Hall gratified the Manes of her poor mother, Mrs. Shakespeare, with one of the oddest of Latin epitaphs. {187a} It opens like an epigram in the Greek Anthology, and ends in an unusual strain of Christian mysticism. Mr. Hall possesses, perhaps arranged for himself, a few Latin elegiacs as an epitaph.|$|E
60|$|He {{then said}} {{incidentally}} that since his voyage {{he had been}} in lodgings at Southampton, and during that time had become acquainted with a lovely and virtuous young maiden, in whom he found the exact qualities necessary to his happiness. Having known this lady for the full space of a fortnight he had had ample opportunities of studying her character, and, being struck with the recollection that, if there was one thing more than another necessary in a mill which had no mistress, it <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> could play that part with grace and dignity, he had asked Miss Matilda Johnson to be his wife. In her kindness she, though sacrificing far better prospects, had agreed; and he could not but regard it as a happy chance that he should have found at the nick of time such a woman to adorn his home, whose innocence was as stunning as her beauty. Without much ado, therefore, he and she had arranged to be married at once, and at Overcombe, that his father might not be deprived of the pleasures of the wedding feast. She had kindly consented to follow him by land {{in the course of a}} few days, and to live in the house as their guest for the week or so previous to the ceremony.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, it is {{understandable}} that the chosen one to replace Pere Monzó <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> had a similar academic qualification to be elected rector, and had the advantage of being a former student of the Jesuit School of Saint Paul.|$|E
30|$|This utility {{function}} {{has four main}} features. The first {{one is that the}} utility of a player increases as the material payoffs of the other members of her group increases. The second one is that the utility of a player increases when she <b>is</b> kind to <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> kind to her and when she <b>is</b> unkind to <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> unkind to her. The third one is that the utility of a player increases when she <b>is</b> kind to <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> kind to a third individual and when she <b>is</b> unkind to <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> unkind to a third individual (as long as she belong to her group). Finally, the utility of a player increases when she <b>is</b> kind to <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> belongs to a group where one member has been kind to a member of her own group and when she <b>is</b> unkind to <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> belongs to a group where a member has been unkind to a member of her own group.|$|R

5000|$|Aliyu Muktar, {{a former}} editor at Triumph {{newspaper}} who worked with Yusuf, said, [...] "She was for me a role model; an excellent career woman, very thorough and unassuming. You know, she was brave, sincere and always fighting for the downtrodden. You also know her antecedent; Hajia <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> would not tolerate injustice anywhere." ...|$|E
5000|$|However, {{ever since}} the release of The Singles with an extra DVD of the band's videos, the song has seen a new lease of life.

5000|$|... {{my record}} on child {{protection}} goes {{back a long}} way and it’ll continue. And if {{on the other hand}} the perception continued among the people that I <b>was</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> was complicit in all of this, then that would be a barrier in my ministry and I couldn’t even minister as a priest or a bishop if that were to continue.|$|E
2500|$|Meeting the US President at the Oval Office in the White House a day later, Barack Obama {{introduced}} him as [...] "one {{of the legendary}} figures of Asia in the 20th and 21st centuries. He <b>is</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> helped to trigger the Asian economic miracle." ...|$|R
