40|$|<b>Waterbound</b> <b>Macadam</b> (WM) layers {{were used}} {{extensively}} {{during the first}} half of the previous century and have been reintroduced in the 1980 ’s, focusing on re-engineering labour-intensive construction techniques during the 1990 ’s. In 1994 and 1995 the former Johannesburg Transitional Metropolitan Council (TMC) in consultation with AFRICON and the University of the Witwatersrand constructed two pilot projects in Johannesburg with a labour-based method utilising WM base courses. The design and construction of various WM roads in Soweto followed in 1996. The construction processes were monitored throughout and data collected to investigate certain technical issues; among them the in-situ WM properties, the construction tolerances and expected performance. Since that time, a number of WM projects followed towards the development of sound guidelines for the design and construction of these pavements. A case study was conducted in 2001 on eight of these <b>waterbound</b> <b>macadam</b> pavements to assess the in-service short-term performance, and re-visiting the expected structural capacity by applying state of the art techniques in the analysis of these layers. The investigation involved...|$|E
