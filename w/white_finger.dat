25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} fast as a petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration <b>white</b> <b>finger.</b> Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless for these kinds of application.|$|E

60|$|The Princess {{was already}} in the room, and {{following}} her a short man in a suit of sombre black, wearing a white tie, and carrying a black bowler hat.

Her hand was extended towards Dominey, but not in greeting. Her <b>white</b> <b>finger</b> pointed straight at him. She turned to her companion.|$|E

60|$|It was on Thursday {{evening that}} Cork's {{seclusion}} became intolerable to him. Never a hart panted for water fountain {{as he did}} for the cool touch of a drifting stein, for the firm security of a foot-rail {{in the hollow of}} his shoe and the quiet, hearty challenges of friendship and repartee along and across the shining bars. But he must avoid the district where he was known. The cops were looking for him everywhere, for news was scarce, and the newspapers were harping again on the failure of the police to suppress the gangs. If they got him before Corrigan came back, the big <b>white</b> <b>finger</b> could not be uplifted; it would be too late then. But Corrigan would be home the next day, so he felt sure there would be small danger in a little excursion that night among the crass pleasures that represented life to him.|$|E
6000|$|She rose mechanically, {{without a}} word, and motioning the groom {{to take the}} feet, she lifted Harry's head--her own husband's head--that drunken wretch's head--great heavens, which was it? and helped to lay him silently {{on the floor of}} the pony carriage. He was {{helpless}} and motionless as a baby. Her eyes were dry now, and she hardly even shuddered. She got into the carriage again, covered over the breathing mass of insensible humanity at the bottom with her light woollen wrapper, and drove on in perfect silence till she reached Peveril Court. As she drew up in front of the door, the evening was beginning to close in rapidly. The groom, still silent, jumped from the carriage, and ran up the steps with his usual drilled accuracy to ring the bell. Edie beckoned to him imperiously with her hand to stop and come back to her. He paused, and turned down the steps again to hear what she wished. Edie's lips were dry; she couldn't utter a word: but she pointed mutely to her husband's prostrate form, and the groom understood at once that she wished him to lift Harry out of the carriage. Hastily and furtively they carried him in at the library door--the first room inside the house--and there they laid him out upon the sofa, Edie putting one <b>white</b> <b>finger</b> passionately on her lip to enjoin silence. As soon as that was done, she sat down to the table with marvellous resolution, and wrote out a cheque for twenty pounds from her own cheque-book. Then at last she found speech with difficulty. [...] "William," [...] she said, her dry husky throat almost choking with the effort, [...] "take that, instead of notice. Go away at once--I'll drive you to the station--go to London, and never say a single word of this to any one." ...|$|E
