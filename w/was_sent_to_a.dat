5|$|After 10 days of {{questioning}} Winter {{was taken to}} Rennes, where he was joined three days later by Captain Burton, Hollings, and Orr. These three had managed to stay together when the boat was sunk, and were captured by a German parachute unit carrying out manoeuvres. Burton <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prisoner of war camp in Germany, Winter, Hollings and Orr were taken to Frankfurt and {{handed over to the}} Gestapo for further questioning, after which Winter <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prisoner of war camp at Memmingen. The fate of Hollings and Orr has never been established. Winter and a Special Air Service officer escaped from the camp in April 1945, disguised as French soldiers. Desgranges was also able to escape from captivity, travelling via Spain to Britain, where he joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE).|$|E

5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he slept in a crib in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large and aggressive adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal. He <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> California animal trainer.

5|$|Ramprasad {{was born}} in Halisahar, a village {{on the banks of}} the Ganges about thirty-five miles north of Kolkata, into a Tantric Vaidya family. Due to the absence of birth records, his actual birth date is not known, but it is {{believed}} to be around 1718 or 1723. His father, Ramram Sen, was an Ayurvedic doctor and Sanskrit scholar. Ramprasad's mother Siddheswari was Ramram's second wife. Ramprasad <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Sanskrit tol (school) where he learned Sanskrit grammar, literature, Persian, and Hindi. As a youth, he had a talent for poetry and learning new languages.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after his}} birth, in {{accordance}} with the traditions of the Quraysh, Khalid <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Bedouin tribe in the desert, where a foster mother nursed him and brought him up in the clear, dry and unpolluted air of the desert. At the age of five or six, he returned to his parents in Mecca. During his childhood Khalid suffered a mild attack of smallpox, which he survived, but it left some pockmarks on his left cheek.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} ten, Zita <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{boarding}} school at Zanberg in Upper Bavaria, {{where there was a}} strict regime of study and religious instruction. She was summoned home in the autumn of 1907 at the death of her father. Her maternal grandmother sent Zita and her sister Franziska to a convent on the Isle of Wight to complete her education. Brought up as devout Catholics, the Parma children regularly undertook good works for the poor. In Schwarzau the family turned surplus cloth into clothes. Zita and Franziska personally distributed food, clothing, and medicines to the needy in Pianore. Three of Zita's sisters became nuns and, for a time, she considered following the same path. Zita went through a patch of poor health and was sent for the traditional cure at a European spa for two years.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{childhood}} in London {{was one of}} poverty and hardship. As his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, he <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> workhouse twice {{before the age of}} nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. Chaplin was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. Chaplin directed his own films from an early stage and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, {{he was one of the}} best-known figures in the world.|$|E

5|$|Frank Williams was recaptured and <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new camp without news of Judy's survival. However, stories began {{being told}} of a dog helping {{drowning}} men reach pieces of debris on which to hold, and others recalled how the dog would bring them flotsam to keep them afloat. The dog would also allow men to hold onto her back while swimming them to safety. She {{had been found in}} the water by other survivors of the sinking, and once again hidden from the Japanese. Upon arrival at a dock, she was found by Les Searle who tried to smuggle her onto a truck with him. However, she was discovered by a Japanese Captain who threatened to kill her – whose order was countermanded by the newly arrived former Commander of the Medan camp and she was allowed to travel with Searle onto the new camp.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Parkinson {{was part}} of the Fiji Expeditionary Force. This was raised {{following}} a request from the Fijian government for military forces to support local police dealing with striking labourers and farmers. The force, numbering about 55 men and under the command of the then Major Edward Puttick, was based on Fiji for two months before returning home. Promoted to captain the following year, he spent two years in Dunedin instructing the Territorial Force artillery, before being posted to Auckland. There, {{he was in charge of}} harbour defences. In 1925, he <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gunnery course in England and, for the following two years, was seconded to the Royal Artillery. He returned to New Zealand in 1927, accompanied by his wife Barbara Waiohine Howe, who he had married in Birmingham on 30 August the previous year. A series of staff and instructional postings in Wellington, and then Auckland, followed. He was promoted to major in 1932.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Dangić {{ordered his}} forces to not resist German and NDH troops during the anti-Partisan {{offensive}} known as Operation Southeast Croatia. Afterwards, {{he was invited}} to Belgrade to negotiate the terms of proposed Chetnik collaboration with the Germans with Milan Nedić and General der Artillerie (lieutenant general) Paul Bader. Although a deal was struck, it was vetoed by the Wehrmacht Commander in Southeast Europe, General der Pioniere (lieutenant general) Walter Kuntze, who remained suspicious of Dangić. Despite this, Dangić's Chetniks collaborated with German forces in eastern Bosnia {{over a period of several}} months beginning in December 1941. In April, Dangić was arrested when he travelled to Serbia despite promising to operate only within the territory of Bosnia, and <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prisoner-of-war camp in German-occupied Poland. In 1943, he escaped from the camp and the following year participated in the Warsaw Uprising. In 1945, he was captured by the Red Army and was extradited to Yugoslavia, where he stood accused of committing war crimes. In 1947, he was tried, convicted, sentenced to death and executed by Yugoslavia's new Communist authorities.|$|E

5|$|John's son, King Henry III, {{assessed}} the carucage on three occasions, in 1217, 1220, and 1224. A new approach in 1217 and 1220 was {{to secure the}} consent of leading noblemen for the tax to be levied. The 1217 tax was once again assessed at 3shillings per carucate. The assessment {{of the amount of}} lands held by each taxpayer involved having each landowner provide the information and swear an oath that it was correct. Like the 1200 tax, the 1217 tax was not recorded in that year's Pipe Roll, lending support to the possibility that the revenue from the tax <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> separate branch of the Exchequer. The 1217 carucage was only paid by laymen; the clergy made a donation in lieu of being taxed. The money raised was intended to defray the expense of the war being fought against Prince Louis of France, who had invaded England before the death of King John and was claiming the English throne.|$|E
5|$|Lie and {{his family}} {{returned}} to Buitenzorg in 1866. At the time there were no schools offering a European-style education in the city, and thus he <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Chinese-run school. For three years, in which the youth studied under three different headmasters, he was made to repeat traditional Hokkien phrases and copy Chinese characters without understanding them. Tio suggests that Lie obtained little knowledge at the school, and until his death Lie was unable to understand Chinese. During his time in Buitenzorg, he studied painting under Raden Saleh, {{a friend of his}} father's. Although he reportedly showed skill, he did not continue the hobby as his mother disapproved. He also showed a propensity for traditional literary forms such as pantun (a form of poetry) and was fond of creating his own.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, he <b>was</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> field hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories {{for the loss of}} four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
