40|$|FY 2007 was a {{productive}} {{year for the}} Iowa Grape and Wine Development Commission. Fourteen proposals were recommended for funding totaling over 390, 000 in outlays. Included in the approved proposals were funds for the establishment and staffing of a Midwest Grape and Wine Institute at Iowa State University, a newly created viticulturist position at Des Moines Area Community College, funding for the first annual Mid-American Wine Competition, and marketing and promotion of four regional cooperative wine events and one wine trail. Commission funding supported a survey of commercial wine producers and grape growers and a new brochure on Iowa’s vineyards. A committee was formed to provide details for a Scholarship Program to aid vineyard and <b>winery</b> <b>staff</b> with the expenses of accredited coursework. Based on the survey conducted and from other governmental and industry sources, the Iowa grape and wine industry appears {{to continue to be}} very viable and growth continues at a strong pace. Wine produced in the state for 2007 was estimated at a market value in excess of 12. 3 million. A tabulation of the budget revealed that just over 800, 000 in wine gallonage tax appropriations have been received into the Grape and Wine Development Fund from 15 FY 2003 through FY 2007. Expenditures have totaled just over 607, 000 during that same time. Just over 80...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{research}} {{on the value of}} winery tasting rooms/cellar doors as an avenue for relationship building with consumers resulting in greater brand loyalty. This paper aims to examine the role of tasting rooms in this regard in an Australasian context. The research was exploratory, designed to explore a full range of visitors' experiences at the winery tasting room, using a modified form of mystery shopping combined with focus groups. Establishing brand loyalty through a winery tasting room experience requires more than just good wine or good service quality, rather it results from an experience which is personalised and which establishes an emotional connection between the visitor and the winery, their product and <b>winery</b> <b>staff.</b> Generally smaller wineries were making this emotional connection more effectively than larger wineries. By contrast, staff at small and larger wineries alike were making little effort to establish concrete links to instil brand loyalty with the wine tourist post-visit by encouraging repeat visitation or promoting their mailing lists or even eliciting wine sales. The research focused on {{a relatively small number of}} consumers in Australia and New Zealand and thus may not be immediately generalisable to other markets. The research highlights numerous areas for improvement in the organisation of tasting room encounters and the training of staff, noticeably with regards to making lasting connections with visitors resulting in future brand loyalty; issues which could be addressed by winery managers. The paper gives depth to results previously reported by researchers on the role of service provision at the tasting room to the overall winery experience, and adds perspectives on the effectiveness of efforts to establish brand loyalty and maintain post-visit contact with the winery visitor...|$|E
40|$|For {{small and}} medium sized wineries, setting up and {{operating}} a cellar door {{is an expensive}} proposition. These retail outlets are usually located on the winery property and for smaller <b>wineries,</b> <b>staffing</b> of the cellar door can be a major distraction from {{the operation of the}} winery itself. In addition to the cash flow generated by across the counter sales, an implicit reason given for these activities is brand building, both in terms of awareness and eventual repurchase of varieties of the brand. There is a view among some winery operators that their involvement in cellar door operations is purely {{for the benefit of the}} tourism industry and had little direct benefit on their own operations. This project sought to test this assertion by interviewing visitors to cellar doors in South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales and contacting them again five months later to see if their wine consumption behaviour had changed as a result of the cellar door visit...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – There {{are many}} factors which may {{influence}} the ability of wineries to build and maintain long-term relationships (LTR) with their suppliers of grapes. The aim {{of this paper is}} to identify the most important factors which enhance LTR between Australian wineries and grape growers. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative in-depth interview technique was employed with 13 Australian grape growers. Findings – The relational dimensions of communication, goal compatibility and use of power were found to influence the relationship quality dimensions of trust and satisfaction, which are also linked to the level of commitment and hence long-term relationship. Practical implications – The Australian wine industry is currently suffering economic instability which has resulted in the demise of some relationships between grape growers and winemakers. However, economic misfortunes will no doubt change and inefficiencies will result if LTR are not maintained. These inefficiencies could prove detrimental as the Australian wine industry strives to produce regionally branded and higher quality wine products which are both grape grower derived element. Furthermore, issues related to communication frequency and reduction in trust have implications for communication strategies which may result in the reduction of <b>winery</b> grower liaison <b>staff.</b> Originality/value – This paper offers a grape/grower-winery perspective on buyer-seller relationships. It moderates the theory on communication and its effect on trust and commitment. Furthermore it posits the issue of buyer size on relational dimension and outcomes, which has had little attention in the literature. Simon Somogyi, Amos Gyau, Elton Li and Johan Bruwe...|$|R
