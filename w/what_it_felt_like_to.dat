Bedier shared his views on <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a young Muslim in America after 9/11. This led to volunteer work with the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in public relations. In December 2003, when CAIR opened a Tampa office, Bedier became the director.|$|E

Psychiatrist Donald Lunde, who interviewed Kemper at length during adulthood, wrote that with these murders, [...] "In his way, [...] had avenged the rejection of both his father and his mother." [...] Kemper's crimes were deemed incomprehensible for a 15-year-old to commit, and court psychiatrists diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia before sending him to the criminally insane unit of the Atascadero State Hospital.|$|E

In 1966 the critic Frank Howes wrote that Elgar {{reflected}} the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but [...] "a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work. ... Elgar is historically important for giving to English music {{a sense of the}} orchestra, for expressing <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations." ...|$|E

[...] She {{went on to say that}} the film's frequent, often jarring shifts in tone were an intentional endorsement of Michael Bay's own filmmaking style. [...] "Tone is for single-purpose machines. Consistency is for Decepticons. Michael Bay's ideal movie shifts from action movie to teen comedy to political drama with the same well-lubricated ease that his cars become men. By the time you've finished watching, you will speak Michael Bay's cinematic language." ...|$|E

MacCaillech says of the initial idea, “I can’t say what inspired the “click” to connect, but that’s exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> was exciting, but also very focused and coordinated. Initially, we were brainstorming ways to collaborate on projects and funding; projects that had not only the potential to impact the clinics in our own states and communities - but every FWHC across the entire country.” Member clinics would be non-profit, independent, have a feminist philosophy and be committed to providing abortions.|$|R

However, the song was left on the cutting room floor. The Game also was working on the album for his inspiration goals about reviving <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be involved in this whole hip hop scene in the West Coast, which was overshadowed over these past few years by these artists between the East to the South. In 2005, in the interview with Vibe magazine, 50 Cent stated that he was brought in by the Interscope Records to work on the album, claiming that {{was on the verge of}} being shelved and The Game was being dropped from the label. However, in the interview with Funkmaster Flex, The Game said that his status was never uncertain that he would be dropped from the label. 50 Cent also claimed that he wrote six songs of The Documentarys eighteen tracks—"Hate It or Love It", [...] "How We Do", [...] "Church for Thugs", [...] "Special", [...] "Higher", and [...] "Westside Story"—and didn't receiving any proper credit for his work. The Game denied those claims, saying that 50 Cent only wrote two songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|After spring {{training}} in 1983, the California Angels assigned McLaughlin to minor league camp in Casa Grande, Arizona. He was eventually {{assigned to the}} Triple-A Edmonton Trappers, but was called up to the majors in June after pitcher Bruce Kison {{was placed on the}} disabled list. McLaughlin made his season debut with the Angels on June 7, against the Chicago White Sox, pitching 1 innings, giving up one earned run. When asked <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be back in the majors, McLaughlin responded, [...] "I'm just thankful the Angels gave me this an opportunity {{to get back in the}} big leagues [...] I always knew I could pitch but I had been labeled a trouble-maker". McLaughlin commented that the personnel on his previous teams felt he had an attitude problem, but that he did not want that to affect him while playing with the Angels, and that it was [...] "in the past". He picked up his first win of the season on July 1, against the Kansas City Royals. McLaughlin was optioned to the minor leagues in August. After hearing the news, McLaughlin was reportedly furious at the Angels front office staff and even threatened to retire. However, McLaughlin continued to play in the California minor league system, and even returned to the majors in September. In the minors that year, he played for the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers and the Double-A Beaumont Golden Gators, going a combined 5–4 with a 4.26 ERA in 26 games in 96 innings pitched. With the Angels, McLaughlin compiled a 2–4 record with a 5.17 ERA, and 45 strikeouts in 16 games, seven of which were starts.|$|E

[...] After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away with him. She tells him {{she has been}} alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had {{forgotten}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles {{to the back of}} the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her because she can't swim. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty-four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving the aforementioned book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks approvingly if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she [...] "passes away". After she succeeds in getting things moving again, she owns up to faking the heart attack as it was the only means to get their attention. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. He goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss, then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time. The film ends with Gilbertson asking questions (some of them irrelevant) not only to Andrew and Margaret, but also Joe, Grace, Annie and Ramone.|$|E

Lost Dogs crackles with that passion and it has another advantage: unlike most of Pearl Jam's albums, it's a fun, compulsive listen. More than any other album in its catalog, Lost Dogs captures what Pearl Jam stood for and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> at their peak."

500|$|The {{following}} year Affleck played a romantic lead in Terrence Malick's experimental drama To the Wonder. Malick, {{a close friend}} of Affleck's godfather, had first met with the actor in the 1990s to offer advice about the plot of Good Will Hunting. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian enjoyed [...] "a performance of dignity and sensitivity," [...] while The New Yorker 's Richard Brody described Affleck as [...] "a solid and muscular performer" [...] who [...] "conveys a sense of thoughtful and willful individuality". Affleck's performance as a poker boss was considered a highlight of the poorly-reviewed thriller Runner Runner (2013). Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times remarked that it was [...] "one killer of a character, and Affleck plays him like a Bach concerto—every note perfectly played." [...] Also in 2013, Affleck hosted the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live for the fifth time since 2000, becoming a member of the Five Timers Club. He then pushed back production on his own directorial project to star as a husband accused of murder in David Fincher's psychological thriller Gone Girl (2014). Fincher cast him partly because he understood <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be misrepresented by tabloid media: [...] "What many people don’t know is that he's crazy smart, but since he doesn’t want that to get awkward, he downplays it. I think he learned how to skate on charm." [...] David Edelstein of New York Magazine noted that Fincher's controlled style of directing had a [...] "remarkable" [...] effect on Affleck's acting: [...] "I never thought I’d write these words, but he carries the movie. He's terrific." [...] Justin Chang of Variety found Affleck [...] "perfectly cast": [...] "It's a tricky turn, requiring a measure of careful underplaying and emotional aloofness, and he nails it completely." [...] In 2015, Affleck and Damon's Project Greenlight was resurrected by HBO for one season.|$|E

The album is also decidedly more heavy and hardcore than New Ghost / Old waves says Brayden Ward, “When people listened to it, we wanted it to feel <b>like</b> how <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> when we were writing <b>it</b> and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> when we were writing it was that it was just a little bit dark, and not brooding, black and noir, just a little darker than New Ghost/Old Waves.” ...|$|R
40|$|This phenomenological {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to reveal midwives’ experiences working as coordinator/charge midwives in tertiary hospital delivery suite settings. The methodology is informed by Heidegger’s interpretive phenomenological, hermeneutic philosophy (1927 / 1962). Data analysis is based on van Manen’s (1990) research methodology. Five coordinator/charge midwives who work at three tertiary hospitals were interviewed. These interviews were tape recorded, transcribed and analyzed to uncover commonality of themes which revealed <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> ‘being’ a coordinator/charge midwife. The three themes which emerged and {{are discussed in the}} data analysis chapters are: “The performing art of leadership”, “Time as lived” and “In the face of the ‘known’ and the ‘unknown’”. The findings of this study reveal coordinators are the ‘hub’ or the ‘pivot’ at their workplace with their art and soul of midwifery at the very core of their ‘being’. They ‘know’ the unpredictability of childbirth and are regularly challenged by ‘lived time’ as they ‘leap in’ to situations and ‘leap ahead’. Their ability to facilitate teamwork and their resilience in the face, at times, of seemingly insurmountable obstacles shines through...|$|R

40|$|The Roman empire afforded a {{kaleidoscope}} of sensations. Through {{a series of}} multisensory case studies centred on people, places, buildings and artefacts, and on specific aspects of human behaviour, this volume develops ground-breaking methods and approaches for sensory studies in Roman archaeology and ancient history. Authors explore questions such as: <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like,</b> and symbolised, to be showered with saffron at the amphitheatre; why {{the shape of a}} dancer’s body made him immediately recognisable as a social outcast; how the dramatic gestures, loud noises and unforgettable smells of a funeral would have different meanings for members of the family and for bystanders; and why feeling the weight of a signet ring on his finger contributed to a man’s sense of identity. A multisensory approach is taken throughout, with each chapter exploring {{at least two of the}} senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste and touch. The contributors’ individual approaches vary, reflecting the possibilities and the wide application of sensory studies to the ancient world. Underlying all chapters is a conviction that taking a multisensory approach enriches our understanding of the Roman empire, but also an awareness of the methodological problems encountered when reconstructing past experiences...|$|R
5000|$|Grodstein's inspirations and {{influences}} for A Friend of the Family {{stemmed from the}} 1990s cases of Amy Grossberg and Melissa Drexler, two high school girls both well known for taking the life of their newborn babies shortly after they had given birth.

This situation was the start for her ideas in the main storyline as well as one of her main characters, Laura Stern. Laura Stern was based on both Melissa Drexler and Amy Grossberg. Grodstein's intentions however, were not to make her audience feel like the actions of young women who commit these neonaticides were wrong nor right but to make her readers understand a different side to the [...] "murders" [...] not just the death of a baby but everything behind that, everything that started such a plan to get rid of a life.

This followed on from the outrage caused when Duffy was held responsible by Finance Minister, Brian Lenihan for inciting widespread public fear that Irish citizens {{were on the verge of}} losing their savings. Several callers freely spoke of their lack of confidence in the banking system, of how they had withdrawn their money from banks, some of which were identified, and were either carrying it around on their person, or considering keeping it [...] "under the mattress", or burying it in their garden. Duffy inflamed the situation further by asking a woman <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> carrying over €70,000 [...] "down the street" [...] and a man how he would feel carrying his savings with him [...] "on the bus" [...] before opining that the banks would not be believed if they stated the system was working as normal.
