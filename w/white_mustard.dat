50|$|Mild <b>white</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sinapis hirta) grows wild in North Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean Europe, and {{has spread}} farther by long cultivation; oriental mustard (Brassica juncea), {{originally}} from {{the foothills of}} the Himalaya, is grown commercially in India, Canada, the UK, Denmark, and the US; black mustard (Brassica nigra) is grown in Argentina, Chile, the US and some European countries. Canada and Nepal are the world's major producers of mustard seed, between them accounting for around 57% of world production in 2010. <b>White</b> <b>mustard</b> (Sinapis alba) is commonly used as a cover crop in Europe (between UK and Ukraine). A large number of varieties exist, e.g. in Germany, Netherlands, mainly differing in lateness of flowering and resistance against white beet-cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii). Farmers prefer late flowering varieties, which do not produce seeds, they may become weeds in the subsequent year. Early vigour is important to cover the soil quickly and suppress weeds and protect the soil against erosion. In rotations with sugar beets, suppression of the white beet-cyst nematode is an important trait. Resistant <b>white</b> <b>mustard</b> varieties decline nematode populations by 70-90%.|$|E

50|$|The key to {{the main}} dish is the butter sauce. The Paris {{newspaper}} Le Monde reports that it is made from chicken livers, fresh thyme and thyme flowers, full cream, <b>white</b> Dijon <b>mustard,</b> butter, and water, plus salt and pepper. According to Le Monde, the chicken livers are blanched in one pan with the thyme until they start to turn colour. In a second pan, the cream is reduced on low heat with the mustard and infused with the flavour of the thyme flowers. The chicken livers are then finely minced and pressed through a strainer into the reduced cream. As the sauce thickens, the butter is incorporated into {{it with a little}} water, it is beaten smooth, and fresh-ground salt and pepper are added. The London newspaper The Independent, however, reports that Hélène Godillot has dismissed the Le Monde report as inaccurate.|$|R
