40|$|Design of wiring for {{aerospace}} vehicles {{relies on}} {{an understanding of}} "ampacity" which refers to the current carrying capacity of wires, either, individually or in <b>wire</b> <b>bundles.</b> Designers rely on standards to derate allowable current flow to prevent exceedance of wire temperature limits due to resistive heat dissipation within the <b>wires</b> or <b>wire</b> <b>bundles.</b> These standards often add considerable margin and are based on empirical data. Commercial providers are taking an aggressive approach to wire sizing which challenges the conventional wisdom of the established standards. Thermal modelling of <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> may offer significant mass reduction in a system if the technique can be generalized to produce reliable temperature predictions for arbitrary bundle configurations. Thermal analysis {{has been applied to}} the problem of <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> wherein any or all of the <b>wires</b> within the <b>bundle</b> may carry current. <b>Wire</b> <b>bundles</b> present analytical challenges because the heat transfer path from conductors internal to the bundle is tortuous, relying on internal radiation and thermal interface conductance to move the heat from within the bundle to the external jacket where it can be carried away by convective and radiative heat transfer. The problem is further complicated by the dependence of wire electrical resistivity on temperature. Reduced heat transfer out of the bundle leads to higher conductor temperatures and, hence, increased resistive heat dissipation. Development of a generalized <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> thermal model is presented and compared with test data. The steady state heat balance for a single wire is derived and extended to the bundle configuration. The generalized model includes the effects of temperature varying resistance, internal radiation and thermal interface conductance, external radiation and temperature varying convective relief from the free surface. The sensitivity of the response to uncertainties in key model parameters is explored using Monte Carlo analysis...|$|R
40|$|Serious {{problems}} can occur from insulation {{failures in the}} wiring harnesses of aerospace vehicles. In most recorded incidents, the failures have been identified {{to be the result}} of arc tracking, the propagation of an arc along <b>wiring</b> <b>bundles</b> through degradation of insulation. Propagation of the arc can lead to the loss of the entire wiring harness and the functions which it supports. While an extensive database of testing for arc track resistant wire insulations has been developed for aircraft applications, the counterpart requirements for spacecraft are very limited. The electrical, thermal, mechanical, chemical, and operational requirements for specification and testing of candidate wiring systems for spacecraft applications is presented...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft wiring {{failures}} {{have increased}} {{over the last few}} years resulting in arc faults and high-energy flashover on the wiring bundle, which can propagate down through aircraft Electrical Wiring and Interconnect Systems (EWIS). It is considered cost prohibitive to completely rewire a plane in terms of man hours and operational time lost to do this, and most faults are only detectable whilst the aircraft is in flight. Temperature, humidity and vibration all accelerate ageing and failure effects on EWIS. This research investigates methods of in-situ non-invasive testing of aircraft wiring during fight. Failure Mode Effects and Analysis (FMEA) was performed on legacy aircraft EWIS using data obtained from RAF Brize Norton. Micro-Electro-mechanical- Systems (MEMS) were evaluated for use in a wire monitoring system that measures the environmental parameters responsible for ageing and failure of EWIS. Such MEMS can be developed into a Health and Usage Monitoring MicroSystem (HUMMS) by incorporating advanced signal processing and prognostic software. Current and humidity sensors were chosen for further investigation in this thesis. These sensors can be positioned inside and outside cable connectors of EWIS so that arc faults can be reliably detected and located. This thesis presents the design, manufacture and test of micro-manufactured Rogowski sensors. The manufactured sensors were benchmarked against commercial high frequency current transformers (HFCT), as these devices can also detect high frequency current signature due to wire insulation failure. Results indicate that these sensors possess superior voltage output compared to the HFCT. The design, manufacture and test of a polymer capacitive humidity sensor is also presented. Two different types of polymer were reviewed as part of the evaluation. A feature of the sensor design is recovery from exposure to chemicals found on <b>wiring</b> <b>bundles.</b> Current and humidity sensors were demonstrated to be suitable for integrating onto a common substrate with accelerometers, temperature sensors and pressure sensors for health monitoring and prognostics of aircraft EWIS.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of two hypervelocity impact failure risk assessments for critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> exposed aboard the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS- 1) to an increased orbital debris environment at its 824 km, 98. 8 deg inclination orbit. The first “generic” approach predicted the number of wires broken by orbital debris ejecta emerging from normal impact with multi-layer insulation (MLI) covering 36, 18, and 6 strand <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> at a 5 cm standoff using the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) code. This approach also included a mathematical approach for computing the probability that redundant wires were severed within the bundle. Based in part on the high computed risk of a critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> failure from the generic approach, an enhanced orbital debris protection design was examined, consisting of betacloth-reinforced MLI suspended at a 5 cm standoff over a seven layer betacloth and Kevlar blanket, draped over the exposed <b>wire</b> <b>bundles.</b> A second SPH-based risk assessment was conducted that also included the beneficial effects from the high (75 degree) obliquity of orbital debris impact owing to the flight orientation of the exposed wiring and shadowing by other spacecraft components. These factors resulted in a considerably reduced likelihood of critical <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> failure compared to the original baseline design with normal impacts and no shadowing...|$|R
40|$|Determining current {{carrying}} capacity (ampacity) of <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> in aerospace vehicles is critical not only to safety but also to efficient design. Published standards provide guidance on determining <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> ampacity but offer little flexibility for configurations where <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> of mixed gauges and currents are employed with varying external insulation jacket surface properties. Thermal modeling has been employed {{in an attempt to}} develop techniques to assist in ampacity determination for these complex configurations. Previous developments allowed analysis of <b>wire</b> <b>bundle</b> configurations but was constrained to configurations comprised of less than 50 elements. Additionally, for vacuum analyses, configurations with very low emittance external jackets suffered from numerical instability in the solution. A new thermal modeler is presented allowing for larger configurations and is not constrained for low bundle infrared emissivity calculations. Formulation of key internal radiation and interface conductance parameters is discussed including the effects of temperature and air pressure on wire to wire thermal conductance. Test cases comparing model-predicted ampacity and that calculated from standards documents are presented...|$|R

40|$|Litz <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> {{are highly}} {{effective}} at enhancing the {{current carrying capacity}} and limiting the losses of electronic devices up to MHz frequencies due to the pattern in which the individual wires are braided in the bundle. However, the technology to fabricate Litz <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> at higher radio frequencies has not been developed due to current manufacturing limitations. Litz <b>wire</b> <b>bundles</b> developed to accommodate higher radio frequencies would have a tremendous impact for electronic devices because these bundles would allow for inductors to be manufactured with increased quality factors from the current range of less than 10 to a possible range of up to 1000 at frequencies of 1 - 10 GHz. This would allow for less spectral crowding, jamming, improved power handling, and more efficient systems. In this thesis, through collaboration with The Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, dielectrophoretic and driven fluid flow bead manipulation methods were explored for the purpose of demonstrating the plausibility of controlled litz wire braiding at a nano-to-micro scale. Results from this thesis show that both dielectrophoresis and driven fluid flow are viable methods for bead manipulation and should be further developed to enable fabrication of "NanoLitz" wires. by Alexxis Isaac and Makai Cartman.
