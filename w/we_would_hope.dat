500|$|The storyline which {{featured}} the character's old nemesis DC Hooch drew criticism of Becky's excessive littering of her cigarette butts. Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: [...] "It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow {{one of its}} characters to throw a butt {{on the floor and}} suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. We understand the writers are concerned with realism but Becky is a role model to many viewers. We all have a responsibility to keep our local area clean and <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>hope</b> that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would support our call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy." [...] A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll to find out which character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she [...] "loved a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror praised Becky's feud with Tracy, explaining it was a [...] "perfectly poised, barbed battle". Though he said it was ruined by Kylie's return.|$|E

Following the sentencing, Taylor press secretary Deborah Potter said Taylor still had no comment, and reviewed a statement by Wiseman: [...] "For a number of years there has been an {{effort on the part of}} certain political opponents of Congressman Charles Taylor to slander him and Blue Ridge Savings Bank by indicating that neither he nor the bank or any present officers of the bank had any prior knowledge," [...] Wiseman said in the statement. [...] "This went on for some nine years with the encouragement of the press. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>hope</b> that the settlement of this case would put an end to such speculation."

Of course for individual planets <b>we</b> ideally <b>would</b> <b>hope</b> to measure mass, radius, atmospheric composition, temperature, and cloud properties, but how do these characteristics fit into our broader understanding of planetary system origin and evolution theories? In my presentation I will review both the specifics of what we hope to learn from newly discovered young worlds as well as how these characteristics inform our broader understanding of giant planets and planetary systems.

First, referring only to the gratification afforded to the eye, which we know to depend upon fixed mathematical principles, though those principles are not always developed, it is to be observed, that country is always most beautiful when it is made up of curves, and that one of the chief characters of Ausonian landscape is the perfection of its curvatures, induced by the gradual undulation of promontories into the plains. In suiting architecture to such a country, that building which least interrupts the curve on which it is placed will be felt to be most delightful to the eye.|$|E

Longitudinal measurement does not allow the students to specifically prepare themselves for particular questions.
