5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce forward thrust if full power <b>was</b> <b>applied.</b> Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|The name of Michilimackinac (later {{abbreviated}} to Mackinac) <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> generally {{to the entire}} vicinity, as well as specifically to the post at St. Ignace.

30|$|Herbicide {{treatments}} <b>were</b> <b>applied</b> using a custom-built, hand-operated spot gun, {{developed by}} Scion and DOC.

Treatments <b>were</b> <b>applied</b> in December 2010.|$|R
5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s.

5|$|In 2010, Biman {{went through}} a {{rebranding}} exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman was forced to revert to the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern revised version of its livery, that <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to the new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.|$|E

5|$|The US-412 {{designation}} <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to preexisting Oklahoma highways. From Woodward to {{just east}} of Enid, US-412 replaced SH-15.

US-412 continued east {{from the end of}} the turnpike along US-64. From there, it was routed through the Tulsa metropolitan freeway system along I-244 and I-44. East of Tulsa, the highway replaced SH-33 to the Arkansas line. The highway designations made redundant by US-412 were removed, effective December 12, 1988.|$|E

5|$|A third update <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to Gears of War 2 on March 24, 2009.

5|$|Although {{the archaeological}} record does not provide {{examples}} of brushes or pens, analysis of ink strokes on the Postclassic codices suggests that it <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> with a brush with a tip fashioned from pliable hair.

Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide <b>was</b> <b>applied</b> to the hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation.
