5000|$|Hauer's {{compositional}} {{techniques are}} extraordinarily various and often change from one piece to the next. These range from building-block techniques to methods using a chord series that is generated {{out of the}} twelve-tone row ("Melos") to pieces employing an ordered row that is then subject to systematic permution. The so-called 44 [...] "tropes" [...] and their compositional usage ("trope-technique") are essential to many of Hauer's twelve-tone techniques. In contrast to a twelve-tone row that contains a fixed succession of twelve tones, a trope consists of two complementary hexachords {{in which there is}} no fixed tone sequence. The tropes are used for structural and intervallic views on the twelve-tone system. Every trope offers certain symmetries that can be used by the composer. But Hauer also employed twelve-tone rows, using one row for a single piece and subjecting that row to a series of transformations, most notably rotation (keeping the order of the elements in a series fixed but reorganizing them so that they start somewhere in the middle and <b>wrap</b> <b>back</b> around to the beginning: A B C D [...] [...] [...] becomes C D [...] [...] [...] A B, for instance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present and}} {{evaluate}} a new memory man-agement technique for eliminating memory leaks in programs with dynamic memory allocation. This technique observes {{the execution of}} the program on a sequence of training inputs to find m-bounded allocation sites, which have the property that at any time during {{the execution of the}} program, the program only accesses the last m objects allocated at that site. The technique then transforms the program to use cyclic memory allocation at that site: it preallocates a buffer containing m objects of the type allocated at that site, with each allocation returning the next object in the buffer. At the end of the buffer the allocations <b>wrap</b> <b>back</b> around to the first object. Cyclic allocation eliminates any memory leak at the allocation site — the total amount of memory required to hold all of the objects ever allocated at the site is simply m times the object size. We evaluate our technique by applying it to several widely-used open source programs. Our results show that it is able to successfully eliminate important memory leaks in these pro-grams. A potential concern is that the estimated bounds m may be too small, causing the program to overlay live objects in memory. Our results indicate that our bounds estimation technique is quite accurate in practice, providing incorrect results for only one of the 161 m-bounded sites that it identifies. To further evaluate the potential impact of overlaying live objects, we artificially reduce the bounds at other m-bounded sites and observe the resulting behavior. The general pattern that emerges is that overlaying elements of core data structures may make the program fail. Overlaying application data, however, may impair parts of the functionality but does not prevent the program from continuing to execute to correctly deliver the remaining functionality...|$|E

50|$|There is {{a second}} type of ink drying that most {{printers}} are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to 10 cm long, <b>wrapping</b> <b>back</b> {{and forth across the}} ink tank.

Those who start with a triple will start with a triple on each new phrase.

2500|$|For the {{sequential}} burst mode, later {{words are}} accessed in increasing address order, <b>wrapping</b> <b>back</b> {{to the start}} of the block when the end is reached. So, for example, for a burst length of four, and a requested column address of five, the words would be accessed in the order 5-6-7-4.

The interleaved burst mode computes the address using an exclusive or operation between the counter and the address. [...] Using the same starting address of five, a four-word burst would return words in the order 5-4-7-6. [...] An eight-word burst would be 5-4-7-6-1-0-3-2.

RosenbergAlthough {{the causes}} of the {{evolution}} of bipedalism are unclear, one consequence is that the hands are freed from use in locomotion, making it possible to carry objects including tools, firewood, water, food, and dependent, helpless offspring. Carrying infants can be problematic because while the baby needs to nurse, the mother also {{needs to be able to}} work. Cross-culturally, there are many different methods and tools used by women to carry their babies throughout the day such as front <b>wraps,</b> <b>back</b> <b>wraps,</b> side slings, and carrying in-arms. In this study, I conducted motion analysis on 22 women carrying 7 and 20 lb weights using these four ways of carrying infants. In the biomechanical engineering lab, I observed women carrying two different loads while walking and standing, to look at the change in their posture and variation in gait. Approved by the Human Subjects Board at the University of Delaware, the protocol does not involve harmful or invasive procedures, and assures anonymity. The two main objectives of this research were to understand the effects of baby weight and baby carrying position on the hip flexion and extension angles and the lateral trunk and forward trunk angles. The results show that on the whole, carrying an increased weight exaggerates the effect of the load on the hip and trunk angles. Also, the front and back carrying positions cause a change in the gait of the carrier, while the <b>back</b> <b>wrap</b> and in arms carrying position cause a change in the posture of the carrier. This study will lead to a better understanding of a universal cultural practice that affects the biology of the human body. Anthropolog...|$|R
