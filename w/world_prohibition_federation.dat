After Prohibition ended in 1933, many of these operations were discontinued. August also managed to keep Anheuser-Busch prosperous during anti-German bias of World War I.

25|$|Due to {{the chaos}} caused in the Jewish <b>world,</b> the Rabbinic <b>prohibition</b> against {{studying}} Kabbalah established itself firmly within the Jewish religion. One {{of the conditions}} allowing a man to study and engage himself in the Kabbalah was {{to be at least}} forty years old. This age requirement came about during this period and is not Talmudic in origin but Rabbinic. Many Jews are familiar with this ruling, but are not aware of its origins. Moreover, the prohibition is not halakhic in nature. According to Moses Cordovero, halakhically, one must be of age twenty to engage in the Kabbalah. Many famous kabbalists, including the ARI, Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, Yehuda Ashlag, were younger than twenty when they began.|$|R

However, despite this, military manuals around the <b>world</b> issued <b>prohibitions</b> on attacking enemy personnel parachuting from aircraft in distress.

40|$|The most {{dangerous}} and deadly form of tobacco consumption, burning and inhaling tobacco cigarettes, is still free. Total eradication {{will not be}} possible for many reasons. Cigarettes have the connotation of the free <b>world</b> and <b>prohibition</b> would not only affect and criminalise marginalised people but also well respected members of our societies. So any attempt to curb the cigarette smoking should be welcomed by all exponents of public health. The dangerousness of cigarettes stems from burning tobacco and thus inhaling numerous toxic ingredients. E-cigs avoid the toxic by-products vaporising the nicotine. The public debate on e-cigs is quite bizarre. Should they fall under tobacco or pharmaceutical laws or others? The arguments against e-cigs follow basically 2 lines. Firstly it is contended that 60 mg of nicotine are lethal (e. g. in Tobacco Atlas). Nicotine can be lethal but only in doses of 0. 5 g- 1 g or more. Secondly {{it is said that}} vapouring paves the way to cigarette smoking, which has not been observed despite enormous growth of the e-cig market.

5000|$|The {{fixed price}} of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959 {{refers to a}} period in the United States during which the price of 6.5 oz of Coca-Cola fluctuated very little to consumers.

The fixed price of Coca-Cola from 1886 to 1959 is especially significant given the potentially influential events {{that occurred during the}} same time period, including the founding of Pepsi, <b>World</b> War I, <b>prohibition,</b> changing taxes, a caffeine and caramel shortage, and World War II.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} divine jealousy in Judaism {{stems from the}} concept of {{monotheism}}. One of the most well known assertions of monotheism in Judaism is the Shema. The Shema proclaims:"Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God; The Lord is one." [...] (Deuteronomy 6:4, World English Bible)Reciting the Shema affirms an individual's faith in one God. Since {{there is only one}} God, worship of multiple gods wrongly gives to false gods what belongs to the one true God. Worship of multiple gods constitutes a form of spiritual infidelity against the one God. The one God responds to this infidelity with jealousy. For example, the second of the Ten Commandments states:"You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me, and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments." [...] (Exodus 20:4-6, <b>World</b> English Bible)This <b>prohibition</b> is later repeated in the verse:"...for you shall worship no other god: for the Lord, whose name is Jealous (Kanna), is a jealous God (El Kanna)." [...] (Exodus 34:14, World English Bible)Divine jealousy in Judaism thus refers to how the one God responds to humans worshipping multiple gods. Humans are prohibited from worshipping multiple gods and provoking the jealousy of the one true God.|$|R
40|$|Investing in the United States {{has become}} a hobby for many. Individual {{ownership}} of equity, moreover, has increased {{over the past decade}} {{due in part to the}} introduction of internet-based trading. While providing the possibility for greater returns compared with bank savings accounts, among other investment alternatives, the public capital markets also pose greater risks for investors. Many individual investors lack both the resources and the incentive to analyze the value of any particular security in the market. Such investors thus trade at a systematic disadvantage relative to more informed parties. In response, regulators have asserted that certain informational disparities cause uninformed investors to lose confidence in the market, thereby justifying stringent regulation. This Article analyzes the impact of information advantages in the market and proposes a unified approach to regulating such advantages. Informational disparities in the market arise from a number of different sources. An individual investor may contemplate a trade in a particular publicly traded company. Call the company whose securities are being traded the 2 ̆ 2 traded firm 2 ̆ 2. In a <b>world</b> without regulatory <b>prohibitions,</b> individual investors first face the possibility that the traded firm itself will provide nonpublic material information to only a subset of investors in the market.

Insiders may then exploit this information to profit from trades in the market at the expense of outside investors.

40|$|Children {{have participated}} in wars {{throughout}} history. Even today {{there are hundreds of}} thousands of child soldiers around the <b>world</b> despite international <b>prohibitions.</b> Whereas research of former child soldiers in their home countries indicates that participating in war negatively affects their social, emotional, psychological, and physical well-being, {{little is known about the}} challenges they face when forcibly migrating to the West. This vulnerable group has not only experienced the major transition from a military to a civilian environment but also that of entering a new culture. Due to the dearth of research on their lives in a new culture, it is necessary to learn more about this particular group in order to provide assistance which coincides better with their specific needs. The aim of this social psychological study was to learn how five former child soldiers from Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Somalia, and El Salvador, respectively, described their experiences of having been child soldiers and having lived in Finland or Sweden. Open ended interviews were conducted to gather these descriptions. Both their subjective and shared experiences were examined using Giorgi’s descriptive phenomenological method, which emphasizes the significance of human experiences and allows the researcher to remain open to the participants’ descriptions without imposing formal theories on them. The findings of this study suggest a temporal and thematic structure of the phenomenon of child soldiery, which includes their experiences of refuge in Finland/Sweden. The results also support previous research of former child soldiers and cross-cultural psychological research of refugees and immigrants in acculturation. Overall, the experience of child soldiery meant forced or voluntary separation from family, multiple losses, lack of control and other hardships. It also had a strong emotional aspect, both negative and positive. While all faced various struggles in the aftermath of war, some continued to behave according to the practices they had learned in the armed group while others behaved pro-socially, both when reintegrating to civil society and adapting to a new culture. For most participants the encounter with a new culture largely amplified the traumas they had experienced as child soldiers...|$|R
