2500|$|On August 8, 1905, Cobb's mother {{fatally shot}} his father {{with a pistol}} {{that his father had}} {{purchased}} for her. Court records indicate that Mr. Cobb had suspected his wife of infidelity and was sneaking past his own bedroom window to catch her in the act. She saw the silhouette of what she presumed to be an intruder and, acting in self-defense, shot and killed her husband. Mrs. Cobb was charged with murder and then released on a $7,000 recognizance bond. She was acquitted on March 31, 1906. Cobb later attributed his ferocious play to his late father, saying, [...] "I did it for my father. He never got to see me play... but I knew he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me,</b> and I never let him down." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{remained}} silent for several moments. All {{this time she}} <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> furtively. I {{did my best}} to keep my {{features}} immovable.|$|E
6000|$|He had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> at the book-case! The {{man who was}} in my husband's confidence, the man {{who knew}} where the clew was to be found, had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> at the book-case! There was no doubt of it now. Major Fitz-David had shown me the hiding-place of the secret in spite of himself! ...|$|R
60|$|How Captain Chris laughed! He had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> {{through the}} water-glass, {{and saw what}} had scared me.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the moment}} when I looked round {{something}} stirred in the front room. The movement let the light in suddenly through the small open space left by the partially closed door. Had somebody <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> through the chink? I stepped softly to the door, and pushed it back until it was wide open. There was the Major, discovered in the front room! I saw it in his face--he had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> at the book-case! ...|$|R
60|$|My tone {{had become}} grave, and my face overcast. She <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> curiously.|$|E
60|$|I {{nodded and}} drank my coffee. Grooton <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> {{with an air}} of respectful interest.|$|E
60|$|There was a moment's silence. It {{seemed to}} me that the Duke <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> with {{peculiar}} intentness.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{have always}} seemed to <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me,</b> and often {{there was such a}} wistful look in them--it {{reminded}} me of the past." ...|$|R
5000|$|No. 21 - Song - Harry - [...] "There's an {{eye that}} <b>is</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> all unseen, a bold dark eye with a winsome light..." ...|$|R
60|$|The Inspector had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> {{narrowly}} as I {{read these}} extracts. When I reached that point, he broke {{in with a}} word of explanation.|$|R
60|$|And {{while he}} enunciated the platitude I was uncomfortably aware that that alien thing inside his skull <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me,</b> {{studying}} me.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> keenly and made a great effort to remain composed, {{although}} my pulses were beating fast and I felt my colour rising.|$|E
60|$|Mr. de Valentin <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> closely, and {{the test}} was a severe one. I was annoyed with Guest for having kept me in ignorance {{of what he had}} done.|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not understand," [...] he answered. [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> me--even to-night they <b>are</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me.</b> Oh, if {{you only}} knew, Louise, how I have longed for this hour that is to come!" ...|$|R
60|$|I sat quite still. I {{felt that}} Eve's eyes <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me.</b> I set my teeth for a moment; and I turned toward her, my {{cigarette}} case in my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're safe enough, I guess. It was {{a mighty}} neat job, Cerise, taken altogether, {{although}} the fools have <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> night and day. That's the reason I {{did not come}} sooner." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that I knew {{something}} about that caché, and I felt like laughing; but he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me,</b> and it struck me that he had a nasty, vindictive kind of mind.|$|E
60|$|Then, one day {{she came}} back, and Steele, who <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> as she entered, quietly got up and without a word took Diane {{out of the room}} and left me alone with Sally.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the first}} glance I {{recognized}} Jeffrey Aspern, and I {{was well aware}} that I flushed with the act. As she <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> however I had the consistency to exclaim, [...] "What a striking face! Do tell me who it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While he <b>is</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> with a policeman? While he {{is still}} {{thinking}} that I entertain a--lover? While he believes that I am the base thing that he has dared to think me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{am afraid}} that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.|$|R
60|$|PARAMORE (angrily). Yes, {{you have}} <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> because you admire Miss Craven yourself. Well, {{you may go}} in and win now. You will be pleased to hear that I am a ruined man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suspected, at any rate. I wrote {{you that}} Lord Deringham <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> sharply. Where {{he got the}} idea from I can't imagine, but he got it and he got it right, anyhow. He's {{followed}} me about like a cat, and it's all up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! He {{has changed}} his mind. He {{is not going to}} Fiume. He <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> all the {{afternoon}} like a regular spy. People had told him that at the banquet to-day Erös Béla had been very attentive, so one of his jealous fits was on him." ...|$|E
60|$|I got up obediently. Aunt Martha was as {{grim and}} uncompromising as ever, and Mrs. Saxby {{looked like a}} chief mourner, but do you suppose I cared? I dropped behind them just once before we left the shore. I knew he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> and I waved my hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I got uneasy. People {{seemed to}} <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me.</b> It scared me--badly." [...] She {{put her hand}} to her head. [...] "It's almost the last thing I {{remember}} before waking up in the hospital...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure of it. Why {{are they}} so shy? That little fellow in blue who was with you just now ought to have got over his fright. He's <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> like a Red Indian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to give you any offence," [...] Richard began. [...] "I {{happened}} to notice that you <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me.</b> I <b>was</b> looking at your daughter--staring at her. I am afraid you thought me impertinent." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made some}} reciprocative speech, which, {{if it was}} {{somewhat}} awkwardly expressed, had at least the merit of earnestness, and my eyes followed her admiringly as {{she walked to the}} door and disappeared with a backward glance and a smile. Then I started and coloured, to find that Mr. Ravenor <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two I {{remained}} quite silent, {{for the simple reason that}} I was far too astonished to make any remark. My new acquaintance sat looking at me with slightly-raised eyebrows and carelessly toying with his eyeglass; yet, notwithstanding his apparent nonchalance, I felt somehow aware that he <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> keenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} too much, master. If I could have managed it I should have dropped the sword Silence on your toe long before. But I couldn't, for the Heer Adrian <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me,</b> and I {{had to wait}} till he closed his eyes, which he did to hear the better without seeming to listen." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked out}} {{and saw a}} number of people walking up and down the street. No one {{appeared}} to <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me,</b> and waiting a favorable opportunity, I slid out of the window to the sidewalk below.|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} have been in that cabin more than two minutes altogether. Say three. [...] . So he {{could not have}} <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> more than a mere {{fraction}} of a minute, luckily. Still, I regretted the occurrence.|$|R
60|$|Then it was I {{found that}} I {{was not alone}} in the garden. Two little leaden {{children}} stood in an attitude of listening {{on either side of the}} carved porch of the palace, and between them a figure that seemed to <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>me</b> intently.|$|R
