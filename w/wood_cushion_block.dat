Based on {{finite element}} {{analysis}} software ANSYS, the 3 D contact finite element model of carbide anvil, steel ring and <b>cushion</b> <b>block</b> were built to make heat transfer analysis, and the temperature field distribution was obtained. The indirect coupling thermal analysis of carbide anvil, steel ring and <b>cushion</b> <b>block</b> were made regarding as a whole, the Von Mises stress nephogram of them and the shear stress nephogram of carbide anvil were displayed. The stress nephogram revealed that it was liable to fracture {{on the edge of}} top surface under high pressure status, and it was also proven that the main reason of fracture was the yield of internal material defects under the action of shear stress. 1.

40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} fork-lift truck vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of fork-lift truck in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the overhead guard is connected with the frame by the rubber <b>cushion</b> <b>blocks</b> at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the rubber <b>cushion</b> <b>blocks</b> (shock mount) in two different position.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} reduced abdominal compression in prone position on ascending colonic movement during supine-to-prone positional change during CT colonography (CTC). Materials and Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients who had undergone prone CTC scanning with <b>cushion</b> <b>blocks</b> placed under the chest and hip/thigh to reduce abdominal compression and had confirmed sessile polyps ≥ 6 mm in the well-distended, straight, mid-ascending colon, were included. Radial location along the ascending colonic luminal circumference (°) was measured for 24 polyps and 54 colonic teniae on supine and prone CTC images. The supine-to-prone change ranging between- 180 ° and + 180 ° (- and + for internal and external colonic rotations, respectively), was determined. In addition, possible causes of any ascending colonic rotations were explored. Results: Abdominal compression during prone CTC scanning completely disappeared with the use of <b>cushion</b> <b>blocks</b> in 17 of 18 patients. However, some degrees of ascending colonic rotation were still observed, with the radial location changes of- 22 ° to 61 ° (median, 13. 9 °) for the polyps and similar degrees for teniae. Fifty-four percent and 56 % of polyps and teniae, respectively, showed changes> 10 °. The radial location change of the polyps was significantly associated with the degree of anterior shift of the small bowel and mesentery (r = 0. 722, p < 0. 001) and the degree of posterior displacement of the ascending colon (r = 0. 566, p = 0. 004) during supine-to-prone positional change. Conclusion: Ascending colonic rotation upon supine-to-prone positional change during CTC, mostly in the form of external rotation, is not eliminated by removing abdominal compression in prone position...|$|R

Healthy young subjects (n =  22) sat for 5  min on contoured foam or <b>wood</b> <b>cushion</b> surfaces fitted to otherwise identical wheelchairs. Force sensing resistors attached to each quadrant of the sitting interface measured the relative movements of the subjects over time. A significant correlation was found between settling down time (SDT) and reported leg/feet discomfort (p =  0. 003; correlation co-efficient =  0. 44); and a significant negative correlation was found between SDT and overall comfort (p =  0. 015; correlation co-efficient = - 0. 36). When comparing cushion surfaces: SDT was significantly longer (p <  0. 0001) for subjects sitting on wood (5. 8  s) compared to contoured foam (3. 9  s); Leg/feet discomfort was significant higher (p =  0. 007) for subjects sitting on wood (1. 1 out of 10) compared to contoured foam (0. 3 out of 10); Overall discomfort was significant higher (p =  0. 009) for subjects sitting on wood (1. 3 out of 10) compared to contoured foam (0. 5 out of 10); Comfort was significantly lower (p =  0. 001) for subjects sitting on wood (6. 5 out of 10) compared to contoured foam (8. 3 out of 10); Support was significantly lower (p =  0. 001) for subjects sitting on wood (6. 4 out of 10) compared to contoured foam (8 out of 10). The {{results of this study}} suggest that the shape and firmness of the surface at the buttock-wheelchair interface can affect a subject's SDT following initial contact with the seat as well as their perception of comfort and discomfort. In addition, there appears to be a relationship between longer SDT's and increased discomfort ratings, and shorter SDT's and increased comfort ratings.

However, the steel being produced at that time proved too brittle to be effective. Iron, being softer, bent, dented and distorted but held together and remained an effective means of protection.|$|R

The AA., after a preliminary and organic geological investigation which permitted {{the preparation of the}} map (Fig. 3) in which the various geolithologic units are corelated, then made a particular study of the principal geomorphologic structures present in the entire basin. The multiple presence of such structure is justified in the geological difference of the formations present. Among the typical structures of the basic vulcanites was the evidence of <b>cushion</b> lava, <b>block</b> lava and tabularcolumn lava; among the typical acid vulcanites are the stratoid lava and the cave like structures. Also the evidence were the pointed tabular structures, the concave tabular structures and the dip-shop, tabular structures present in the series of lava flows, and of porous stone deposits and sea deposits in alternate stratus. The part relative to the hydrogeology was preceded by an examination of the climatology and the hydrometry of the basinc. Five meteorological rain measuring stations and two thermometeorological rain measuring stations were used for this study and the following information were gathered: - the maximum precipitations were concentrated in the late autumn period, in winter and in the early spring; the maximum aridity was during the summer months; there is a great irregularity in the intensity of the precipitations; within the area of the basin proportional differences of values of precipitation due to altitudes do not exist. The hydrometric characteristics of the basin have been brought to light using the information of hydrometric data given by the station at Reinamare.

40|$|Function of {{the heart}} begins long before its {{formation}} is complete. Analyses in mouse and zebrafish have shown that myocardial function is not required for early steps of organogenesis, such as formation {{of the heart}} tube or chamber specification. However, whether myocardial function is required for later steps of cardiac development, such as endocardial cushion (EC) formation, has not been established. Recent technical advances and approaches have provided novel inroads toward the study of organogenesis, allowing us {{to examine the effects}} of both genetic and pharmacological perturbations of myocardial function on EC formation in zebrafish. To address whether myocardial function is required for EC formation, we examined s ilent heart (sih -/-) embryos, which lack a heartbeat due to mutation of cardiac troponin T (tnnt 2), and observed that atrioventricular (AV) ECs do not form. Likewise, we determined that <b>cushion</b> formation is <b>blocked</b> in cardiofunk (cfk -/-) embryos, which exhibit cardiac dilation and no early blood flow. In order to further analyze the heart defects in cfk -/- embryos, we positionally cloned cfk and show that it encodes a novel sarcomeric actin expressed in the embryonic myocardium. The Cfk s 11 variant exhibits a change in a universally conserved residue (R 177 H). We show that in yeast this mutation negatively affects actin polymerization. Because the lack of cushion formation in sih- and cfk- mutant embryos could be due to reduced myocardial function and/or lack of blood flow, we approached this question pharmacologically and provide evidence that reduction in myocardial function is primarily responsible for the defect in cushion development. Our data demonstrate that early myocardial function is required for later steps of organogenesis and suggest that myocardial function, not endothelial shear stress, is the major epigenetic factor controlling late heart development. Based on these observations, we postulate that defects in cardiac morphogenesis may be secondary to mutations affecting early myocardial function, and that, in humans, mutations affecting embryonic myocardial function may be responsible for structural congenital heart disease. </p...|$|R
