5|$|Edward's unorthodox {{approach}} to his role also {{extended to the}} coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that {{of his or her}} predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting in his hair. Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition by suggesting that, had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> him facing right.|$|E
5|$|In Nigel Kneale's 1996 radio serial The Quatermass Memoirs, it is {{revealed}} that the Professor was first involved in rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and that his wife died young. The unmade prequel serial Quatermass in the Third Reich, an idea conceived by Kneale in the late 1990s, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> Quatermass travelling to Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics and becoming involved with Wernher von Braun and the German rocket programme, before helping a young Jewish refugee {{to escape from the}} country. According to The Quatermass Memoirs, during World War II Quatermass conducted top secret work for the British war effort, which he subsequently refused ever to discuss.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Kingsglaive was based around {{a portion of}} the {{original}} opening of Final Fantasy XV, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> the invasion of Insomnia by Niflheim's army. This had to be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of Kingsglaive. To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core. That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by Kazushige Nojima. The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script. Los Angeles-based company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff. The storyline was designed to complement and {{set the stage for the}} events of Final Fantasy XV without revealing major plot elements from the game. The movie was created for a primarily English audience, with the script translation handled by Square Enix's in-house localization team. As many team members were Final Fantasy fans, frequent nostalgic references to earlier entries in the series were included.|$|E

25|$|As a result, a “Corrective Action Plan” {{had been}} {{prepared}} and implemented, but EASA was {{of the opinion that}} “it is unlikely that such action <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> a major effect on the system at the time of or prior to, the accident”.|$|E
25|$|The figure also {{suggests}} that there is a lateral component of force which can only be interpreted as a weak radial dipole. Experiments have been performed on the ring tone. The lower figure on the right shows the relationship of frequency to Reynolds number. If the Strouhal number were graphed in lieu of the frequency, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that contours were reasonably constant similar to those for the hole tone. Close examination of the data in the figure showed a slight negative dependence of Strouhal number on Reynolds number.|$|E
25|$|The matter {{came before}} the heads of houses, and {{there was talk of}} Preston's {{expulsion}} from the university. At the suggestion of Lancelot Andrewes, then Bishop of Ely, Preston was directed to declare his judgment regarding forms of prayer in a sermon at St. Botolph's. He acquitted himself so as to silence complaint. Soon afterwards he was summoned to preach before the king at Finchingbrook, near Royston, Cambridgeshire. James highly approved his argument against the Arminians; he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> him less favour had he known that Preston was the author of a paper against the Spanish match, circulated with much secrecy among members of the House of Lords. He was proposed as a royal chaplain by James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn, but James thought this premature.|$|E
60|$|To retrace their steps by {{the course}} {{laid out on}} the {{previous}} evening was not a difficult matter, for the trail through the tangled underbrush <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>showed</b> the way even without the compass, and before two hours of this new day were spent the little party stood once more around the coral-head.|$|R
50|$|Since each {{episode was}} {{approximately}} 12 minutes long, {{it was usually}} shown {{as part of a}} longer program. This was common at the time, as many stations across the United States <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shows,</b> often hosted by clowns, which consisted of shorts like Mack & Myer, Clutch Cargo and The Three Stooges combined with station-produced host segments. Like many sitcoms of the time, it featured a laugh track.|$|R

The forest on the hill was soft and warm, and but for the gleams of autumn, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>showed</b> some of the {{tenderness}} of spring. Down in the lowlands a sea of color waved under a blue, smoky, melancholy haze.|$|R
25|$|An ambitious {{general of}} the current Emperor of the Galaxy {{perceives}} the Foundation as a growing threat and orders an attack on it, using the Empire's still-mighty fleet of war vessels. The Emperor, initially supportive, becomes suspicious of his general's long-term motive for the attack, and recalls the fleet despite being close to victory. In spite of its undoubted inferiority in purely military terms, the Foundation emerges as the victor and the Empire itself is defeated. Seldon's hologram reappears in the vault on Terminus, and explains to the Foundation that this opening of the vault follows a conflict whose result was inevitable whatever might have been done – a weak Imperial navy could not have attacked them, while a strong navy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> itself by its successes to be {{a direct threat to}} the Emperor himself and been recalled.|$|E
25|$|A self-inflicted {{wound was}} the VOC's {{dividend}} policy. The dividends {{distributed by the}} company had exceeded the surplus it garnered in Europe in every decade but one (1710–1720) from 1690 to 1760. However, in the period up to 1730 the directors shipped resources to Asia {{to build up the}} trading capital there. Consolidated bookkeeping therefore probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that total profits exceeded dividends. In addition, between 1700 and 1740 the company retired 5.4 million guilders of long-term debt. The company therefore was still on a secure financial footing in these years. This changed after 1730. While profits plummeted the bewindhebbers only slightly decreased dividends from the earlier level. Distributed dividends were therefore in excess of earnings in every decade but one (1760–1770). To accomplish this, the Asian capital stock had to be drawn down by 4 million guilders between 1730 and 1780, and the liquid capital available in Europe was reduced by 20 million guilders in the same period. The directors were therefore constrained to replenish the company's liquidity by resorting to short-term financing from anticipatory loans, backed by expected revenues from home-bound fleets.|$|E
25|$|Although the Mariel Boatlift was {{partially}} a Cuban response to Western failure {{to take the}} dissident unadapted prisoners and ex prisoners out of Cuba, it was sparked by {{the removal of the}} Cuban security guards from the Embassy of Peru compound resulting in its being overrun by thousands of Cuban asylum seekers. Leaving the country was again in vogue as the US-Cuban relationship improved. Cuban members of divided families were encouraged to seek exit permission. For those for whom legal channels were not available, since early 1979, increasing numbers of Cubans had tried to gain access to Foreign Embassies in Havana to gain asylum and safe passage abroad. Large groups entered diplomatic compounds by jumping from adjacent buildings and by ramming gates and perimeter fences with buses and trucks. In such an attempt at the Embassy of Peru, a Cuban guard was killed by friendly fire. Cuba precipitously removed the perimeter guards and over ten thousand Cuban asylum seekers flooded the compound. Eventually 125,000 Cubans left the island in the ensuing months, mostly to the United States. Also during the Mariel period a large group of hundreds of Cuban ex-political prisoners and applicants to immigrate to the United States to rejoin family (civilians) waiting in front of the Interests Section was attacked by government employees in several buses and sought refuge inside the building. A junior Consular Officer, Susan Johnson, was accused of inciting the crowd on national TV and in Granma. The USG withdrew her to the Cuban desk in Washington (and she was expelled from Cuba as persona non grata). The Cubans had been secretly filming Consular crowd dispersal activities at the front entrance and used the film as evidence of incitement, but did not include the audio portion which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that there was no incitement.|$|E

500|$|In July 1982, {{during the}} film's first {{theatrical}} run, Steven Spielberg and Melissa Mathison wrote {{a treatment for}} a sequel to be titled E.T. II: Nocturnal Fears. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> Elliott and his friends getting kidnapped by evil aliens and follow their attempts to contact E.T. for help. Spielberg decided against pursuing it, feeling it [...] "would do nothing but rob the original of its virginity".|$|E
500|$|... "Trevor" [...] was co-written by Ken Hawryliw and Jim Guttridge, who {{developed}} a partnership after {{working on the}} television series Millennium. The episode was originally supposed to be set in Oklahoma, but was changed to Mississippi for budgetary reasons. In addition, many of the special effects used in the episode were created by conventional methods in order to not exceed {{the budget of the}} show; this included the removal of a scene that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> Pinker moving through the walls in a motel.|$|E
500|$|Talking {{about the}} scene where Fisk beheads Anatoly Ranskahov with a car door in [...] "In the Blood", DeKnight noted that series like Spartacus and The Walking Dead <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> the head being crushed, which he felt was [...] "the right choice" [...] for them, but for Daredevil [...] "we did very much a Psycho thing, we saw the aftereffects of it, but you never saw the car door {{crushing}} his head....Sound effects, absolutely.

500|$|By June 2002, {{the band}} had {{completed}} A Rush of Blood to the Head, but thought their output sounded [...] "rubbish" [...] and {{reached an agreement}} with the label to postpone the release of the album until they were completely satisfied. Subsequently, many songs were discarded because they sounded like they could have been on Parachutes. Martin has claimed {{that it would have been}} uninteresting: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that we're happy to sit back on what we'd done, and we're not.

500|$|In 2011, {{further study}} was {{conducted}} in the Smithsonian Channel's The Real Story: Jaws. [...] The documentary takes {{a closer look at the}} series of events from different perspectives. [...] It was demonstrated in the Matawan Creek attacks, for example, that the full moon of the lunar cycle, which would have coincided with the attacks, would have raised the salinity in the water by more than double just a few hours before high tide. [...] This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> support for the theory that a great white could have been responsible. [...] Other evidence such as Joseph Dunn's injury suggested that the type of bite was more likely made by a bull shark as opposed to a great white, leading some to believe more than one shark was likely involved in the five incidents.|$|E
500|$|Their {{relationship}} was further embittered by Speer's failure to mention Wolters by name in Speer's first book {{based on the}} Spandau material, Inside the Third Reich. [...] Speer's initial draft of the book, written while in Spandau, does mention his [...] "old university friend, Dr. Rudolf Wolters, to whom was assigned the most essential task, the Prachtstrasse" [...] {{in connection with the}} Berlin project. [...] However, Wolters' name appears nowhere in the published version, and no mention is made of Wolters' help, essential to the writing and preservation of the draft memoir. [...] Speer later told his future biographer, Gitta Sereny, that he did so to protect Wolters, since it might have been risky for Wolters to have been known to have assisted an imprisoned war criminal. [...] Sereny notes in her biography of Speer that {{it would not have been}} in Speer's interest to have publicized Wolter's assistance, given the growing disagreement between them over Speer's statements. [...] Wolter's son, Fritz, suggested that had Speer mentioned Wolters even once, [...] "it would have made all the difference", since it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that Speer acknowledged the debt he owed Wolters for his efforts during his incarceration.|$|E

Jacobs stated that though it was clear she and her partner Jesse Tafero were innocent of the charges, in order to facilitate his career advancement Satz bullied and threatened a female prisoner into falsifying evidence against Sunny as well as deliberately suppressing other evidence that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>showed</b> that Tafero and Jacobs were innocent.|$|R
500|$|Both Ben and Brother Justin {{would have}} been alive in the third season. Daniel Knauf would have written Brother Justin as a man [...] "with an {{inoperable}} chunk of shrapnel near his heart", which the anointed blade had caused in the final season 2 episode. Brother Justin {{would have been}} [...] "severely weakened and prone to exhaustion, serving as a hollow figurehead in his burgeoning ministry. Sofie and Iris would be vying for the power behind the throne, with Sofie by far the more dangerous of the two, although Iris is {{a force to be}} reckoned with." [...] Knauf had the intention of marrying Brother Justin to Sofie at some point in the future, and the third season <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> a three-year-old boy amidst Sofie and the Crowes. Knauf left the question about the child's parents open. Ben's future would face other hardships. According to Knauf, Ben's wounds of the season 2 finale would require repeated suturing, causing him to lose his Vitae Divina and draining him of strength. Ben would be a different man than he was before, with a personality closer to Management, and while he and Sofie would be bound together by love, their ultimate fates remain uncertain.|$|E
500|$|It {{had first}} been {{thought that the}} dwarfs would be {{the main focus of}} the story, and many {{sequences}} were written for the seven characters. However, at a certain point, it was decided that the main thrust of the story was provided by the relationship between the Queen and Snow White. For this reason, several sequences featuring the dwarfs were cut from the film. The first, which was animated in its entirety before being cut, showed Doc and Grumpy arguing about whether Snow White should stay with them. Another, also completely animated, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> the dwarfs eating soup noisily and messily; Snow White unsuccessfully attempts to teach them how to eat 'like gentlemen'. A partially animated sequence involved the dwarfs holding a [...] "lodge meeting" [...] in which they try to think of a gift for Snow White; this was to be followed by the elaborate 'bed building sequence', in which the dwarfs and the forest animals construct and carve a bed for the princess. This also was cut, as it was thought to slow down the movement of the story. The soup-eating and bed-building sequences were animated by Ward Kimball, who was sufficiently discouraged by their removal to consider leaving the studio, however Disney persuaded him to stay by promoting him to supervising animator of Jiminy Cricket in his next feature Pinocchio (1940).|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} {{opened with}} excerpts {{from two of}} the interviews prior to the title sequence, followed by an introduction from Jonathan Dimbleby, who told viewers that the evidence presented in the programme was [...] "of critical importance for {{those who wish to}} find out what really happened in Gibraltar last month". The commentary cut to Manyon, who introduced Styles and discussed the impact the IRA's bomb would have had, and then to Noreen Hill, whose husband was in a coma {{as a result of the}} Enniskillen bombing. Manyon pointed out that the IRA expressed regret after Enniskillen, but that they were by then already planning to attack Gibraltar. Manyon told viewers of the three IRA members' backgrounds, before introducing an interview with an official from the Spanish Interior Ministry, who discussed the Spanish surveillance operation, of which viewers were shown a reconstruction with a voice-over from Manyon. The programme reconstructed Savage's movements as he crossed the border into Gibraltar, parked his car in the assembly area for the ceremony and met up with McCann and Farrell, after which it broadcast part of Howe's statement to the House of Commons: [...] "Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicion that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car". Manyon explained that the vehicle was later found not to contain a bomb, and introduced Styles, who believed that such an examination <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> that the car did not contain a bomb, as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle's springs.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the final}} editing, Welles {{proposed}} {{to the studio}} that they keep his ending, but have a [...] "cheerful closing credits" [...] sequence to send audiences out happy. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> included <b>showing</b> an oval picture of a younger Major Amberson (Richard Bennett) in Civil War uniform; an image of Ray Collins sitting on a veranda with the ocean behind him; Agnes Moorehead busily playing cards with friends in the boarding house, and Joseph Cotten looking out a window as Tim Holt and Anne Baxter drive away together waving to him.
