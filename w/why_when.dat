By 1938, SR85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo and Why that would eventually become part of SR85.

In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo and Why was added to the state highway system, but as SR86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the United States-Mexico border with an overlap with SR86 between Ajo and <b>Why</b> <b>when</b> a county road was added to SR85.|$|E

25|$|Note: angular {{frequency}} ω (ω=2 π f) with the units of radians per second {{is often used}} in equations because it simplifies the equations, but is normally converted to ordinary frequency (units of Hz or equivalently cycles per second) when stating the frequency of a system. If the mass and stiffness {{of the system is}} known, the formula above can determine the frequency at which the system vibrates once set in motion by an initial disturbance. Every vibrating system has one or more natural frequencies that it vibrates at once disturbed. This simple relation can be used to understand in general what happens to a more complex system once we add mass or stiffness. For example, the above formula explains <b>why,</b> <b>when</b> a car or truck is fully loaded, the suspension feels ″softer″ than unloaded—the mass has increased, reducing the natural frequency of the system.|$|E

500|$|This leads Hazlitt to {{consider}} <b>why,</b> <b>when</b> Falstaff [...] "is {{represented as a}} liar, a braggart, a coward, a glutton, etc., [...] we are not offended but delighted with him [...]" [...] The answer is that [...] "he is all these as much to amuse others as to gratify himself. He openly assumes all these characters to shew the humourous part of them. The unrestrained indulgence of his own ease, appetites, and convenience, has neither malice nor hypocrisy in it. In a word, he is an actor in himself {{almost as much as}} upon the stage, and we no more object to the character of Falstaff in a moral point of view than we should think of bringing an excellent comedian, who should represent him to the life, before one of the police offices." ...|$|E

The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Latin uses {{morphology}} {{to express}} the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains <b>why</b> <b>when</b> in English, the phrase [...] "John is talking to Lucy" [...] is turned into a question, it becomes [...] "Who is John talking to?", and not [...] "John is talking to who?". The latter example {{may be used as}} a way of placing special emphasis on [...] "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels. To the right is a graphic representation of the syntactic analysis of the English sentence [...] "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.|$|E

500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors have been fighting {{for the last five years}} to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. This is a terrible thing for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I have heard that for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. <b>Why,</b> <b>when</b> we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E
500|$|The fair catch kick rule is {{very rarely}} invoked, {{and is one}} of the rarest plays in football. The rule has been {{regarded}} as [...] "obscure", [...] "bizarre", and [...] "quirky". [...] A unique set of circumstances is required for a fair catch kick to be a viable option. For one, the fair catch would need to be made at a point on the field where a field goal attempt has a reasonable chance of being successful; most fair catches are made well outside of field goal range (even more so since 1974, when the goal posts were moved back to the end line, adding 10 yards to such attempts). Furthermore, for a fair catch kick to be a viable option near the end of the fourth quarter, the team attempting the kick needs to be either tied or behind by three points or fewer; even if a game is tied, a fair catch kick might be unpalatable, as it is possible the ball lands in the field of play and the opponent returns it for a touchdown (hence <b>why,</b> <b>when</b> the possibility of a 75-yard fair catch kick arose in Super Bowl LI, the idea was nixed). In exceptional circumstances a team might try the kick at the end of the first half if only a few seconds remained, but Art McNally, who led the officiating department of the National Football League from 1968 to 1990, notes that, even in the event a fair catch is made within field goal range, most teams would attempt to score a touchdown unless there is not enough time left to score one. Accordingly, most fair catch kick attempts occur when a team has fair-caught a ball from a punt from deep in their opponent's territory, and there is not enough time left in the half to go for a touchdown.|$|E
