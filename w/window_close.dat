Features Digital Research removed from GEM {{as a result of}} the lawsuit included disk drive icons on the desktop, movable and resizable windows in the file manager, shading in the title bars, and window open/close animations. In addition, visual elements including the scrollbar thumbs and the <b>window</b> <b>close</b> button were changed to be less similar to those in the Mac GUI.|$|E
500|$|American kestrels do not train {{so easily}} as some larger falcons (particularly the Peregrine falcon) {{in the art}} of [...] "waiting on" [...] to perform a diving stoop on flushed prey. [...] However, some {{individual}} kestrels do master this skill. [...] Falconers sometimes train them to climb to a stooping position with tidbids on kites or balloons that the kestrels learn to climb after. [...] More common hunting techniques are to [...] "slip" [...] them after spotted game from the fist, or to release them from a vehicle <b>window</b> <b>close</b> to spotted quarry. [...] These techniques are more of a natural fit to the kestrel's ambushing methods in the wild.|$|E

60|$|They {{stood at}} the open <b>window,</b> <b>close</b> together, hands locked, gazing out over the quiet valley. The moon was full, and broad belts of silver light lay in strong {{contrast}} to black shadows. The hour was late. The sentries paced their beats.|$|E

60|$|The Scarlet Pimpernel, Percy Blakeney, her husband, was in {{the hands}} of the Terrorists of France, and though face to face with her now, with an open <b>window</b> <b>close</b> to him, and an {{apparently}} helpless enemy under his hand, he could not--owing to the fiendish measures taken by Chauvelin--raise a finger to save himself and her.|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth made {{a gesture}} which was vaguely {{expressive}} of resignation, and in another moment would have closed the bargain, but the footsteps grew plainer, and, as he turned round, Acton appeared at the open <b>window</b> <b>close</b> behind them. He stood still, looking at them with amusement in his shrewd eyes, and then, stepping out, dropped heavily into the nearest chair.|$|E
60|$|A cry {{of terror}} {{from her mother}} echoed the cry from above; {{the sound of the}} opening and closing of the door {{followed}} instantly. Then there was a momentary silence. Then Mrs. Ronald's voice was heard from the upper room calling to the nurse, asleep in the front parlour. The nurse's gruff tones were just audible, answering from the parlour door. There was another interval of silence; broken by another voice--a stranger's voice--speaking at the open <b>window,</b> <b>close</b> by.|$|E

60|$|While these {{thoughts}} were passing through his mind, {{he had stopped}} insensibly at the <b>window,</b> <b>close</b> to which stood {{the foot of the}} bed with the closed curtains. At first he looked at it absently; then he became conscious that his eyes were fixed on it; and then a perverse desire took possession of him to do the very thing which he had resolved not to do up to this time--to look at the dead man.|$|E
60|$|What she saw outside {{might have}} struck terror into a heart stouter than a {{helpless}} woman's at midnight. In {{the centre of}} the lowest pane of the <b>window,</b> <b>close</b> to the glass, was a human face, which she barely recognized as the face of Fitzpiers. It was surrounded with the darkness of the night without, corpse-like in its pallor, and covered with blood. As disclosed in the square area of the pane it met her frightened eyes like a replica of the Sudarium of St. Veronica.|$|E
60|$|So sweet a place I {{had never}} seen: no palace in Persia could be pleasanter; there were {{flowers in the}} garden; and six red cheeks, like six moss-roses, hanging from the casement. At the embowered doorway, sat an old man, confidentially communing with his pipe: while a little child, {{sprawling}} on the ground, was playing with his shoestrings. A hale matron, but with rather a prim expression, was reading a journal by his side: and three charmers, three Peris, three Houris! were leaning out of the <b>window</b> <b>close</b> by.|$|E

6000|$|Here alone did I {{leave the}} carriage, but I had Cooper's Spy and my sketch-book as companions while waiting at doors where the {{inhabitants}} were at home. The last visit was at Hillside Rectory, {{a house of}} architecture somewhat similar to our own, but of the soft creamy stone which so well set off the vine with purple clusters, the myrtles and fuchsias, that covered it. I was wishing we had drawn up far enough off for a sketch to be possible, when, from a <b>window</b> <b>close</b> above, I heard the following words in a clear girlish voice - ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} midnight, when Amyas leaped to his feet, or rather fell upon his back, {{upsetting}} saddle, settle, and finally, table, under {{the notion that}} ten thousand flying dragons were bursting in the <b>window</b> <b>close</b> to his ear, with howls most fierce and fell. The flying dragons past, however, being only a flock of terror-stricken geese, which flew flapping and screaming round {{the corner of the}} house; but the noise which had startled them did not pass; and another minute made it evident that a sharp fight {{was going on in the}} courtyard, and that Yeo was hallooing lustily for help.|$|E
60|$|When the men {{had been}} placed in the two {{vehicles}} in which the police had come, the Chief and I made an examination of the premises, and we found that the house had been entered by a kitchen window, in exactly the manner which the tall burglar had described. Outside of this <b>window,</b> <b>close</b> to the wall, we found a leathern bag, containing what the Chief declared to be an excellent assortment of burglars' tools. The officers and their prisoners now drove away, and we were left to a long morning nap, if we were so fortunate as to get it, and a late breakfast.|$|E
60|$|And {{the noise}} was again heard of a <b>window</b> <b>closing.</b> The little spot moved away. When she passed the corner a subdued exclamation was heard inside the wall.|$|R
50|$|On 1 September 2009, {{just before}} the {{transfer}} <b>window</b> <b>closed,</b> Bayern and Premier League club Stoke City came to an agreement for Lell transfer to England. However, the deal failed {{when no one was}} able to contact Lell and inform him about it. As a result, the transfer <b>window</b> <b>closed</b> before Lell could agree to the transfer. In the 2009-10 season, new Bayern coach Louis van Gaal relegated Lell to the reserves, where he made an appearance. He almo made an appearance in the cup for the first team.|$|R

6000|$|But {{the words}} were hardly {{out of her mouth}} when the shoes gave one jump, and took her downstairs, through the hall, and landed her at the kitchen door. Her breath was nearly gone; but she gave the message, and turned round, trying to see if the shoes would let her walk at all. They went nicely till she wanted to turn into the china-closet where the cake was. She was {{forbidden}} to touch it, but loved to take a bit when she could. Now she found that her feet were fixed fast to the floor, and could not be moved till her father said, as he passed the <b>window</b> <b>close</b> by,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Harold's face {{just showed}} from another <b>window</b> <b>close</b> by. Too soon or too late might {{either of them}} be fatal. He glanced inquiry at me. I nodded back, 'Now!' The train gave its first jerk, a faint {{backward}} jerk, indicative of the nascent intention of starting. As it braced itself to go on, I jumped out; so did Harold. We faced one another on the platform without a word. 'Stand away there:' the station-master cried, in an angry voice. The guard waved his green flag. The detective, still absorbed on the signals, never once looked back. One second later, we were safe at Dunbar, and he was speeding away by the express for Edinburgh.|$|E
60|$|The {{third was}} a very soft gurgle or rattle--of a strange and {{abnormal}} kind--yet a sound she had heard before at some past period of her life--when, she could not recollect. To make it the more disturbing, {{it seemed to be}} almost close to her--either close outside the <b>window,</b> <b>close</b> under the floor, or close above the ceiling. The accidental fact of its coming so immediately upon the heels of her supposition, told so powerfully upon her excited nerves that she jumped up in the bed. The same instant, a little dog in some room near, having probably heard the same noise, set up a low whine. The watch-dog in the yard, hearing the moan of his associate, began to howl loudly and distinctly. His melancholy notes were taken up directly afterwards by the dogs in the kennel a long way off, in every variety of wail.|$|E
