Long pastas should have less {{moisture}} content (and therefore less water) so {{they will be able}} to stretch during the extrusion. Short pastas need less moisture content due to rapid cutting. Various dosing systems are used to pump the water to the mixture. The most common ones are piston pumps in which the <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> is controlled by adjusting the piston stroke, screw feeder, and gear and lobe pumps where the speed of the rotation determines the water flow.

2500|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{analogy is}} sometimes {{used to describe}} Ohm's law. [...] Water pressure, measured by pascals (or PSI), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow. [...] <b>Water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> as in liters per second, is the analog of current, as in coulombs per second. Finally, flow restrictors—such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured—are the analog of resistors. We say {{that the rate of}} water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor.|$|E

40|$|Adsorptive bubble-separation {{processes}} {{are used to}} remove adsorptive contaminants from wastewater. A mathematical model was developed for the adsorptive bubble separation processes in a countercurrent column. The model included an assumption that linear adsorption of the solute occurred on the gas bubbles. Predictions indicated that aqueous column height has less effect on the solute removal efficiency than <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> gas <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> or bubble size. Increased <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> reduce removal efficiency; greater gas <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> increase removal efficiency. The maximum removal efficiency is determined by adsorption characteristics of the solute; the removal rate is controlled by mass-transfer rate. However, influent concentrations of the solute in the water phase do not affect removal efficiency. These predictions were tested by means of solvent sublation experiments conducted in a laboratory setting. The {{data were collected from}} the sublation of Triton-X 100 in a water-ethyl acetate-nitrogen system. Linear regression was used to compare predictions and experimental data with respect to column height. Five column heights ranged from 30 to 100 cm were compared at three <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates,</b> 3. 0, 5. 5 and 13. 0 ml/min. The calculated column heights agreed the observed column heights well. As the model predicted, the effect of influent concentraion on the removal efficiency was not significant. The surface excess of Triton-X 100 (0. 75 E- 10 to 7. 5 E- 10 g mole/cm?) estimated from the adsorption constant in the model agrees with other published values (2. 6 E- 10 to 2. 8 E- 10 g mole/cm?). The mass-transfer coefficients of Triton-X 100 in water (kL, which ranged from 0. 50 to 0. 60 cm/min) determined from the model and experimental data at 3. 0, 5. 5, 8. 0 and 13. 0 ml/min <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> (Qw) are proportional to the 0. 124 power of the <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> = 0. 0441 Qwo. 124 This empirical exponent correlation between mass-transfer coefficients and <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> for the adsorption processes is similar to the correlation determined from previous absorption models...|$|R

40|$|Two-D {{numerical}} {{flow and}} transport experiments were performed with a meter-sized unsaturated fractured block {{in an attempt}} to validate the active fracture model (AFM) by estimating {gamma}, a positive constant relating the fraction of active fractures to the effective water saturation for the block. Two different models developed for the study include a discrete fracture network model (DFNM) and a dual continuum model (DCM). The DFNM served to synthetically generate experimental measurements for <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> and tracer breakthroughs, against which numerical simulation data with DCM was calibrated to estimate {gamma} values for the fracture network. <b>Water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were monitored at both top and bottom to find balanced (''pseudo-steady'') states, when a pulse of tracer injection was initiated {{from the top of the}} block. During the transient state, <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in DCM did not closely predict the measurements from DFNM, which show step-wise increments with time. Based on goodness-of-fit values, the <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in the range of 7. 12 x 10 {sup - 8 } and 7. 12 x 10 {sup - 7 } kg/s (0. 2 - 2. 0 % of the saturated <b>flow</b> <b>rate)</b> provide better estimates of {gamma}. The DCM may be not suitable to estimate {gamma} when the injection rates are too high or low. <b>Water</b> <b>flows</b> predominantly through a few major fractures as preferential fast flow when the injection rate is high (> 10 % of saturated <b>flow</b> <b>rate),</b> and capillary pressure solely governs <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> when the injection rate is low (< 0. 02 %). At pseudo-steady state, tracer breakthrough curves show that DCM simulates very well the tracer transport in DFNM, however, the breakthroughs were not strongly sensitive to {gamma}. The results suggest that transient flow experiments within a certain range of injection rates would provide more reliable estimates of {gamma}...|$|R
