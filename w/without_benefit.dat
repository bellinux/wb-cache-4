5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer <b>without</b> <b>benefit,</b> it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{determine}} whether receipt of social {{supplemental security income}} (SSI) or Social Security disability income (SSDI) disability payments is associated with increased drug and alcohol use. Data Sources/Study Setting. Secondary analysis of data from 6, 199 participants in the Access to Community Care and Effective Social Supports and Services demonstra-tion for the homeless mentally ill. Design. Observational, 12 -month, cohort study completed over 4 years. Substance abuse and other outcomes were compared between the participants who did not receive SSI or SSDI during the 12 -month study, those newly awarded <b>benefits,</b> and those <b>without</b> <b>benefits</b> throughout the 12 months. Data Collection Methods. Social Security administrative records were used to cor-roborate Social Security benefit status. Drug and alcohol use were measured by self-report and clinician ratings. Principal Findings. Participants who did not receive benefits significantly reduced their substance use over time. In generalized estimating equations models that adjusted for potentially confounding covariates, participants who newly received Social Security benefits showed no greater drug use than those <b>without</b> <b>benefits</b> but had significantly more days housed and fewer days employed. Participants whose benefits antedated the demonstration and continued during the 12 months had more clinician-rated drug use over time than those <b>without</b> <b>benefits.</b> Conclusions. In this vulnerable population, participants with newly awarded benefits {{did not have any}} different drug use changes than those <b>without</b> <b>benefits,</b> and had relatively more days housed. The hypothesis that Social Security benefits facilitate drug use was not supported by longitudinal data in this high-risk population. Key Words.
