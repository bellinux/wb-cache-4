5|$|Fragment of a Crucifixion is a 1950 canvas by the Irish-born, English figurative painter Francis Bacon, {{housed in}} the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. The {{painting}} shows two animals engaged in brutal struggle. The upper figure, which may be a dog or a cat, crouches over a chimera and is {{at the point of}} kill. It stoops on the horizontal beam of a T-shaped structure, which may signify Christ's cross. The painting contains thinly sketched passer-by figures, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> oblivious to the central drama.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Detectives Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) {{inspect the}} case of an interracial couple who are shot dead in their car at Fairmount Park. This case leads them to many suspects, {{including}} one of the victim's parents, Al (Barry Shabaka Henley) and Laura (Brenda Pressley), both <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to be hiding secrets about the couple's relationship.|$|E
5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops {{seems to have been}} an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was not always possible in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing.|$|E

5|$|North & South is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} the BBC and originally broadcast in four episodes on BBC One in November and December 2004. It follows the story of Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), a young woman from southern England who has {{to move to the}} North after her father decides to leave the clergy. The family struggles to adjust itself to the industrial town's customs, especially after meeting the Thorntons, a proud family of cotton mill owners <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to despise their social inferiors. The story explores the issues of class and gender, as Margaret's sympathy for the town mill workers clashes with her growing attraction to John Thornton (Richard Armitage).|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress out of the window, which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E

25|$|Several Gandharan sculptures {{also show}} {{foreigner}} in soft tunics, sometimes wearing the typical Scythian cap.

25|$|Individual skill was {{generally}} on England's side, the dribbling of Kirke-Smith, Brockbank and Ottaway being very fine, while Welch, half-back, showed himself {{a safe and}} good kick.

25|$|In the serial, the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce (UNIT), {{including}} Liz Shaw (Caroline John) and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney), {{investigate the}} disappearance of astronauts who have lost contact with Earth.

25|$|The {{official}} {{position of the}} present Cuban government is still that Mella was killed at Gerardo Machado's orders, but it admits that Tina Modotti was a Stalinist operative who operated {{in a number of}} countries. Yet there are some even in Cuba <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to believe that Vidali did it. Adding to the mystery, according to Albers (2002), both Magriñat and Diego Rivera, who had just returned from Cuba, had warned Mella that he was in danger.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning, the bear inexplicably begins to hammer away at iron. He's roaring loudly, {{almost as if}} in song, and no one understands why. However, the men join him and, in essence, lose {{themselves}} in the hard work. Prushevsky does not follow suit. A girl asks him to teach her knowledge, and he leaves the worksite with her. The activist receives {{a letter from the}} Soviet government stating that any peasants <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> too willing to have their property collectivized should be treated with suspicion as undercover agents.|$|E
25|$|Verhofstadt led the VLD {{into the}} 2007 general election. Already with the 2006 {{municipal}} elections, the VLD {{showed signs of}} fatigue with the Flemish voter, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to have had enough of eight years of Verhofstadt, and the purple coalition governments. In an evening speech on election day, Verhofstadt conceded defeat {{and asked for a}} new generation to lead the VLD; he was to step down as prime minister after formation of a new government. However, the formation of a new government was complicated, and in the end, CD politician Yves Leterme failed to bring about a new government.|$|E

25|$|Australian {{historian}} Les Carlyon {{wrote that}} while Haig {{was slow to}} adapt to the correct use of artillery in sufficient quantities to support infantry attacks and was generally sceptical that the science of such doctrine had much place in military theory, he was fully supportive of excellent corps and field commanders such as Herbert Plumer, Arthur Currie and John Monash, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to best grasp and exercise these concepts, especially later in the war. Carlyon also wrote out that there was a case to answer, for his support of more dubious commanders such as Ian Hamilton, Aylmer Hunter-Weston and Hubert Gough.|$|E
25|$|Not {{mentioned}} on {{the site}} are conflicts of Anglo and Hispanic settlers with Indians, usually Comanche or Tonkawa, and raids by outlaw gangs. These small scale incidents are mentioned, {{more or less in}} passing, in memoirs and histories but their losses added up. Casualties of these fights, excluding Indians and the outlaws <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to have been left where slain or hanged and buried wherever expedient, were interred at the city cemetery; an example is Texas Ranger Captain Michael E. van Buren, who died in 1851 as a result of wounds suffered during a fight with Indians.|$|E

Christy tries to {{resuscitate}} him using CPR, although she is warned away from him by the other residents, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to be aware that he is HIV-positive. The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is born prematurely and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief nervous breakdown and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him.|$|E

25|$|From 1850 on, small {{communities}} established themselves in elsewhere in Azerbaijan. Soon {{the community of}} Baku counted {{the largest number of}} believers in the region and in 1860 obtained official recognition from the authorities. The community recognized the newly announced position of Bahá'u'lláh. Soon there was more public awareness and some favor from leaders of the broader community {{and at the same time}} the Bahá'í community of Baku broadened its communication with other Bahá'í communities in Russia, Turkey and Ashkhabad and did much work printing materials in Turkish. The most publicly recognized member of the community approaching 1900 was Musa Nagiyev, one of Azerbaijan's richest citizens of the times though there were many public figures before and after <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to have admired the religion or even been members of it.|$|E
25|$|Picard {{wakes up}} to find himself {{on the surface of}} Kataan, a non-Federation planet. A woman {{identifies}} herself as his wife, Eline, telling Picard that he is Kamin, an iron weaver recovering from a feverish sickness. Picard talks of his memories on the Enterprise, but Eline and their close friend Batai try to convince Picard that his memories were only dreams, and acclimate him into their society as Kamin. Picard begins living out his life as Kamin in the village of Ressik, starting a family with Eline, and learning to play the flute. Kamin spends much time outdoors and with his Dobsonian telescope studying nature. As the years pass, he begins to notice that the planet is suffering a worldwide drought owing to increased radiation from the planet's sun. He sends reports to the planet's leaders, <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to ignore his concerns.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} evidence of early domestication comes from the Botai culture, found in northern Kazakhstan. The Botai culture was a culture of foragers <b>who</b> <b>seem</b> to have adopted horseback riding in order to hunt the abundant wild horses of northern Kazakhstan between 3500–3000 BCE. Botai sites had no cattle or sheep bones; the only domesticated animals, in addition to horses, were dogs. Botai settlements in this period contained between 50–150 pit houses. Garbage deposits contained tens to hundreds of thousands of discarded animal bones, 65% to 99% of which had come from horses. Also, there has been evidence found of horse milking at these sites, with horse milk fats soaked into pottery shards dating to 3500 BCE. Earlier hunter-gatherers who lived in the same region had not hunted wild horses with such success, and lived for millennia in smaller, more shifting settlements, often containing less than 200 wild animal bones.|$|E
