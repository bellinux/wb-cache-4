After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I remember he said, 'So, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think we should continue with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'" [...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{did not speak}} from their breakup until 2008. That August, Jerry Finn {{suffered}} a cerebral hemorrhage and was taken off life support. On September 19, Barker and Goldstein {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving the two the only survivors. Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4-8 hour blood transfusions. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of the}} night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat. [...] "I thought he was going to die," [...] says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the pronominal system in Asian Englishes, namely Indian English, Singapore English, Hong-Kong English and the Philippines English. The object of study is the second person pronoun in the plural form, which, in Present-Day English, presents the canonical form you (ambiguous between the singular and the plural) and also new forms which {{have been added to the}} paradigm (Kortmann and Schneider 2004 : 1142), and which are unambiguously plural, as is the case of <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> (e. g. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> talk last Friday) or you all (e. g. You all can leave now) among others. Thus, in this study I intend to analyze the factors that determine the selection of the alternative forms other than you and show how the gap in the paradigm for the second person plural person in PDE in Asian Englishes is being filled with these alternative forms...|$|R

Years later, Bozak recounted this story about the Conn electronic organ project: [...] "The general sales manager, who was a pianist and played organ, sat down and played the thing and said it was great, just what we were looking for. A week later he was invited back into the laboratory and sat down and played the instrument again. He didn’t play ten or fifteen bars when he said, This goddamn thing doesn’t sound right. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> to it?’ We said we hadn’t done anything. Well, he didn’t believe us. ‘You did something to it. You messed it up here,’ he said. ‘Restore it back to the way you had it.’ So <b>what</b> we <b>did</b> was let the damn instrument sit there for another week, and he comes back and plays it again. ‘Now {{this is the way it}} should be,’ he says." ...|$|R

While Trebelhorn's tenure as Cubs manager was short, it was memorable. Following a slow start in which the Cubs failed to win their first 10 home games, Trebelhorn promised reporters that if the Cubs lost the next game, he'd answer questions from fans {{in front of the}} firehouse across Waveland Avenue from Wrigley Field. True to form, the Cubs lost the next game. True to his word, Trebelhorn marched across the street shortly after the game and held court.

500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish.
