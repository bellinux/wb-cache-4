50|$|The nation's {{wildlife}} {{is threatened}} by hunting. As of 2001, twenty-one mammal species and nine bird species are endangered, {{as well as two}} species of plants.

50|$|The {{southern}} {{bald ibis}} (Geronticus calvus) is a large bird found in open grassland or semi-desert {{in the mountains of}} southern Africa.Taxonomically, it is most closely related to its counterpart in the northern regions of Africa, the <b>waldrapp</b> (Geronticus eremita). As a species, it has a very restricted homerange, limited to the southern tips of South Africa in highland and mountainous regions.|$|E
50|$|The genus name, Geronticus, {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek , meaning old man and refers to the bald head of the aged. Eremita is Late Latin for hermit, from the Greek , meaning desert, and refers to the arid {{habitats}} inhabited by this species. The alternative common name <b>waldrapp</b> is German for forest crow, the equivalent of the Latin Corvo sylvatico of Gesner, adapted as Corvus sylvaticus by Linnaeus.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} bald ibis, hermit ibis, or <b>waldrapp</b> (Geronticus eremita) is a {{migratory bird}} found in barren, semi-desert or rocky habitats, often close to running water. This 70 - 80 cm glossy black ibis, which, unlike {{other members of}} the ibis family, is non-wading, has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals.|$|E
50|$|Studies of <b>waldrapp</b> ibis {{show that}} birds {{spatially}} coordinate {{the phase of}} wing flapping and show wingtip path coherence when flying in V positions, thus enabling them to maximally utilise the available energy of upwash over the entire flap cycle. In contrast, birds flying in a stream immediately one behind another do not have wingtip coherence in their flight pattern and their flapping is out of phase, as compared to birds flying in V patterns, {{so as to avoid}} the detrimental effects of the downwash due to the leading bird's flight.|$|E
50|$|Desertification is {{a serious}} problem in the Sudans. There is also concern over soil erosion. Agricultural expansion, both public and private, has {{proceeded}} without conservation measures. The consequences have manifested themselves in the form of deforestation, soil desiccation, and the lowering of soil fertility and the water table.The nation's wildlife is threatened by hunting. As of 2001, twenty-one mammal species and nine bird species are endangered, as well as two species of plants. endangered species include: the <b>waldrapp,</b> northern white rhinoceros, tora hartebeest, slender-horned gazelle, and hawksbill turtle. The Sahara oryx has become extinct in the wild.|$|E
50|$|Hornbill Hill was a {{steep and}} narrow pathway that {{featured}} enclosures for <b>Waldrapp</b> ibis, southern ground hornbill, black hornbill, red-billed blue magpie {{and at the}} top of the hill there is an enclosure that has previously held snow leopard, fossa, giant anteater and various New World monkeys and an African aviary that normally holds purple gallinule, hamerkop, Von der Decken's hornbill and curlew. There is also a small hidden enclosure for Geoffroy's cat. The Hornbill Hill aviaries, Geoffroy's cat enclosure and part of the Medellin Monkeys exhibit have all been demolished to make way for the new sun bear enclosure.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} {{bald ibis}} {{is part of the}} genus Geronticus, which includes two distinct species. The {{southern bald ibis}} (Geronticus calvus) is restricted primarily to the southern regions of Africa whereas its counterpart, the <b>waldrapp</b> (Geronticus eremita) is found in the northern regions of the continent. Both species share common characteristics regardless of their geographic separation. Both species nest on rock cliffs and display distinct breeding behaviours adapted for their particular locations. Similarly, they both show evolutionary adaptations in foraging behaviours due to their dry habitats. The separation between these two species is believed to have occurred relatively recently. This separation, between G. calvus and G. eremita, is believed to have occurred only 335 000 to 1 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|In 1504, {{a decree}} by Archbishop Leonhard of Salzburg made the {{northern}} bald ibis one of the world's earliest officially protected species. Despite the decree, it died out in Austria as elsewhere in Europe. There are now two ibis reintroduction projects in the country, at Gr端nau and Kuchl.http://waldrapp.eu/index.php/en/project-sites/breeding-area-kuchl A research station at Gr端nau has a breeding colony managed, like the Turkish population, as a free-flying flock which is caged at migration time. The aim here is to investigate flock interactions and hormonal status, behavioural and ecological aspects of natural foraging, {{and the establishment of}} traditions via social learning.The Scharnstein Project is an attempt to establish a migratory <b>waldrapp</b> colony by using ultralight planes to teach a migration route. The scheme builds on the Gr端nau research by developing a method to control and guide the autumn migration of a founder population, which then can pass this migration tradition to subsequent generations. In May 2002, 11 birds from the Vienna Zoo and the Gr端nau colony were trained to follow two microlight planes, and in 2003, a first attempt was made to lead a group of birds from Scharnstein to southern Tuscany. Due to adverse weather and technical problems, the birds had to be transported by road over a considerable part of the distance. The subsequent releases were more successful, with birds wintering in Tuscany, and, from 2005, returning to northern Austria. In 2008, a female ibis named Aurelia flew 930 km back to Austria for her fourth return to the breeding site. The hazards of the journey are shown by the loss of her two offspring and her mate while on the southern journey in the autumn of 2007.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Waldrapp</b> ibis (Geronticus eremita), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} bald ibis and the hermit ibis, is listed as highly endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. To date, only approximately 100 breeding pairs are thought to remain in the wild, and captive breeding programs are critical for the survival of this species (www. iucnredlist. org). However, descriptions of diseases arising in <b>Waldrapp</b> ibis and of their relative sensitivity to common pathogens are sparse. Previous reports have cited mycobacteriosis, strepto-coccal endocarditis, gastric foreign bodies, ulcerative derma-titis, and trauma as causes of disease in captivity (Quevad...|$|E
