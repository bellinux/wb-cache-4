25|$|In 1950, Canadian {{electrical}} engineer John Hopps {{designed and built}} the first external pacemaker based upon observations by cardio-thoracic surgeon's Wilfred Gordon Bigelow and John Callaghan at Toronto General Hospital, although the device was first tested at the University of Toronto's Banting Institute on a dog. A substantial external device using vacuum tube technology to provide transcutaneous pacing, it was somewhat crude and painful to the patient in use and, being powered from an AC <b>wall</b> <b>socket,</b> carried a potential hazard of electrocution of the patient and inducing ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|Alternating current (AC) is an {{electric}} current which periodically reverses direction, {{in contrast to}} direct current (DC) which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, {{and it is the}} form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into a <b>wall</b> <b>socket.</b> A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight. The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct, as when they modify current or voltage.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{rechargeable}} {{electric vehicles}} and equipment can be recharged from a domestic <b>wall</b> <b>socket,</b> a charging station is usually accessible to multiple electric vehicles and has additional current or connection sensing [...] mechanisms to {{disconnect the power}} when the EV is not charging.|$|E

2500|$|Engineers {{invented the}} first loud, {{powerful}} amplifier and speaker systems for public address systems and movie theaters. These large PA systems and movie theatre sound systems were {{very large and}} very expensive, and so {{they could not be}} used by most touring musicians. After 1927, smaller, portable AC mains-powered PA systems that could be plugged into a regular <b>wall</b> <b>socket</b> [...] "quickly became popular with musicians"; indeed, [...] "...Leon McAuliffe (with Bob Wills) still used a carbon mic and a portable PA as late as 1935." [...] During the late 1920s to mid-1930s, small portable PA systems and guitar combo amplifiers were fairly similar. These early amps had a [...] "single volume control and one or two input jacks, field coil speakers" [...] and thin wooden cabinets; remarkably, these early amps did not have tone controls or even an on-off switch.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defibrillator}} {{designed by}} Zoll, {{as well as}} earlier versions invented by Kouwenhoven and Beck, utilized alternating current and were run from line voltage, the electricity from any <b>wall</b> <b>socket.</b> The decision to use alternating current rather than direct current was a practical one. Direct current batteries and capacitor technology both powerful enough {{to do the job}} and portable enough for practical use simply didn't exist in the early 1950s. These AC defibrillators were very large and heavy, primarily because they contained a transformer to step up the line voltage from [...] to 500 or [...] The only good feature is that they could be mounted on wheels and pushed down the hallway from one part of the hospital to another. Not many lives would be saved unless the inherent non-portability of AC defibrillators could be solved.|$|E
2500|$|The Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid, {{produced}} {{as early as}} 1899, was the first hybrid electric car. Early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation. However, the term [...] "plug-in hybrid" [...] has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical <b>wall</b> <b>socket.</b> The term [...] "plug-in hybrid electric vehicle" [...] was coined by UC Davis Professor Andrew Frank, who {{has been called the}} [...] "father of the modern plug-in hybrid." [...] The July 1969 issue of Popular Science featured an article on the General Motors XP-883 plug-in hybrid. The concept commuter vehicle housed six [...] leadâ€“acid batteries in the trunk area and a transverse-mounted DC electric motor turning a front-wheel drive. [...] The car could be plugged into a standard North American 120 volt AC outlet for recharging.|$|E
50|$|An optical {{guidance}} system {{was added to}} Mod II. This provided, among other capabilities, the ability to optically identify the black <b>wall</b> <b>sockets</b> that contrasted with the white wall.|$|R
50|$|For example, a {{computer}} could be wired to a router as follows: an adapter {{is connected to}} a router of an existing wired local-area network, via its network port. A second adapter is connected to an Ethernet-ready device like {{a computer}}. When both adapters are plugged into their <b>wall</b> <b>sockets</b> {{they will have a}} network connection via the electrical wiring in between the two <b>wall</b> <b>sockets</b> being used. Some networking devices, such as routers or switches, also have power line connectivity built in. This adds no new wires since they need to be plugged into the wall to operate anyway.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Vitrometan" [...] factory {{was built}} in 1922 and {{produces}} various glass products, including porcelain, light bulbs and mirrors. [...] "Relee S.A" [...] manufactures automobile components, switches, <b>wall</b> <b>sockets,</b> relays and electric motors.|$|R
2500|$|The term plug is {{in general}} and {{technical}} use in all forms of English, common alternatives being power plug, [...] electric plug, and (in the UK) plug top. The normal technical term (in both British and International English) for an AC power socket is socket-outlet, but in non-technical contexts {{a number of other}} terms are in common use. In British English the general term is socket, but there are numerous common alternatives, including power point, plug socket, <b>wall</b> <b>socket,</b> and wall plug. In American English receptacle (which is a term not defined in IEC 60050) is used in official standards and codes such as the NEMA connector standard and the National Electrical Code. [...] The American National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) defines outlet as [...] "A point on the wiring system at which current is taken to supply utilization equipment." [...] In common use outlet is used to refer to the actual receptacle or socket, sometimes with qualifiers such as wall outlet, electrical outlet and electrical receptacle, all of these sometimes {{to be found in the}} same document. [...] There is also colloquial use of socket in American English.|$|E

25|$|As of 1 July 2008, <b>wall</b> <b>sockets</b> for French 2-pin, female earth CEE 7/5 are {{permitted}} for installations in Denmark. This was done because no electrical equipment sold to private users {{is equipped with}} a Danish plug.|$|R
50|$|Plugpoint {{is a well}} {{established}} term for electrical power-supply devices, such as specific types of <b>wall</b> <b>sockets,</b> remote-controlled power devices, and other similar devices. Plugpoint may also refer to the locations where plug-in appliances are permitted at trade shows or other activities where flexible power facilities are required.|$|R
50|$|Mains {{electricity}} is the general-purpose alternating-current (AC) electric power supply. Mains {{electricity is}} {{the form of}} electrical power that is delivered to homes and businesses, {{and it is the}} form of electrical power that consumers use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions and electric lamps into <b>wall</b> <b>sockets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} sensors in Mod I were physical touch only. The <b>wall</b> <b>socket</b> {{was detected}} by physical switches on the arm that followed the wall. Once detected, two electrical prongs were extended until they entered the <b>wall</b> <b>socket</b> and made the electrical connection to charge the vehicle. The stairway, doors, and pipes on the hall wall were also detected by physical switches and recognized by appropriate logic.|$|E
50|$|The {{cable is}} {{available}} in both stranded and solid conductor forms. The stranded form is more flexible and withstands more bending without breaking. Permanent wiring (for example, the wiring inside the wall that connects a <b>wall</b> <b>socket</b> to a central patch panel) is solid-core, while patch cables (for example, the movable cable that plugs into the <b>wall</b> <b>socket</b> on one end and a computer on the other) are stranded.|$|E

5000|$|A very {{successful}} August 1925 product, called the [...] "Socket Power Battery Eliminator", was a rectifier unit that allowed users to operate their battery-powered radios from standard light or <b>wall</b> <b>sockets.</b> By 1927 {{over a million}} of these units had been sold. However, {{the invention of the}} vacuum tube rectifier (incorporated into the coming 1928 line of radio sets) made this technology obsolete.|$|R
5000|$|Manual. Manual {{vibrators}} {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of designs. Some manual vibrators are powered from <b>wall</b> <b>sockets,</b> such as the Hitachi Magic Wand. This makes them somewhat less convenient, but generally allows the vibrator to offer more intense stimulation and better durability. At the other end of the spectrum are small battery operated vibrators that can be worn on a finger, which is suited for couples' play.|$|R

25|$|The first {{electric}} instrument amplifiers {{were not}} intended for electric guitars, but were portable PA systems. These {{appeared in the}} early 1930s when the introduction of electrolytic capacitors and rectifier tubes enabled economical built-in power supplies that could plug into <b>wall</b> <b>sockets.</b> Previously, amplifiers required heavy multiple battery packs. People used these amplifiers to amplify acoustic guitar, but electronic amplification of guitar first became widely poplular in the 1930s and 1940s craze for Hawaiian music, which extensively used amplified lap steel guitars.|$|R
