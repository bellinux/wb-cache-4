5|$|Fortinet {{was founded}} in 2000 by {{brothers}} Ken and Michael Xie. It raised about $93 million in funding by 2004 and introduced ten FortiGate appliances. That same year {{was the beginning of}} a recurring patent dispute between Fortinet and Trend Micro. The company went public in 2009, raising $156 million through an initial public offering. Throughout the 2000s, Fortinet diversified its product lines, adding products for <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> points, sandboxing, and messaging security, among others.|$|E
5|$|The IEEE 802.3af Power over Ethernet (PoE) {{standard}} specifies a {{more elaborate}} power negotiation scheme than powered USB. It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> points, and other networked devices within buildings. However, USB is cheaper than PoE provided that the distance is short and power demand is low.|$|E

5|$|The {{initiative}} {{to construct a}} citywide wireless internet network, initiated in 2003 by city councilmember Gary Schiff, aimed to both offer city residents with <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> for around $20 per month, and also to improve city services such as fire and police by giving them greater access to information while en route or on-site anywhere in the city. Bridging the digital divide in the city was also a stated goal for the network.|$|E
5|$|About 200 free <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> {{points were}} set up around the city to aid with the city's goal of {{increasing}} access to the internet. US Internet paid $500,000 up front and agreed to pay five percent of its yearly revenues for seven years to maintain them, totaling about $10 million. By 2010, 44 such points {{had been set up}} at community centers around Minneapolis, {{out of a total of}} 117 which had also gone up in parks and on street corners around the city. Per the request of law enforcement officials who were concerned about the potential ability to surf the internet anonymously, the free login points require the user to enter a username, password, and credit card number.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{radio system}} {{consists}} of multiple <b>wireless</b> <b>accesses</b> that cover overlapping area, and cognitive terminals that use {{one or more}} of the <b>wireless</b> <b>accesses</b> simultaneously. In this paper, we propose the architecture of the cognitive radio system, and the inter-system handover protocols. In the proposed architecture, each cognitive terminal, that has multiple radio systems, operates with a single local IP address. The control sequence and packet format are designed to achieve fast handover among the radio systems. Based on the proposed architecture, we have developed a simulator with WiMAX and wireless LAN. Through simulation, we have proved that systems load balance was achieved between WiMAX and wireless LAN, and total system capacity was increased with using proposed architecture. I...|$|R

25|$|Access network: The {{user can}} {{connect to the}} IP-core of NGN in various ways, most of which use the {{standard}} Internet Protocol (IP). User terminals such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and computers can register directly on NGN-core, {{even when they are}} roaming in another network or country. The only requirement is that they can use IP and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Fixed access (e.g., Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable modems, Ethernet), mobile access (e.g. W-CDMA, CDMA2000, GSM, GPRS) and <b>wireless</b> <b>access</b> (e.g.WLAN, WiMAX) are all supported. Other phone systems like plain old telephone service and non-compatible VoIP systems, are supported through gateways. With the deployment of the NGN, users may subscribe to many simultaneous access-providers providing telephony, internet or entertainment services. This may provide end-users with virtually unlimited options to choose between service providers for these services in NGN environment.|$|E
25|$|Before the $2.9 million {{facility}} {{opened in}} September 1965, the district received a $12,000 grant from {{a unit of}} the Ford Foundation that would allow the school to use IT computer systems run by a senior program analyst from that firm that would allow students to select classes on their own, with a system of folding walls that could be adjusted to handle student groups of varying sizes. The school spent its first five decades relatively unchanged in terms of architecture. In 2006, an extra gym was added. Most recently, the new science wing was opened as well as a new entrance building.
