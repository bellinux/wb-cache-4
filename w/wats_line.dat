The younger Byars said that he had thought the telephone card was the connection to the municipal <b>WATS</b> <b>line</b> and was unaware that his calls were costing taxpayers. Richards Byars was found guilty of felony theft.|$|E
50|$|For {{outbound}} calls, the 1984 AT&T divestiture brought multiple competitors offering {{similar services}} using standard business telephone lines; the special <b>WATS</b> <b>line</b> was ultimately supplanted by other flat-rate offerings. The requirement that an inbound toll-free number terminate {{at a special}} <b>WATS</b> <b>line</b> or fixed-rate service was also rendered obsolete by the 1980s due to intelligent network capability and technological improvement in the +1-800 service. A toll-free number may now terminate at a T carrier line, at any standard local telephone number or at one of multiple destinations based on time of day, call origin, cost or other factors.|$|E
5000|$|During the Civil Rights Movement in the U.S., activist {{organizations}} such as SNCC used WATS as a convenient way for eyewitnesses {{on the ground to}} convey information quickly. Notes from these phone calls were compiled into [...] "WATS Line Reports" [...] and mailed to civil rights leaders, the media, the Justice Department, and others involved in the events. WATS was also how organizations communicated with local leaders across the country. A [...] "Bay Area Friends of SNCC" [...] newsletter in 1965 described WATS:The WATS (Wide Area Telephone Service) line is the heart of all SNCC security and communications. For a flat monthly rate, an unlimited number of calls can be dialed directly to any place in the country — or the state — depending on what line one uses. The Jackson office has a state-wide line, the Atlanta office has the national <b>WATS</b> <b>line.</b> Both run on a 24-hour basis. A project worker can call in news of any incident, threat or major activity to the Jackson office. The WATS operator there takes down the details and relays it to Atlanta if the event is of national importance. In the case of a threat or incident involving Federal laws, Jackson will notify the FBI and the Justice Department. Atlanta uses its national <b>WATS</b> <b>line</b> to notify SNCC groups around the country.See [...] "External Links" [...] for digitized <b>WATS</b> <b>Line</b> Reports.|$|E

40|$|The cold-inducible PPAR {{co-activator}} PGC- 1 α {{has been}} reported to play a pivotal role in the control of pre-adipocyte differentiation to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and mitochondriogenesis.   The overall aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the transcriptional control of PGC- 1 α gene in brown and white adipose tissue (WAT) precursor cells. Fragments up to 1. 8 kb of the rat PGC- 1 α proximal promoter were cloned into a pGL 3 luciferase reporter vector and transfected into 3 T 3 -L 1 (<b>WAT</b> pre-adipocyte cell <b>line)</b> and HIB- 1 B (BAT pre-adipocyte cell line).   The phenotype of these cell lines was confirmed by histological and biochemical characterisation.   When cells were induced to differentiate, even the shortest (264 bp) reporter construct supported luciferase expression in HIB- 1 B, but not in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells.   cAMP stimulation induced endogenous PGC- 1 α  expression only in HIB- 1 B cells. Putative transcription factor binding sites were identified in the 264 bp proximal promoter using both EMSA and promoter analysis software.   Mutation of the cAMP response element at - 183 to - 175 abolished completely the cAMP response of the promoter in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells, but only attenuated this response in HIB- 1 B cells.   this suggested that other indirect pathways were acting for the cAMP stimulation of this promoter in HIB- 1 B cells. Additional pathways through which differential control of the proximal PGC- 1 α promoter region could occur were next considered.   A putative C/EBP site at - 101 to - 94 was also implicated in the transcriptional control of this promoter.   Over-expression of C/EBPβ increased the activity of the promoter and rescued the response of PGC- 1 α in the 3 T 3 -L 1 cells.   Similar to PGC- 1 α, C/EBPβ was cAMP induced only in HIB- 1 B cells.

50|$|Limited-service {{suppliers}} {{specialize in}} {{one or a few}} phases of the marketing research project. Services offered by such suppliers are classified as field services, coding and data entry, data analysis, analytical services, and branded products. Field services collect data through the internet, traditional mail, in-person, or telephone interviewing, and firms that specialize in interviewing are called field service organizations. These organizations may range from small proprietary organizations which operate locally to large multinational organizations with <b>WATS</b> <b>line</b> interviewing facilities. Some organizations maintain extensive interviewing facilities across the country for interviewing shoppers in malls.|$|E
40|$|The Community College of Vermont (CCV) {{does not}} have a campus library, but {{supports}} its programs with library services offered at 12 different sites within the state. The 12 sites, which were begun in spring 1965, each have a 500 -volume non-circulating reference collection, with a special emphasis on business and human services materials to match program needs. Specialized collections in such areas as adult education, science, fine arts, Vermont history, sign language, cultural anthropology, and psychology, are circulated on a rotating basis among sites, The site libraries serve as research skills laboratories, helping students to begin their research by becoming familiar with reference materials, the card catalog, and various indexes. The college provides direct reference service to a community of students and instructors scattered throughout the state via a Wide Area Telecommunications Service (<b>WATS)</b> <b>line</b> installed int...|$|E
