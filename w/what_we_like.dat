500|$|The JAMs offered {{what they}} claimed were [...] "the last five" [...] copies of 1987 {{for sale at}} £1000 each in a full-page {{advertisement}} in the April 1988 edition of The Face. Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: [...] "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made it perfectly clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement {{and we can do}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> with them and not break any laws." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} rumors were true that Daisy {{would be the}} band's final release, Lacey replied [...] "I don't {{think that will be}} true. It might be our last {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put out <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E

500|$|Foote {{took the}} script to Philip and Mary Ann Hobel, {{a married couple}} who ran Antron Media Production and had {{produced}} more than 200 documentaries between them. Foote felt their background in documentaries would lend Tender Mercies the authenticity he and Duvall were seeking. The Hobels agreed to produce it after reading and liking the script; it would become their feature film debut as producers. The Hobels approached EMI Films, a British film and television production company, which agreed to provide financing for Tender Mercies as long as Duvall remained involved, and under the condition the Hobels find a good director. The script was rejected by many American directors, creating concerns for Foote and the producers that the film would never be made. Foote later said, [...] "This film was turned down by every American director {{on the face of}} the globe". The Hobels eventually mailed the script to Australian director Bruce Beresford because they were impressed by his 1980 film Breaker Morant. Philip Hobel said, [...] "What we saw in Breaker Morant is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> as filmmakers ourselves—an attention to the environment, a straightforward presentation; it's almost a documentary approach." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{have always}} been {{of the opinion that}} we have no right to impose our ideals upon other nations, no matter how strange it may seem to us that they enjoy the kind of life they lead, how slow they may be in {{utilizing}} the resources of their countries, or how much opposed their ideals may be to ours ... Our intolerant attitude is most pronounced in regard to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>like</b> to call [...] "our free institutions." [...] Modern democracy was no doubt the most wholesome and needed reaction against the abuses of absolutism and of a selfish, often corrupt, bureaucracy. That the wishes and thoughts of the people should find expression, and that the form of government should conform to these wishis is an axiom that has pervaded the whole Western world, and that is even taking root in the Far East. It is a quite different question, however, in how far the particular machinery of democratic government is identical with democratic institutions ... To claim as we often do, that our solution is the only democratic and the ideal one is a one-sided expression of Americanism. I see no reason why we should not allow the Germans, Austrians, and Russians, or whoever else it may be, to solve their problems in their own ways, instead of demanding that they bestow upon themselves the benefactions of our regime.|$|E

5000|$|His {{first five}} years as a {{producer}} were largely focused on developing the Swedish indie band The Cardigans, for whom Johansson has produced five of their six albums to date, beginning with the 1994 debut [...] "Emmerdale", excluding their fifth studio album [...] "Long Gone Before Daylight" [...] due to artistic differences. As someone as new to the studio as the band these sessions were an equally valuable learning experience for both parties. According to Johansson, each time they started on a new album, [...] "we sat down {{and listened to the}} old album and decided <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>liked</b> about it and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> didn't <b>like</b> about it and what direction the new album should go in."Nowadays Tore Johansson prefers to write for or co-write with solo artists.|$|R
