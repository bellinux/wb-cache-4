500|$|Keith Fay of {{the folk}} metal band Cruachan has also noted the {{influence}} of sea shanties on Viking metal, although disparagingly. In an interview with British magazine Terrorizer, {{he said that there}} is [...] "no real defined 'Viking music', so all these Nordic bands use 'sea shanty' type tunes to match their music. A lot of these bands, especially the bigger ones, are called folk metal but they don't really understand <b>what</b> <b>real</b> folk music is; though I know this is not true for all of them." ...|$|E

Kiedis described the song as a lyrical description of the conversation, about how music itself is [...] "color-blind" [...] but is [...] "segregated {{by the media and}} radio based on their perceptions of the artists." [...] Kiedis wrote [...] "Me and My Friends", a song which [...] "came together nicely", while driving home from San Francisco with his childhood friend Joe Walters. [...] "Backwoods" [...] details the history of rock and roll. [...] Kiedis said that [...] "Love Trilogy" [...] became one of the group's all-time favorite songs; it is about [...] "loving the things that aren't necessarily perfect or always lovable". He explained that [...] "For years, whenever someone would question our lyrics, Flea would say, 'Read 'Love Trilogy' and you'll know <b>what</b> <b>real</b> lyrics are all about.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Monroe had no film roles {{during the}} first months of her {{contract}} and instead dedicated her days to acting, singing and dancing classes. Eager {{to learn more about the}} film industry and in order to promote herself, she spent time at the studio lot to observe others working. Her contract was renewed in February 1947, and she was soon given her first two film roles: nine lines of dialogue as a waitress in the drama Dangerous Years (1947) and a one-line appearance in the comedy Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay! (1948). The studio also enrolled her in the Actors' Laboratory Theatre, an acting school teaching the techniques of the Group Theatre; she later stated that it was [...] "my first taste of <b>what</b> <b>real</b> acting in a real drama could be, and I was hooked". Monroe's contract was not renewed in August 1947, and she returned to modeling while also doing occasional odd jobs at the studio.|$|E

The rest is baloney. Astrology. Religion. All of our sciences still {{suffer from}} their former attachment to religion, {{and that is}} why there is so much metaphysics and astrology, the two are the same, in science." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the same}} article which he later re-printed in the Mencken Chrestomathy, Mencken {{primarily}} contrasts <b>what</b> <b>real</b> scientists do, {{which is to}} simply directly look at the existence of [...] "shapes and forces" [...] confronting them instead of (such as in statistics) attempting to speculate and use mathematical models. Physicists and especially astronomers are consequently not real scientists, because when looking at shapes or forces, they do not simply [...] "patiently wait for further light", but resort to mathematical theory. There {{is no need for}} statistics in scientific physics, since one should simply look at the facts while statistics attempts to construct mathematical models. On the other hand, the really competent physicists do not bother with the [...] "theology" [...] or reasoning of mathematical theories (such as in quantum mechanics): ...|$|E
2500|$|Other journalistic {{media are}} satirized as well. [...] "Homer Badman" [...] is a satire of shows like Hard Copy. David Mirkin, the show runner at the time, felt very {{strongly}} about the [...] "tabloidization of the media" [...] and {{has said that the}} episode is as current today as it was at the time and things have since gotten worse. Several gags in the episode are based on <b>what</b> <b>real</b> life shows like Hard Copy would do, such as making people look to be guilty without a trial as well as a complete invasion of privacy by setting up camp outside people's homes. The talk show [...] "Ben" [...] reflects the writers' feeling that anyone could host a talk show because all they need is a microphone and an audience. This leads to Homer using public access TV to try to clear his name. The character Birch Barlow, who hosts a conservative radio talk show in Springfield, is a take-off of American talk show host and political commentator Rush Limbaugh.|$|E

2500|$|The modern Greek Homerist Ioannis Kakridis may be {{compared}} with Eratosthenes in his approach to the problem. He argued that the Odyssey {{is a work of}} poetry and not a travel log. To attempt a quick outline of Kakridis's views, it is useless to try to locate the places mentioned in Odysseus' narrative on the map; we cannot confuse the narrative of Odyssey with history unless we believe in the existence of gods, giants and monsters. Kakridis admits that one may indeed ask <b>what</b> <b>real</b> locations inspired these imaginary places, but one must always bear in mind that geography is not the main concern either of Odysseus (as narrator) or of the poet. Similarly, Merry and Riddell, in their late 19th century school edition of the Odyssey, state the following opinion: [...] "Throughout these books [...] we are in a wonderland, which we shall look in vain for on the map". W. B. Stanford in his mid 20th century edition comments as follows on book 9 lines 80-81 (where Odysseus says that he met storms off Cape Malea near the island of Cythera): [...] "These are the last clearly identifiable places in O.'s wanderings. After this he leaves the sphere of Geography and enters Wonderland ..." [...] Thereafter, while frequently referring to ancient opinions on the location of Odysseus's adventures, Stanford makes little or no reference to modern theories.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{response}} to the album has been mixed, based on a score of 59 out of 100 from review aggregator site Metacritic. The Observers review of Echo gave the album three out of five stars, with reviewer Peter Robinson writing, [...] "Unusually for an X Factor graduate, there was actually something at risk if the second album didn't work, but Echo hits its target. A handful of upbeat numbers – including an unexpected foray into frothy high-speed electro – pull Leona {{back from the brink}} of boring." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News agreed, writing [...] "Echo has a sense of fun, and a youthful vim, rarely on display on Spirit. It's faster, harder and way catchier." [...] Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said Lewis's [...] "mezzo-soprano range allows her to take melodies from luxurious low notes to high-flying falsetto, gliding with elegant power and impressive control through all kinds of fluctuations and modulations. [...] The approach of the album's producers is to throw Leona at a song, with multi-tracked vocals shooting off in every direction, until you feel like you're listening to a room full of cloned divas fighting over who gets the top line. It's an exhausting yet strangely exhilarating experience." [...] Heats Karen Edwards awarded the album five stars out of five, saying [...] "From girlie pop to big ballads, this album will remind you what the fuss is all about. Future X Factor winners take note: this is <b>what</b> <b>real</b> talent sounds like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Actress Eliza Dushku {{describes}} Faith as the [...] "working class" [...] Slayer, {{a reason}} she feels {{so many people}} identify with her. She was written as a sympathetic character; with Doug Petrie claiming [...] "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." [...] According to Petrie, [...] "The whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, {{she would be a}} monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's <b>what</b> <b>real</b> monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster." [...] Petrie claims Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous Watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the Mayor as the father she never had. [...] "So she's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane" [...] says Petrie. [...] "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her m.o. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one." [...] Petrie describes the character's name as [...] "wildly ironic", due to her cynical nature. According to Petrie, [...] "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun {{if you look at it}} from their point of view." ...|$|E

It features [...] "relentless acoustic rhythm" [...] and [...] "strange gang vocals {{and a series}} of odd-but-familiar images from small-town America: prom queens in plastic crowns, amateurish bar bands and rude Waffle House waitresses." [...] According to Owen, the song is thematically about how [...] "In a world of materialistic things, everybody is constantly looking for what they don't have, as opposed to looking for <b>what's</b> <b>real</b> and <b>what</b> you have right in front of you. That's what 'What We Ain't Got' touched on…'Real Life' is about what we've got and <b>what's</b> <b>real</b> to us." ...|$|R

5000|$|The 1990s were {{a turning}} point for the boombox in popular culture. The rise of the Walkman and other {{advanced}} electronics eliminated the need to carry around such large and heavy audio equipment, and boomboxes quickly disappeared from the streets. As boombox enthusiast Lyle Owerko puts it, [...] "Towards the end of any culture, you have the second or third generation that steps into the culture, which is so far from the origination, it's the impression of <b>what's</b> <b>real,</b> but it's not the full definition of <b>what's</b> <b>real.</b> It's just cheesy."
