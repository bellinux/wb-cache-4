We came last night, {{got up to}} a {{delightful}} spring day, {{and we are now}} enjoying the little book room, with the windows open, hearing the birds sing, and the place looking beautiful. The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E

For me, that has enough validity...I am married with the heart." [...] Their daughter, Manuela Sánchez Michel, was born on July 28, 2001. The couple separated in 2005. Sanz later had a son named Alexander with Valeria Rivera, a Puerto Rican fashion designer.|$|E

[...] In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, [...] "Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal." ...|$|E

But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' out on me. No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is.

2500|$|Several {{people who}} worked with Genie, {{including}} Curtiss and James Kent, harshly criticized Rymer's works. A late April 1993 New York Times review of Rymer's book from scientific reporter Natalie Angier, which took an extremely negative view of the research team, prompted David Rigler to write his first public account of his involvement in Genie's case. In his letter to the Times, published in mid-June 1993, Rigler wrote that Genie was doing well in a small, private facility where her mother regularly visited her. He also stated that he and Marilyn were in contact with Genie's mother and had recently reestablished contact with Genie, writing that Genie was happy and that on their first visit she immediately greeted him and Marilyn by name, and said that, [...] "my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have resumed our (now infrequent) visits with Genie and her mother." ...|$|E
