5|$|Ful medames, {{originally}} from Egypt {{and still a}} national dish there, consists of fava beans <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> cumin; it is popular throughout the Levant. The dish may be ancient: dried beans of Neolithic age have been found near Nazareth.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian cuisine has ancient roots, with {{evidence}} that, for example, cheese {{has been made}} in Egypt since at least 3,000 BC. Ful medames, a stew of fava beans <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> cumin, is popular in Egypt and has become widespread across the Arab world. Duqqa is a dip made of pounded herbs, hazelnuts and spices, eaten with bread. Kushari is a foreign-derived 19th century dish of rice, lentils and pasta, variously garnished; it began as food for the poor, but has become a national dish.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{development}} of both, {{residential and commercial}} rooftop solar as well as utility-scale photovoltaic power stations, began to accelerate again due to supply issues <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural gas, global warming concerns, and the improving economic position of PV relative to other energy technologies. In the early 2000s, the adoption of feed-in tariffs—a policy mechanism, that gives renewables priority on the grid and defines a fixed price for the generated electricity—lead to {{a high level of}} investment security and to a soaring number of PV deployments in Europe.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} other salads in Greek cuisine. These include: the {{above-mentioned}} marouli (lettuce) salad with lettuce, onion and dill; cabbage salad ("slaw") (Lahanosalata), dressed <b>with</b> olive <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> lemon juice and garlic; beetroot salad (pantzarosalata), boiled and sliced beetroots, sometimes with beet greens as well, dressed <b>with</b> olive <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> red wine vinegar; roka (rocket) salad, arugula dressed <b>with</b> olive <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> red wine vinegar or lemon juice, possibly including anchovies; patatosalata, potato salad <b>with</b> olive <b>oil,</b> finely sliced onions, lemon juice or vinegar; revithosalata, chickpea salad; and maintanouri, parsley salad, usually used as a condiment.|$|R
5000|$|Produced {{water is}} a term used in the oil {{industry}} to describe water that is produced as a byproduct along <b>with</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas. <b>Oil</b> <b>and</b> gas reservoirs often have water as well as hydrocarbons, sometimes in a zone that lies under the hydrocarbons, and sometimes in the same zone <b>with</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas.|$|R
5|$|World War II was a {{demanding}} {{time for the}} railway line, as the track was in heavy use for both civilian and military transportation, {{and much of the}} equipment and maintenance was lacking. On 28 February 1944 a descending eastbound freight train loaded <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> petrol lost its braking power and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of Geilo. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and an unknown number of German soldiers. Poor lubrication oil combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.|$|E
5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> water radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
25|$|Meal offerings called mincha all {{consisted}} {{primarily of}} flour and were either completely or partially burned {{on the altar}}. Those not entirely burned on the altar were eaten by the priests. Some mincha offerings were fried or baked before being offered. Types of mincha included fine flour (solet) mixed <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> of which a portion {{was given to the}} kohen; flour mixed <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> fried on a griddle or on a pan; bread called challot mixed <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> baked in an oven; and wafers (rekikim) smeared with oil baked in an oven.|$|E

25|$|Grooming {{procedures}} – Grooming is best {{done with}} a falling temperature—typically after nightfall—to prevent excessive hardening. Once groomed, the tilled surface needs 1–2 hours to coalesce. Too-frequent grooming can destroy snow crystals and contaminate snow <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> dirt.|$|E

25|$|In 234, Sun Quan {{personally}} led a 100,000-strong army {{to attack}} Xincheng, Hefei. Man Chong recruited dozens of fierce warriors to make torches from tree branches, douse them <b>with</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> {{take advantage of}} the winds to set fire to the Wu army's siege engines and destroy them. Sun Quan's nephew, Sun Tai, was killed in the battle. Sun Quan withdrew his forces.|$|E

As the siege continues, Fallon captures Jack and Isabelle, but Jack throws the final bean down Fallon's throat, causing a beanstalk to rip apart his body. Jack takes the crown and sends the giants back to their realm.|$|E

25|$|To prevent hunting, belugas are {{protected}} under the 1986 International Moratorium on Commercial Whaling; however, hunting of {{small numbers of}} belugas is still allowed. Since {{it is very difficult}} to know the exact population of belugas because their habitats include inland waters away from the ocean, they easily come in contact <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas development centres. To prevent whales from coming in contact with industrial waste, the Alaskan and Canadian governments are relocating sites where whales and waste come in contact.|$|E
25|$|Cumberland sailed in 1808. On 26 June Captain W. Swain was at Port Jackson with a {{cargo of}} oil, having come from England. He left on 20 July for the whale fishery. He {{returned}} from the fishery on 22 July 1809 <b>with</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> then left in September for the fishery again. Cumberland returned to England on 3 July 1810.

25|$|Fossil fuels are a more {{recently}} developed resource in Canada, <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas being extracted from deposits in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin {{since the mid}} 1900s.

25|$|The {{original}} concession of March 14, 1925 {{covered all}} of Iraq, but IPC {{was reluctant to}} develop it quickly and production was restricted to fields constituting only one-half of 1 percent of the country's total area. During the Great Depression, the world was awash <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> greater output from Iraq would simply have driven the price down to even lower levels. Delaying tactics were employed not only in actual drilling and development, but also in conducting negotiations on such matters as pipeline rights-of-way.|$|E
25|$|There may be {{locations}} in the Sea of Okhotsk where right whales can reliably be found in summer. In the Sea of Okhotsk, the right whales are currently distributed far from shore {{in the southern part}} of the sea. The Sea is mainly Russian territorial waters, so Russian cooperation is required for any surveys. The remoteness of the location and the enormous demand for ships and aircraft associated <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> gas exploration near Sakhalin Island, make any ship or aerial surveys difficult and expensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{two largest}} {{economic}} sectors are mining and tourism. Mining and energy industry production exceeds $2.5billion per annum. The most important mineral resources are gold, zinc and bauxite, along with manganese and many others. The energy production is mostly off shore <b>with</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> natural {{gas from the}} Timor Sea, although there are significant uranium deposits near Darwin. Tourism employs 8% of Darwin residents, {{and is expected to}} grow as domestic and international tourists are now spending time in Darwin during the Wet and Dry seasons. Federal spending is a major contributor to the local economy as well.|$|E
