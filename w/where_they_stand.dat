5|$|On 9th Dhu al-Hijjah before noon, pilgrims {{arrive at}} Arafat, a barren and plain land some 20 {{kilometers}} east of Mecca, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> in contemplative vigil: they offer supplications, repent on and atone for their past sins, and seek mercy of God, {{and listen to}} sermon from the Islamic scholars who deliver it from near Jabal al-Rahmah (The Mount of Mercy) from where Muhammad {{is said to have}} delivered his last sermon. Lasting from noon through sunset, this is known as 'standing before God' (wuquf), {{one of the most significant}} rites of Hajj. At Masjid al-Namirah, pilgrims offer noon and afternoon prayers together at noon time. A pilgrim's Hajj is considered invalid if they do not spend the afternoon on Arafat.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{relatively}} small size of the crease is such that they limit {{the degree to which}} a batsman or a bowler can alter <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> to face or deliver a ball, there is a degree of latitude afforded whereby both can move around the crease as long as they remain within the aforementioned confines. Batsmen 'use the crease' when they move toward leg or off, before or while playing a shot. Bowlers 'use the crease' by varying the position of their feet, relative to the stumps, at the moment of delivery. In so doing, they can alter the angle of delivery and the trajectory of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Scattles is {{a version}} of {{skittles}} {{in which all the}} pins are numbered. Players take turn in throwing the baton at the pins with a view to totalling exactly 50 points. If more than one pin is knocked over, the score received is that quantity of pins. But if only one pin is knocked over, the value on it is scored. If a player exceeds 50, their total reduces to 25. Pins are then placed upright <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand,</b> thus scattering. Scattles is made by Jaques of London and reminiscent of the older Cornish game, smite, itself based on the Finnish skittles game mölkky.|$|E

If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so everyone knows <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand.</b> A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn.

25|$|By the 1950s and 1960s, {{the area}} went into decline, {{in line with}} a trend of general urban {{deterioration}} in Manhattan. As middle-class residents left for the suburbs, buildings were allowed to fall into disrepair and were divided into small units for new low-rent tenants, many of them originally from Puerto Rico. Urban renewal programs, headed by city planner Robert Moses, called for several city blocks to be demolished in order to construct the Frederick Douglass Houses in the superblock <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> today. The development of the Douglass Houses greatly increased the density of low-income renters without providing {{much in the way}} of amenities (food shops, clubs, restaurants, and open space) for them to use. Rampant graft and corruption associated with the project blighted their opening and brought ill repute on the neighborhood, and the debacle contributed strongly to Moses's fall from power and ouster. Although community groups, such as the Manhattan Valley Development Corporation, tried to find alternative solutions for the housing shortage in the area, the city's 1976 fiscal crisis caused many of these alternate plans to be shelved.|$|E

In addition, AIPAC helps connect donors with candidates, especially to the network of pro-Israel political action committees. AIPAC president Howard Friedman says “AIPAC meets with every candidate running for Congress.

[...] iDigitalTimes, in a review of the DanMachi anime, found the relationship between Bell and Hestia to be [...] "really touching", writing [...] "she obviously loves him and wants to be with him, not simply as patron goddess but as a lover. Bell’s ignorance to her every overture is a grating genre standard, but his trademark obliviousness lessens Hestia’s love for Bell not a whit." ...|$|E
2500|$|This article {{traces the}} {{historical}} {{development of the}} dioceses and cathedrals of the Church of England. It is customary in England to name each diocese after the city where its cathedral is located. Occasionally, when the bishop's seat has been moved from one city to another, the diocese may retain both names, for example Bath and Wells. More recently, where a cathedral is in a small or little-known city, the diocesan name has been changed to include the name of a nearby larger city: thus the cathedral in Southwell now serves the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham, and Ripon Cathedral was in Ripon and Leeds from 1999 until 2014. Cathedrals, like other churches, are dedicated to a particular saint or holy object, or Christ himself, but are commonly referred to by the name of the city <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand.</b> A cathedral is, simply, the church where the bishop has his chair or [...] "cathedra".|$|E

2500|$|This {{geographical}} {{transition is}} accompanied by a change in approach to skyscraper design. For much of the twentieth century large buildings took the form of simple geometrical shapes. This reflected the [...] "international style" [...] or modernist philosophy shaped by Bauhaus architects early in the century. The last of these, the Willis Tower and World Trade Center towers in New York, erected in the 1970s, reflect the philosophy. Tastes shifted in the decade which followed, and new skyscrapers began to exhibit postmodernist influences. This approach to design avails itself of historical elements, often adapted and re-interpreted, in creating technologically modern structures. The Petronas Twin Towers recall Asian pagoda architecture and Islamic geometric principles. Taipei 101 likewise reflects the pagoda tradition as it incorporates ancient motifs such as the ruyi symbol. The Burj Khalifa draws inspiration from traditional Islamic art. Architects in recent years have sought to create structures that would not appear equally at home if set in any part of the world, but that reflect the culture thriving in the spot <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans to get us out of, and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>stand</b> on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E
