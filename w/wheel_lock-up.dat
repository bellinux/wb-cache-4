5000|$|If {{the wheel}} speed sensors detect <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up,</b> {{the system will}} {{initiate}} anti-lock algorithm (ABS).|$|E
50|$|Antilock Braking System (ABS) ABS senses {{impending}} <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up</b> {{under heavy}} braking and pumps the front brakes individually or the rear brakes together (to help maintain stability), as needed, up to 30 times per second to prevent lock-up and maintain steering ability.|$|E
50|$|Most basic brake {{controllers}} {{will generally}} have a +/- gain adjustment. The tow vehicle operator {{would set the}} gain as high as possible but without the trailer brakes locking up after making a few test stops. The heavier the trailer, the higher the gain adjustment would be set and therefore the less chances of <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The 620 has an APTC {{wet clutch}}. According to Ducati, the wet clutch reduces lever {{operating}} effort, ensuring gradual engagement, and incorporates a racing derived [...] "slipper" [...] device {{to reduce the}} tendency for the rear <b>wheel</b> to <b>lock-up</b> or chatter during aggressive downshifting.|$|R
50|$|Safety wise, the Proton Juara came {{equipped}} with a reinforced body structure with anti-intrusion bars, as well as front ventilated disc brakes and rear drum brakes respectively. The brake line also has a load-sensing proportioning valve which prevents rear <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up</b> on wet surfaces when the Juara is lightly loaded. However, there are no airbags or an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).|$|E
5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering wheel angle to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects more/less yaw than the steering wheel angle should create, the car is understeering or oversteering and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up</b> and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle wheels may lock-up due to {{excessive}} wheel torque over tire-road friction forces available, caused by too much hydraulic line pressure. The ABS monitors wheel speeds and releases pressure on individual wheel brake lines, rapidly pulsing individual brakes to prevent lock-up. During heavy braking, preventing <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up</b> helps the driver maintain steering control. Four channel ABS systems have an individual brake line {{for each of}} the four wheels, enabling different braking pressure on different road surfaces. Three channel systems are equipped with a sensor for each wheel, but control the rear brakes as a single unit. For example, less braking pressure is needed to lock a wheel on ice than a wheel which is on bare asphalt. If the left wheels are on asphalt and the right wheels are on ice, during an emergency stop, ABS detects the right wheels about to lock and reduces braking force on the right front wheel. Four channel systems also reduce brake force on the right rear wheel, while a three channel system would also reduce force on both back wheels. Both systems help avoid lock-up and loss of vehicle control.|$|E
5000|$|Despite a front left <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up</b> at {{the final}} corner, Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time by four tenths of a second upon his first attempt. He {{subsequently}} returned to the pits during his second, knowing that he already had pole position. The second McLaren of Jenson Button set the second fasest time, one tenth behind Hamilton's time, to complete the second McLaren front row lock-out in the season's two races. Michael Schumacher demonstrated the improved pace of the Mercedes car since [...] by achieving his highest qualifying position since {{his return to the}} sport, with third place. Webber and Räikkönen set an identical time, but Webber was granted fourth position because he set his time first. Räikkönen's five place grid penalty for gearbox change meant he dropped from fifth to tenth place, despite an otherwise impressive performance from the Lotus team. This promoted Sebastian Vettel to fifth position, who had chosen to set his lap on the harder 'prime' tyres. The second Lotus of Romain Grosjean had another good qualifying with sixth place, after Räikkönen's penalty. Rosberg, Alonso and Pérez took seventh, eighth and ninth respectively on the grid. The final session was so closely fought out that the top eight drivers were separated by less than half a second.|$|E
50|$|The first {{qualifying}} period began with Paul di Resta leading {{a host of}} cars for their first flying lap. As expected, most teams posted their early timed laps on the slower 'prime' tyre and after ten minutes the four Mercedes powered cars from McLaren and Mercedes were ahead, led by Michael Schumacher. As in Melbourne, Felipe Massa was again {{in danger of being}} eliminated and as a result he and teammate Fernando Alonso both used a set of the medium 'option' tyre to avoid an embarrassing elimination. Late on in the session, Mark Webber also switched to the softer tyres and consequently set the fastest time of 1-minute 37.172 seconds. Significantly, both the HRT Pedro de la Rosa and Narain Karthikeyan were within the 107% time needed to qualify because of Webber's lap. A front right <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up</b> going into the braking zone of turn 1 resulted in severe vibration and effectively eliminated Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne on his final timed run. He finished the session 18th ahead of the Caterham cars of Heikki Kovalainen and Vitaly Petrov. Kovalainen was later demoted from his 19th place slot {{to the back of the}} grid, for the first time in his career, because of a five place grid penalty he incurred at the last race for overtaking under safety car conditions. The HRTs occupied the two places in front of him, the two Marussia cars were in front of them (with Timo Glock out-qualifying rookie Charles Pic) and teammate Petrov moved up into 19th. Schumacher and Jenson Button rounded out the top three.|$|E
40|$|An {{anti-lock}} braking system (ABS) is the primary motivation for this research. The ABS controller switches the actions of charging and discharging valves in the hydraulic actuator of the brake cylinder based on the wheels' angular speed and acceleration. The controller is, therefore, modeled by discontinuous differential equations where two smooth vector fields are separated by a switching manifold S. The goal of the controller is to maximize the tire-road friction force during braking (and, in particular, to prevent the <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up).</b> Since the optimal slip L of the wheel is known rather approximately, the actual goal of the controller is to achieve such a switching strategy that makes the dynamics converging to a limit cycle surrounding the region of prospective values of L. In this paper we show that the required limit cycle can be obtained as a bifurcation from a point x 0 of S when a suitable parameter D crosses 0. The point x 0 {{turns out to be}} a fold-fold singularity (the vector fields on the two sides of S are tangent one another at x 0) and the parameter D measures the deviation of the switching manifold from a hyperplane. The proposed result is based on an extension of the classical fold bifurcation theory available for smooth maps. Construction of a suitable smooth map is a crucial step of the proof.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} and understand the dynamics of motor vehicles un-der straight ahead braking and accelerating condi-tions. Two vehicle braking models are considered— a quarter-car, or single wheel model, and a half-car, or two wheel model—and a nonlinear analysis is un-dertaken for each. A brief survey of the main char-acteristics and features of a single wheel acceleration model is also conducted. The equations of motion describing the single wheel model shown in Figure 1 are presented and the need to quantify the available friction force for braking is specified. This motivates an investigation of the tire/road interface and leads to the introduc-tion of force coefficient characteristics µ as a function of longitudinal wheel slip s. The equations of motion are hence cast into a framework which is convenient for a nonlinear dynamic analysis. The forward vehi-cle speed u is customarily chosen as an independent variable for such an investigation. Whereas the an-gular velocity of the wheel ω is typically chosen as the second independent variable for braking anal-ysis [1], this paper utilizes wheel slip in its stead. This results in a single dimensionless function h(s) of longitudinal wheel slip that completely character-izes the nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system. It will be shown that considerable insight is gained from such a description. Criteria for the local sta-bility of finite slip in braking and wheel lockup are outlined and a qualitative vector field description of the braking model is presented and discussed. The main results of the investigation include domains of stable and unstable braking, local stability criteria, and a description of the transition to <b>wheel</b> <b>lock-up</b> as the brake torque is varied. The single wheel model equations of motion can be cast in the form u ̇ = −µ(s) g s ̇ = g u h(s) where g is the acceleration due to gravity and µ(s) is an experimentally derived friction coefficient charac-teristic. It is defined by the ratio of the longitudinal braking force X to the reaction force Z of the singl...|$|E
