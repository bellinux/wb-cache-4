Proposals include: limiting {{the use of the}} veto to vital national security issues; requiring agreement from multiple states before exercising the veto; abolishing the veto entirely; and embarking on the transition stipulated in Article 106 of the Charter, which requires the consensus principle to stay in place. Any reform of the veto <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult.</b> Articles 108 and 109 of the United Nations Charter grant the P5 veto over any amendments to the Charter, requiring them to approve of any modifications to the UNSC veto power that they themselves hold.|$|E

500|$|Borussia {{were drawn}} against Slovan Liberec of the Czech Republic in the quarter–finals, {{the first leg}} was drawn 0–0 draw in Prague. The draw was {{significant}} {{because it was the}} first time in the competition, that Liberec had failed to win at home. Dortmund won the second leg 4–0, after goals from Márcio Amoroso on 51 minutes, Jan Koller on 57 minutes, Lars Ricken on 70 minutes, and finally Ewerthon on 89 minutes. Borussia faced stronger opponents in the semi-finals, when they were drawn with the then five times champions of Europe; Milan. Nevertheless, Borussia won the first leg 4–0, after a hat-trick from Márcio Amoroso, and a goal on 63 minutes from Jörg Heinrich. Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti admitted he was not surprised with the result, stating that, [...] "We knew they had quick strikers. I am more surprised by the terrible performance of our team. The problem stemmed from the wings. I had no reason to change the team because Rui Costa has not trained for ten days. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> but it is our duty to give it our best and to try and qualify." [...] In the second leg, Milan won 3–1, with Filippo Inzaghi, and Cosmin Contra scoring within 18 minutes. However, Milan did not get their third goal until injury time when Serginho scored a penalty after Inzaghi was adjudged to have been pulled back by Christoph Metzelder. With Milan still needing one goal to force extra time, Lars Ricken scored for Dortmund in the fourth minute of injury time to put the club into their first European final since winning the 1997 Champions League Final.|$|E

2500|$|The Cycle Super Highways are {{a series}} of bike paths that connect Copenhagen to nearby suburbs.

In confidential official documents Benazir Bhutto had objected to the number of Urdu speaking class in 1993 elections, in context that she had no Urdu-speaking sentiment in her circle and discrimination was continued even in her government. Her stance on these issues was perceived as part of rising public disclosure which Altaf Hussain called [...] "racism".

If MPs cannot consult with their electorates about the bills, how can they properly represent their views about these bills which will become laws that will affect their day-to-day lives? Such late notice and late provision of the bills demonstrates that the Government is not at all committed to the “stampa” principle of democracy and good governance, which is the representation of the people by leaders they elect to represent them. It reflects the Government’s attitude that because it has a majority in Parliament - which means its bills will automatically be passed - {{there is no need for}} the grassroots to know about these laws that it intends to pass, which will nevertheless affect their lives.
