50|$|On 26 September 2012 DNCS at the {{companys}} Le Mourillon plant {{announced plans}} to design and build a submarine canister-based air defence weapon based on MBDAs Mistral. The concept {{is based on the}} British SLAM, Submarine Launched Airflight Missile which was based <b>on</b> the <b>Blowpipe</b> developed by Vickers in the 1970s, and used on HMS Aeneas.|$|R
500|$|Allowing {{the pull}} of gravity to stretch and bend hot glass while <b>on</b> the <b>blowpipe</b> or punty led Littleton to his [...] "Folded Forms" [...] and [...] "Loops" [...] series, which {{continued}} until 1979.

5000|$|In {{chemistry}} and mineralogy blowpipes {{have been used}} as scientific instruments for the analysis of small samples since about 1738, according to the accounts of Torbern Bergman. One Andreas Swab, a Swedish metallurgist and Counsellor of the College of Mines is credited with the first use of the blowpipe for 'pyrognostic operations', of which no record remains. The next person of eminence who used the blowpipe was Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who put it to the purpose of the discrimination of minerals by means of fusible reagents. [...] In 1770 an English translation of Cronstedt's work was made by Von Engestrom, annexed to which was a treatise <b>on</b> the <b>blowpipe.</b> Despite this opening, assay by blowpipe was for the time an occupation undertaken for the most part in Sweden. Bergman's use of the blowpipe outstripped all of his predecessors, and he widened its application from mineralogy to inorganic chemistry, giving rise to what may be regarded as a masterpiece of philosophical investigation, De Tubo Ferruminatorio, published in Vienna in 1779 (and translated into English in 1788). Bergman's assistant, Assessor Gahn, is next credited with moving the design and application of the <b>blowpipe</b> <b>on.</b> Gahn travelled with a portable blowpipe, applying it to every kind of chemical and mineralogical enquiry, such as proving the presence of copper in the ashes of vegetables. Gahn published a Treatise <b>on</b> the <b>Blowpipe,</b> which was reprinted a number of times in contemporary chemistry textbooks. Jöns Jakob Berzelius worked with Gahn to ascertain in a systematic manner of the phenomena presented by different minerals when acted <b>on</b> by the <b>blowpipe.</b> He established, according to Griffin, the notion that the blowpipe was an instrument of indispensable utility, and his published work, later translated into English, was {{regarded as one of the}} most useful books on practical chemistry extant.|$|R

The end of the cylinder opposite the blowpipe can be squeezed together and sealed. With further heating, the sealed cylinder can be blown and formed into any shape a glassblower can make.|$|R
