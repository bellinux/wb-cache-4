25|$|In {{a report}} of the same match, Spanish {{newspaper}} El Mundo said: Bale combines the height and build of an 800-metre runner like Steve Ovett with the acceleration and directness of a rugby winger like Bryan Habana. And, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> the byline, he delivers curling crosses like a Brazilian. Big words? Yes, but that's what Bale is like – easily the greatest sensation in the opening month and a half of the Champions League. Ask Maicon what he thinks after the two exhibitions Bale turned in against Inter. Yesterday he left Maicon for dead and then a wily old fox like Lúcio was left in his wake like someone trying to follow the vapour trail of an aeroplane. Three goals and two assists – against the European champions. His performances have been stunning.|$|E
500|$|... "Moment of Surrender" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics {{after the release}} of No Line on the Horizon. David Fricke of Rolling Stone enjoyed the song, writing, [...] "The rising-falling effect of the harmony voices around Bono... is a perfect picture of where he really wants to be, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> the line about 'vision over visibility.'" [...] Blender considered it the high-point of the album, comparing it to the band's 1987 single [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For". Reviewer Rob Sheffield complimented the melding of bass, guitar, and vocals, calling it [...] "the kind of gimme-divinity anthem that U2 cut their teeth on, except it really does seem like they've gotten better at these songs now that they've picked up some bummed-out adult grit. Bono actually sounds scared of something in this song, and whether his nightmares are religious or sexual, the fear gives his voice some heft." [...] NME felt that it was the [...] "most impressive" [...] song on the album, describing it as a [...] "gorgeously sparse prayer built around Adam Clayton's heartbeat bassline and Bono's rough growl", and noting that despite its seven-minute length, it did not feel too long. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was more critical of the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have enough of a tune to support the full seven-minute gospel treatment", a sentiment that The Times agreed with.|$|E
