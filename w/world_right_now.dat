500|$|With S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{announced}} {{as a legitimate}} organization again, after working in secret {{since the end of}} the series' first season, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the reaction to this would be mixed, as [...] "there are people who, as we see with the senator, are outspoken against Inhumans and will be against any form of protection for them. There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever really talking about them." ...|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{has said}} that he has never seen a High School Musical film, to which Glee has been compared, and that his {{interest}} lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing more heavily on the format of Chicago. Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> that's why Idol worked. It's pure escapism," [...] he said. Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads, and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.|$|E

500|$|In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau hailed Off the Wall as [...] "the dance groove of the year" [...] {{and that}} Jackson's vocal stylings were a {{reminder}} that he had grown up. In a review for Melody Maker Phil McNeill expressed the opinion that in Off the Wall Jackson sounded comfortable, confident and in control. He believed [...] "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough" [...] had a [...] "classy" [...] introduction {{and that it was}} the best song on the album. He also praised [...] "Rock with You", describing it as [...] "masterful". The reviewer concurred with a colleague that Jackson was [...] "probably the best singer in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> in terms of style and technique". Giving the album a favorable review in Smash Hits, David Hepworth said that Jackson [...] "sings like an angel". Sounds shared the same point of view, qualifying Jackson's voice as [...] "astoninshingly agile". The first side of Off the Wall is praised for its [...] "clutch of dancers that must have even Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards watching their backs".|$|E

The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be watching the news, and thinking, 'of all the things going on in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E

We have to deal with {{much the same way that}} Captain America, when thawed from the Arctic ice, entered a world that he didn't recognize," [...] similar to the way Stan Lee and Jack Kirby reintroduced the character in the 1960s. Likewise, Arad noted, [...] "Captain America stands for freedom for all democracies, for hope all around the world. He was created to stop tyranny and the idea of stopping tyranny is important today as it was then. So I think that we will have some interesting challenges but at the end of the day if the movie is terrific and the movie talks to the world, it's not about one place, it's about the world and I think [...] that basis it will be very successful." [...] Later, after the election of US President Barack Obama, Feige commented, [...] "The idea of change and hope has permeated the country, regardless of politics, and that includes Hollywood. Discussions in all our development meetings include the zeitgeist and how it's changed in the last two weeks. Things are being adjusted".|$|E

Flynn confronts Yuri in order to settle the outstanding issue of Yuri's double homicide and his willingness to let Flynn take credit for all of his accomplishments. Yuri tells Flynn that he is the leader that the <b>world</b> needs <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> and that Yuri is happy to be a criminal in the shadows to achieve that end.

Human <b>Rights</b> <b>Now!,</b> which was timed to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), played a series of concerts on five continents over six weeks.

500|$|Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan created Glee. Murphy drew {{inspiration}} from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role {{in all of his}} high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> that's why 'Idol' worked. It's pure escapism." [...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is actually filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.|$|E

2500|$|José Mourinho said {{he wanted}} Modrić in Real Madrid because of his {{influence}} on the game, tactical level and because he has [...] "that artistic sense". In 2012, Carlo Ancelotti praised Modrić's technique and versatility as a midfield player, stating, [...] "Modric is an outstanding player and in my opinion {{one of the best}} midfielders in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> because he can play in more than one position". Alex Ferguson regarded him highly as a player while he played in the Premier League, saying it is fair to compare him to Paul Scholes because both are intelligent footballers with good passing consistencies, control of the game, and fairplay. Slaven Bilić said Modrić [...] "is a player who makes others better, they all benefit from him being in the team. He's not selfish, he's playing for the team...he's a complete player; good in defence, good in offence—it looks like he was born with the ball at his feet". Others managers who have praised Modrić's game include Pep Guardiola and Sven-Göran Eriksson.|$|E

We achieve this purpose and we lay out a complete implementation which sets up two autonomous sides in the functionality building process: on the one hand, the features are combined as external ab-stract operators; the external languages derive from XML by being dedicated to a domain.

I wanted to bring that fresh element to that character." [...] Leon said Colleen fans came over to her message board after she got the role and tried to fill her in on the details of the part so she would not [...] "screw things up." [...] Though she looked over the information, Leon said, [...] "I didn't want to go into detail, because I did want to come in and have a fresh start with the character. Coming in as a recast was stressful already, so trying to mimic what she did…. I got this role for a reason — something I did — so I didn't want to lose that element. Plus, the character's grown up." [...] Sursok hoped to bring something new to the role while keeping with the familiar. [...] "It's very hard to come in and have a background already in place for a character," [...] she said. [...] "You want to remember who the character was from the beginning, but I'd like to change it up a bit. People evolve; characters evolve. I think Colleen is torn between two <b>worlds</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Her father treats her like a child, but she's trying to grow up." [...] An element Sursok wanted to add to the character was drama. [...] "Everyone wants to play what they don't have and my life's very settled at the moment," [...] she said.

2500|$|The Loudest Engine {{received}} mostly favourable {{reviews from}} music critics, {{but there were}} a certain amount of music critics who felt otherwise and consequently panned it. Upon its release, Chris Phillips from the Live at the Vault show on BRfm 97.3 called it one of the best albums of the year. Luke McNaney of The Music Fix rated it 8/10 and praised the album, using terms like [...] "swooning melodies", [...] "beguilingly sexy rock", and [...] "prowling guitars". He appreciated the final third of the album the most, and declared [...] "the band have proved their belltower remains a den of intoxicating noise." [...] Scott Causer of Contactmusic rated it 7/10 and expected to hear Stoermer produce an album full of indie anthem pop songs, similar to those of The Killers, but was surprised to instead hear a darker creation. He ended his review by stating that [...] "Howling Bells {{are one of the most}} interesting bands in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> and should be cherished as such." [...] Tom O'Donovan of V Music acknowledged that Juanita stood out from her female-fronted counterparts and praised her vocal capacity for its diverse range. He referred to The Loudest Engine as [...] "a promising record displaying a real maturity." [...] Denis Semchenko of Rave Magazine rated the album 3.5/5 and noted that the opening track [...] "Charlatan" [...] and lead single [...] "Into the Sky" [...] were among the band's most distinguished guitar riffs yet, although he thought the album would have benefited from more stylistic diversity.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's going on in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
50|$|In short: The {{state of}} union, while far {{stronger}} than when Mr. Obama took office, remains troubled. The financial crisis has ended, with job growth picking {{up and the}} American economy among the <b>world's</b> strongest <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Yet the great 21st-century wage slowdown continues, with pay raises for most workers still meager. In other positive news, the deficit has fallen sharply, thanks {{to a combination of}} slower health-cost growth and budget cuts (the latter championed by Republicans). Many more people have health insurance, thanks to Mr. Obama's health law. More people are graduating from college—although Mr. Obama is likely to fall short of his vow to have the United States lead the world in college graduates by 2020.On the negative side, climate change appears to be accelerating, creating serious health and economic risks. The fall in gasoline prices, though welcome for many struggling families, won't help the climate. And with Mr. Obama delivering his address the day after Martin Luther King's Birthday, it's also worth remembering that the country's racial divides remain deep, with African-Americans still far behind other Americans by many measures.|$|R

2500|$|McFly {{have been}} cited as having {{influenced}} a number of high-profile musicians in various different ways. Of particular note are Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson of One Direction, who have credited McFly as the opening act of the first concert they had ever attended. Speaking about meeting with the group, Jones said [...] "it turned out that Niall and Louis were at one of our first ever shows. And they were all like, 'we copied your haircuts, and you made us want to play guitar', which is really amazing to hear. They're the biggest band in the <b>world</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> And their favourite band was us! We influenced them. It's really strange, because {{you feel like a}} veteran!". [...] Reviews for One Direction's debut album Up All Night had credited McFly as a notable influence, and Horan stated the group were very happy to have such a comparison noted. McFly had contributed song-writing to the first three studio albums that the group released. The group's debut featured the Fletcher-penned track I Want, while the group's 2nd album Take Me Home featured the song I Would penned by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. Deluxe editions of the album also featured Irresistible, a track penned by all 5 members of One Direction alongside Fletcher, Jones and Poynter. This track marked the first time Jones was credited as the producer of any McFly-penned song for the group, with this trait continuing for later songs. Horan has since established a professional relationship with McFly, co-writing a number of album tracks for One Direction with Fletcher, Jones and Poynter, including the song Don't Forget Where You Belong from their 3rd album Midnight Memories, having previously credited them for teaching the group songwriting techniques. Horan, Fletcher, Jones and Poynter had written three songs together for the group's 4th album, due for release in late 2014. Despite this, none of the tracks were chosen for the release, marking the first time the band were not featured on the group's songwriting credits on any studio album. However, Horan has returned to work with the band for the group's 5th studio album in 2015, penning two tracks with Fletcher and Jones which are presently in production. On 16 June 2014, Horan told the group's audience at the Parken Stadium in Denmark that McBusted supporting the group was [...] "something special" [...] because [...] "they were a lot of our favourite bands when we were growing up". One Direction have also praised McFly as role models for longevity, having stayed together as a band for over a decade. Tomlinson said [...] "Oh, they're great role models. They've been through it, so it was really nice to have the chance to talk to them about their experiences. They've been so successful because they've managed to be themselves from the start. There aren't any egos, you know? I think that's really important in a band." ...|$|E
