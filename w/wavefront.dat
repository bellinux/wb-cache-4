5|$|A <b>wavefront</b> {{splitting}} interferometer divides a light <b>wavefront</b> {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} <b>wavefront</b> to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of <b>wavefront</b> splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{component}} forms {{used to construct}} distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a <b>wavefront</b> travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors, capacitors or resonators, {{as required by the}} filter.|$|E
5|$|The latest {{proposed}} extremely large astronomical telescopes, {{such as the}} Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be {{built from}} hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly aspheric and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference {{with the aid of}} a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex aspheric surfaces. Fig.15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no <b>wavefront</b> modification. The <b>wavefront</b> of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E

5|$|Phase {{shifting}} interferometry overcomes {{these limitations}} by not relying on finding fringe centers, {{but rather by}} collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor. As seen in Fig.17, multiple interferograms (at least three) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Alternatively, precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency. The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical <b>wavefront</b> errors. The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis, with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine. Phase shifting technology has been adapted {{to a variety of}} interferometer types such as Twyman-Green, Mach–Zehnder, laser Fizeau, and even common path configurations such as point diffraction and lateral shearing interferometers. More generally, phase shifting techniques can be adapted to almost any system that uses fringes for measurement, such as holographic and speckle interferometry.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license {{a single piece of}} software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool or learning a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias <b>Wavefront</b> Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E

25|$|According to the Huygens–Fresnel principle, {{each point}} on the <b>wavefront</b> of a {{propagating}} wave can be considered {{to act as a}} point source, and the <b>wavefront</b> at any subsequent point can be found by adding together the contributions from each of these individual point sources.|$|E
25|$|After {{propagation}} of a <b>wavefront,</b> {{parts of it}} may overlap leading to interference and preventing adaptive optics from correcting it. Propagation of a curved <b>wavefront</b> always leads to amplitude variation. This needs to be considered if a good beam profile is to be achieved in laser applications.|$|E
25|$|Ocular aberrations are {{generally}} measured using a <b>wavefront</b> sensor, {{and the most}} commonly used type of <b>wavefront</b> sensor is the Shack-Hartmann. Ocular aberrations are caused by spatial phase nonuniformities in the <b>wavefront</b> exiting the eye. In a Shack-Hartmann <b>wavefront</b> sensor, these are measured by placing a two-dimensional array of small lenses (lenslets) in a pupil plane conjugate to the eye's pupil, and a CCD chip at the back focal plane of the lenslets. The lenslets cause spots to be focused onto the CCD chip, and the positions of these spots are calculated using a centroiding algorithm. The positions of these spots are compared with the positions of reference spots, and the displacements between the two are used to determine the local curvature of the wavefront—an estimate of the phase nonuniformities causing aberration.|$|E

25|$|Adaptive optics (AO) is a {{technology}} {{used to improve}} the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of <b>wavefront</b> distortions: it aims at correcting the deformations of an incoming <b>wavefront</b> by deforming a mirror in order {{to compensate for the}} distortion. It is used in astronomical telescopes and laser communication systems to remove the effects of atmospheric distortion, in microscopy, optical fabrication and in retinal imaging systems to reduce optical aberrations. Adaptive optics works by measuring the distortions in a <b>wavefront</b> and compensating for them with a device that corrects those errors such as a deformable mirror or a liquid crystal array.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} perform {{adaptive}} optics correction, {{the shape of}} the incoming wavefronts must be measured as a function of position in the telescope aperture plane. Typically the circular telescope aperture is split up into an array of pixels in a <b>wavefront</b> sensor, either using an array of small lenslets (a Shack–Hartmann sensor), or using a curvature or pyramid sensor which operates on images of the telescope aperture. The mean <b>wavefront</b> perturbation in each pixel is calculated. This pixelated map of the wavefronts is fed into the deformable mirror and used to correct the <b>wavefront</b> errors introduced by the atmosphere. It is not necessary for the shape or size of the astronomical object to be known– even Solar System objects which are not point-like {{can be used in a}} Shack–Hartmann <b>wavefront</b> sensor, and time-varying structure on the surface of the Sun is commonly used for adaptive optics at solar telescopes. The deformable mirror corrects incoming light so that the images appear sharp.|$|E

25|$|The Huygens–Fresnel {{equation}} {{is one such}} model. This was derived empirically by Fresnel in 1815, based on Huygens' hypothesis that each point on a <b>wavefront</b> generates a secondary spherical <b>wavefront,</b> which Fresnel combined with the principle of superposition of waves.

25|$|Since the Huygens–Fresnel {{principle}} {{states that}} every {{point of a}} <b>wavefront</b> {{is associated with the}} production of a new disturbance, it is possible for a <b>wavefront</b> to interfere with itself constructively or destructively at different locations producing bright and dark fringes in regular and predictable patterns.
