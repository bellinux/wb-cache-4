40|$|In the {{research}} area of dynamic traffic assignment, link travel times {{can be derived}} from link cumulative inflow and outflow curves which are generated by dynamic network loading. In this paper, the profiles of <b>cumulative</b> <b>flows</b> are piecewise linearized. Both the step function (SF) and linear interpolation (LI) are used to approximate <b>cumulative</b> <b>flows</b> over time. New formulations of the SF-type and LI-type link travel time models are developed. We prove that these two types of link travel time models ensure first-in-first-out (FIFO) and continuity of travel times with respect to flows, and have other desirable properties. Since the LI-type link travel time model does not satisfy the causality property, a modified LI-type (MLI-type) link travel time model is proposed in this paper. We prove that the MLI-type link travel time model ensures causality, strong FIFO and travel time continuity, and that the MLI-type link travel time function is strictly monotone under the condition that the travel time of each vehicle on a link is greater than the free flow travel time on that link. Numerical examples are set up to illustrate the properties and accuracy of the three models. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. postprin...|$|R

This method provided a rapid and accurate procedure to measure the flow accumulation using the precipitation accrued by the topography of the basin derived from Digital Elevation Model (DEM). We obtained a 30 -m resolution DEM and depression features (e.g. dams and reservoirs) for the region derived from CARTOSAT data (BHUVAN, ISRO CARTOSAT DEM, 2016) and used a computational resolution of 100  m by 100  m grids. Thus, we smoothed the data using bilinear resampling into 100  m resolution {{in order to determine}} the major stream flows. The precipitation layers were resampled similarly. We used the GRASS GIS environment to perform the flow accumulation analysis. Initially, the topographical parameters for the basin were derived from the DEM and depression layer. We then derived the stream flow for each day by adding daily precipitation over the basin configuration and calculated the accumulated runoff values by adding the <b>cumulative</b> <b>flow</b> into the lagoon at the major streams. Figure  2 shows examples of the analysis for two different scenarios.
