5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May MacLachlan was {{informed}} {{that he would be}} decorated with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On 29 May the award was announced. His tally stood at 11 air victories and he <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> recognised night flyer and ground-attack ace. On 18 May 1942 the BBC interviewed him for the 9 pm news. During the interview he gave his views on the dangers and thrills of night fighter operations.|$|E
5|$|While Esther <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> {{powerful}} hurricane {{over the}} open Atlantic, the San Juan Weather Bureau office issued a small craft advisory for the Leeward Islands, United States Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda.

The agency later issued a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September 18.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{had long}} been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily, and rarely exercising.

In August 1944, Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home.

5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided to get on with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} much {{of two years}} at the writer's workshop at the University of Iowa, teaching one course each term, Vonnegut was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for research in Germany. By the time he won it, in March 1967, he <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> well-known writer. He used the funds to travel in Eastern Europe, including to Dresden, where he found many prominent buildings still in ruins. At {{the time of the}} bombing, Vonnegut had not appreciated the sheer scale of destruction in Dresden; his enlightenment came only slowly as information dribbled out, and based on early figures he came to believe that 135,000 had died there.|$|E
5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The Usual Suspects, Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, it <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E

Shadow configurations allow configuration evaluation before deployment and thus can reduce potential network disruptions. We demonstrate using real implementation that shadow configurations can be implemented with low overhead...|$|R

5|$|At {{this point}} the {{fighting}} ceased for almost two weeks and during this time the 39th was joined by the 53rd and the 30th Brigade headquarters; and Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner arrived from Ilolo to take command. Reaching the battalion at Isurava on 16 August, he subsequently began organising the battalion's defence of Isurava. On 23 August Brigadier Arnold Potts took over command of Maroubra Force and further reinforcements arrived as first the 2/14th, 2/16th and later the 2/27th Battalions from the 7th Division's 21st Brigade also reached the area. Despite this, the situation remained bleak as the supply issue <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> serious problem for the Australians and the reinforcements that had arrived were also {{in a state of}} disarray having been committed to the battle in a piecemeal fashion and suffering badly from hunger and disease.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1850s the {{miasma theory}} of disease was largely {{superseded}} by the germ theory of disease, creating extensive interest in microorganisms and {{their interactions with}} other forms of life. By the 1880s, bacteriology <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> coherent discipline, especially through the work of Robert Koch, who introduced methods for growing pure cultures on agar gels containing specific nutrients in Petri dishes. The long-held idea that living organisms could easily originate from nonliving matter (spontaneous generation) was attacked {{in a series of}} experiments carried out by Louis Pasteur, while debates over vitalism vs. mechanism (a perennial issue since the time of Aristotle and the Greek atomists) continued apace.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey and Maud's oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer {{control of}} Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block {{alongside}} the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> popular tripartite design for domestic castle {{buildings in the}} 14th century; an additional building was also constructed by Roger on {{the location of the}} later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain wall. Between 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found himself on the losing side of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped from the Tower of London in 1323 into exile.|$|E

Hitler {{needed someone to}} keep up the pressure on Britain, and Göring was willing to do it. On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> strain.

5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> shut-in.|$|E
5|$|Major {{rebuilding}} {{took place}} in the Lower or Middle town area following a fire in 1791. In that year a Carrara marble statue of Queen Anne, sculpted by Francis Bird was presented to the town by Sir Jacob Bancks, who served as the local Member of Parliament from 1698 to 1715. It originally stood in the parish church but was moved to Wellington Square in 1893, when the marble pedestal and canopy by H. Dare Bryan were added. Lower town and the quay area were rebuilt and the fortunes of the town revived with the growth in sea bathing, and by 1851 <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> retirement centre.|$|E

This endeavour was unsuccessful, since Merrick's facial deformities rendered his speech increasingly unintelligible and prospective customers reacted with horror to his physical appearance. Housewives refused to open doors for him and now people not only stared at him but began to follow him out of curiosity. Merrick failed to make enough money as a hawker to support himself. On returning home one day in 1877, he was severely beaten by his father and he left home for good.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Isma'il Pasha {{also saw the}} return of royal {{patronage}} to al-Azhar. As khedive, Isma'il restored the Bab al-Sa'yida (first built by Katkhuda) and the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya. Tewfik Pasha, Isma'il's son, who became khedive {{when his father was}} deposed as a result of British pressure, continued to restore the mosque. Tewfik renovated the prayer hall that was added by Katkhuda, also aligning the southeastern facade of the hall with the street behind it, and remodeling several other areas of the mosque. Abbas II succeeded his father Tewfik as khedive of Egypt and Sudan in 1892, and continued the renovations started by his grandfather Isma'il. He restructured the main facade of the mosque and built a new riwaq. Under his rule, the Committee for the Conservation of Monuments of Arab Art (initially formed under French occupation), also restored the original Fatimid sahn. These renovations were both needed and helped modernize al-Azhar and harmonize it with what <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> metropolis.|$|E
5|$|Triumph in the 1976 League Cup final gave Manchester City a {{place in}} the UEFA Cup after a {{four-year}} absence. City drew Juventus in the first round.

Juventus {{went on to win the}} competition. As league runners-up in 1976–77, Manchester City again qualified for the UEFA Cup. Drawn against Widzew Łódź, City drew the first leg at Maine Road 2–2. In the late 1970s, hooliganism <b>was</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> more prominent part of English football. Following an incident where a fan invaded the pitch and attacked Widzew's Zbigniew Boniek, City were fined by UEFA, and fencing was erected between the pitch and the stands.
