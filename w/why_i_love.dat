500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the soundtrack was mixed. Some reviewers, such as Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan, {{found it to be}} of medium quality, saying it [...] "suffer from {{occasional}} compositional problems" [...] and noted that others refer to it as simply [...] "in the middle" [...] of the soundtracks of Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI, though he stated [...] "I don't know <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> Final Fantasy V's music" [...] despite this. Schweitzer praised the [...] "Main Theme of Final Fantasy V" [...] ("Ahead on Our Way") as [...] "a truly stirring piece of music" [...] and [...] "triumphant, hopeful, and yet almost longing at the same time," [...] but stated that [...] "Uematsu's compositional style hits a sort of early plateau here." [...] Other reviewers disagreed, with Jason Strohmaier of Soundtrack Central finding it to be an underrated album, while Jeremy Althouse of Soundtrack Central felt that it was on par with Uematsu's other works.|$|E

[...] In 2009 Bancroft received the Dromkeen Medal for her contribution to children's literature. In May 2010, the Governor-General of Australia Quentin Bryce launched Bancroft's latest book, <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> Australia. A long-time supporter of Bancroft's work, Ms Bryce said: [...] "Why I love Australia is a work and title that, again, speaks volumes of its author and illustrator.

[...] Many critics praised the tenacity of the writers for airing an episode featuring such a creepy character after the Super Bowl.

500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic complimented {{the opening}} scene with the gun purchase, which he called [...] "reminiscent of season one, when the show took the slow, {{fascinating}} steps that no other program would touch". He also complimented the episodes for taking the viewers [...] "inside the minds" [...] of Walter and Jesse. Craig McQuinn of The Faster Times enjoyed {{the slow pace of}} the episode and complimented the show's lack of predictability, claiming {{he had no idea how}} Walter's confrontation with Gus would end, [...] "and that’s <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> this show". Michael Arbeiter of Hollywood.com compared {{the opening scene}} to the works of Quentin Tarantino, and called the bar Mike frequents [...] "the most beautifully shot setting I've seen in TV lately". He also called the subplot between Marie and Hank a [...] "surprisingly interesting story". Carl Williott of CNN complimented the shows' [...] "clever pieces of misdirection" [...] by having Walter purchase a gun but never getting to use it, and by showing Mike's conflicted emotions but having him side with Gus against Walter. However, Williott said the episode ultimately felt like a [...] "placeholder" [...] for bigger developments in the storyline. Not all reviews were entirely positive. CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell said Walter's near-assassination of Gus was [...] "the highlight of the episode", but felt Jesse's story was [...] "less compelling [...] extremely repetitive", and he found the subplot with Hank and Marie difficult to enjoy because Hank was so unsympathetic.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Polygon, Eric Watson {{said that}} [...] "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s fourth season pulls the best {{elements}} from the MCU {{and the most}} over-the-top elements from comics to remind me <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> Marvel: superheroes punching Nazis." [...] He said this was refreshing after the controversial comic storyline Secret Empire which sees the patriotic Captain America revealed to be a sleeper agent for Hydra. Carli Velocci at TheWrap also discussed the season in relation to Secret Empire, noting that Agents of Hydra [...] "hasn’t spawned a digital mountain of outrage" [...] like the commic event. She said that Secet Empire [...] "all but ignores [...] real world context, minus acknowledging that Nazis tend to like concentration camps. If anything, it treats the subject matter like window dressing, background for a plot intended to blow readers’ minds ... Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, however, embraces that real world context. It does everything it can {{to ensure that the}} real world still matters and that the audience understands the negative consequences of a Nazi-driven society. And unlike the comic book counterpart, it doesn’t shy away from the fact that Hydra is definitely rooted in the Third Reich." [...] She continued that the series [...] "manages to create a world where Hydra is the establishment, but every other plot point is about questioning it explicitly" [...] and [...] "what’s more inspiring than seeing an actual symbol of America not taking crap from Nazis? Wherever the comic series takes Captain America, it shouldn’t have lost sight of that. Fortunately, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. didn’t." ...|$|E

This is a very {{personal}} thing—since humor's subjective like that—but for me, this was the funniest episode since the clip show... I laughed myself silly at this one, {{to the point where}} I was devolving into hiccups at certain scenes, and I'm glad we get to go out on an episode like this, one that plays around with form and makes me laugh." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix also praised the Glee-spoofing, saying [...] "'Regional Holiday Music' was the logical, clever, funny endpoint to it." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said, [...] "As with its best theme-episodes, the show bridged the gap between high-concept parody and character-based comedy." [...] TV Fanatic's Leigh Raines gave the episode a 4/5 rating, saying while the show [...] "definitely went out with a bang, it didn't totally blow my socks off... While there were a few moments that upped the ick factor, overall this episode fell on the positive side." [...] She praised Troy and Abed's rap performance, but called the scene where Annie seduces Jeff [...] "creepy". Robert Canning of IGN said it was a [...] "great" [...] episode, but [...] "faltered just a bit" [...] at the end: [...] "Abed's realization that his attempts to brighten the holiday only made things darker, as Jeff had previously suggested, fit the character well enough, but the study group's follow-up felt a bit forced and holiday hokey.

500|$|The ballad [...] "I Miss You" [...] was {{performed}} {{in front of an}} electronic backdrop in which a male dancer was silhouetted in kinetic, black-and-white stripes. A re-arranged version of [...] "Resentment" [...] followed with an acoustic guitar used for its musical backbone. Beyoncé opened the performance of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] saying [...] "We all know how it feels to be hurt and lied to" [...] and later turned it into a guitar-pop song, in which elements of Goo Goo Dolls' adult-alt ballad [...] "Iris" [...] were used.

500|$|In later episodes, Margaret {{develops}} into a {{more complex}} character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor by becoming easily suspicious and jealous. For example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode [...] "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In [...] "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer (played by Barbara Windsor) develops {{a soft spot for}} Victor and tries to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults her with a pair of boxing gloves. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man called Ben whom she met on holiday in the episode [...] "Warm Champagne". She decides against cheating on Victor. In this episode, she sums up her relationship with Victor by telling Ben, [...] "He's the most sensitive person I've ever met, and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>love</b> him and why I constantly want to ram his head through a television screen." [...] She also began to develop a sense of cynicism, slowly beginning to see the world the way her husband Victor sees it. This is especially evident in [...] "Things aren't simple anymore" [...] where she voices that the world is [...] "all speed and greed" [...] and that [...] "nobody does anything about anything". In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Margaret recounts the time she first chose Victor at a party and, during a power cut, [...] "shared their bodies" [...] in the garden. After this moment of passion, they went back inside and when the lights came back on Margaret realised that she had [...] "grabbed hold of the wrong person". Margaret's demeanor seemed to stem from an incident she had at school when she was a child. When she was five, she had two budgies and one day when she opened the door to their cage one flew straight out and hit the window killing itself while the other stayed in the cage despite her best efforts to get it to come out. The next day at school her teacher asked the class to write a story about something that had happened to them so Margaret wrote her story about the budgies. Her teacher made Margaret read it out loud {{in front of the whole}} class which resulted in everyone laughing at her. She then realized that the teacher had done it deliberately just to be cruel to her and knew why the other budgie never wanted to leave its cage.|$|E
