2500|$|After the {{occurrence}} of World War I, the Gibson Girl transformed into the Flapper, which dominated {{the period of the}} “Roaring Twenties”. Women transitioned towards androgynous looks, whereby hairstyles were kept short, and wore brassieres that flatten the chest. Loose clothing was also a trend, as it downplayed the waist by lowering it below the navel, resulting in a straight boyish figure. Dress senses soon become more casual as well, and {{is said to have been}} a representation of the reduction in social or political tension after the war, or an extensive disagreement with the Prohibition movement. With advertisements increasingly advocating the need to achieve a thinner frame, many women therefore pursued diets and exercises. Although slimmer body types were favoured, a sporty and healthy appearance was still prized above the frail and sickly look from the Victorian Era.The 1930’s and 1940’s witnessed the devastating effects of the 2nd World War, which unfortunately led to The Great Depression. While men were out on the battlefield, females began entering the <b>workface.</b> This resulted in more formal and traditional military dress styles for women, which caused another shift in body image. While waists’ remained thin but prominent, the media embraced a more curvaceous look similar to the hourglass figure, through the addition of broad shoulders and large breasts as well. Since this era was part of the golden age of Hollywood, many celebrities continued to influence this trend by wearing tight fitted clothing that emphasized their figures. Pin-up girls and sex symbols radiating glamour soon followed in the 1950’s, and the proportions of the hourglass figure expanded. Notable names include Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, and Jessica Rabbit. In order to achieve this ideal figure, women consumed weight-gain supplements [...] The release of Playboy magazine and the Barbie doll during this era were other additions in the need to achieve this ideal.Depictions of the perfect woman; however, slowly grew thinner from 1960’s onwards. The “Swinging Sixties” saw a similar look to the Flapper with the emergence of high-fashion model Twiggy, who promoted the thin and petite frame, with long slender legs, and an adolescent but androgynous figure. Other characteristics include, small busts, narrow hips, and flat stomachs. Hence, many women either underwent diets or switched to weight-loss supplements to achieve the new look. This eventually resulted in an increase in anorexia nervosa sufferers during the 1970’s. Nonetheless, greater importance was soon placed on fitness, and actress Farrah Fawcett introduced a more toned and athletic body type. The exercise craze continued in the 1980’s with Jane Fonda and the release of workout videos, motivating women to be thin but fit and svelte. This era also saw the rise of tall, long legged supermodels; such as Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford, dominating the industry, and setting a new beauty standard for females around the world.|$|E
50|$|In early shield tunnelling, {{the shield}} {{functioned as a}} way to protect labourers who {{performed}} the digging and moved the shield forward, progressively replacing it with pre-built sections of tunnel wall. The early deep tunnels for the London Underground were built in this way. The shield divided the <b>workface</b> into overlapping portions that each worker could excavate.|$|E
50|$|As mines {{increased}} {{in size and}} output, the aforementioned methods became impractical because of the distances and quantities of material involved, so larger carts would be used, hauled by narrow gauge diesel and electric locomotives (in coal mining operations, where gas that is flammable would present a problem, the locomotives would be flameproof or battery powered). These were also used to pull trains transporting miners to the <b>workfaces.</b>|$|R
25|$|The tunnel was {{constructed}} from many <b>workfaces,</b> with 25 shafts sunk along its course to provide access. After completion there were problems, and the tunnel was shut {{for two and}} a half months during 1790 for further work to be carried out. The summit level and a branch to Cirencester were completed in 1787, and became operational as soon as the tunnel opened. The final section to the junction with the Thames at Inglesham, which descends through 16 locks, was finished in November 1789. The canal was completed at a cost of £250,000. With the Stroudwater Navigation, which had been completed in 1779, it completed a link between the River Severn in the west and the River Thames in the east.|$|R
50|$|By late summer, the {{decision}} had been taken to build a broad tunnel, 15 ft high and 15 ft wide, and the company advertised for tunnellers in September. The tunnel would be 3817 yd long, and was expected to take four years to complete, beginning in early 1784. In order to speed the work, 25 shafts were sunk along its length, to provide multiple <b>workfaces,</b> the deepest of which was 244 ft. The construction contract was awarded to Charles Jones, who managed to build about one third of it, but then had financial difficulties, and so {{a number of other}} contractors were engaged to work on smaller sections of it. The tunnel was opened on 20 April 1789 after five years of construction. It has no towpath; boats were propelled through the tunnel by legging. There were some defects in the workmanship, as it had to be closed for ten weeks after only a year, while repairs were carried out.|$|R
50|$|A {{full-sized}} portable jackhammer is impractical for {{use against}} walls and steep slopes, except {{by a very}} strong person, as the user would have to both support {{the weight of the}} tool, and push the tool back against the work after each blow. A technique developed by experienced workers is a two-man team to overcome this obstacle of gravity: one operates the hammer and the second assists by holding the hammer either on his shoulders or cradled in his arms. Both use their combined weight to push the bit into the <b>workface.</b> This method is commonly referred to as horizontal jackhammering.|$|E
50|$|By late August 1952 the Ministry of Works had {{completed}} the two cableways that were {{to be used to}} carry concrete to the <b>workface.</b> To manufacture concrete on site the Ministry of Works purchased a Johnson concrete batching plant that had been used by the United States Navy in the reconstruction of Pearl Harbour after the Japanese attack in 1941. This came into operation in early April 1953. Upon completion of Roxburgh the plant was transported first to Benmore power station and then later to Aviemore power station and the Pukaki dam to mix aggregate for the penstocks, spillways and other concrete structures.|$|E
50|$|Among slotted screwdrivers, {{variations}} at {{the blade}} or bit end involve {{the profile of}} the blade as viewed face-on (from the side of the tool). The more common type is sometimes referred to as keystone, where the blade profile is slightly flared before tapering off at the end, which provides extra stiffness to the <b>workface</b> and makes it capable of withstanding more torque. To maximize access in space-restricted applications, the cabinet variant screwdriver blade sides are straight and parallel, reaching the end of the blade at a right angle. This design is also frequently used in jeweler's screwdrivers.|$|E
50|$|Work {{began with}} Outram acting as {{engineer}} and Brown acting as superintendent and surveyor. In July 1795, John Evans {{was appointed to}} manage the boring of the tunnel. By mid-1796, 795 yd of tunnel had been cut, some {{of which had been}} lined, but much effort had been spent on constructing small tunnels to supply waterwheels which would raise spoil and water from the intermediate adits. By the autumn, there was concern that such work was expensive but had not contributed anything to the task in hand and soon afterwards, Outram abandoned the attempt to build extra <b>workfaces</b> in order to concentrate on working from both ends. Although cheaper, this choice extended the completion date. Tunnelling was hampered by much larger quantities of water entering the workings than had been expected. In September 1797, Outram advised the management committee that Thomas Lee, the first contractor to be employed on the tunnel works, had made large losses {{as a result of the}} difficulties and could not complete his contract. He was awarded more money for timber, an increased rate per yard for completion and an extra year in which to finish.|$|R

The excavated mud would be carted away to the surface using battery-operated electric locomotives. In some cases, the silt would be baked with kerosene torches to facilitate easier removal of the mud. The southernmost tunnel of the uptown pair, as well as the downtown tunnels, were all constructed using the tubular cast iron and tunneling shield method.|$|E
50|$|On 25 August 2010, around 13:10 CET, {{breakthrough}} {{was achieved}} in the eastern tunnel. Drilling then switched to the western tunnel, which started in March 2011 from the <b>workface</b> {{at the south end}} and proceeded north. On 3 April 2012, this drive reached the central adit, whereupon 2,517 m, or 46 percent, of the western tunnel had been bored. The remaining 1,144 m to be drilled, which totaled 15 percent of the entire drilling project, was expected to be particularly challenging, as it contains a section of poor quality bedrock and significant amounts of water and water pressure. An extra freezing stage, plus extra time (4 to 6 months) allotted for freezing, and thicker concrete lining segments, was utilized in this 300 m problem area, which is longer than the adjacent area encountered in the eastern bore. By the end of August 2013, a total of 5,379 m or 99.1 percent of the western bore had been drilled, and on 4 September 2013, the second tunnel broke through.|$|E

40|$|Keywords-component: Coal seam {{with thin}} cover; Surrounding rocks; Support {{capacity}} Abstract—The showing of ground pressure is severe in <b>workface</b> of coal seam with thin upper cover, {{due to the}} thin upper rock seam and the action of upper incompact cover. Generally, the thin cover coal seam with 90 m upper cover {{can be defined as}} Coal seam with thin cover. The result of simulation experiment for <b>workface</b> with thin cover and 5 m mining height shows that under overburden pressure, the step subsidence is obvious, and balanced structure is still formed in surrounding rock, under overburden pressure. But the shape and form of balanced structure are different from the balanced structure formed upper coal seam with normal buried depth. There appears step or dislocation between the upper rock seam in <b>workface</b> and the balanced structure in the mined-out area, and the quantity of dislocation is 2 m. But no step subsidence appears in the simulation for the <b>workface</b> with thin cover and 3 m mining height. So the mining height is the key for the step subsidence.

40|$|Mine fires mainly {{arise from}} {{spontaneous}} combustion of coal seams {{and are a}} global issue that has attracted increasing public attention. Particularly in china, the closure of coal workfaces because of spontaneous combustion has contributed to substantial economic loss. To reduce the occurrence of mine fires, the spontaneous coal combustion underground needs to be studied. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed for coal spontaneous combustion under goaf gas drainage conditions. The CFD model was used to simulate the distribution of oxygen in the goaf at the <b>workface</b> in a fully mechanized cave mine. The goaf was treated as an anisotropic medium, {{and the effects of}} methane drainage and oxygen consumption on spontaneous combustion were considered. The simulation results matched observational data from a field study, which indicates CFD simulation is suitable for research on the distribution of oxygen in coalmines. The results also indicated that near the <b>workface</b> spontaneous combustion was more likely to take place in {{the upper part of the}} goaf than near the bottom, while further from <b>workface</b> the risk of spontaneous combustion was greater in the lower part of the goaf. These results can be used to develop firefighting approaches for coalmines...|$|E

40|$|In the {{construction}} industry, onsite labour {{is one of}} the most variable and costly factors which affect project profits. Due to the variable nature of construction labour and its correlation with profits, construction managers require a comprehensive understanding of the activities of workers onsite. For project success, it is important that workers are spending the majority of their time installing materials which advance the project. This material installation time is known in {{the construction}} industry as “direct-work” or “tool time”. Site management should continuously seek to improve the direct-work rate through the life of the project. A review of the literature indicates that no <b>workface</b> assessment method exists in the literature which provides: (1) a detailed description of worker activities, and (2) a continuous productivity improvement process to help management identify productivity inhibitors affecting site labour, to develop a plan to reduce or eliminate these issues, and to measure improvements as a result of these changes. In response to this need, this research has focused on the development of a <b>workface</b> assessment method called activity analysis. Activity analysis is a continuous productivity improvement process which efficiently measures the time expenditure of workers onsite and identifies productivity inhibitors that management must reduce or eliminate to provide workers with more time for direct-work activities. Six case studies were conducted to verify the feasibility of the activity analysis process. Further, cyclical data from two major construction firms was collected and statistically analyzed to validate the hypothesis that activity analysis can improve direct-work rates. It has been concluded that activity analysis, as a continuous productivity improvement process, is both feasible and when continually applied to a construction site, can significantly improve direct-work rates through the life of a project...|$|E

A Photo-AR scene, consisting of existing plant facilities plus virtual models of temporary facilities, can be linked with a scheduled event on an industrial construction project. The AR scene is instrumental in revealing and analyzing potential <b>workface</b> space conflicts and refining the estimate of productivity for construction scheduling. In previous research, the Photo-AR requires at least two control points with known coordinates fixed on the site explicitly visible in each photo.

30|$|Similarly, {{poor design}} {{communication}} {{can lead to}} errors and confusion in task execution. Some of the issues result from {{the difference in the}} message intended versus the message received. The format and intent of drawings is easier to comprehend by the designer that creates the drawing than it is for the contractor and his/her workforce that has to interpret the message (Emmitt and Gorse [2003]). This problem is magnified when the contractor must reference several different drawings to understand the design intent for a particular building element. Further, different symbols and terminology used by various designers can also lead to confusion and complications (Emmitt and Gorse [2003]). Mourgues and Fischer ([2008]) argue that communication of project information to the <b>workface</b> is ineffective and can negatively impact quality, safety, and productivity. Studying the understanding and communication of design throughout all project participants can greatly improve project outcomes by increasing project morale, improving productivity, and reducing rework.|$|E
