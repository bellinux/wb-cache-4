5|$|Kerala's {{sex ratio}} of 1.084 {{is higher than}} that of the rest of India and is the only state where women outnumber men. While having the {{opportunities}} that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, equal rights for the women of Kerala. There is a general attitude that <b>women</b> <b>must</b> be restricted for their own benefit. In the state, despite the social progress, gender still influences social mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{church has}} six weekly services, {{one of them}} located in the Rue Battant {{especially}} for people with disabilities. Each meeting is devoted to a particular Christian practice: evangelization, prayer, Bible reading, singing, and weekly worship. Meetings are composed of biblical sermons and studies, testimonies of religious experiences, hymns, meditation, worship, and prayers. Services are dynamic, charismatic and emotional, often evolving into ecstasy and trance; glossolalia results when the pastor calls the Holy Spirit to come upon the congregation, and usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes. <b>Women</b> <b>must</b> have their heads covered during worship.|$|E
5|$|Women {{were usually}} {{identified}} as victims during the independence wars since {{the women of}} Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that <b>women</b> <b>must</b> sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due {{to the loss of}} many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics {{in the hands of the}} men.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including <b>women)</b> <b>must</b> own property.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Cornell {{admitted}} {{its first}} female students, {{making it the}} first coeducational school among {{what came to be}} known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872. The requirement that women (at least freshman <b>women)</b> <b>must</b> live in dormitories, which started in 1884, served to constrain female student admissions until 1972, when Cornell dropped its freshman dorm residency requirement. As a result, the academic admission standards for women in each college were typically higher than the corresponding standards for men. In general, women have been over-represented in certain schools and under-represented in others. For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the Cornell School of Nursing historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the College of Engineering attracted fewer women.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, {{underwear}} maker Jockey International {{offered a}} new way to measure bra and cup size. It introduced a system with ten cup sizes per band size that are numbered and not lettered, designated as 1-36, 2-36 etc. The company developed the system over eight years, during which they scanned and measured the breasts and torsos of 800 women. Researchers also tracked the women's use of their bras at home. To implement the system, <b>women</b> <b>must</b> purchase a set of plastic cups from the company to find their Jockey cup size. Some analysts were critical of the requirement to buy the measurement kit, since <b>women</b> <b>must</b> pay about USD$20 to adopt Jockey's proprietary system, in addition to the cost of the bras themselves.|$|E

25|$|Divorce became {{legal in}} Brazil in 1977, {{with the law}} {{permitting}} each person only one divorce in a lifetime and only after a three -year legal or five-year de facto separation.

25|$|Historians {{have paid}} special {{attention}} to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal Weimar Republic. It appears {{the role of women in}} Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances. Theoretically the Nazis believed that <b>women</b> <b>must</b> be subservient to men, avoid careers, devote themselves to childbearing and child-rearing, and be a helpmate of the traditional dominant father in the traditional family.|$|E
25|$|Women legally {{have equal}} {{ownership}} rights, although in locations {{along the east}} coast of Madagascar they may be unable to own land.

However, in cases of spousal abuse, <b>women</b> <b>must</b> report the crime themselves in order for the police to act. Although calling the police is rare, women also have a traditional right known as misintaka that allows them to leave their husbands and live with their families.|$|E
25|$|During {{pregnancy}} and breastfeeding, <b>women</b> <b>must</b> ingest enough nutrients {{for themselves and}} their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K). In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in developing countries and increased the risk of death during childbirth. A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).|$|E

It is compulsory to remove the shoes before entering the temple, {{as a sign of}} respect of the Buddha, as is the practice in all other temples in Thailand. While offering prayers before the Buddha image, the sitting posture should avoid any offensive stretching of feet towards the deity; the feet should be tucked in towards the back.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuities {{reports on}} and {{analyzes}} the shifting patterns of contemporary adolescent sexuality. Wolf argues that literature {{is rife with}} examples of male coming-of-age stories, covered autobiographically by D. H. Lawrence, Tobias Wolff, J. D. Salinger, and Ernest Hemingway, and covered misogynistically by Henry Miller, Philip Roth, and Norman Mailer. Wolf insists, however, that female accounts of adolescent sexuality have been systematically suppressed. She adduces cross-cultural material to demonstrate that women have, across history, been celebrated as more carnal than men. Wolf also argues that <b>women</b> <b>must</b> reclaim the legitimacy of their own sexuality by shattering the polarization of women between virgin and whore.|$|E
