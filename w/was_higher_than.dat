30|$|To {{illustrate}} this {{feature of the}} model, Fig.  5 depicts the value functions associated with honoring the outstanding debt obligations, receiving financial aid and defaulting. These value functions assume a fixed value of output. One then can identify four regions. In region 1 (R 1), the value of defaulting <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the other two value functions (i.e., paying and financial aid), therefore, defaulting on the outstanding debt is the optimal solution. In region 2 (R 2), the value of receiving financial aid <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the other two value functions (i.e., defaulting and paying). In addition, the value of defaulting <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the value of honoring the outstanding debt. Accordingly, in this region, financial aid prevents a default episode. In region 3 (R 3), the value of receiving financial aid <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the value of paying back debt and the latter <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the value of defaulting. Therefore, financial aid works as a subsidy. In region 4 (R 4), the value of honoring the outstanding debt <b>is</b> <b>higher</b> <b>than</b> the other two value functions (i.e., defaulting and financial aid). This has as a repercussion that the agent will not default regardless of official aid.|$|R
