5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as <b>was</b> <b>Tiny</b> Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
5|$|The early anti-smoking {{campaign}} {{was considered a}} failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany. The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring France, where the anti-tobacco movement <b>was</b> <b>tiny</b> and far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630.|$|E

[...] National Journal magazine named her one of its [...] "Ten Freshmen to Watch", and said that her election [...] "is a sign {{of things to come}} in California and a generational changing of the guard in the Hispanic Caucus". [...] Solis commissioned for her new office a painting of the United States Capitol with the San Gabriel Mountains behind it, so that she would not forget her roots.

500|$|Macdonald faced a huge, but {{critical}} task in overseeing {{the expansion of}} the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). As historian Desmond Morton points out, the RCN <b>was</b> <b>tiny</b> when Canada entered the war in 1939. It consisted of six destroyers, five minesweepers and about 3,000 personnel in its regular forces and volunteer reserves. By the time Macdonald took office in 1940, the RCN had grown to 100 ships and more than 7,000 personnel, but as biographer Stephen Henderson notes, [...] "few of its ships and sailors were ready for service at sea". By the end of the war, the RCN had expanded by 50 times its original strength with about 400 fighting ships, almost 500 additional craft and about 96,000 men and women.|$|E
500|$|Crawley {{began to}} develop slowly from the 13th century, when it was granted a royal charter for a market. [...] Its ecclesiastical parish, centred on St John the Baptist's Church, <b>was</b> <b>tiny</b> in {{comparison}} to neighbouring Worth and Ifield. [...] The parish had an unusual shape: very narrow, long from north to south, and gradually widening to the north until it met the county boundary with Surrey. [...] This directed development northwards along the High Street, part of the ancient London to Brighton road which had provided the impetus for development to begin. [...] The road was partly turnpiked after an Act of Parliament in 1696, and became fully turnpiked in 1770. [...] By this time {{the distinction between the}} name [...] "London Road" [...] (the section north of the church) and [...] "Brighton Road" [...] (southwards) had been made; and tollgates were built north and south of the town: these became known as the North Gate and South Gate.|$|E

500|$|Bobby Orr {{displayed}} his hockey talents from {{an early}} age. Orr played his first organized hockey in 1953 at age five, in the [...] "minor squirt" [...] division, a year after getting his first skates and playing shinny. Although he <b>was</b> <b>tiny</b> and somewhat frail, he soon was able to skate faster than anyone his own age, speed he demonstrated in races around the rink and in games. Until he was ten years old, Orr played on the wing, as a forward. His coach, former NHL player Bucko McDonald moved Orr to defence. Although Orr played defence, McDonald encouraged Orr to use his talents as a stickhandler, skater and scorer to make offensive rushes. According to McDonald: [...] "I used to tell Doug the kid was in his natural position when he played defence. You didn't have to be genius to see that – honest. I don't think Doug agreed, but he accepted my decision." [...] Orr would later credit McDonald: [...] "Bucko taught me almost everything I know." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea {{of using}} [...] "Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight" [...] {{originated}} when an anonymous sent Hillenburg a tape with [...] "a bunch of music." [...] While the writers were developing the show outside Nickelodeon, Hillenburg played the song for Drymon {{as an example of}} the enthusiasm he was looking for. When it came time to write the pilot, they had the idea to use the song in the third act. The crew eventually got the rights to use the song for the pilot, but all they had was [...] "the crummy copy on Steve's old tape." [...] The writers were able to use the music, as one of the women who worked at Nickelodeon at the time [...] "knew somebody somewhere who had access to something," [...] and she brought in a copy of the song on CD. Drymon said [...] "We were totally lucky that she had the contact, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to use it. The sad part <b>was</b> <b>Tiny</b> Tim died right around the time we were writing the pilot, so he never knew we used his song." ...|$|E
500|$|She began {{performing}} at age six {{when she was}} cast in the lead singing role of [...] "Little Star" [...] in the Christmas play at her school, Fendalton Open Air School. After the show, a teacher who had watched the performance approached her parents {{to tell them that}} their daughter was [...] "pitch perfect". The teacher encouraged Westenra to learn how to play a musical instrument; Hayley soon after learned to read music and play the violin, piano, guitar, and recorder. She then began voice lessons and discovered a passion for musical theatre. By age 11, she had performed more than 40 times on stage, but was often given male parts: [...] "I got boy parts quite often. In ballet, there were not enough boys. So they ended up choosing half and half. I got chosen to wear the grey suit and the wig, and not the pretty dresses. In A Christmas Carol, I <b>was</b> <b>Tiny</b> Tim, so I got to be quite a sick, sick boy. There was a severe lack of singing boys and, at the time, it was quite disappointing." [...] Westenra attended Cobham Intermediate School in 1998 and 1999, where a performing arts building was later named in her honour. She won a talent quest in her first year (Year 9) at Burnside High School, which she attended from 2000 to 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Whether {{or not the}} Newspeak {{appendix}} {{implies a}} hopeful end to Nineteen Eighty-Four remains a critical debate, {{as it is in}} Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the past tense: [...] "Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary <b>was</b> <b>tiny,</b> and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised" [...] p.422). Some critics (Atwood, Benstead, Milner, Pynchon) claim that for the essay's author, both Newspeak and the totalitarian government are in the past.|$|E

This was followed almost immediately with test deployments. However, the total signal sent end-to-end <b>was</b> <b>tiny,</b> and the un-amplified system could only be used with powerful signals. Early experiments carried out aboard Eskimo and Royal George, {{as well as the}} RMS Mauretania were successful, but the range was limited to about [...] In testing on the USS Wyoming, the US Navy found that the ship's own magnetism overwhelmed the signal produced from the sense coils, producing an output that suggested the transmitter was always in front of the ship.|$|E
2500|$|Purchase of {{the land}} on which BMS now sits, as well as initial {{construction}} of the track, cost approximately $600,000. The entire layout for BMS covered [...] and provided parking for more than 12,000 cars. The track itself was a perfect , measuring [...] wide on the straightaways, [...] wide in the turns, and the turns were banked at 22degrees. Seating capacity {{for the very first}} NASCAR race at BMS– held on July 30, 1961– was 18,000. Prior to this race the speedway hosted weekly races. The first driver on the track for practice on July 27, 1961 <b>was</b> <b>Tiny</b> Lund in his Pontiac. The second driver out was David Pearson. Fred Lorenzen won the pole for the first race at BMS with a speed of [...] Atlanta's Jack Smith won the inaugural event– the Volunteer 500– at BMS. However, Smith was not in the driver's seat of the Pontiac when the race ended. Smith drove the first 290 laps then had to have Johnny Allen, also of Atlanta, take over as his relief driver. The two shared the $3,225 purse. The total purse for the race was $16,625. Country music star Brenda Lee, who was 17 at the time, sang the national anthem for the first race at BMS. A total of 42 cars started the first race at BMS but only 19 finished.|$|E
