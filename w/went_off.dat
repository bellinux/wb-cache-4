5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, <b>went</b> <b>off</b> at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also <b>went</b> <b>off</b> at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E
5|$|In its later history, HIAG was {{monitored}} by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution as a far-right organisation. It briefly <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the list of neo-Nazi and extremist groups in 1984, causing another controversy.|$|E

5|$|The British war {{propaganda}} film 49th Parallel (1941) {{uses the}} name U-37 for the German submarine whose crew comes ashore in Canada during WW2. The craft is shown being blown up in Hudson Bay. The film was released {{shortly after the}} real U-37 <b>went</b> <b>off</b> active service.|$|E
5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, he asked his admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart and <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to London anyway.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland {{finished}} in eighth place in 1914–15 Division One season, before World War I forced the break-up {{of the team}} as men <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to fight on the continent. Charlie Buchan and Bob Young each {{went on to win}} the Military Medal. After the resumption of the Football League following the war, Sunderland finished fifth in the 1919–20 season.|$|E

5|$|The second {{practice}} session {{was held in}} wet but drying weather conditions. During the session, Schumacher <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the track at the exit of turnfive, damaging his car's front wing in the process. However, he still set the fastest time of the session (1:23.607) after a change to his car's ride height proved beneficial to its performance. The top six was completed by Berger, Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, and Olivier Panis' Ligier.|$|E
5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} {{the ball on}} the left flank, and played a ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only to see it sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal. Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso <b>went</b> <b>off</b> with an injury to be replaced by defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal. West Ham subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
5|$|As KG 53 retreated out to sea, the German bombers dumped their bombs. Around 32 German bombs fell on {{the town}} of Shoeburyness. Two houses were {{destroyed}} and 20 damaged. One bomb landed on an Anderson Air Raid Shelter, killing {{a man and his}} wife. Another landed on the railway signal box, killing the signalman. Several bombs fell on a War Department gunnery range, causing no damage. Some 200 German bombs {{fell on the}} mud flats and sandbanks off Shoeburyness. Many were delayed-action bombs, and <b>went</b> <b>off</b> at irregular intervals.|$|E

5|$|At Extreme Rules, Edge {{helped his}} friend Christian {{to win the}} vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At SummerSlam, Edge was in Christian's corner for his World Heavyweight Championship defense against Randy Orton but, {{disappointed}} by the cowardly tactics Christian used to win his second World Heavyweight Championship, berated him and walked out on him. Christian then lost the title to Orton for a second time. On the September 16, 2011 episode of SmackDown, {{in his hometown of}} Toronto, Edge hosted The Cutting Edge between Mark Henry and the World Heavyweight Champion, Randy Orton. After the show <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the air, they held Edge Appreciation Night to celebrate his career.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and <b>went</b> <b>off</b> on strange tangents. The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed to countries including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Following his discharge, Statton {{settled in}} Fitzgerald, Tasmania, where he gained {{employment}} in the timber industry. True to her word that she would leave him if he <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to war, Statton's wife divorced him on 1 October 1920. Five years later, on 21 December 1925, he married Eliza Grace Hudson (née Parker) at the Registrar General's Office, Hobart. In 1934, severe bushfires {{broke out in the}} Derwent Valley, and Statton took a prominent role in rescue work aiding families isolated by the fire.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, a {{security}} system at a scrap metal yard, {{which had been}} repeatedly burglarized, <b>went</b> <b>off.</b> The yard's owner {{was at the time}} on a hunt close to the yard and drove directly to it. A group of burglars jumped into their car and attempted to drive away. The owner used his shotgun and attempted to shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for intentional infliction of bodily harm, a sentence that was confirmed on appeal. The owner received full presidential pardon.|$|E
5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again. He <b>went</b> <b>off</b> at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while {{he was doing a}} run on {{intermediate}} tyres in wet conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of the}} session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{people and}} al-Balawi {{were killed by}} the blast. Seven were CIA personnel: five officers, {{including}} the chief of the base, and two contractors. One was a Jordanian intelligence officer and another was the Afghan driver. Six other CIA personnel were seriously wounded in the attack, including the deputy chief of Kabul station. Some of those killed had already approached the bomber to search him, whereas others killed were standing some distance away. At least 13 intelligence officers were within 50 feet of al-Balawi when the bomb <b>went</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
50|$|On July 31, 2006, {{two people}} placed two {{suitcases}} filled with bombs on regional trains in Germany. The bombs {{were supposed to}} <b>go</b> <b>off</b> near Hamm and Koblenz and according to German investigators, {{would have resulted in}} the deaths of hundreds of people. However, due to faulty construction, the bombs did not <b>go</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
60|$|Apparently, however, it does not. It {{seems to}} be a train that starts out from Munich at 1.45, and <b>goes</b> <b>off</b> on the loose.

5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm <b>went</b> <b>off</b> and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Rollins put {{the show}} on a short hiatus to {{undertake}} a spoken-word tour in early 2005. Rollins posted playlists and commentary on-line; these lists were expanded with more information and published in book form as Fanatic! through 2.13.61 in November 2005. In late 2005, Rollins announced the show's return and began the first episode by playing the show's namesake Buzzcocks song. In 2008, the show was continuing each week despite Rollins's constant touring with new pre-recorded shows between live broadcasts. In 2009 Indie 103.1 <b>went</b> <b>off</b> the air, although it continues to broadcast over the Internet.|$|E
