5|$|After {{moving into}} the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, {{oversized}} shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a corduroy suit with no lapels that he <b>wore</b> <b>on</b> stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.|$|E
5|$|As the 1950s <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> the IRFU and WIFU distanced {{themselves}} from the CRU, forming the Canadian Football Council in 1956 to administer the game at the professional level. Two years later, on January 18, 1958, the CFC withdrew from the CRU and reorganized as the Canadian Football League (CFL). The new league formally assumed control of the Grey Cup from the CRU.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> Art Deco {{emerged as}} a popular {{building}} style, {{as evidenced by the}} Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined concrete faced appearance with smooth stone or metal, with terracotta, and trimming consisting of glass and colored tiles.|$|E
50|$|For {{military}} officers, {{the medal}} {{is accompanied by}} a ribbon bar for <b>wearing</b> <b>on</b> military uniform, a miniature medal pendant for <b>wearing</b> <b>on</b> mess uniform, and a lapel badge for <b>wearing</b> <b>on</b> civilian clothes.|$|R
5000|$|Shoulder sleeve {{insignia}} {{receive their}} {{name from the}} fact that they are most commonly <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper left shoulders of all U.S. Army uniforms, though they can be placed on other locations, notably a combat helmet. Shoulder sleeve insignia <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper right shoulders on Army uniforms denote former wartime service. These [...] "combat patches" [...] are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Army Combat Uniform but are not <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Army Service Uniform. Instead a 2 inch metal replica is <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the right breast pocket and is officially known as the Combat Service Identification Badge.|$|R

5|$|As {{the night}} <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> {{reinforcements}} arrived {{from a nearby}} British hill fort which had as yet been ignored by the Pashtun forces. At 4:15pm, the attacking forces withdrew with their dead and wounded. The British had lost {{a large number of}} officers wounded, and recorded 21 deaths amongst the sepoys.|$|E
5|$|However, without Newcastle's {{infantry}}, {{and with}} his own infantry exhausted from their long march on the previous day, Rupert was unable to attack, and the odds against him lengthened as the day <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> and the Scots and Parliamentarian infantry and artillery returned from their aborted move south and took position.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{lesson from the}} Tunisia Campaign was that neuropsychiatric casualties had {{to be treated as}} soon as possible and not evacuated from the combat zone. This was not done {{in the early stages of}} the Sicilian Campaign, and large numbers of neuropsychiatric casualties were evacuated to North Africa, with the result that treatment became complicated and only 15 percent of them were returned to duty. As the campaign <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> the system became better organized and nearly 50 percent were restored to combat duty.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{place for the}} SSI to be <b>worn</b> is <b>on</b> the {{shoulder}} of the uniform, however it is also sometimes <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> other places, notably when the soldier's body armor covers the shoulders. SSI are also commonly <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder pads of interceptor body armor, which covers the SSI on the uniform. Some soldiers also <b>wear</b> SSI <b>on</b> their MICH TC-2000 Combat Helmets, however this is not standard practice for all units. Some SSI are too large to be <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the helmets. SSI are also occasionally <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the backpacks or rucksacks of soldiers, but this is not standard practice and is usually personal preference.|$|R
50|$|SADF Nutria Badges <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> Combat Uniform {{known as}} Browns, whilst the Metal {{insignia}} were <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the Dress Uniform known as Step-Outs.|$|R
5|$|As the 19th century <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities. It was not until the National Assistance Act of 1948 that the last vestiges of the Poor Law disappeared, and with them the workhouses.|$|E
5|$|In February 1955, Saban was {{promoted}} to head coach at Northwestern, succeeding Bob Voigts and becoming the youngest coach in the Big Ten Conference at 33 years old. Saban's tenure {{as coach of the}} Northwestern Wildcats football team, however, was brief and unsuccessful. Hampered by injuries, the team lost all of its games in 1955, and calls intensified for Saban's firing as the season <b>wore</b> <b>on.</b> In December, Saban and his entire staff were fired by new athletic director Stu Holcomb. Ara Parseghian was named as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Seven Days Battles, Lee's {{forces had}} been {{separated}} and scattered due to swamps, narrow roads and other geographic obstacles, and occasionally due to unclear orders. As {{the days of}} marching and fighting <b>wore</b> <b>on</b> the number of stragglers swelled to fill narrow roads and significantly deplete the Confederate ranks, presenting a significant additional strain on their combat readiness. These hindrances continued during the Battle of Malvern Hill, with both Magruder and Huger making mistakes in the deployment of their forces.|$|E

5000|$|Officer's {{insignia}} were officially <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the collars of {{the shirt}} with Class B uniform. The officer's rank insignia was <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the right collar and {{the branch of}} service insignia (e.g., crossed muskets for Infantry) was <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the left collar. To prevent targeting by snipers, a set of rank insignia were usually <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder straps in combat. Warrant Officers wore the Warrant Officer [...] "Wreathed Rising Eagle" [...] (or [...] "Squashed Bug") as their branch of service insignia.|$|R
5|$|After the season, Márquez and Jurietti {{departed}} Monaco for Spanish club Barcelona and Bordeaux respectively, {{and were}} replaced by Gaël Givet and Hugo Ibarra, the latter joining the club on loan. In the 2003–04 league season, Deschamps installed Evra as a vice-captain and he responded by appearing in 33 matches and providing four assists. Monaco spent six months from September to March in first place, but, like last season, conceded the top spot to Lyon as the season <b>wore</b> <b>on.</b> Evra made his UEFA Champions League debut on 17 September 2003 in the team's opening group stage match against PSV. Evra played the entire match in a 2–1 win. He appeared in all six group stage matches as Monaco finished in first place. For his performances {{in the first half}} of the 2003–04 season, Evra was linked with a 2004 winter move to English club Arsenal, Italian clubs Juventus and Milan, and Spanish club Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century <b>wore</b> <b>on</b> non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit {{the civil rights of}} Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of the}} failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment of a Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|As the day <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> {{conditions}} {{appeared more}} and more favorable for thunderstorms, and {{more and more}} similar to the events of March 20. Weather radar images showed a severe squall line had formed to the west, and weather stations to the west reported cumulonimbus clouds and thunderstorms. In an afternoon meeting, under some pressure from their commanding officer, base meteorologists composed and issued the first official tornado forecast. Although they were aware of the small chance of success, they felt they had no choice, since the conditions were so similar to March 20. Equipment which could be was moved to bomb-proof shelters, and base personnel were moved to safer areas.|$|E

The khaki uniforms use green stripes on khaki flash, and again are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the upper sleeves of both long and short-sleeved service blouses. Utility uniform rank insignia are black metal pins and are <b>worn</b> <b>on</b> the collars, or black embroidered insignia sewn into patches of material when wearing a flak. Musicians in the United States Marine Band wear insignia with lyre {{in the center}} {{as opposed to the}} crossed rifles, to denote their lack of a combat mission; full-service Marines who are attached to the 10 field bands of the Operating Forces and Supporting Establishment continue to wear their normal rank insignia.|$|R
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under way. A {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot <b>wore</b> <b>on</b> into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} 1923 season, Coveleski pitched 27 {{straight}} scoreless innings, winning {{three consecutive}} games during that time. However, he won less frequently as the season <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> losing three straight games in mid-August. His last game came on August 15, with over a month left in the season. Coveleski finished {{the season with a}} 13–14 record, his first season with a losing record. Despite that, he had an ERA of 2.76 and five shutouts, both of which led the AL. In 1924, Coveleski struggled, {{and at the end of}} May, he had four losses and an ERA of 6.49. By the end of the season, he had a 15–16 record and a 4.04 ERA. In December 1924, after nine years pitching for Cleveland, Coveleski was traded to the Washington Senators for pitcher By Speece and outfielder Carr Smith.|$|E
5|$|Individually, Iginla reached 900 career {{points in}} a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his 1,000th career game against the Florida Panthers. Iginla {{struggled}} offensively to begin the 2010–11 season, and with the Flames falling {{to the bottom of}} the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly reiterated that they were not interested in moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days later that he had declined to play in the All-Star Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.|$|E

5|$|Nasri {{continued}} his fine form as season <b>wore</b> <b>on.</b> In the club's Champions League group stage tie against Serbian club Partizan, he assisted on a Sébastien Squillaci {{goal in the}} team's 3–1 victory. In October 2010, Nasri went on a streak in which he scored goals in three-straight matches. He started the streak by converting a penalty in a 2–1 win over Birmingham City. In the club's following match, against Shakhtar Donetsk, Nasri scored on a left-footed volley in a 5–1 victory. He also assisted on a goal in the match. Against Manchester City five days later, he scored the first goal {{and set up the}} third in a 3–0 victory. As a result of his performances in October 2010, Nasri was named the PFA Fans' Player of the Month. In November, Nasri was on the score-sheet again netting the opener in a 3–2 defeat to Tottenham. A week later, he scored a volley in a 4–2 win over Aston Villa.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska {{was ranked}} No. 1 in the Associated Press preseason poll, and {{lived up to}} the ranking in its first game of the season. On September 7, Nebraska {{overwhelmed}} the Michigan State Spartans, 5514. After an off week, however, Nebraska fans were shocked by one of the first big national upsets of the season as Nebraska was shut out by No. 17 Arizona State, 190. The loss dropped Nebraska to No. 8 in the rankings, but as the season <b>wore</b> <b>on,</b> Nebraska rose through the ranks as the Cornhuskers won seven consecutive games. Nebraska's 101 record to that point earned it a trip to the first-ever Big 12 Championship Game in St. Louis, Missouri, against the Texas Longhorns.|$|E
