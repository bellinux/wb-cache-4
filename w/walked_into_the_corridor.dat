25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Auvinen spotted the first {{responding}} {{police officers and}} paramedics converging at {{the area of the}} inner court. He fired a shot at them through a window, but the bullet failed to penetrate the glass. At 12:04, he took another position near the main entrance and fired two more shots at police officers who tried to approach and negotiate with him. No officers were hit. Soon afterward, Auvinen <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> next to the canteen and shot himself in the head, ending the shooting.|$|E
60|$|Alec did not answer. In {{order to}} break off the {{conversation}} {{he got up and}} <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> He lit a cigar and watched the green fields that fled past them. For two hours he stood motionless. At last he took his seat again, with a shrug of the shoulders, and a scornful smile on his lips.|$|E
60|$|No one was about. She <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> On {{one side}} was the {{municipal}} court, like a country school; on the other, {{the room of}} the volunteer fire company, with a Ford hose-cart and the ornamental helmets used in parades, {{at the end of}} the hall, a filthy two-cell jail, now empty but smelling of ammonia and ancient sweat. The whole second story was a large unfinished room littered with piles of folding chairs, a lime-crusted mortar-mixing box, and the skeletons of Fourth of July floats covered with decomposing plaster shields and faded red, white, and blue bunting. At the end was an abortive stage. The room was large enough for the community dances which Mrs. Nat Hicks advocated. But Carol was after something bigger than dances.|$|E
60|$|From this {{miscellany}} {{he selected}} riding breeches, {{a pair of}} boots, and the red hunting coat as the only articles that fitted his rather large frame. Hastily he dressed, and, taking the ax {{the old man had}} brought to the room as the only weapon available, he <b>walked</b> boldly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> down <b>the</b> spiral stairway and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> guardroom.|$|R

50|$|The {{night before}} her execution, Grese sang Nazi hymns {{until the early}} hours of the morning with Johanna Bormann. On Thursday, 13 December 1945, in Hamelin Jail, Grese was led to the gallows. The women were {{executed}} singly by long-drop hanging and then the men in pairs. Regimental Sgt. Maj. O'Neill assisted the British executioner, Albert Pierrepoint:We climbed the stairs to the cells where the condemned were waiting. A German officer at the door leading to the corridor flung open the door and we filed past the row of faces and into the execution chamber. The officers stood at attention. Brigadier Paton-Walsh stood with his wristwatch raised. He gave me the signal, and a sigh of released breath was audible in the chamber, I <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> 'Irma Grese', I called.The German guards quickly closed all grilles on twelve of the inspection holes and opened one door. Irma Grese stepped out. The cell was far too small for me to go inside, and I had to pinion her in the corridor. 'Follow me,' I said in English, and O'Neil repeated the order in German. At 9.34 a.m. she walked into the execution chamber, gazed for a moment at the officials standing round it, then walked on to the centre of the trap, where I had made a chalk mark. She stood on this mark very firmly, and as I placed the white cap over her head she said in her languid voice, 'Schnell'. translation: 'Quickly.' The drop crashed down, and the doctor followed me into the pit and pronounced her dead. After twenty minutes the body was taken down and placed in a coffin ready for burial.|$|E
2500|$|According to Dana Mazalova, {{who spoke}} {{about this issue}} on a press conference, the images that Chingiz Mustafayev had shown her, [...] "have {{nothing in common with}} the videos and photographs, which the Azerbaijani side {{presents}} to the world". Mazalova claims to have seen the original footage shot by the Azerbaijani cameraman Chingiz Mustafiev of the dead bodies and says that she did not see there the signs of mutilation that were in later footage. That has the grisly implication that someone interfered with the corpses afterwards. Mazalova also claimed that <b>the</b> free <b>corridor</b> existed and that Russian journalist Victoria Ivleva passed through it together with Meskhetian Turks and remained alive. However Ivleva said that she did not know who Mazalova was and that Mazalova was lying when she said that Ivleva walked through this corridor. In another interview Ivleva also stated that she entered the town from the opposite direction to the alleged location of <b>the</b> free <b>corridor,</b> where Meskhetian Turks lived, and they survived because they did not <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> free <b>corridor.</b>|$|R
60|$|Stephen the ingenuous boy, {{though now}} obliterated {{externally}} by Stephen the contriving man, returned to Knight's memory vividly that afternoon. He was at present but a sojourner in London; and after {{attending to the}} two or three matters of business which remained to be done that day, he <b>walked</b> abstractedly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gloomy <b>corridors</b> of <b>the</b> British Museum for the half-hour previous to their closing. That meeting with Smith had reunited the present with the past, closing up the chasm of his absence from England as if it had never existed, until the final circumstances of his previous time of residence in London formed but a yesterday to the circumstances now. The conflict that then had raged in him concerning Elfride Swancourt revived, strengthened by its sleep. Indeed, in those many months of absence, though quelling the intention to make her his wife, he had never forgotten that she was the type of woman adapted to his nature; and instead of trying to obliterate thoughts of her altogether, he had grown to regard them as an infirmity it was necessary to tolerate.|$|R
