5|$|Schizophrenia {{and smoking}} {{have shown a}} strong {{association}} in studies worldwide. Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population. Those <b>who</b> <b>smoke</b> tend to smoke heavily, and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content. Among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those <b>who</b> <b>smoke</b> about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women <b>who</b> <b>smoke</b> during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Data {{from the}} 1992, 1993, and 1994 Monitoring the Future Surveys {{were used to}} {{investigate}} the differential effects of cigarette price on the intensity of youth cigarette smoking. Methods: Respondents are classified into nonsmokers; individuals <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> less than one cigarette per day; individuals <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> one to five cigarettes per day; individuals <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> one-half pack a day; and individuals <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> one pack or more a day. A Threshold of Change Model was estimated with information on cigarette prices as the main explanatory variables. Results: Dummy variables indicating medium and high prices {{were found to have}} varying effects on different levels of smoking intensity, even though higher prices were associated with lower smoking in all cases. The differences are more striking in the high price case. The effects of higher prices are largest at the heaviest smoking levels. Conclusion: Cigarette prices an effective tool to discourage youth smoking. The differential effects of cigarette price on smoking intensity warrant further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{examines}} {{the differences in}} the rate of smoking cessation during pregnancy among mothers <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> before pregnancy, by selected maternal characteristics. We also identify differences in maternal behaviors and birth outcomes between women who did and did not quit smoking during pregnancy, among women <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> before pregnancy. Methods: The sample for this study was obtained from the North Carolina Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This is a random sample of 7, 935 live births for the period 1997 - 2001. For most analyses in this study, we exclude women <b>who</b> did not <b>smoke</b> before pregnancy (5, 608) and those with data missing on smoking before or during pregnancy (255). Mothers <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> before pregnancy and smoked at least one cigarette a day during the last three months of pregnancy are defined as persistent smokers, and those <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> before pregnancy and did not smoke at least one cigarette a day during the last three months of pregnancy are defined as quitters in this study. Results: Overall, 24. 6 percent of women reported cigarette smoking before pregnancy, 13. 8 percent during pregnancy, and 20. 3 percent after pregnancy. Of those <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> before pregnancy and quit during pregnancy, roughly half began smoking again by the time they completed the PRAMS survey at 3 - 6 months postpartum...|$|R
5|$|Genetics {{play a role}} in the {{development}} of COPD. It is more common among relatives of those with COPD <b>who</b> <b>smoke</b> than unrelated smokers. Currently, the only clearly inherited risk factor is alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AAT). This risk is particularly high if someone deficient in alpha 1-antitrypsin also smokes. It is responsible for about 1–5% of cases and the condition is present in about 3–4 in 10,000 people. Other genetic factors are being investigated, of which there are likely to be many.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those <b>who</b> <b>smoke.</b> Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people <b>who</b> <b>smoke,</b> {{and there is}} also a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization of the oral mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E

5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those <b>who</b> <b>smoke</b> additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E

40|$|Retrospective {{assessment}} of maternal smoking or substance use during pregnancy is sometimes unavoidable. The unusually close relationship of twin sister pairs permits comparison of self-report data versus co-twin informant data on substance use during pregnancy. Information about smoking during pregnancy has been gathered {{from a series}} of mothers from an Australian volunteer twin panel (576 women reporting on 995 pregnancies), supplemented in many cases by independent ratings of their smoking by twin sister informants (821 pregnancies). Estimates of the proportion of women <b>who</b> had never <b>smoked</b> regularly (56 - 58 %), <b>who</b> had <b>smoked</b> but did not smoke during a particular pregnancy (16 - 21 %), or <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> throughout the pregnancy (16 - 18 %), were in good agreement whether based on self-report or twin sister informant data. However, informants underreported cases <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> during the first trimester but then quit (1 - 3 % versus 7 - 9 % by self-report). Women <b>who</b> <b>smoked</b> throughout pregnancy (by informant report) rarely denied a history of regular smoking...|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} other {{difficulties}} in researching {{the effects of}} cannabis. Many people <b>who</b> <b>smoke</b> cannabis also smoke tobacco.

Another difficulty researchers have is in recruiting people <b>who</b> <b>smoke</b> cannabis into studies.
