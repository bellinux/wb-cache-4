500|$|In September 2009, Susan Bower {{announced}} that Neighbours would introduce new opening titles for the 25th anniversary {{and they would}} feature a bit of [...] "bling". The titles were created by Visual Playground, who shot a series of scenes featuring the cast in settings familiar to viewers. The titles made their debut on 18 March 2010. A new set of opening titles made their debut on 15 April 2013, along with {{a new version of}} the theme tune. Visual Playground once again created and produced the titles. The titles depict the Ramsay Street residents gathering outside their houses for a street party. A writer for Visual Playground explained that they [...] "invented a bokeh graphic device that uses the play of light in a formation to locate the houses in the cul-de-sac. Six overlapping circles represent the six houses of Ramsay St and the off street cast members. All the circles together reinforce the sense of community that makes up Neighbours." [...] A new retro-inspired logo, theme tune and opening titles debuted on 5 January 2015 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations. The new logo is a reimagined contemporary version of the original Neighbours logo from 1985. The titles show characters in a variety of familiar settings around Erinsborough and ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Ramsay Street from above.|$|E
500|$|The German Army Group Centre (where {{the main}} attack fell) underestimated Soviet {{infantry}} by 40%, mechanized forces by 300% {{and the number}} of tanks as 400 to 1800, instead of the 4000 to 5200 in fact arrayed against them. The German high command (OKH) and Adolf Hitler grossly underestimated the threat to Army Group Centre, confidently redeploying a third of its artillery, half its tank destroyers and 88% of its tanks to the Southern front where OKH expected the Soviet attack. Only 580 German armoured vehicles were in place for the battle. In the battle, Army Group Centre was almost totally destroyed, losing its Fourth Army encircled east of Minsk, its 3rd Panzer Army (LIII Corps encircled in Vitebsk), and its Ninth Army encircled east of Bobruisk. In military historian Bruce Pirnie's view, [...] "the Germans were more completely fooled prior to Operation Bagration than they had been prior to Operation Uranus [...] ". Pirnie concluded, based largely on Bagration and Uranus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> other Second World War operations, that the Soviet military deception in Bagration was unsophisticated, but [...] "clever and effective". The Soviets succeeded in distorting OKH's intelligence picture, given that German intelligence had to rely mainly on [...] radio intercept, aerial photography and agents left behind in the territory they had once held. Stavka deceived OKH by playing to their three sources of information; Stavka systematically denied the Germans real intelligence on Red Army forces as they concentrated for the attack, and revealed other real and simulated forces in other places. However Stavka may have come to do this, it [...] "played well to the Germans' mental attitude".|$|E
