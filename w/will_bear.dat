5|$|Unlike in Nuuk, {{the modern}} {{environmentally}} friendly construction technologies {{have not yet}} arrived to Sisimiut, and in 2010 the existing communal-block district remained {{in a state of}} partial disrepair. The Qeqqata municipality however is planning the town expansion in the 2010s, with the area north of the Kangerluarsunnguaq Bay reserved for real estate.

5|$|Zoe {{is taken}} in by a priest who has become Malus' new host. He gives her a blade which was once Satan's sword and tells her she <b>will</b> <b>bear</b> the antichrist. Zoe kills the priest, and Malus moves through several more hosts. Zoe reunites with Rachel and the others, and they decide to work with Lilith to stop Malus. Overcome by her {{inevitable}} role {{in the end of}} the world, Zoe cuts her own throat. While Rachel tries to save Zoe's life, Lilith takes her blade and confronts Malus's new host. Malus resists, and his host is killed. As he leaves the body, Lilith stabs him with the blade, condemning him to Hell.|$|E
5|$|Sonya gives Rodya a cross {{when he goes}} to turn {{himself in}} and symbolizes the burden Raskolnikov must bear. Sonya tells him they <b>will</b> <b>bear</b> the cross {{together}} and is taking part of his burden onto herself, encouraging him to confess. Sonya and Lizaveta had exchanged crosses, so originally the cross was Lizaveta's—whom Rodya didn't intend to kill, making it an important symbol of redemption. Sonya's face reminds him of Lizaveta's face, another example of his guilty conscience and symbolizes a shared grief. Self-sacrifice, along with poverty, is a larger theme of the novel. The desperation of poverty creates a situation where the only way to survive is through self-sacrifice, which Raskolnikov consistently rejects, as part of his philosophical reasoning. For example, he rejects Razumikhin's offer of employment and the idea of his sister's arranged marriage. Raskolnikov originally rejects Sonya's offer to accompany him to the confession but, in a feverish state of mind, sees her following him through the market, and finds power in that idealism.|$|E

25|$|In {{reproductive}} rights, feminists {{sought the}} right to contraception and birth control, which were almost universally restricted until the 1960s. Feminists hoped to use the first birth control pill to free women to decide the terms under which they <b>will</b> <b>bear</b> children. They felt that reproductive self-control was essential for full economic independence from men. Access to abortion was also widely demanded for these reasons, but was more difficult to secure due to existing, deep societal divisions over the issue.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} oft-studied aspects of the Kagoshima dialect is its {{prosodic}} system.

In mainland Kagoshima, unaccented units <b>will</b> <b>bear</b> a low tonal pitch until the final syllable, at which point the pitch rises. In accented units, however, the pitch rises on the penultimate syllable, and then drops back down on the final syllable.|$|E

25|$|Burgundy is in {{some ways}} the most terroir-oriented region in France; immense {{attention}} is paid to the area of origin, and in which of the region's 400 types of soil a wine's grapes are grown. As opposed to Bordeaux, where classifications are producer-driven and awarded to individual chateaux, Burgundy classifications are geographically-focused. A specific vineyard or region <b>will</b> <b>bear</b> a given classification, regardless of the wine's producer. This focus is reflected on the wine's labels, where appellations are most prominent and producers' names often appear at the bottom in much smaller text.|$|E
