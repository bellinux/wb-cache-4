5|$|Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences {{a further}} four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the {{intention}} of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: One Arabian Night was a reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while Harlequinade visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film Don Quixote, for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies and <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the family home.|$|E

5|$|Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91s in Perth in January 1980, {{breaking}} Tonelli's Australian {{record in}} the 100m freestyle. As a result, {{he was invited to}} his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers. He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators, first claiming that the officials did not want him to board with Tonelli's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times, which he felt was insufficient. Brooks <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80s.

5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town.

The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows.

5|$|Breckinridge asked James Clay {{to protect}} his {{interests}} at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Clay, Lazarus Powell, William Preston, Henry Cornelius Burnett, and James B. Beck desired to nominate Breckinridge for president, but in a compromise with Kentucky's Douglas backers, the delegation went to Charleston committed to former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Louisville. Fifty Southern Democrats, upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a two-thirds majority of the original 303 delegates. For 35 ballots, Douglas ran well ahead of Guthrie but short of the needed majority. Arkansas's lone remaining delegate nominated Breckinridge, but Beck asked that the nomination be withdrawn because Breckinridge refused to compete with Guthrie. Twenty-one more ballots were cast, but the convention remained deadlocked. On May 3, the convention adjourned until June 18 in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
