5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their <b>worksite,</b> and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|A {{major upgrade}} is being planned by Transport for London to bring {{improvements}} to the station; these include a new Northern line ticket hall, three new escalators and additional lifts to provide step-free access to the Northern line platforms. This will be done {{in conjunction with the}} major transformation in the Elephant & Castle area to create thousands of new homes and potential for new retail development to provide growth in the area. This is also in line with a further consultation on its <b>worksite</b> for the Bakerloo line due to the highly constrained space surrounding the platforms of the line. New tunnels could be dug alongside with new platforms to accommodate the increase in demand if the Bakerloo line extension comes into service.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Interventions in {{occupational}} health often target <b>worksites</b> rather than individuals. The {{objective of this}} paper is to describe the (lack of) stability in units of analysis in {{occupational health}} and safety intervention projects directed toward <b>worksites.</b> Methods A case study approach is used to describe naturally occurring organizational changes in four, large, Nordic intervention projects that ran 3 – 5 years, covered 3 – 52 <b>worksites,</b> cost 0. 25 mill– 2. 2 mill €, and involved 3 – 7 researchers. Results In all four cases, high rates of closing, merging, moving, downsizing or restructuring was observed, and in all four cases at least one company/worksite experienced two or more re-organizations during the project period. If individual <b>worksites</b> remained, ownership or (for publicly owned) administrative or legal base often shifted. Forthcoming closure led employees and managers to seek employment at other <b>worksites</b> participating in the studies. Key employees involved in the intervention process often changed. Conclusion Major changes were the rule rather than the exception. Frequent fundamental changes at <b>worksites</b> need to be taken into account when planning intervention studies and raises serious questions concerning design, analyses and interpretation of results. The frequent changes may also have deleterious implications for the potential effectiveness of many real life interventions directed toward <b>worksites.</b> We urge researchers and editors to prioritize this subject in order to improve the quality of future intervention research and preventive action. </p...|$|R

According to Amennakht, Paneb ordered his stone workers not only to steal stone from the <b>worksite</b> of Seti II, but to use this stone to build columns for his personal tomb. In one case, he not only ordered his workers to make a plaited bed, but made their wives weave clothing for him. In addition, he stole several work tools, breaking one (Recto 2.13). Some tools were apparently of great value, as the workers searched for an entire month for a tool he stole before he snuck it back onto the <b>worksite.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of smoke-free environment polices throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia at <b>worksites</b> employing fifty or more workers. Specifically, this study assessed policy prevalence, development, implementation, and enforcement. In addition, this study assessed smoke-free environment policy effectiveness. The population for this investigation consisted of telephone surveys of 374 <b>worksites</b> located throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. Of these <b>worksites,</b> 340 (91 %) completed the telephone survey. The population (n = 340) was spread throughout five health regions, Northern, Northwest, Central, Southwest, and East.

Though Černý seems to think that the door-keepers might have served the role of bailiffs, A.G. McDowell, a prominent Egyptologist in the study of Deir el-Medina, speculates that the door-keepers' legal function was small, and that Aapehty only testified to them because they stood in a public part of the <b>worksite.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the theft from his <b>worksite,</b> he also stole from other tombs.

He also stole a (mummified or model) goose from the funeral of the daughter of Ramesses II and later swore that he had not. In fact, he had a propensity towards exploring tombs in general, as Amennakht accuses him of entering three tombs, presumably to steal goods, but it seems to have had an element of rebelliousness to it, as he also sat on the sarcophagus of Seti II, a great sign of disrespect to both Seti II and the institution of kingship in Egypt.|$|E

40|$|Despite an {{increase}} in policies regulating smoking at the workplace, {{little research has been}} conducted on organizational factors that may be associated with the adoption of those policies. In November 1986, a survey assessing tobacco use habits was sent to 3, 432 employees of 68 auto dealerships in western New York. Managers at the <b>worksites</b> were surveyed by telephone in 1986 and 1 year later to assess their attitudes about smoking by employees and changes in smoking policy implementation. At the time of the initial survey, 21 percent (N = 14) of businesses had smoking restrictions. Among the 54 <b>worksites</b> with no smoking restrictions, 14 (26 percent) adopted smoking policies within a year. The strongest predictor of policy adoption was an interaction between the presence of floating smoking restrictions (not tied to a specific area) and the manager's willingness to impose smoking restrictions on employees. Adoption of policies was also more likely to occur among <b>worksites</b> with younger employees. That adoption of smoking policies was more likely to occur among <b>worksites</b> with floating smoking policies underscores the idea that focusing efforts at the managerial level within an organization can accelerate the diffusion process. In addition, the presence of unions and employee concerns about smoking policies are likely to impact upon management's decisions regarding implementation of policies. Given the potential of smoking prohibitions to influence the smoking habits of employees, future studies should begin to focus on ways to facilitate the adoption of smoking policies in <b>worksites...</b>|$|R
25|$|CALRA {{went into}} effect on August 28, 1975. Draft {{regulations}} governing {{the operation of the}} Board and secret ballot organizing elections were issued 10 days earlier, but did not address the controversial issue of whether union organizers would have access to the workplace (e.g., fields). The ALRB issued rules giving organizers access to fields on August 29, and the UFW filed for the first union elections under the Act on September 1. But a federal district court enjoined the Board from implementing its <b>worksite</b> access rules on September 3—putting a halt to some ballot-counting in several elections. By {{the end of the first}} week of elections, the UFW had won 22 bargaining units and the Teamsters 13, while growers had alleged the UFW had committed unfair labor practices in several elections. The California Supreme Court lifted the ban on union organizers in the fields on September 18, and the ALRB issued its first formal ULP complaints (against two growers) the next day.|$|E
25|$|In November 1997, King was {{assigned}} to oversee the union's National Organizing Department, a position created especially for him. UAW members approved making the position an elected vice president in June 1998, and King was elected that year. It was the first new vice presidency created in many years. During his four-year tenure in this latter position, King pushed the UAW to organize retail workers at Kmart, casino workers; state, county, and local government employees; and graduate student teaching and research assistants. Yokich defended King's outreach to these nontraditional constituencies of the UAW. King also established six regional organizing centers to help devolve responsibility for organizing closer to the <b>worksite.</b> By November 2000, he had led organizational drives which added about 50,000 new members to the union. By 2001, more than 22,000 state government workers in Michigan belonged to the UAW, as did some 15,000 graduate student workers. More than 20,000 of the 60,000 new members the UAW organized between 2002 and 2006 worked outside the automotive industry. Under his leadership, the UAW organized another 6,000 new members between 2006 and 2009. But his organizing drives also saw some major setbacks, such as when Nissan workers in Tennessee rejected UAW representation 2-to-1 in what {{was seen as a}} major setback for the union in its Southern organizing effort. Another loss came at Freightliner in North Carolina, and a major organizing effort at Mercedes-Benz never resulted in an election. The union did make organizing headway among auto parts suppliers, however.|$|E
25|$|EVA 1 {{started with}} astronauts Dave Wolf and Tim Kopra {{switching}} their spacesuit power to internal battery at 16:19 UTC. Despite a communication {{problem with the}} spacewalkers, the Japanese Exposed Facility was successfully installed on the Japanese Experiment Module {{by means of a}} complex series of steps involving the robotic arms of both the station and the shuttle. The JEF was first unberthed from the shuttle payload bay by the station arm, after which the shuttle arm took the load. The station arm was then moved to the <b>worksite</b> on Node-2 (Harmony), wherefrom it took the 4.1 ton facility back. The facility was then successfully latched on to the Experiment Module. As part of the EVA, the spacewalkers successfully deployed the port Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attach System (UCCAS), which could not be deployed during STS-119. During the prior mission, the deployment failed due to a jamming caused by a stuck detent pin. Engineers designed a custom tool to force the pin to release, which was used to deploy the mechanism. Meanwhile, the shuttle managers announced {{that there would be no}} need for a focused inspection of the heat shield. The nose cap and wing leading-edge panels of the shuttle were cleared for entry as they were, but a reentry clearance was not given. Beyond one impact site having a gouge, the rest of the impacts were found to be mostly a loss of coating. The other activity scheduled for EVA 1, the deployment of a starboard side cargo carrier, was postponed for want of time. A fuel cell issue found before launch was analyzed, though the cell continued to function as expected with no impact to the mission.|$|E

METHODS: We systematically searched stair-use interventions performed in <b>worksites</b> or public settings, published up to mid 2013. We used a harvest plot approach to visualize the findings in addition to a quantitative synthesis. We also assessed external validity using the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. RESULTS: Of 8571 articles identified, 50 were included. In <b>worksites</b> (25 studies) and public settings (35 studies), an increase in stair climbing was found during the intervention period in 64 % and 76 % of studies, respectively. Combining motivational and directional signs in <b>worksites</b> or conducting a second intervention phase in public settings increased stair climbing in 83 % and 86 % of studies, respectively. Elements of external validity were overall largely under-reported. CONCLUSION: There is evidence that stair-use interventions are effective to increase stair climbing in public settings, but evidence of such effect is limited in <b>worksites.</b> Issues regarding the best sequencing of interventions or the potential importance of environmental interventions should be addressed in future studies.
