2500|$|In 1935 Gertrude Stein gave {{a series}} of talks in the United States that included, on January 12 and 13, a visit to Choate. Fortunately for {{literary}} posterity, her audience included both a stenographer and Dudley Fitts, critic, translator, and longtime teacher of Greek and Latin at Choate. Stein's public speaking style was extemporary, and Fitts recognized the permanent value of a stenographic transcript. After an exchange of letters, Stein authorized Fitts to oversee publication of her talk in The Choate Literary Magazine. On February 5, he sent her the page proofs, saying, [...] "I had to restore {{a great deal of}} the lecture from memory. I hope I didn't spoil anything. Sorry to have missed entirely <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the noun." [...] (Fitts's typescript and the Fitts-Stein correspondence are now at Yale.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I insist after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the {{pleasure}} of keeping these days?" [...] she admirably--it was so all sincerely--asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't quite know, but in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> {{work and}} things; and then you're so patient. Yes, you're better than I am.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My position's {{much the}} same as Mr. Grant's--I can do without. After <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the Sachem, I'll join you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, I {{have been}} {{carefully}} considering <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> today <b>about</b> the hidden meaning of those suns and hearts and 'Ka's', and I have been examining the drawings again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Great Jupiter! {{did you not}} know? Where {{have you}} lived? It is Nero the Emperor! Never would he pardon <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>about</b> his voice. Quick, man, quick, or the guards will be at your heels!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{interested}} in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the visitors here," [...] he remarked. [...] "I daresay to Americans this place must be very interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|BENTLEY. [running forward between Lina and Gunner] But {{what did}} you mean by <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Miss Tarleton and Mr Percival, you beastly rotter, you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am willing}} to drop the matter, {{providing}} you will retract <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> my being connected with these--er--these other things," [...] answered Pepper, slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{makes me}} sick. All {{he wants to}} do is lolly-gag.... Besides, after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> to Helen <b>about</b> the jazz I wouldn't dance in front of you on a bet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{keep this}} to myself {{if you were}} my own brother. Four men held in your {{district}} -four or forty at Peshawur - and <b>what</b> was that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Multan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I had so groaned it--as if {{for very}} ecstasy--that it pulled him up, and I {{could see his}} curiosity as indeed reaffected. But he went on with a {{coherency}} that somewhat admonished me: [...] "It was your making me, as I told you this morning, think over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> had <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Brissenden and his wife: it was that----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I do. I heard <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> me to Mrs. Fosdyke, and I {{heard you}} bang {{the door when}} you got out of my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought I was {{justified}} {{in making the}} promise after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the pleasure {{it would be to}} help me. You remember, that day on the hilltop?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Fitzjocelyn,' said Isabel, {{when they}} were shut into a coupe, 'tell me <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> {{distress}} of mind. It has haunted me whether you used those words.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] laughed Ida, [...] "was {{probably}} {{the result of}} wearing a smart English skirt. Do you remember the day you fell down and broke her parasol, and <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> immediately afterward <b>about</b> women's fripperies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir,--Pardon {{the liberty}} I am taking, but, having read <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> [...] <b>about</b> poor women working {{fourteen}} {{hours a day}} for ten shillings per [...] week, I beg to state my case. I am a tie-maker, who, after working [...] all the week, cannot earn more than five shillings, and I have a poor [...] afflicted husband to keep who hasn't earned a penny for more than ten [...] years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mary; let you! Do <b>you</b> {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> once <b>about</b> coming, {{and being}} near me? I have so {{often thought of}} it. And now, Mary, I must tell you about Caleb;" [...] and the young lady settled herself on the sofa, so as to have a comfortable long talk. Beatrice had been quite right. Mary was as meek with her, and as mild as a dove.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} been used to public speaking. You speak uncommonly well, though I don't agree with you. From <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> sentiment, I fancy you are a Panslavist." ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--I was prodigiously {{delighted with}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the book--so, on the whole, I've {{concluded}} to publish intrepidly, instead of concealing the authorship. I shall leave out that bull story.|$|E
6000|$|... "I like <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> that anchor, mate, I'll {{not forget}} it" [...] said Swinton, sinking {{back on his}} pillow as Grummidge sallied forth {{to join in the}} pursuit of the savages.|$|E
60|$|DEAR PROFESSOR PHELPS,--I {{thank you}} ever {{so much for}} the book--[Professor Phelps's Essays on Modern Novelists.]--which I find charming--so charming indeed, that I read it through in a single night, and did not regret the lost night's sleep. I am glad if I deserve <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>about</b> me: and even if I don't I am proud and well contented, since you think I deserve it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, Andrew, I {{will not}} argue with you, and I don't blame you at being sore and angry over the matter; nor do I deny <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>about</b> myself; it's true enough, {{and you might}} say worse things against me without my quarreling with ye over it. However, the less said the better. I will take myself off and think over what's to be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I hope {{we shall}} not {{separate}} so soon,' said Coningsby; 'I was much struck with <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now <b>about</b> the Reform Bill. Do {{you know that the}} more I think the more I am perplexed by what is meant by Representation?' ...|$|R
6000|$|They were {{apparently}} not troubled. Mela said {{over her shoulder}} to the student of human nature, [...] "The next time I see you I'll {{give it to you}} for <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> Moffitt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think anything; I'm so glad! I {{supposed}} from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the world, {{that it must}} be--But if it isn't, all the better. If it's Mr. Hinkle {{that you}} can have--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{say it was}} {{a mighty}} lucky thing if we were goin' to stay here; but, in case you stick to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> goin' away to-morrow, it will be kinder tough on both of 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{this is over}} sudden, your excellency," [...] said he. [...] "There is much {{truth in}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the pirates. From my villa near the fort of Anderida I saw eighty of their galleys only last week, and I know well {{that they would be}} on us like ravens on a dying ox. For many years to come it would not be {{possible}} for us to hold them off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{certainly}} come back," [...] she returned, [...] "in {{spite of}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> say about its being bad {{to live in}} Italy. <b>What</b> was that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> one's natural mission? I wonder if I should forsake my natural mission if I were to settle in Florence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, where there's smoke there's some fire. Cou't {{discharged}} him {{and college}} suspended him. That's about where it is? I guess he'll keep out o' harm's way next time. Read <b>you</b> <b>what</b> he <b>said</b> <b>about</b> them {{scenes of the}} Revolution in Paris?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing. There was {{one thing}} more I wanted to tell you; but I fancy we've seen enough of one another for the present! I shall think over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> your circumstances, and let you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{have been}} {{thinking}} of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> business. There is one thing I must do, and then I can remain quiet for a fortnight, unless I should {{be called upon to}} disturb my rest by dying." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Pettikins, don't make me cry. You know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>about</b> my {{making a}} {{household}} pet {{of him is}} a little true. Perhaps {{he ought to have}} waited for you. Would any other woman on earth forgive you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{certainly}} {{was a very}} laudable intention," [...] returned Mr. Ford, observing Uncle Ben curiously, [...] "and from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now <b>about</b> one passionate man, I suppose you have determined already WHO to favor. I hope your public spirit will be appreciated by Indian Spring at least--if it isn't by those two men." ...|$|R
6000|$|RAINA (coldly). Thank you. And now I {{will do a}} soldierly thing. You cannot {{stay here}} after <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have just <b>said</b> <b>about</b> my future husband; but I will {{go out on the}} balcony and see whether it is safe for you to climb down into the street. (She turns to the window.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} {{exceedingly}} obliged {{if you will}} look in on me here occasionally, Mr. Lydgate," [...] the banker observed, after a brief pause. [...] "If, as I dare to hope, I have the privilege of finding you a valuable coadjutor in the interesting matter of hospital management, {{there will be many}} questions which we shall need to discuss in private. As to the new hospital, which is nearly finished, I shall consider <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>about</b> the advantages of the special destination for fevers. The decision will rest with me, for though Lord Medlicote has given the land and timber for the building, he is not disposed to give his personal attention to the object." ...|$|R
