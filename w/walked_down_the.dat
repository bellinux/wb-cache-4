5|$|As {{the match}} between Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage {{was about to}} begin, Ted DiBiase {{appeared}} and {{announced that he had}} purchased Sapphire. Rhodes <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s {{just one of those}} moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families, being joined at the door by the two youngest flower girls.|$|E

After arriving at the Sept, Sansa is <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle by King Joffrey Baratheon. In an effort to embarrass Tyrion, Joffrey removes the stepstool Tyrion was to use to cloak Sansa with the Lannister colors.

25|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 November 1995 (12th of Heshvan on the Hebrew Calendar), Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a right-wing extremist who opposed {{the signing of the}} Oslo Accords. Rabin had been {{attending}} a mass rally at the Kings of Israel Square (now Rabin Square) in Tel Aviv, held in support of the Oslo Accords. When the rally ended, Rabin <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> city hall steps towards the open door of his car, at which point Amir fired three shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Two shots hit Rabin, and the third lightly injured Yoram Rubin, one of Rabin's bodyguards. Rabin was taken to the nearby Ichilov Hospital with considerable delay, where he died on the operating table less than 40 minutes later due to blood loss and a punctured lung. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin's bodyguards. He was later tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. After an emergency cabinet meeting, Israel's foreign minister, Shimon Peres, was appointed as acting Israeli prime minister.|$|E

25|$|Shane Bond {{took three}} wickets {{in his first}} six overs in his first Test match for a year, and Sri Lanka were bowled out for 154 with only Tharanga and Chamara Kapugedera passing 20. In reply, New Zealand trailed by 41 with six wickets in hand, but Daniel Vettori's half-century helped score 206 against a Muttiah Muralitharan-led bowling attack. Murali took four for 65 from 34 overs, while Chaminda Vaas took two wickets in an over and ended with three for 49. The second time around, Kumar Sangakkara made an unbeaten century from number three, {{out of a total}} of 170. After {{completing}} an easy single to complete Sangakkara's century Muralitharan <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch to celebrate while the ball was being returned to the wicketkeeper. McCullum then appealed for a runout and Muralitharan was dismissed, ending Sri Lanka's second innings. After the match Jayawardene expressed the Sri Lankan team's disappointment about the incident, saying it was contrary to the spirit of the game, but Fleming and McCullum were unrepentant. New Zealand managed to reach the modest target of 118 to win the game, despite a mini-collapse.|$|E
500|$|For the I Am... disc, Beyoncé was {{influenced}} by folk and alternative rock genres, while incorporating other instruments she had not normally used previously, such as the acoustic guitar. Tedder specifically assisted Beyoncé with crafting the album's balladry. The ballads were crafted {{in a way to}} combine [...] "the best elements" [...] of pop and soul music, while simultaneously [...] "expanding the possibilities of both genres". Beyoncé attempted something different as people had strong expectations from her; she experimented with stronger lyrics. Beyoncé worked with Ghost to re-write Franz Schubert's [...] "Ave Maria" [...] after having co-written [...] "Disappear" [...] in London, England. Ghost told The Daily Telegraph that they were both inspired by their then-recent marriages and had <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle to [...] "Ave Maria".|$|E

The presentation was made by Sir Adrian Boult, who recalled that as they left the platform, [...] "Monteux gave two little groans as we <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> passage, and I suddenly found my arms full of violins and bows. The orchestra had recognized the signs. Their beloved chief was fainting." [...] Monteux suffered another collapse the following year, and David Zinman and Lorin Maazel deputised for him at the Festival Hall.|$|E

Additionally, they sang the song {{live at the}} 71st Annual Academy Awards on March 21, 1999. Before the performance, they were due to rehearse together {{a few days before}} their scheduled appearance. Houston however, called in sick and had to miss the rehearsal. [...] Reportedly, her excuse was not taken well, with academy executives calling it a [...] "bullshit story." [...] Conti, the academy's musical arranger, found a young female singer to take Houston's place, Janis Uhley. Before the performance, Carey <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stage in a white top and jeans, while choreographer Debbie Allen led the background singers. As they began the performance, Carey forgot the lyrics and stopped, as Uhley began singing in a [...] "theatricality and gusto". Her boastful performance was not taken well by the directors, who called it [...] "inappropriate and unnerving". After she was removed from the stage, a new date was chosen for the rehearsal, one that would accommodate both Houston and Carey.|$|E

500|$|On July 25, as North Korean forces {{seized the}} town of Yongdong, 7 miles (11km) west of No Gun Ri, U.S. troops were {{evacuating}} nearby villages, including hundreds of residents of Chu Gok Ri and Im Ke Ri. These villagers were joined by others as they <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> main road south, and the estimated 600 refugees spent the night by a riverbank near Ha Ga Ri village, 3.5 miles (5.5km) west of No Gun Ri. Seven refugees were killed by U.S. soldiers when they strayed from the group during the night. In the morning of July 26, the villagers found that the escorting soldiers had left. They continued down the road, were stopped by American troops at a roadblock near No Gun Ri, and were ordered onto the parallel railroad tracks, where U.S. soldiers searched them and their belongings, confiscating knives and other items. The refugees were resting, spread out along the railroad embankment around midday, when military aircraft strafed and bombed them. Recalling the air strike, Yang Hae-chan, a 10-year-old boy in 1950, said that the attacking planes returned repeatedly, and [...] "chaos broke out among the refugees. We ran around wildly trying to get away." [...] He and another survivor said that soldiers reappeared and began shooting the wounded on the tracks.|$|E

I'm about {{to give birth to}} a panic attack!" [...] Becky Bain of Idolator compared Black's styling to that of Lady Gaga's. Contessa Gayles of AOL described Porcelain Black's choreography as [...] "racy," [...] later complimenting Porcelain Black on her [...] "two-toned, Cruella De Vil-inspired coiffure." [...] Porcelain Black <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> runway in a camouflage corset designed by Falguni and Shane Peacock at the 2012 Spring Fashion Week, as her song played in the background.

500|$|Having {{overcome}} {{food poisoning}} {{leading up to}} the match, Barnes was selected for the First Test at Trent Bridge, as were the other two openers in the squad. England elected to bat first, and Australia's fast bowlers reduced the home side to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first afternoon. In Australia's reply, Barnes partnered Morris {{at the top of the}} order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. The pair had less than 15 minutes of batting before the scheduled close of play. Barnes made an appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Bill Edrich. Barnes <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> pitch and was reported to have casually muttered to umpire Frank Chester [...] "Eh, the light!", which appeared to shock the official. During the previous Ashes series in Australia in 1946–47, Barnes continuously appealed against the light, forcing cricket authorities to limit the batting team to one appeal, after which only the umpire can call off play, at his own prerogative. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball attack of Edrich and Alec Bedser to reach stumps at 17 without loss, with Morris on 10 and Barnes on 6. Despite the appeal against the light, the Australians showed little desire to be watchful against Edrich's bowling, scoring 11 runs from his two overs. However, Barnes had been fortunate, edging both Edrich and Bedser through the slip cordon.|$|E
