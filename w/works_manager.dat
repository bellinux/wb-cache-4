5|$|The M7 tank {{locomotive}} was {{the first}} design by Dugald Drummond upon replacing William Adams as Locomotive Superintendent of the LSWR in 1895. It was an enlargement of the T1 with a sloping grate of increased area giving greater power. Drummond drew upon his previous experience with the successful London Brighton and South Coast Railway D1 class, whilst he was <b>works</b> <b>manager</b> at Brighton in the early 1870s, and his own 157 class of 1877, on the North British Railway in Scotland. It was the heaviest 0-4-4 type ever to run in Britain.|$|E
5|$|A new {{application}} {{for the same}} route was made on 16 April 1907, this time from Solicitor H. M. Helliesen, Wholesaler A. Thune-Larsen, and <b>Works</b> <b>Manager</b> T. Poppe of Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS), the company which operated one the city tramways. This time the plans were slightly changed, with the route proposed built with a tramway {{rather than as a}} railway. In particular, the line was to connect to the Gamleby Line (then called the Oslo Line) of KSS's network and run up Ekeberg to an intersection between Ekeberveien and Kirkeveien. The plans called for a regular street tram with regular city tram vehicles. At the time, the city limits of Oslo went at Sjømannskolen. The application for the part within Oslo was sent to the city, while for the section outside the city, the application was sent to the Ministry of Labour. Within Oslo, a new line would only have to be built from Oslo Hospital to Sjømannskolen, while from Oslo Hospital to the city center, the line would follow the Gamleby Line.|$|E
40|$|Motivation is {{critical}} to the effective management of social workers in an organisation. A literature study of the concept motivation and an empirical study on the motivational function of the social <b>work</b> <b>manager</b> were conducted. This exploratory/descriptive study aimed to set scientifically grounded guidelines for the implementation of motivation as management function of social <b>work</b> <b>managers.</b> The literature indicated that motivating employees is the responsibility of social <b>work</b> <b>managers.</b> Research showed that social workers, social <b>work</b> <b>managers</b> and the organisation do benefit from motivation. The respondents indicated that motivation as a management function is important. They highlighted that intrinsic motivation and internal and external motivators influence their motivation positively. Organisational policies and a leadership style characterised by autocracy and a laissez-faire approach are demotivating. Social <b>work</b> <b>managers</b> should apply the principles of motivation theories, motivational strategies and guidelines to maintain and sustain motivation.

As a result, the LB established concentrations of locomotives awaiting entry to the works or else scrapping at East Grinstead, Horsted Keynes and Horley. An outside investigation in 1908, conducted by Robert Urie, then <b>Works</b> <b>Manager</b> of Nine Elms Works found 108 of the LB's 541 locomotives (20%) were awaiting or under repair, and that a general overhaul at Brighton took 43 days, compared with 7.2% of the locomotives of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway under repair and 21 days taken by Ashford Works. By 1910 30% of the locomotive stock was unusable due to delays and inefficiencies at Brighton works.|$|E

The treatment process was rudimentary, with sludge being removed to ponds and then to drying beds, after which it was used as manure or transferred by rail to a tip at Kilnhurst. The works progressively expanded to improve the quality of effluent discharged to the River Don and was a pioneer in the use of bio-aeration, following experiments by the <b>works</b> <b>manager</b> during the First World War. This process became known as the [...] "Sheffield System", and was demonstrated to visitors from Great Britain and abroad.

500|$|The former Ohio <b>Works</b> <b>manager</b> was {{apparently}} {{not the only}} observer to suggest that Joseph McDonald engaged in [...] "unsportsmanlike tactics". A feature story, that appeared in The Youngstown Daily Vindicator in 1920, stated that McDonald took deliberate steps in 1907 to replace the Ohio Works team with a more seasoned club from Homestead, Pennsylvania. The new club became known officially as the [...] "Youngstown Champs". Rumors of McDonald's supposed strategy apparently angered local baseball fans. According to the 1920 feature article, the Youngstown media highlighted the Champs' unexpected loss to the amateur Rayen Athletics in 1907. At this point, however, McDonald's relationship with the club was less direct. According to Sporting Life, the Youngstown franchise had been [...] "declared forfeit" [...] in early 1907, {{on the recommendation of}} the Akron club; it was subsequently [...] "awarded" [...] to a recently established baseball company. [...] "This was only a formality to make legal the actions taken by Magnate [...] McDonald when they turned over the old franchise to the newly organized company in Youngstown", the paper reported. In any event, the Youngstown Champs {{went on to win the}} Ohio–Pennsylvania League championship.|$|E
500|$|Tesla {{had been}} working at the Machine Works {{for a total of}} six months when he quit. What event precipitated him leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for {{redesigning}} generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his own biography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design [...] "twenty-four different types of standard machines" [...] "but {{it turned out to be}} a practical joke". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal quipping [...] "Tesla, you don't understand our American humor." [...] The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine <b>Works</b> <b>manager</b> Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that sort of cash (equivalent to $12 million today) on hand. Tesla's diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering December 7, 1884 to January 4, 1885 saying [...] "Good by to the Edison Machine Works".|$|E

[...] In November 1912, Sporting Life {{reported that}} the manager was still mulling his next move when he attended {{the annual meeting of}} the National Association in New York. [...] "Marty Hogan, the veteran minor league manager, who is known from end to end of the land as a developer of minor league talent and winner of pennants, could not bear to miss meeting his old friends", the paper stated. [...] "Marty wound up the season with Zanesville and has not definitely decided upon his plans for the coming season". [...] Ultimately, Hogan went to Zanesville, where he managed the Zanesville Flood Sufferers in 1913. [...] The team's nickname was evidently inspired by a massive flood that had devastated cities and towns throughout central and southern Ohioincluding Zanesvillein the spring of 1913. [...] In April 1913, Sporting Life noted that the Zanesville club would [...] "stick to the circuit", despite the fact that the city was [...] "hit hard by the recent floods".
