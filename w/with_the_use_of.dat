5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of}} the 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents.

5|$|After 1872, steel {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as a material for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight.

5|$|Although {{machinery}} {{has replaced}} horses {{in many parts}} of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E

5|$|As {{the river}} {{frontage}} areas of Alabama and Mississippi were settled by planters {{who developed the}} cotton plantation economy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> slave labor, Mobile's population exploded. It came to be settled by attorneys, cotton factors, doctors, merchants and other professionals seeking to capitalize on trade with the upriver areas. Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system {{that served as the}} principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. By 1822 the city's population was 2800.|$|E

Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot {{to see if the}} plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian vulture {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{in most parts}} of its range. In Europe and most of the Middle East, populations in 2001 were half of those from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% decrease each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the NSAID Diclofenac, which has been known to cause death in Gyps vultures.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{clothing}} in Parthian inspired sculptures {{have been found}} in excavations at Hatra, in northwestern Iraq. Statues erected there feature the typical Parthian shirt (qamis), combined with trousers and made with fine, ornamented materials. The aristocratic elite of Hatra adopted the bobbed hairstyles, headdresses, and belted tunics worn by the nobility belonging to the central Arsacid court. The trouser-suit was even worn by the Arsacid kings, as shown on the reverse images of coins. The Parthian trouser-suit was also adopted in Palmyra, Syria, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Parthian frontality in art.|$|E

5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E
5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension {{is a condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur in association <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a microscope because of its setae. Setae {{are a kind of}} unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the hymenium. In shape, the setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) {{can be found in the}} species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh.|$|E
