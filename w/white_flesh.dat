5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria {{by the absence}} of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may be confused with the blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has <b>white</b> <b>flesh</b> below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|B. edulis is {{the type}} species of the genus Boletus. In Rolf Singer's {{classification}} of the Agaricales mushrooms, {{it is also the}} type species of section Boletus, a grouping of about 30 related boletes united by several characteristics: a mild-tasting, <b>white</b> <b>flesh</b> that does not change colour when exposed to air; a smooth to distinctly raised, netted pattern over at least the uppermost portion of the stem; a yellow-brown or olive-brown spore print; white tubes that later become yellowish then greenish, which initially appear to be stuffed with cotton; and cystidia that are not strongly coloured. Molecular analysis published in 1997 established that the bolete mushrooms are all derived from a common ancestor, and established the Boletales as an order separate from the Agaricales.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in his work, and {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and <b>white</b> <b>flesh</b> tones was visually striking.|$|E

40|$|Bacteria {{in growth}} {{required}} nutrient, {{sources of energy}} and special environment conditions in growth. The media which often used in growth of bacteria was NA media. Costly NA encourage the researcher to find the media from easily material, cheap, {{and there was a}} source of nutrients for the growth of bacteria such as cassava, <b>white</b> and yellow <b>fleshed</b> sweet potatoes with high carbohydrate as a source of carbon for bacterial growth. This research was an experimental study using two factor of completely randomized design (CDR). Fist factor was a types of bacteria, such as E. coli (B 1) and Bacillus subtilis (B 2) and the second factor was the types of media, such as NA media (M 0) <b>white</b> <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato (M 1), yellow fleshed sweet potato (M 2) and cassava (M 3). Inoculation used streak plate method which incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours. Parameters measured were bacterial growth concerned with the thickness of the lines streak, size of colony, fertility, and density in media of bacteria growth. The results showed that growth of bacteria in the media of <b>white</b> <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato was better than yellow fleshed sweet potato and cassava, but the growth of bacteria on <b>white</b> <b>fleshed</b> sweet potato was not better than NA medi...|$|R

5|$|Thomas Hale Streets {{discussed}} the behaviour in 1877, doubting {{that the animal}} would climb trees {{to get at the}} coconuts. In the 1980s, Holger Rumpf was able to confirm Streets' report, observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild. The animal has developed a special technique to do so: if the coconut is still covered with husk, it will use its claws to rip off strips, always starting from the side with the three germination pores, the group of three small circles found {{on the outside of the}} coconut. Once the pores are visible, the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break. Afterwards, it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the <b>white</b> <b>flesh</b> of the coconut. Using their strong claws, larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the bay bolete is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from <b>white</b> <b>flesh</b> when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E

40|$|Custard {{powder and}} salad cream are two food {{products}} commercially manufactured using different quantities of corn starch. This study aimed at determining the physicochemical properties of some starches extracted from some white and yellow root cassava varieties. The prospective {{applicability of the}} cassava starches in custard powder and salad cream production was also determined. The physical, chemical and functional properties of eight cassava starches were determined using standard analytical procedures. Sensory acceptability of the products was also determined using untrained consumer group. Products made from corn starch were used as the reference samples. The physical, chemical and functional properties of the cassava starches varied significantly (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). The results of multivariate data analysis (principal component and cluster analyses) showed {{that it was difficult}} to completely discriminate starches from the yellow <b>fleshed</b> and <b>white</b> <b>fleshed</b> cassava roots.

Starch powder dispersibility was found to have significant influence (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) on the sensory acceptability of the two products.

25|$|Cultivated peaches {{are divided}} into clingstones and freestones, {{depending}} on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with <b>white</b> <b>flesh</b> typically are very sweet with little acidity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colors often have some red on their skin. Low-acid white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed cultivars.|$|E
25|$|The {{style in}} which Bouguereau chooses {{to paint the}} {{children}} is articulated and meaningful. Their <b>white</b> <b>flesh</b> is luminous and rosy- a symbol to their purity. Wings sprout delicately from their shoulders. Bouguereau invokes whimsical elements of childhood and young love {{through the use of}} pastels and soft, velvety brushstrokes. The painting is mostly blue, an uncommon color for the portrayal of a love story. By not using pink and reds, the painter steers away from the theme of forbidden love and towards the idea of young love. The colors are cool and crisp. Bouguereau takes care to accurately portray the pudginess of Cupid and Psyche. The painting is full of texture from the light fabrics, wispy golden hair, and smoothness of their skin. The painting doesn’t strike the viewer but is a rest for the eyes.|$|E

There is evidence that the picture may have originally portrayed the titan with a partially erect penis, but, if ever present, this addition was lost due to the deterioration of the mural over time or during the transfer to canvas; in the picture today the area around his groin is indistinct.
