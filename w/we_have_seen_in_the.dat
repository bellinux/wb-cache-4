25|$|First, the Legio Maria church {{recognises}} salvation through Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The discontinuity with orthodox {{theology is}} that the Son of God has been incarnated in multiple contexts, rejecting the orthodox doctrine of Christ taking a human body and soul for eternity. As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> above research, none of these incarnations are considered exclusive; they only serve to reveal Christ to people of different contexts. All who are saved through any of these incarnations of Christ will worship God together in heaven. Thus, for the Legio Church, salvation is found through Christ, as revealed in their particular Messias Simeo Ondeto.|$|E
25|$|In another {{paper with}} Simon Johnson at Massachusetts Institute of Technology called The Colonial Origins of Comparative Development: An Empirical Investigation, the authors use a natural {{experiment}} {{in history to}} show that different institutions result in different levels of economic growth. The paper examines institutional choices {{during the colonial period}} of several nations in relation to the same nations' economic development today. It found that in countries where the disease environment meant that it was hard for colonizers to survive (high mortality rate), they tended to set up extractive regimes, which resulted in poor economic growth today. In places where it was easier for colonizers to survive (low mortality rates), however, they tended to settle down and duplicate institutions from their country of origin—especially from Britain, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colonial success of Australia and United States. Thus, the mortality rate among colonial settlers several hundred years ago has determined the economic growth of today's post-colonial nations by setting institutions on very different paths.|$|E

2500|$|The aza-Cope/Mannich {{reaction}} {{is often the}} most efficient way to synthesize pyrrolidine rings, and thus has a number of applications in natural product total syntheses. [...] Because of its diastereoselectivity this reaction has added to the catalog of asymmetric synthesis tools, as seen in the many examples of asymmetric alkaloids synthesized using the reaction. [...] As <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first aza-Cope/Mannich reaction and in the elucidation of the reaction's stereochemistry, the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction can be used to form pyrrolidine rings and pyrrolizidine rings. [...] It can be used to create many additional ring structures useful in synthesis, such as indolizidine cycles and indole rings.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{violence}} and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested that Pulp Fiction should be seen {{in light of the}} short stories of Flannery O'Connor, which likewise feature [...] "religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor." [...] Discussing [...] "the connection between violence and redemption," [...] Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers [...] "of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace," [...] Tarantino [...] "seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film— all {{the violence}}, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior— grace is still possible; there might be still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is true {{that these}} general ideas occur in all the old liturgies; {{but in this case}} a {{remarkable}} identity is found even in the words. Some allusions to what were probably older forms in the Canon make the similarity still more striking. Thus Optatus of Mileve says that Mass is offered [...] "pro ecclesiâ, quæ una est et toto orbe terrarum diffusa" [...] (Adv. Parm., III, xii). This represents exactly a Latin version of the [...] "holy Church which is in all the world" [...] that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Syrian Anaphora above. The Syrian use adds a prayer for [...] "our religious kings and queens" [...] after that for the patriarch and bishop. So the Roman Missal long contained the words [...] "et pro rege nostro N." [...] after [...] "et Antistite nostro N." [...] (see below). It has a prayer for the celebrant himself (Brightman, 90), where the Roman Missal once contained just such a prayer (below). The treatise [...] "De Sacramentis" [...] gives the words on Institution for the Chalice as [...] "Hic est sanguis meus", just as does the Syrian Liturgy.|$|E
