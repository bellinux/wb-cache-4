Traditionally, Scandinavian Rya rugs were hand-made by artisans who would add symmetric Turkish (or Ghiordes) knots directly to the warp through a specially <b>woven</b> <b>backing.</b> Small holes in the weave allowed the rug-makers to insert evenly spaced knots using a larger tapestry needle.|$|E
50|$|A coated {{abrasive}} comprises an abrasive fixed to a backing material such as paper, cloth, rubber, resin, polyester or even metal, {{many of which}} are flexible. Sandpaper is a very common {{coated abrasive}}. Coated abrasives are commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A <b>woven</b> <b>backing</b> may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.|$|E

She held repeated arguments with him. Gargi and Yajnavalkya's exchange centered on the ultimate [...] "warp" [...] of reality ("warp" [...] means [...] "the basic foundation or material of a structure or entity). Her initial dialogue with Yajnavalkya tended to be too metaphysical, such as unending status of the soul, away from practical situations.

50|$|As {{technique}} developed, {{and mountains}} {{of the world}} were ascended via easy routes, climbers began to challenge themselves by looking for and trying harder routes. Once all the obvious lines had been tried, climbers looked for more technically challenging routes (e.g. an all-rock route threading between icefields or a single thin, fissure running in a continuous straight line from base to summit). An aesthetic element came in, as well. An easy, but confusing route, <b>weaving</b> <b>back</b> and forth across a face was less desirable than a direct route along a scenic ridge. Safe routes that yielded to good technique were more desirable than routes with loose rock and awkward climbing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this research, {{a method}} for {{implementing}} au-tomatic seam-tracking for friction stir welding, referred to hear as WeaveTrack, is presented. In this extrumum-seeking control technique, the tool <b>weaves</b> <b>back</b> and forth during welding to maintain the location where axial force is great-est, which is shown {{to be the center}} of the weld. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique in tracking both known and unknown weld-seams. Comparisons of ten-sile test results of weaved and non-weaved welds, and find-ings in related literature, indicate that weaving’s impact on weld quality could be positive. Finally, methods for incorpo-rating WeaveTrack seam-tracking into existing friction stir welding control systems (such as load control) are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{computation}} by linear assemblies {{of complex}} DNA tiles, {{which we call}} string tiles. By {{keeping track of the}} strands as they <b>weave</b> <b>back</b> and forth through the assembly, we show that surprisingly sophisticated calculations can be performed using linear self-assembly. Examples range from generating an addition table to providing O(1) solutions to CNF-SAT and DHPP. We classify the families of languages that can be generated by various types of DNA molecules, and establish a correspondence to the existing classes ET 0 L_(ml) and ET 0 L_(fin). Thus, linear self-assembly of string tiles can generate the output languages of finite-visit Turing Machines...|$|R

Although Miéville <b>weaves</b> <b>back</b> and forth between narrative, time, and space, this summary will follow each narrative individually, discussing their relation to each other toward the end. The novel is set in and around New Crobuzon, a sprawling London-esque city. New Crobuzon has for some unknown amount of time been at war with Tesh, and is attempting to build a railroad across the outlying desert, partially as a new means of conducting this war. Against this backdrop, the novel follows the deeds of three main characters--Ori, Cutter, and Judah Low.|$|R
