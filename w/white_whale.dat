40|$|Response {{times have}} been used to explore {{cognitive}} and perceptual processes since 1850 (Donders, 1868). The technique has primarily been applied to humans, birds, and terrestrial mammals. Results from two studies are presented here that examine response times in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> (Delphinapterus leucas). One study concerned response times to stimuli well above the threshold of perceptibility of a stimulus, and the other concerned response times to stimuli near threshold. Two <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> (Delphinapterus leucas) and five Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were presented stimuli well above threshold. The stimuli varied in type (tone versus pulse), amplitude, duration, and frequency. The average response time for bottlenose dolphins was 231. 9 ms. The average response time for <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> was 584. 1 ms. There was considerable variation between subjects within a species, but the difference between species was also found to be significant. In general, response times decreased with increasing stimulus amplitude. The effect of duration and frequency on response time was unclear. Two <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> (Delphinapterus leucas) and four Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) were given audiometric tests to determine masked hearing thresholds in open waters of San Diego Bay (Ridgway et al., 1997). Animals were tested at six frequencies over a range from 400 Hz to 30 kHz using pure tones. Hearing thresholds varied from 87. 5 dB to 125. 5 dB depending on the frequency, masking noise intensity and individual animal. At threshold, median response time across frequencies within each animal varied by about 150 ms. The two <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> responded significantly slower (? 670 msec, p< 0. 0001) than the four dolphins (? 410 msec). As in terrestrial animals, reaction time became shorter as stimulus amplitude increased (Wells, 1913; Stebbins, 1966). Across the two studies, the dolphins as a group were faster in the abovethreshold study than in the nearthreshold study. <b>White</b> <b>whales</b> had longer response times than bottlenose dolphins in both studies. Analysis of response time with an allometric relation based on weight shows that the difference in weight can explain {{a significant part of the}} difference in response time...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{financed by the}} Norwegian Research Council ICE whales grant (No. 244488 /E 10), The Foreign Ministry of Norway (Norwegian-Russian programme), WWF Sweden and the Norwegian Polar Institute. T. A. M. was {{supported}} in part by CEAUL (funded by FCT - Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, Portugal, through the project UID/MAT/ 00006 / 2013). The Arctic is experiencing rapid warming, and resultant sea ice losses represent a serious threat to ice-associated species in the region. This study explored the distribution and abundance of the 3 Arctic resident whale species: narwhals, bowhead and <b>white</b> <b>whales,</b> in the marginal ice zone and into the sea ice north of the Svalbard Archipelago. Line-transect surveys were conducted using a combination of helicopter-based and ship-based efforts in August 2015. Twenty-six sightings, involving 27 bowhead whales and 58 narwhals, occurred along the helicopter transects, while no whales were recorded along ship transects. No <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> were observed during these surveys. After correcting for surface availability, distance sampling produced abundance estimates of 343 (CV = 0. 488) bowhead whales and 837 (CV = 0. 501) narwhals within the 52 919 km(2) study area. Bowhead whales were predominantly seen close to the ice-edge, whereas narwhals were located deeper into the ice. To contextualize these results within the broader Svalbard cetacean community, all whale sightings from the Norwegian Polar Institute's Svalbard Marine Mammal Sighting Data Base, from the period of the survey, were mapped to compare general distributions. These opportunistic sightings included numerous cetacean species, especially seasonally occurring ones. However, <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> dominated in terms of the numbers of individuals reported. Our results suggest little spatial overlap between seasonally occurring whales and the 3 Arctic resident whales. Bowhead whales and narwhals were tightly associated with sea ice, and <b>white</b> <b>whales</b> were tightly coastal. In contrast, the seasonally occurring species were found over the shelf and along its edges. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R

Backstrap meat is sometimes dried, and beluga skin is sometimes pickled. Beluga products are prepared a number of ways, such as boiling skin and meat (eaten hot or cold); flouring and frying or barbecuing backstraps; and processing fat into oil for use with dried fish and meat.
