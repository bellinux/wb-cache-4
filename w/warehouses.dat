After Alexander died, the <b>Warehouse</b> was moved to Egypt, establishing the practice of locating the <b>Warehouse</b> in the most powerful empire of the day, under the reasoning that it will be best defended there. Egypt's Ptolemaic rulers appointed a group of people, known as the Regents, to oversee the <b>Warehouse</b> and act as its first [...] "agents" [...] and collectors of artifacts. <b>Warehouse</b> 2 lasted until the Roman conquest of Egypt. Other warehouses: <b>Warehouse</b> 3 in Western Roman Empire (Italy), <b>Warehouse</b> 4 in Hunnic Empire until the death of Attila the Hun, <b>Warehouse</b> 5 in Byzantine Empire, <b>Warehouse</b> 6 in Cambodia under Khmer Empire, <b>Warehouse</b> 7 in the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan, <b>Warehouse</b> 8 in Germany during the Holy Roman Empire (1260-1517), <b>Warehouse</b> 9 in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople until the death of Suleiman the Magnificent, <b>Warehouse</b> 10 in Mughal Empire (India), <b>Warehouse</b> 11 in the Russian Empire under the Romanov Dynasty (the 1812 Napoleonic War with Russia was an attempt to seize control of <b>Warehouse</b> 11), and <b>Warehouse</b> 12 in the United Kingdom from 1830 until 1914. It was during the time of <b>Warehouse</b> 11 that the Regents began to employ agents to gather and protect artifacts. This practice continued under <b>Warehouse</b> 12, with British agents traveling further and further searching for artifacts to add to the collection.|$|R

It also examines the mediating effect of <b>warehousing</b> MIS in {{the relationship between}} <b>warehousing</b> attributes and <b>warehouse</b> efficiency.

5|$|The {{size of the}} ice houses made it {{difficult}} to load ice into them; in 1827 Wyeth invented a lever and horse-drawn pulley system to raise blocks of ice through the roofs of the <b>warehouses.</b> Later improvements to loading included the use of lift systems to raise the blocks of ice {{to the top of the}} building, first using horse power, then steam power; the largest <b>warehouses</b> later introduced conveyor belt systems to bring the ice into storage. Power houses containing the equipment to support these were built alongside the ice houses, and care was taken to avoid the risk of fire from this machinery. <b>Warehouses</b> were typically painted either white or yellow in order to reflect the sun during the summer. A typical Hudson River warehouse might be 400 feet (120 m) long, 100 feet (30 m) deep and three stories high, able to hold 50,000 tons (four million kg) of ice. The later railroad ice houses could hold up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) apiece.|$|E

5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, <b>warehouses</b> and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In <b>warehouses</b> and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
