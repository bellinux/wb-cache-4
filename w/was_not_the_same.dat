5|$|There is {{disagreement}} amongst Jewish scholars as {{to whether}} Keturah was, or <b>was</b> <b>not,</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person as Hagar—the servant of Abraham's wife Sarah, and Abraham's concubine—who (together with her son Ishmael) was sent away by Abraham {{at the insistence of}} Sarah.|$|E
5|$|The World Organization to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong further called {{attention}} to portrayals of Wang Jindong on state-run television, claiming {{that the man who}} self-immolated on the square <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> person who appeared in subsequent interviews with CCTV. It pointed to a voice analysis conducted by the Speech Processing Laboratory at National Taiwan University, which concluded that the voices did not match, and also noted that the hairline and facial proportions appeared to be different. These observations were used to advance the theory that the self-immolators were actors.|$|E

5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 and it seemed to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops moving toward a fixed location like Khe Sanh <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as doing it on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E
5|$|Basset was {{a native}} of Montreuil-au-Houlme near Domfront in Normandy, and {{possibly}} came to the notice of King Henry while Henry was count of Domfort during the reign of Henry's older brother King William II of England (1087–1100). Either Basset himself or an earlier person with the same name held lands of Robert d'Oilly that were recorded in Domesday Book as in Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. If the Ralph in Domesday <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the judge, the Domesday Ralph may have been the judge's father. Other Bassets in the area were also recorded in Domesday, including a Wiliam and a Richard. It is not clear how or if they were related to Ralph. Ralph the judge held lands in Montreuil that in 1150 were considered to be worth two English manors. He held lands in Wallingford and Colston Basset. The lands in Wallingford were worth 16 and a third knight's fees.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Singapore {{claimed that}} the old Johor Sultanate, which {{controlled}} a maritime Malay empire from a capital on the Johor River, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the new Johor Sultanate occupying only {{the southern tip of}} the Malay Peninsula that came into existence after the signing of the Anglo–Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In its view, the Anglo–Dutch Treaty did not divide up the Singapore Strait, in which Pedra Branca is situated, between the new Johor Sultanate under the British sphere of influence and the Riau-Lingga Sultanate under Dutch influence. Instead, both Britain and the Netherlands could access the Strait freely. Therefore, there was a legal vacuum with regard to sovereignty over the island, enabling the British to lawfully take possession of it between 1847 and 1851.|$|E
50|$|A {{newspaper}} sub-editor who {{was accustomed}} to replacing game with match to avoid repetition may make an error with tennis, where a game <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a match.

5|$|Johnson scored another 14 {{goals for}} Ipswich {{on the way}} to a third-place finish in the league in 1998–99, but again they lost out in the {{play-off}} semi-finals, this time losing to Bolton Wanderers on away goals. However, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> story the following year; after three consecutive play-off semi-final defeats in 1996–97, 1997–98 and 1998–99, Ipswich finally reached the final in 1999–2000 with a 7–5 aggregate win over Bolton, before beating Barnsley 4–2 in the final at Wembley Stadium. After scoring 22 goals in 44 league games in 1999–2000, Johnson was awarded with a new, four-year contract with Ipswich.|$|E
5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had trouble making decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E
25|$|London Fire Brigade {{said it had}} {{not given}} {{approval}} for the work, saying its legal powers are limited. It said firefighters regularly visit buildings to gain familiarity with the layout and equipment, but that this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as a detailed inspection.|$|E

25|$|Less than {{a century}} later, Arab grammarians reorganized the alphabet, for reasons of teaching, putting letters next to other letters which were nearly the same shape. This {{produced}} a new order which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the numeric order, which became less important over time because it was being competed with by the Indian numerals and sometimes by the Greek numerals.|$|E
25|$|Menu Foods: Over 50 {{brands of}} dog food, and over 40 brands of cat food. Almost {{all of the}} foods are wet foods, {{specifically}} the 'cuts and gravy' varieties. As a precautionary measure, Menu Foods also recalled all brands of food with wheat gluten in them even though {{the source of the}} gluten <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the source behind the contaminated findings.|$|E
25|$|Medicine {{had made}} only slight {{progress}} against {{the disease in}} Mozart's time. Around the second decade of the 18th century the method of inoculation, which had originated in Asia, reached European countries. Inoculation <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the vaccination which later succeeded in eradicating the disease; rather, an inoculated person was treated with live smallpox virus, taken from pustules of the mildest variety of smallpox that could be found.|$|E

This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> postal box used by Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi who purchased their tickets for the same flight a day later with another Mailboxes Etc. postal box in Delray Beach, although both groups listed the same phone number.|$|E
25|$|With the 1969 {{reform in}} place, the {{acceptance}} of homosexual acts or homosexual identities for West Germans was far from in place. Most reformers agreed that decriminalizing sexual relations between adult men <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as advocating an acceptance of homosexual men. While the old view of “militarized” masculinity may have phased out, “family-centered” masculinity was now grounded in the traditional male, and being a proper man meant being a proper father, which was believed {{at the time to}} be a role a homosexual male could not fulfill.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other Sophists, such as Protagoras, Gorgias did not {{profess to}} teach arete (excellence, or, virtue). He {{believed}} {{that there was no}} absolute form of arete, but that it was relative to each situation. For example, virtue in a slave <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as virtue in a statesman. His believed that rhetoric, the art of persuasion, was the king of all sciences, since he saw it as a techné with which one could persuade an audience toward any course of action. While rhetoric existed in the curriculum of every Sophist, Gorgias placed more prominence upon it than any of the others.|$|E

In hardware emulation, a {{piece of}} hardware imitates another, while in hardware virtualization, a hypervisor ({{a piece of}} software) imitates a particular piece of computer hardware or the entire computer. Furthermore, a hypervisor <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as an emulator; both are computer programs that imitate hardware, but their domain of use in language differs.|$|R

25|$|During the Panic of 1893, Pullman {{closed his}} {{manufacturing}} plant in Detroit {{in order to}} move all manufacturing to the company town. Wages were reduced and employees were laid off, but the costs of utilities remained unchanged. On May 11, 1894, the employees of the Pullman Co. walked off the job and initiated the Pullman Strike. The Pullman Co. had reduced wages, but not the rents on housing. 30 people were killed {{as a result of the}} strikes and sabotage. After the strike, the company town <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The strike resulted in the loss of pride for the company town.|$|E
25|$|Koppel had {{a verbal}} denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the {{archaeologist}} who had supervised the initial 1980 dig {{of the tomb}} of Yeshua`, with whom he spoke on 3/4/07, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the alleged Tomb of 'Jesus' {{could not have been}} what is now known as the James ossuary. In fact he indicated there was evidence that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> by saying that the now missing ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette.|$|E
25|$|Weinzweig’s {{move toward}} {{serialism}} {{was not a}} complete transition; he was very selective and deliberate in which principles he chose to adopt. While he acknowledged that Schoenberg’s influence on the musical world was powerful, he was not particularly taken with Schoeberg’s music and preferred that of composers such as Berg and Webern. His attraction to serialism <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as that of its Viennese founders. Since he was not taught strictly using tonality in his early education, {{he did not feel}} the need to rebel and use serialism simply as a means to avoid tonality. While he often employed the techniques used by Stravinsky, Bartók, Copland and Varèse, he did not teach these methods to his students exclusively.|$|E
