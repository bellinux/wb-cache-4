500|$|Bucer {{took the}} {{position}} of Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge. [...] In June he entered a controversy when Peter Martyr, another refugee who had taken the equivalent Regius Professor position at Oxford University, debated with Catholic colleagues {{over the issue of}} the Lord's Supper. Martyr asked Bucer for his support, but Bucer did not totally agree with Martyr's position and thought that exposure of differences would not assist the cause of reform. Unwilling to see the eucharist conflict repeat itself in England, he told Martyr he did not take sides, Catholic, Lutheran, or Zwinglian. He said, [...] "We must aspire with the utmost zeal to edify as many people as <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> in faith and in the love of Christ—and to offend no one." ...|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "I believe that we have the power to deter Iran, should it become nuclear." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film Matisse From MoMA and Tate Modern {{combines}} high-definition {{footage of}} the galleries with commentary from curators, museum administrators and, through narration of words from the past, Matisse himself. [...] "We want to show the exhibition as well as <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> to the audience who can’t get there", said director Phil Grabsky. Inspired by a similar [...] "event cinema" [...] produced by the Met, Grabsky started his series to simulate the experience of strolling through an art exhibit.|$|E
2500|$|... "Window Seat"'s {{official}} {{music video}} was premiered on March 27, 2010 at 3:33a.m. on Badu's website. Circulating throughout several Internet blogs, the music video was received with controversy and a divided reaction from fans, Internet critics, and media outlets. On March 30, 2010, {{it became the}} ninth most popular search on Google. The music video also prompted attention from Dallas city officials for Badu's public nudity and filming without city permits. Dallas Mayor Pro Tem Dwaine Caraway expressed concern for stricter laws to prevent similar incidents, stating [...] "None {{of this would have}} occurred had she stayed clothed. But since she didn't, it elevated the need for making sure that we have policies in place that will protect folks and the integrity of the city as best <b>we</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> ... What if there is another take to her bizarre activity? What if there is a part two and we don't take some type of action or put it up for discussion and she comes out and really gets with it and does a Michael Jackson-type video and have 15, 20 people and all of them take their clothes off?" ...|$|E
