50|$|During the 2012 West Nile virus {{outbreak}} in Texas, USA, 1,868 cases were reported. Male patients, persons >65 years of age, and minorities were {{at highest risk}} for neuroinvasive disease. At total of 1,868 cases including 844 (45%) WNND (<b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease)</b> cases and 89 deaths (case-fatality rate 5%). Dates of onset ranged from May 1, 2012, through December 6, 2012. The outbreak peaked during week 33 (mid-August) with 225 reported cases, which is historically the same peak for all reported WNV cases in Texas during 2002-2011. The median time from date of symptom onset to date of official report to TxDSHS was 27 days (range 6-274 days). Of the 254 counties in Texas, 135 (53%) reported a WNV case. The overall incidence rate for the state was 7.8 cases per 100,000 population. Almost half of the cases were reported from the northeastern quadrant of the state, including the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex (902 48% cases): Dallas (396 21%), Tarrant (259 14%), Collin (64 3%), and Denton (183 10%) counties.

40|$|Background and Aim: Both West Nile {{fever and}} <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> have been {{associated}} with gastrointestinal manifestations including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (Murray et al., 2008). No publications to date have specifically focused on the gastrointestinal manifestations in acute West Nile disease, even with a high prevalence of gastrointestinal disease within the study populations (Murray et al., 2008). Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations, and to assess the association between gastrointestinal manifestations and <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease.</b> ^ Methods: All probable and confirmed West Nile illness cases reported to Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services (HCPHES) as a part of routine surveillance between 2002 and 2014 were used in this study. Descriptive demographic characteristics were summarized and their analysis stratified by West Nile fever and <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> (Including encephalitis, meningitis, and meningoencephalitis). The prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain in WNV disease patients was calculated. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the presence of gastrointestinal manifestations and WNV neuroinvasive disease, and disease outcomes (recovered, continued morbidity, and death). Multiple linear regression was used to assess the association between delay in diagnosis (the number of days between date of symptom onset and date of specimen collection), and the presence of gastrointestinal manifestations. ^ Results: There were 261 probable and confirmed West Nile disease patients reported to HCPHES between 2002 and 2014. 75. 5 % of the patients reported gastrointestinal manifestations. Multiple logistic regression indicated that the odds of prevalent <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> in patients with gastrointestinal manifestations increased by 114 percent when compared to patients without gastrointestinal manifestations. Other multiple logistic regression models indicated that there was no significant association between the presence of gastrointestinal manifestations and the various disease outcomes (continued morbidity, death, or recovery). Multiple linear regression indicated no significant difference delayed diagnosis and presence of gastrointestinal manifestations. ^ Conclusions: Due to the findings in this study, patients who are suspected of having West Nile illness and gastrointestinal manifestations should be warned about the potential neurological complications. Proper education on the signs and symptoms of <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> should be provided for these patients by the medical provider. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Estimates {{indicate}} that West Nile virus infects approximately {{one and a}} half million people in the United States of America. Up to 1 % may develop West <b>Nile</b> virus <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease,</b> in which infected patients develop any combination of meningitis, encephalitis, or acute paralysis. Case presentation A 56 -year-old African-American man presented to our hospital with headache, restlessness, fever, myalgias, decreased appetite, and progressive confusion. A cerebrospinal fluid examination showed mild leukocytosis and an elevated protein level. Testing for routine infections was negative. Brain T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans showed marked enlargement of caudate nuclei and increased intensity within the basal ganglia and thalami. A West Nile virus titer was positive, and serial brain magnetic resonance imaging scans showed resolving abnormalities that paralleled his neurological examination.

MethodsTwenty-two patients with WNND were examined 16 months after the onset of symptoms. The physical and mental function of the 22 survivors was evaluated. ResultsA considerable persistent morbidity and long length of time to recovery was observed. The most common symptoms were anorexia (77. 3 %) and muscle weakness (72. 7 %), followed by memory impairment (36. 4 %) and depression (22. 7 %). Older age was correlated with memory impairment, muscle weakness, and permanent damage. A complete recovery was seen in 7 / 22 (31. 8 %) patients, while three patients presented permanent damage. The critical time-point was 1 year after the onset of symptoms; at that time the patient's health status was either highly improved or had deteriorated irreversibly. ConclusionsWNND is associated with considerable short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Lineage 2 strains need further scientific attention.

40|$|Since 1999, {{more than}} 6, 500 cases of West <b>Nile</b> virus <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> (WNND) have been {{reported}} in the United States. Patients with WNND can present with muscle weakness that is often assumed to be of neurologi-cal origin. During 2002, nearly 3, 000 persons with WNV meningitis or encephalitis (or both) were reported in the United States; in suburban Cook County, Illinois, with 244 persons were hospitalized for WNV illnesses. The ob-jective of this investigation was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of identified cases of WNV <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> and rhabdomyolysis. Public health officials investigated patients hospitalized in Cook County, and identified a subset of WNV <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> patients with elevated creatine kinase levels. Cases were defined as hospitalized persons with a WNV infection, encephalitis or meningitis, and rhabdomyolysis. Ret-rospective medical record reviews were conducted and data was abstracted with a standardized data collection in-strument. Eight patients with West Nile encephalitis and one with West Nile meningitis were identified with rhabdomyolysis. Median age of the nine patients was 70 years (range, 45 – 85 years), and eight were men. For all nine patients, the peak CK level was documented a median of 2 days after hospitalization (range, 1 – 24 days). Me-dian CK level during hospitalization for all case-patients was 3, 037 IU (range, 1, 153 – 42, 113 IU). Six patients had history of recent falls prior to admission. Although the temporal relationship of rhabdomyolysis and neurologi-cal WNV illness suggested a common etiology, these patients presented with complex clinical conditions which may have led to development of rhabdomyolysis from other causes.

40|$|Importance. Oftentimes, when {{patients}} with metastatic cancer present with acute encephalopathy, it is suspected to be secondary to their underlying malignancy. However, {{there are multiple}} causes of delirium such as central nervous system (CNS) infections, electrolyte abnormalities, and drug adverse reactions. Because West <b>Nile</b> Virus (WNV) <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> has a high mortality rate in immunosuppressed patients, a high index of suspicion is required in patients who present with fever, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms. Observations. Our case report details a single patient with brain metastases who presented with unexplained fever, encephalopathy, and new-onset tremors. Initially, {{it was assumed that}} his symptoms were due to his underlying malignancy or seizures. However, because his unexplained fevers persisted, lumbar puncture was pursued. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis included WNV polymerase chain reaction and serologies were ordered which eventually led to diagnosis of WNV encephalitis. Conclusions and Relevance. Patients with metastatic cancer who present with encephalopathy are often evaluated with assumption that malignancy is the underlying etiology.

It can cause a highly variable range of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe illness. Neuroinvasive disease due to West Nile virus can lead to long-term neurological deficits and psychological impairment. However, these deficits have not been well described. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the neuropsychological manifestations of West Nile virus infection with a focus on neuroinvasive status and time since infection. Patients from Ontario Canada with a diagnosis of neuroinvasive disease (meningitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis) and non-neuroinvasive disease who had participated in a cohort study were enrolled. Clinical and laboratory were collected, as well as demographics and medical history. Cognitive functioning was assessed using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Data from 49 individuals (32 with West Nile fever and 17 with <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease)</b> were included in the present cross-sectional analysis.

To further elucidate the mechanisms responsible for end-stage WNV and CHIKV <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease,</b> we used transcriptomics to compare the induction of effector pathways in the brain during the early and late stage of disease in young mice. In addition to the more commonly described cell death pathways such as apoptosis and autophagy, we also found evidence for the differential expression of pyroptosis and necroptosis cell death markers during both WNV and CHIKV <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease.</b> In contrast, no evidence of cell dysfunction was observed, indicating that cell death {{may be the most}} important mechanism of disease. Interestingly, there was overlap when comparing immune markers involved in <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> to those seen in neurodegenerative diseases.

Less than 1 % of infected persons develop <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease,</b> which typically presents as encephalitis, meningitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. Reporting Period: 1999 - 2008. Description of System: WNV disease is a nationally notifiable disease with standardized case definitions. State and metropolitan heath departments report cases to CDC through ArboNET, an electronic passive surveillance system. Variables collected include patient age, sex, race, county and state of residence, date of illness onset, clinical syndrome, and outcome of illness. Results: During 1999 - 2008, a total of 28, 961 confirmed and probable cases of WNV disease, including 11, 822 (41 %) WNV <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> cases, were reported to CDC from 47 states and the District of Columbia. No cases were reported from Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, or any U. S. territories. A total of 93 % of all WNV patients had illness onset during July-September. The national incidence of WNV <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> peaked in 2002 (1. 02 cases per 100, 000 population) and was stable during 2004 - 2007 (mean annual incidence: 0. 44; range: 0. 390. 50). In 2008, the incidence was 0. 23 per 100, 000 population, compared with 0. 41 in 2007 and 0. 50 in 2006. During 1999 - 2008, the highest incidence of <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> occurred in West North Central and Mountain states. <b>Neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> incidence increased with increasing age, with the highest incidence (1. 35 cases per 100, 000 population) occurring among persons aged _> 70 years. The hospitalization rate and case-fatality ratio increased with increasing age among persons with <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease.</b> Interpretation: The stability in reported incidence of <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> during 2004 - 2007 might represent an endemic level of WNV transmission. Whether the incidence reported in 2008 represents a decrease that will continue is unknown; variations in vectors, avian amplifying hosts, human activity, and environmental factors make predicting future WNV transmission levels difficult. Public Health Action: Surveillance of WNV disease is important for detecting and monitoring seasonal epidemics and targeting prevention and control activities. Public health education programs should focus on older persons, who are at increased risk for neurologic disease and poor clinical outcomes. In the absence of an effective human vaccine, WNV disease prevention depends on community-level mosquito control and household and personal protection measures. "- p. 1 Nicole P. Lindsey, J.

40|$|West Nile {{virus is}} a member of the {{flaviviridae}} family. It was first discovered in 1937 when it was isolated from blood of a febrile Ugandan woman. Since 1999, the virus has spread rapidly throughout the western hemisphere. Infection with West Nile virus often results in a fever. However, infection might also result in travelling of West Nile virus into the central nervous system and the brain, causing <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease.</b> Infection might cause meningitis, encephalitis, poliomyelitis, chorioretinitis and has a high lethality. No specific treatment is available for West Nile virus infection. The mechanism by which the virus enters the central nervous system and the brain is not fully unraveled. Disruption of blood-brain barrier is important in causing <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> as well as travel of the virus into axons that lead to the central nervous system. Several factors modulate entry into the brain. Signaling of the tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor has shown to be a predominant factor in facilitating transport across the blood brain barrier. The aim of this review is to discuss the mechanism underlying <b>neuroinvasive</b> <b>disease</b> in West <b>Nile</b> virus infection. ...|$|R
