Tom Young from BBC Music called the performance a [...] "delight" [...] but described the video as the [...] "lowlight" [...] of the tour. Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine {{wrote that the}} performance was not among the concert's highlights.

2500|$|Roger Hahn {{disputes}} this {{portrayal of}} Laplace as an opportunist and turncoat, pointing out that, like many in France, he {{had followed the}} debacle of Napoleon's Russian campaign with serious misgivings. The Laplaces, whose only daughter Sophie had died in childbirth in September 1813, were in fear {{for the safety of}} their son Émile, who was on the eastern front with the emperor. Napoleon had originally come to power promising stability, but {{it was clear that he}} had overextended himself, putting the nation at peril. It was at this point that Laplace's loyalty began to weaken. Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to the quick by Napoleon's insensitivity in an exchange related by Jean-Antoine Chaptal: [...] "On his return from the rout in Leipzig, he [...] accosted Mr Laplace: 'Oh! I see that you have grown thin—Sire, I have lost my daughter—Oh! that's not a reason for losing <b>weight.</b> <b>You</b> are a mathematician; put this event in an equation, and you will find that it adds up to zero.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] Rabbi Levi {{taught that}} blessed actions bless {{those who are}} {{responsible}} for them, and cursed actions curse those {{who are responsible for}} them. The Midrash interpreted the words of [...] "A perfect and just <b>weight</b> <b>you</b> shall have," [...] to mean that if one acts justly, one will have something to take and something to give, something to buy and something to sell. Conversely, the Midrash read [...] to teach, [...] "You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small. You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your house diverse measures, a great and a small." [...] Thus, if one does employ deceitful measures, one will not have anything to take or give, to buy or sell. The Midrash taught that God tells businesspeople that they [...] "may not make" [...] one measure great and another small, but if they do, they [...] "will not make" [...] a profit. The Midrash likened this commandment to that of [...] (20:20 in the NJPS) [...] "You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make," [...] for if a person did make gods of silver and gold, then that person {{would not be able to}} afford to have even gods of wood or stone.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{likened the}} commandment of [...] {{to have just}} weights and {{measures}} to that of [...] (20:20 in the NJPS) not to make gods of silver, or gods of gold.

50|$|The arabesque is a {{technique}} that is borrowed from the ballet moves. It works excellently for the butt muscles, and does not even make the use of free <b>weights.</b> However, if <b>you</b> want to add cuffs or ankle <b>weights,</b> <b>you</b> need to follow the following procedure. Place {{your hands on the}} back of the chair or on a railing, and lift one leg behind you as high as possible, while holding your glutes and squeezing them for a count of about 4 or 5. Make sure to maintain an upright position so that you do not stress your lower back instead of the glutes.|$|R

60|$|Indeed, in {{the seventh}} chapter of your book, you make a great noise of the effects and {{consequences}} {{of the death of}} Christ, as that it was a sacrifice for sin, an expiatory, and propitiatory sacrifice (p. 83).
