5|$|Despite the evident {{conflicts}} between amateurism and the Soviet {{system in which}} athletes received stipends, jobs, and housing at state expense, Brundage took no action against the USSR or Warsaw Pact nations with similar systems; when challenged on this point, he argued that <b>Western</b> <b>nations</b> had similar abuses, such as athletic scholarships. The Soviet system remained in place, though <b>Western</b> <b>nations</b> reacted by giving their athletes greater state support.|$|E
5|$|All in all, the {{membership}} reflected a mid-1950s combination of anti-communist <b>Western</b> <b>nations</b> and such nations in Southeast Asia. The United Kingdom, France and the United States, {{the latter of}} which joined after the U.S. Senate ratified the treaty by an 82–1 vote, represented the strongest Western powers. Canada also considered joining, but decided against {{it in order to}} concentrate on its NATO responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} stay-at-home dads began {{gradually}} increasing {{in the late}} 20th century, especially in developed <b>Western</b> <b>nations.</b> The recent statistic that Pew Research released, showed a report in June 2014 that found 2 million men to be stay-at-home dads in the US. However, in 2010, the number of stay-at-home dads had reached its highest point of 2.2 million.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{coronary}} artery disease, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and traffic accidents caused the most {{years of life}} lost in the U.S. Low back pain, depression, musculoskeletal disorders, neck pain, and anxiety caused the most years lost to disability. The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates. U.S. teenage pregnancy and abortion rates are substantially higher than in other <b>Western</b> <b>nations,</b> especially among blacks and Hispanics.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the perceived blasphemy, Akhtar declared it was his personal jihad to find {{those responsible for the}} packaging and destroy their professional status, personal life and the UK as a whole for having a culture allowing the insult to occur. This event, Akhtar's reaction and other similar issues with companies such as Nike and Unilever have been used by conservative political critics, such as James Joyner, claiming that <b>western</b> <b>nations</b> and organizations are kowtowing in too easily to Muslims' claims or threats and by commentators, including author Daniel C. Dennett, highlighting how factions of the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm.|$|E

5|$|Of the <b>Western</b> <b>nations</b> {{represented}} in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando only Norway did not develop a Commando force. The French troops were the predecessors of the Naval commandos. The Dutch Troops were the predecessors of the Korps Commandotroepen and the Belgian Troops were the predecessors of the Paracommando Brigade. The 1st Battalion of the United States Army Rangers were {{also influenced by}} the British Commandos. Their first volunteers were from troops stationed in Northern Ireland, who were sent to train at the Commando depot at Achnacarry. However, subsequent Ranger battalions were formed and trained independent of British influence.|$|E
5|$|The ONA {{believe that}} there are {{historical}} precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named Baphomet at the spring equinox and to the Arcturus star in the autumn. However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist groups like the Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within <b>Western</b> <b>nations.</b>|$|E
5|$|The U.S. teenage {{pregnancy}} rate is 26.5 per 1,000 women. The rate has declined by 57% since 1991. In 2013, the highest teenage birth rate was in Alabama, {{and the lowest}} in Wyoming. Abortion is legal throughout the U.S., owing to Roe v. Wade, a 1973 landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. While the abortion rate is falling, the abortion ratio of 241 per 1,000 live births and abortion rate of 15 per 1,000 women aged 15–44 remain {{higher than those of}} most <b>Western</b> <b>nations.</b> In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.|$|E

5|$|Women have {{traditionally}} been disadvantaged {{in terms of economic}} and social status and power, which in turn reduces their access to the necessities of life including health care. Despite recent improvements in <b>western</b> <b>nations,</b> women remain disadvantaged with respect to men. The gender gap in health is even more acute in developing countries where women are relatively more disadvantaged. In addition to gender inequity, there remain specific disease processes uniquely associated with being a woman which create specific challenges in both prevention and health care.|$|E
5|$|After sitar player Ravi Shankar {{successfully}} {{performed in}} Western countries, Narayan followed his example. He recorded solo albums {{and made his}} first international tour in 1964 to America and Europe with his older brother Chatur Lal, a tabla player who had toured with Shankar in the 1950s. The European tour included performances in France, Germany, sponsored by the Goethe-Institut, and at the City of London Festival, England. Beginning in the 1960s, Narayan often taught and gave concerts outside of India. On his Western tours he encountered interest in the sarangi because of its similarity to the cello and violin. The tabla player Suresh Talwalkar became a frequent accompanist for Narayan in the late 1960s. Narayan continued to perform and record in India and abroad for the next decades and his recordings appeared on Indian, American, and European labels. During the early 1980s he typically spent months each year visiting <b>Western</b> <b>nations.</b> Narayan performed less frequently in the 2000s and rarely in the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|Mugabe {{focused on}} the {{propaganda}} war, making regular speeches and radio broadcasts. In these, he presented himself as a Marxist-Leninist, speaking warmly of Marxist-Leninist revolutionaries like Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, and Fidel Castro. Despite his Marxist views, Mugabe's meetings with Soviet representatives were unproductive, for they insisted on Nkomo's leadership of the revolutionary struggle. His relationship with the People's Republic of China was far warmer, as the Chinese Marxist government supplied ZANLA with armaments without any conditions. He also sought support from <b>Western</b> <b>nations,</b> visiting Western embassies in Mozambique, and travelled to both Western states like Italy and Switzerland and Marxist-governed states like the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.|$|E

5|$|Questions about Modi's {{relationship}} with Muslims were also raised by many <b>Western</b> <b>nations</b> {{during his tenure}} as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, {{in accordance with the}} recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed {{under the aegis of the}} International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, several parties, {{including}} the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the British Heart Foundation, the City of New York, and the Spanish government, {{have argued that}} Burger King has contributed to obesity and unhealthy eating behaviors in <b>Western</b> <b>nations</b> by producing products that contain large amounts of salt, fat, trans-fat and calories. After its purchase by TPG Capital from former parent company Diageo in 2002, the company introduced several large, over-sized products including its European BK XXL line, the British Angus burger six-pack, the Enormous Omelet Sandwich line and the BK Stacker line. These new offerings, and others like them, have resulted in further international scorn and negative attention due the large portion size and increased amounts of unhealthy fats and trans-fats in these items. Many consumer groups have accused Burger King and other fast food restaurant chains of failing to provide healthier alternatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} occupation of Kampuchea had profound consequences for Vietnamese foreign policy. Since gaining independence in 1954, the Vietnamese communist perspective {{on foreign policy}} had been dominated {{by the need to}} maintain a world order of two camps, communist and non-communist. Indeed, the treaties of friendship that Vietnam signed with the Soviet Union, Laos and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea were consistent with that view. However, the ideological motivations of the Vietnamese communist leadership were proven to be limited and heavily flawed, as demonstrated by the 1979 condemnation of Vietnam after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime. In the years that followed, the Vietnamese Government was left isolated from the world and its efforts to rebuild the country were handicapped by the lack of aid from the capitalist <b>Western</b> <b>nations.</b> Furthermore, the presence of Vietnamese military forces in Cambodia became an obstacle which prevented the normalisation of diplomatic ties with China, the United States and the member nations of ASEAN.|$|E

Australia maintains {{some of the}} most restrictive Internet policies of any <b>Western</b> <b>nation,</b> while its neighbor, New Zealand, is less rigorous in its Internet regulation. Without any explicit protection of free speech in the constitution, the Australian government has used its "communications power" delineated in the constitution to regulate the availability of offensive content, endowing a government entity with the power to issue take-down notices for Internet content hosted within the country. A number of state and territorial governments in Australia have also passed legislation making the distribution of offensive material a criminal offense, as the constitution does not afford that power to the national government...|$|R
50|$|Canada was {{the first}} <b>western</b> <b>nation</b> to {{recognize}} Ukraine's independence on December 2, 1991.

5|$|Yangwu was {{a wooden}} corvette, {{built at the}} Foochow Navy Yard and {{launched}} on April 23, 1872. She was the seventh vessel built {{as part of a}} larger shipbuilding program at the Foochow Arsenal, and cost 254,000 taels (353,000 silver dollars) for her construction. She was the largest warship built between 1868–75 out of the 19 vessels planned. The shipyard was overseen by Imperial commissioner Shen Baozhen but led by staff from <b>Western</b> <b>nations,</b> who advised the Chinese to continue building wooden-hulled ships despite them being made obsolete by the construction of ironclads by those nations. Chinese officials would later blame the French, in particular Prosper Giquel, for purposely providing them with out-of-date equipment and designs.|$|E
5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views {{out of fear of}} reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, <b>Western</b> <b>nations,</b> and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E
5|$|Diệm spent {{little time}} on {{detailed}} defence and policy discussions with Australian officials during the trip, {{because of his}} extensive meetings with Catholic leaders. Although Diệm had signalled his intentions to discuss defence relations during the visit, these did not materialise. At {{the end of the}} visit, Diệm and Menzies released a bilateral statement, announcing that they would increase the magnitude of the Colombo Plan, a program under which Asian students could study abroad in <b>Western</b> <b>nations.</b> However, there was little detail in the announcements relating to anti-communism, with only general expressions of Australian support. Diệm had previously stated that if North Vietnam attacked the south, he would send the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to land in the Red River Delta in the north and retaliate. This was contrary to the air attack plans of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO), which had vowed to defend the south under the provisions of the Manila Treaty. Despite the public statements of support, the Australian government never shared the details of the SEATO plans with Diệm.|$|E
