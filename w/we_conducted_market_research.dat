40|$|Servitization {{has already}} {{diffused}} to a reasonable extent in European manufacturing industries. While {{several studies have}} shown and analyzed this development, {{little is known about}} the needs and behaviour of manufacturers with regard to services in emerging industries, e. g., in the so-called BRIC countries. Consequently, service providers have to conduct their own market analysis to obtain a deeper understanding of the target foreign market. However, in reality, manufacturers are uncertain of how to conduct this type of service market research. Therefore, this study presents a typical market research analysis for servitized offerings in emerging manufacturing industries. This work entails a study of the demand of manufacturers for services in emerging markets based on a quantitative survey that was conducted in the Chinese province of Guangdong. To obtain a deeper understanding of the existing service needs in emerging industries, <b>we</b> <b>conducted</b> <b>market</b> <b>research</b> for manufacturers that offer services abroad. On the basis of our experiences with this study in China, we describe the challenges for manufacturers in conducting market research analysis and the managerial implications of designing a suitable market entry mode. Consequently, this article aims to support industrial firms in conducting their own market research and in developing individual market entry modes, with a focus on BRIC countries...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The tablet {{formulation}} of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r; Kaletra ®) has many advantages over the soft gel capsule (SGC) formulation, including lower pill count, no refrigeration requirement, and no dietary restrictions. These advantages may help improve patient compliance and therefore increase adherence to treatment. However, there are limited data regarding patient preferences and only recently was the comparative efficacy and tolerability data of LPV/r SGC versus tablet formulation presented {{at an international}} conference. To address this deficit, <b>we</b> <b>conducted</b> a <b>market</b> <b>research</b> survey to assess potential tolerability benefits, patient satisfaction, changes in adherence, and formulation preference in patients switching from SGCs to the tablet formulation. Data from 332 patients who switched from LPV/r SGCs twice-daily (BID) to tablets BID and 41 patients who switched from LPV/r SGCs BID or once daily (QD) to tablets QD were analyzed. Results Switching from SGCs to a tablet {{formulation of}} LPV/r was associated with increased patient satisfaction, tolerability and self-reported adherence to treatment; gastrointestinal side effects were reduced. In addition, {{respondents indicated that they}} preferred the tablet formulation to the SGC. Conclusion The LPV/r tablet formulation provides HIV-infected patients with multiple benefits over the SGC in terms of tolerability and convenience. Additional assessments to further define the tolerability profile of the LPV/r tablet, including studies using once-daily dosing, are warranted. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{our present}} aging society, {{a large number}} of {{problems}} need resolved so that clothing designed for the elderly allows them to enjoy an independent life. Considerable {{progress has been made in}} research and development of supportive welfare devices and barrier-free homes, but little has been done to solve the problems associated with ready-made nightwear, such as the limited number of sizes, inappropriate sleeve and trouser lengths and crotch depth, and lack of pockets. In the present study, <b>we</b> therefore <b>conducted</b> <b>market</b> <b>research</b> and a questionnaire survey, and based on the results, made three pairs of pajamas considered acceptable for elderly women. An additional pair was also made taking into consideration the most common grievance items. The visual appearance and fit of a total of 6 pajamas, the above and 2 ready-made pajamas made of different material and with different button features, were evaluated. Our evaluation produced the following results : 1. Cotton fabric with a light colored floral pattern was most appropriate. 2. Pajama tops with buttons on the front, no collar and an adequately long body, short raglan, elasticated sleeves, and bilateral pockets were preferred. 3. Pajamas trousers with a short inner leg and unnelasticated hems, and pockets to identify the front from the rear were preferred, 4. The collar, which often appears cramped in ready-made pajamas, should be widened. The results indicated that a slight difference in length and width affected the comfort of pajamas, Taking this into consideration, appropriately designed pajamas should be made available...|$|R
40|$|Background Cardiovascular disease {{mortality}} {{remains high}} in Europe and many patients have elevated risk factors, despite evidence-based targets and treatment guidelines. This survey examined barriers to implementing cardiovascular risk reduction guidelines. Design <b>We</b> <b>conducted</b> a semi-structured <b>market</b> <b>research</b> survey of physicians. Methods The {{survey was conducted}} in six European countries among cardiologists and primary care physicians. In total, 67 questions were used: 35 had multiple choice answers (prompted) and 32 allowed any answer (unprompted). Respondents were working full-time in patient care (Z 3 years experience) and were {{in a position to}} initiate cardiovascular drug treatment. Results Of the 220 respondents (155 primary care physicians, 65 cardiologists), most (85 %) based assessment of cardiovascular risk on all risk factors, reflecting a global approach to risk, rather than considering risk factors individually. A majority (62 %) used subjective assessments for establishing global risk rather than guidelines or risk calculators. The most common unprompted barrier to guideline implementation was patient compliance (36 %) and a lack of time (23 %), and when prompted, the most important was government health policy (40 %). The most common unprompted suggestion for improving implementation were financial opportunities (24 %) and clear and easy to use guidelines (23 %), while when prompted the most important change required was the development of simpler guidelines (46 %). Conclusions Although a majority of physicians are aware of the need to look at a combination of cardiovascular diseas...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. In {{this paper}} we have {{identified}} the factors of consumer capital, which are accounted {{in the process of}} strategic planning on the confectionery enterprises. The results of the analysis. For consumer capital growth it is necessary to consider the features of consumer needs in the strategic planning of the company. A behavior is characterized by the volume and frequency of purchases. Consumer capital is often understood as capital of relations. In this sense, it includes contracts and agreements, reputation, brand, trademarks, distribution channels and product portfolio, relationships with consumers. Sociological data needed in the allocation of a certain market for groups of consumers are public. For this information analyzing we should use data from different sources, and to consider the thoughts and intuition leadership concerning the market situation. The main task of this research is to identify groups of customers with varying degrees of receptivity of products and brands. To assess consumer capital of confectioner enterprises we have provided <b>market</b> <b>research</b> in 2012 in Donetsk. In <b>conducting</b> <b>marketing</b> <b>research</b> (processed 50 customers) the degree of confidence probability was 95 %, confidence interval 10, 04 %. This made it possible to identify the benefits and demands of confectionery consumers, as well as to determine the factors that motivate them to buy. 50 % of respondents often choose products of brand Roshen. Consumers of PA Konti products there are 40 %. Wide range of products, favorable prices, quality products etc. allow Konti company to win a large market share of confectionery in the country. On the third place there is AVK company. Products of this corporation are bought by 32 % of respondents. Note that the AVK company is the market leader in Ukraine in category of chocolate candy. More than a half of respondents (56 %) choose this type of confectionery like chocolate candy. 46 %of respondents prefer cookies. Bars and tiles are bought by 24 % of consumers. All of these products and those who scored less interest are presented {{in a wide range of}} each trading firms that were mentioned earlier. Conclusions and directions of further researches. The results of the research give us opportunity to form conclusions:wide range of products, favorable prices, quality products allow corporations to gain a large market share of confectionery in the country;to estimate consumer capital of confectionery enterprises <b>we</b> need to <b>conduct</b> <b>market</b> <b>research</b> that will help identify the benefits and demands of its consumers, as well as to determine the factors that motivate them to buy;in the process of developing the strategic planning of confectionery industry we need to segment the market of consumers that will enable to develop effective measures to increase profits;ideal buyers confectionery products (according to the research) are women of 25, which income is up to 2000 USD with higher education who buy confectioneries weekly at the supermarket...|$|R

40|$|We model a duopoly {{in which}} ex ante {{identical}} firms must {{decide where to}} direct their innovation efforts. The firms face market uncertainty about consumers' preferences for innovation on two product attributes and technology uncertainty about {{the success of their}} research and development (R&D) investments. Firms can <b>conduct</b> costly <b>market</b> <b>research</b> before setting R&D strategy. We find that the value of market information to a firm depends on whether its rival is expected to obtain this information in equilibrium. Consequently, one firm may forgo <b>market</b> <b>research</b> even though its rival conducts such research and learns the true state of demand. We examine both vertical and horizontal demand structures. With vertical preferences, firms are a priori uncertain about which attribute all consumers will value more. In this case, a firm that <b>conducts</b> <b>market</b> <b>research</b> always attempts innovation on the attribute it discovers that consumers prefer and expends more on R&D than a rival that has not <b>conducted</b> <b>market</b> <b>research.</b> With horizontal preferences, distinct segments exist—each caring about innovation on only one attribute—and firms are a priori uncertain how many consumers each segment contains. In this case, a firm that <b>conducts</b> <b>market</b> <b>research</b> may follow a strategy and attempt innovation to serve the smaller segment to avoid intense price competition for the larger segment. A firm that <b>conducts</b> <b>market</b> <b>research</b> may therefore invest less in R&D and earn lower postlaunch profits than a rival that has forgone such research. new product development, <b>market</b> <b>research,</b> innovation, differentiation, segmentation...|$|R
