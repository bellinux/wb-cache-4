25|$|Upon {{assuming}} power, Suharto government {{adopted a}} policy of neutrality in the Cold War <b>with</b> <b>quiet</b> alignment with the Western bloc (including Japan and South Korea) {{with the objective of}} securing support for Indonesia's economic recovery. Western countries, impressed by Suharto's strong anti-communist credentials, were quick to offer their support. Diplomatic relations with China was suspended in October 1967 due to suspicion of Chinese involvement in 30 September Movement (diplomatic relations was only restored in 1990). Due to Suharto's destruction of PKI the Soviet Union embargoed military sales to Indonesia. However, from 1967 to 1970 foreign minister Adam Malik managed to secure several agreements to restructure massive debts incurred by Sukarno from the Soviet Union and other Eastern European communist states. Regionally, having ended confrontation with Malaysia in August 1966, Indonesia became {{a founding member of the}} Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in August 1967.

25|$|The first {{movement}} {{revolves around}} a diatonic melody that soon develops into complex pianistic figuration. The second theme opens <b>with</b> <b>quiet</b> exchanges between the orchestra and the piano before fully diving {{into the second}} theme in B major. The {{first part of the}} first theme is restated before the movement is pulled into a loud development section which opens with toccata like quavers in the piano and reaches a loud chordal section. The whole development exhibits features similar to a canon, such as an eighth note passage in the piano in which the left hand and the right hand play overlapping figures. The movement reaches a number of ferocious climaxes, especially in the cadenza. Rachmaninoff wrote two versions of this cadenza: the chordal original, which is commonly notated as the ossia, and a second one with a lighter, toccata-like style. Both cadenzas lead into a quiet solo section where the flute, oboe, clarinet and horn restate the first theme of the exposition, accompanied by delicate arpeggios in the piano. The cadenza then ends quietly, but the piano alone continues to play a quiet development of the exposition's second theme in E major before leading to the recapitulation, where the first theme is restated by the piano, with the orchestra accompanying, soon closing with a quiet, rippling coda reminiscent of the second theme.|$|E
500|$|Gil Wahlquist of The Sydney Morning Herald {{called the}} album [...] "heavily accented towards jazz." [...] It has {{changing}} moods, <b>with</b> <b>quiet</b> moments which are [...] "eerie, euphonic, and evocative." [...] Aboriginal clapsticks and the imitation didgeridoo allude to the indigenous character of Uluru {{and the surrounding}} area. Another section is double-tempo jazz fusion with guitar and saxophone solos, complemented by a rhythm section driving to a crescendo. The section concludes with a rapid rallentando (slowing of tempo) to another gentle phase. Changes in tempo and volume are heard throughout the title track, in contrast to disco (featuring one tempo and volume, which was becoming more popular).|$|E

500|$|Although he {{performed}} on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of {{the pressures of the}} road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. [...] "I fell apart with the idea of touring", Ward later said. [...] "I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake." [...] Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the US <b>with</b> <b>Quiet</b> Riot and Night Ranger.

Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue." [...] Reporter Edna Gunderson commented: [...] "The woman whose hourglass torso and sensual gyrating have made her MTV's reigning sex kitten is today a vision of wholesome beauty." [...] Professor and social critic Camille Paglia expressed: [...] "Janet's unique persona combines bold, brash power <b>with</b> <b>quiet</b> sensitively and womanly mystery.

500|$|... "Sober" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics, with many considering {{it as one}} of the album's highlights. Entertainment Weekly editor Chris Willman considered both [...] "Never Again" [...] and [...] "Sober" [...] to be [...] "moody" [...] and [...] "warm-weather singles." [...] On his review of My December, Josh Love of Stylus Magazine wrote that while album track [...] "'Hole' whips up an almost joyously liberating nihilism that blessedly bypasses goth’s obfuscation, [...] right on its heels there's 'Sober' seething <b>with</b> <b>quiet</b> restraint (at least until the end)."

500|$|Townsend {{described}} Ki as {{both the}} introduction and the moral to the [...] "larger concept" [...] of the Devin Townsend Project. The album's lyrical themes explore Townsend's inner demons, past addictions, self-acceptance, and his [...] "newfound ability to say no." [...] The album opens with a brief instrumental that leads into [...] "Coast", a quiet, bass-driven track that {{sets the stage for}} the album as a [...] "metaphor for Devin's newfound restraint." [...] Townsend described it as [...] "the intro to the story, quiet, dark, haunted and unsure". The track builds in intensity toward the end with layers of vocals, but rather than exploding into Strapping Young Lad–style metal, fades into [...] "loose, bluesy guitar work". [...] "Disruptr" [...] has been described as [...] "a coffee-house metal track", contrasting light instrumentation with heavy metal–style songwriting and vocals in a way that one critic compared to Talking Heads. [...] "Gato" [...] proceeds in a similar vein, but is set apart with backing vocals by Dorval. [...] "Disruptr" [...] and [...] "Gato" [...] continue the musical theme; each song builds in intensity toward the end but [...] "stops and takes a deep breath" [...] before proceeding. The album then fades into [...] "Terminal", an atmospheric track <b>with</b> <b>quiet</b> vocals that was co-written by keyboardist Dave Young.|$|E
500|$|The general {{opinion of}} Fountain of the Great Lakes was {{positive}} with some describing it as a cultural achievement for Taft and Chicago. The detractors conceded that as a figural composition, it was ideal in an Old World way. [...] Critics voiced concern over the sculpture's confusion and decorum. [...] One of the basic problems for the critics was the propriety of the symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water. [...] There had for some time been discussion of the depictions representing relative elevations and the flows of the waters as they seem to do. There were grumblings for closer association of the figures to the lakes by use of physical features, directional orientation and definite contours. [...] Harriet Monroe, a general supporter of Taft's artistic efforts, was disappointed in the lack of representative geographic configuration {{and the lack of}} spirit of the lakes as inland seas. [...] With respect to this specific piece she had gone from being an ardent supporter who felt the model was [...] "stupendous" [...] to finding herself in [...] "doubt" [...] about the work. [...] Taft's human form depictions of the lake failed to capture the imagery of contemporary literature as it related to the power and fury of nature and the heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of Hamlin Garland, Charles Eugene Banks, Willa Cather, or Robert Morss Lovett. [...] Taft's representations of Lakes <b>with</b> <b>quiet</b> trickling water was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture. [...] On the day of the dedication the Chicago Daily News expressed this point with a photomontage juxtaposition of Taft's fountain and Lake Michigan in all its fury.|$|E

500|$|Back in England, the {{continuous}} succession of recording sessions, gigs and promotional work started again, but {{the strain of}} this routine was wearing out Kelly Johnson, who was also tired of the music the band had been playing for four years without a break. The other members struggled to convince her to stay {{and the chance to}} record with British celebrities Noddy Holder and Jim Lea as producers persuaded the guitarist to carry on with Girlschool. Holder and Lea, who had returned in those years to great success and popularity in Great Britain with the 70s rock band Slade, were hired to produce only a single, with the following album already scheduled to be recorded in Los Angeles <b>with</b> <b>Quiet</b> Riot producer Spencer Proffer. However, the good chemistry found with the two Slade members led the band to decide to record not a single, but their whole fourth studio album in North London with Lea and Holder, giving up the trip to the USA. This time the group changed sensibly both their appearance and their musical style in order to appeal to a large American audience, which Bronze considered more oriented toward AOR and glam rock than to the 'biker metal' Girlschool had produced before. Play Dirty, released in October 1983, is an album with a very polished sound, filled with keyboards, choruses and melodies, but it lacks much of the aggression and power of the preceding works. The album contains covers of the Slade songs [...] "High & Dry" [...] and [...] "Burning in the Heat" [...] and of T.Rex’s [...] "20th Century Boy", which was also released as a single. Play Dirty failed to enter the top 50 chart in the UK and had a lukewarm reception by fans and critics at home. A struggle between Bronze and PolyGram for the worldwide contract of the band resulted also in poor promotion for the album in the USA. Moreover, a disastrous performance at Wembley Arena supporting ZZ Top did not help Girlschool's already degraded image in Great Britain.|$|E
