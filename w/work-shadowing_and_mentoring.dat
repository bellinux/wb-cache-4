40|$|In {{discussion}} recently, a {{group of}} coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> students at Oxford Brookes University highlighted how studying coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring,</b> using rigorous methods to answer meaningful questions had developed their practice more than they could have ever anticipated. This issue of IJEBCM draws {{particular attention to the}} questions asked by those studying coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> illustrates the benefits to practice of undertaking meaningful and systematic research. The issue includes papers presented at the recent Coaching <b>and</b> <b>Mentoring</b> Research Conference, held at Oxford Brookes University on 7 th April 2006. Since research in the field of coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> is relatively new, this annual conference was instigated specifically to provide an opportunity for postgraduate students from any institution to share their work with a much wider audience. The benefits to coaching practice of well-formed questions are articulated in the summary by P. Alex Linley of his keynote presentation at the conference. In this paper Linley, writing as an academic researcher, talks about the advantages of research for coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> the obstacles to research both for the academic and the practitioner.

40|$|This paper, {{adopts a}} case study {{approach}} {{in order to examine}} the issues relating to the deployment of a coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> intervention {{within the context of a}} specific UK based small and medium-sized enterprise (SME). The SME coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> research agenda is highlighted as an area urgently needing attention given its economic impact. This paper seeks to initiate this debate. The pre-eminence of culture within an organisational context is analysed in order to establish its uniqueness and impact on coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> deployment. A number of barriers to effective coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> within this context are also identified as issues that need to be incorporated within an intervention if it is to be successful. A coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programme was developed to incorporate these findings and provide a starting point to address the SME research chasm...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{organizations}} have adopted coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> interventions {{to discover and}} foster the potential capabilities of employees. These practices are seen as competitive drivers to cultivate innovation and creativity in turbulent business environments. However, the literature has not investigated {{the question of how}} coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> are interrelated. By examining this connection, this study explores the joint effects of these practices on the organizational commitment of employees. The results from survey data of 247 employees, who were coachees as well as protégés at the same time, from 17 companies in South Korea suggested that mentoring moderates the positive relationship between managerial coaching and organizational commitment. In addition, the moderating effects also depended on the extent of the homogeneity of their coach <b>and</b> <b>mentor.</b> The positive relationship between managerial coaching and organizational commitment strongly increased with conditions of higher <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> lower homogeneity of coach <b>and</b> <b>mentor.</b> Conversely, the relationship became negative when both <b>mentoring</b> practice <b>and</b> the homogeneity of coach <b>and</b> <b>mentor</b> were low. These results could provide practical implications to organizations that are concurrently adopting both coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programs by helping managers to better understand their joint effects...|$|R

40|$|Coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> {{have been}} studied {{extensively}} with specific regard to learning theories; however, {{there is a lack}} of coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> research that is both grounded in psychological theory and evidence-based in the real world. This paper suggests an innovative framework presenting two distinctive ‘research journeys’, namely, mentoring in informal education settings and coaching in formal education settings. The combined evidence reveals that coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> in supporting the learning and development of adolescents involves complex and subtle psychological, social, emotional, cognitive and contextual interactive processes for all participants. The paper proposes a unified psychological model of coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> for those involved in supporting the learning and development of adolescents and describes the dynamic processe...|$|R
40|$|Faculty Development <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> are {{critical}} issues for all universities. It is widely {{recognized that the}} quality of the faculty is a limiting factor in the quality of virtually all academic programs. At universities that enjoy regional reputations, {{it may be difficult to}} attract new hires from the top group of candidates. A formally structured program for faculty development <b>and</b> <b>mentoring,</b> coupled with wise recruiting strategies, can help a regional university achieve and maintain the highest possible faculty quality. E-FAST (Engineering Faculty Academy for Scholarship in Teaching) is a faculty development <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> program that has been designed to work in concert with recruiting efforts to achieve the highest possible faculty quality. In this paper we discuss the history of faculty development <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> activities in Engineering programs in the United States, from the total neglect of development <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> that characterized the faculty hiring boom after Sputnik, through the current widespread interest in the "Teaching Academy" concept...|$|R

The study is unusual in that the participants experienced both coaching <b>and</b> <b>mentoring,</b> <b>and</b> it has been possible to identify the particular role provided by coaching <b>and</b> by <b>mentoring,</b> as well as where they offered support in similar ways...|$|R

50|$|The {{final round}} of the {{selection}} process, the home visits, saw the remaining 24 acts travel to exclusive locations around the world to find out which judge would become their mentor. The Boys, Girls and Over 25s travelled to New York City, while the Groups visited London. Each judge reduced their six acts to three, with help from celebrity guest mentors. The Boys were assigned to Mel B <b>and</b> <b>mentored</b> by Usher, the Girls were assigned to Natalie Bassingthwaighte <b>and</b> <b>mentored</b> by Kesha, the Over 25s were assigned to Guy Sebastian <b>and</b> <b>mentored</b> by Alicia Keys, and the Groups were assigned to Ronan Keating <b>and</b> <b>mentored</b> by One Direction. During the first day of home visits, each act was given a private mentoring session with their mentor, ahead of their solo performance in front of their <b>mentor</b> <b>and</b> guest <b>mentor</b> the next day. After, the judges along with their guest mentors, narrowed down the contestants to three each.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2004. The study {{investigated}} the role of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programmes in achieving school effectiveness. The study did not address all the issues related to school effectiveness. It aimed at finding out if the two schools under study had induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> programmes, <b>and</b> if these programmes were effectively used, and also to ascertain if the programmes of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> contributed to the sound relationships within the school community. In order to answer the research questions the study employed a qualitative case study approach. Literature on issues of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> locally <b>and</b> internationally was examined to provide a wider context with which to view the present study. Interviews were conducted which involved a sample of seven educators, employed between the years 2002 and 2003. Observation of the staff meetings {{and three of the}} newly appointed educators teaching was also conducted. Documents supplied by the Department, such as, Towards Effective School Management Manuals, The Final Draft of Systemic Evaluation 2001 KZN, Handbook for the Code of Professional Ethics 2002 and Guides for School Management Teams, related to induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> were analysed. The findings of the study suggest that in one school, the educators felt abandoned. In the other, the educators felt at home as regards induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring.</b> The findings also seem to suggest that the schools studied did not practice formal induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring.</b> As far as <b>mentoring</b> <b>and</b> having <b>mentors</b> were concerned, educators in one school, have their H. O. Ds as mentors although it was not spelt out to them. Educators in the other school did not have mentors in the school. The study recommends that principals, especially the beginning principals, need to be given guidance in the development of programmes of induction <b>and</b> <b>mentoring.</b> Workshops would also help to develop principals in using documents supplied to schools by the Department, to ensure the effective implementation of procedures and processes to be followed in schools...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{influence}} of self-efficacy in the relationship between <b>mentoring</b> program practices <b>and</b> mentee outcomes using 196 usable questionnaires collected from students studying in institutions of higher learning in Sarawak, Malaysia. The outcomes of stepwise regression analysis showed two important findings; firstly, the relationship between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> program practices (i. e., communication, participation and support) is insignificantly correlated with psycho social. Secondly, the relationship between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> program practices (i. e., communication, participation and support) is significantly correlated with academic performance. Statistically, this result confirms that the relationship between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> program practices has not been an important predictor of psycho social but the relationship between self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>mentoring</b> program practice has been an important predictor of academic performance in the organizational sample...|$|R
