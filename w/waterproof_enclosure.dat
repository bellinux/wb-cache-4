5000|$|The HERO3+ camera models claim {{dramatically}} improved {{low light}} performance {{and have a}} <b>waterproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> which is 20% lighter and 15% smaller than the HERO3's, according to the GoPro website. The HERO3+ camera housing is 20% smaller than the HERO3. The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness (close focus down to 7" [...] vs about 3 ft on the HERO3, {{at the expense of}} distant focus which is slightly less sharp with HERO3+), and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction. Battery life is claimed to be 30% longer than for the HERO3 model (both through better efficiency and a higher-capacity battery of the same dimensions).|$|E
40|$|Modern {{ecological}} {{theory is}} largely based off mean field assumptions that can overlook the critically important “patchiness”, areas {{of high and}} low resource distributions, that define ecosystems. Also, studying the fine scale distributions of microorganisms in these patches has traditionally involved very expensive, resource intensive methods. This has greatly hindered the ability to conduct research in this area. This paper present an alternative, high tech, low cost method {{that can be used to}} study these patch dynamics across a range of scales, from that of 10 ’s of centimeters to that of kilometers. This method involves the use of a <b>waterproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> that houses a microcomputer and imaging capture device that, with accompanying software, can analyze large batches of video for the presence, or lack thereof, of organisms of a desired size class. This paper also suggests a method, namely fractal analysis, which can be used to compare the self‐similarity, or lack thereof, of various organism distributions over a range of scales. Preliminary results seem to indicate a rough correlation between organisms of a small size and those of a larger size, though further data and analysis is necessary for confirmation. Further fine-tuning and utilization of this imagine system promises a high potential yet low cost way in which researchers in both terrestrial and marine landscapes can simultaneously analyze a greater volume of data while reducing their workload in terms of manual analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Clearpath Robotics Kingfisher M 200 robot is an {{unmanned}} {{water surface}} vehicle with payload autonomy capability. This {{allows users to}} develop autonomy control on an offboard computer until it is ready for use on the autonomous vehicle. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Battelle Autonomy Laboratory plans to utilize this feature in both teaching and research applications so that users can develop autonomous missions on off-board single-board computers and then easily integrate their missions with the vehicles when ready. Although the M 200 's payload bay includes a waterproof data connection port, there is no provided environmental protection for the payload computer itself. This paper documents the design and production of a waterproof payload computer module that allows for {{the operation of the}} single-board computer, data interface with the M 200 's on-board computer and for the attachment of additional USB components. The Raspberry Pi was selected as the most appropriate single-board computer and the Otterbox Drybox 3000 was selected as the most appropriate enclosure. Electrical circuitry was designed to allow for power to the computer, data communication with the M 200 and USB connections for additional components, and combination of cable glands and panel-mounted connectors were used to allow these connections to be accessible from the outside of the enclosure while retaining a NEMA 4 <b>waterproof</b> <b>enclosure</b> rating. In order to create a robust and user-friendly module, a system of strain relief and component orientation was designed. Continuous testing and adapting of prototypes resulted in a compact, operational payload module that can easily be interfaced with the Kingfisher M 200 to provide payload autonomy as well as offer two additional USB ports for the connection of additional components. This design aims to be easily reproducible by other Kingfisher M 200 users, as well as adaptable to other payload autonomy applications. by Emily L. Dunne. Thesis: S.

5000|$|Transverters {{are used}} in amateur radio to convert radio {{transceivers}} designed for use on the HF or VHF bands to operate on even higher frequency (microwave) bands. A transceiver used in this fashion {{is referred to as}} an IF radio, indicating its role as the [...] "intermediate frequency" [...] stage in the chain of radio electronics. Common transceiver/transverter combinations include transverters for 50 MHz, 70 MHz, 144 MHz, 222 MHz, and 432 MHz designed for use with 28 MHz IF radios, and transverters for 50 MHz, 902 MHz, 1296 MHz, 2304 MHz, 3456 MHz, 5706 MHz, and 10368 MHz designed for use with 144 MHz IF radios. Some transverter units include transmit/receive switching built into the design, whereas other units require external switching. The use of external switching is popular in applications where preamps and amplifiers are included. Many transverters are built into <b>waterproof</b> <b>enclosures</b> for installation on a radio tower or other antenna support structure to get the device {{as close as possible to}} the antenna so as to reduce signal loss in the transmission line.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} control {{cyanobacteria}} blooms with silver carp in Lake Taihu, an in situ experiment {{was carried out}} by stocking silver carp at a biomass of 35, 70, and 150 [*]g[*]m- 3 and no carp control in <b>waterproof</b> <b>enclosures.</b> Physicochemical water parameters and biomass of plankton were measured in enclosures to evaluate the suitable stocking density of silver carp for relieving internal nutrients and constraining cyanobacteria growth in Lake Taihu. It is found that the 35 [*]g[*]m- 3 silver carp group and 70 [*]g[*]m- 3 silver carp group presented lower total phosphorus, lower chlorophyll-a, and higher water transparency. Increased nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, which indicated the result of algae decline in fish presence enclosures, was attributed to decline of phosphorus. Phosphorus decline also exerted limitation on reestablish of cyanobacteria bloom. Crustacean zooplankton biomass and Microcystis biomass decreased significantly in fish presence enclosures. Silver carp could be more effective to regulate algae bloom in enclosures with dense cyanobacteria. Therefore, nonclassic manipulation is supposed to be appropriate method to get rid of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Taihu by stocking 35 to 70 [*]g[*]m- 3 silver carp in application...|$|R
