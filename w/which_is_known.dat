Some of these birds include California least tern, least Bell's vireo, southwestern willow flycatcher, California gnatcatcher, and western snowy plover.

5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} macaw have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on the Caribbean islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains: the Cuban macaw, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> only from subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>known</b> from subfossils and reports. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both in historic times by Europeans and natives, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; {{it is also possible that}} they were escaped or feral foreign macaws that had been transported to the islands. All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times. The identity of these macaws is only likely to be further resolved through fossil finds and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E
