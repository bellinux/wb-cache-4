The investigation is completed based on the finite volume numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, in the formulation, expressing the flow field of the two phases, liquid and gas, coupled with the volume of fluid (VOF) method for tracking the liquid-gas interface. And three-dimensional simulations are used to investigate the mechanisms of coalescence and separation of the droplets at difference <b>Weber</b> <b>numbers.</b> The model and method are validated by comparison with available experimental data for the temporal movement of the impinging droplet.

40|$|We present {{experiments}} on the instability and fragmentation of volumes of heavier liquid released into lighter immiscible liquids. We {{focus on the}} regime defined by small Ohnesorge numbers, density ratios of order one, and variable <b>Weber</b> <b>numbers.</b> The observed stages in the fragmentation process include deformation of the released fluid by either Rayleigh-Taylor instability or vortex ring roll-up and destabilization, formation of filamentary structures, capillary instability, and drop formation. At low and intermediate <b>Weber</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{a wide variety of}} fragmentation regimes is identified. Those regimes depend on early deformations, which mainly result from a competition between the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and the roll-up of a vortex ring.

40|$|A smooth {{circular}} moving liquid sheet {{is formed}} by the head-on impingement of two equal laminar water jets. We subject such a liquid sheet to uniform laminar air flow from one side such that the direction of air velocity is perpendicular to the liquid sheet. The pressure of the moving air deforms the liquid sheet giving rise to an open water bell. The water bell is symmetric suggesting that the gas flow around the bell is also symmetric and that the gravitational force is negligible. We have captured {{the shape of the}} water bells for varying air flow rates and for varying <b>Weber</b> <b>numbers,</b> and compared the measurements with theoretical predictions obtained from a force balance involving liquid inertia, surface tension, and pressure difference across the sheet. The pressure exerted by the gas phase on the front and the rear surface of the deformed liquid sheet is obtained from known results of flow past flat circular discs. The predicted steady state shapes match well with the measurements at low <b>Weber</b> <b>numbers</b> but differences are observed at high <b>Weber</b> <b>numbers,</b> where the sheet flaps and is no longer smooth. Interestingly, the shape predicted by assuming a constant pressure difference equal to the stagnation pressure over the whole of the front face of the sheet and free stream value over the whole of the rear face yields nearly identical results suggesting that an open water bell is similar to a closed water bell in that, to a good approximation, the pressure on either sides of the water bell is homogeneous.

A rectangular test section, 6 " x 6 " x 14 " tall, made out of half-inch thick Lexan was used. Images of the annular jet were acquired using a high-speed camera.

The preferential spreading inversely scales with the pitch at a given <b>Weber</b> <b>number.</b> In this case, the outcome is no bouncing (NB); however, this changes at larger pitch or <b>Weber</b> <b>number.</b> Under these conditions, the following outcomes are obtained as function of the pitch and <b>Weber</b> <b>number</b> - droplet completely bounces off the surface (CB), bouncing occurs with droplet breakup (BDB) or no bouncing due to Cassie to Wenzel wetting transition (NBW). In BDB and NBW, the liquid penetrates the grooves partially or completely beneath the droplet due to the wetting transition. The former results in droplet breakup alongside bouncing while the latter suppresses the bouncing.
