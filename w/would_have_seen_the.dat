5|$|Written by Phil Ford. Planned as an {{animated}} Halloween special for a 2011 broadcast. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> return of former series regular Maria Jackson {{and her father}} Alan who had since moved to the USA.|$|E
5|$|Written by Russell T. Davies. Planned for {{the sixth}} series, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> return of former Doctor Who {{companion}} Ace and explained how Ace left the Doctor and {{what had happened to}} her since then.|$|E
50|$|The Victoria Palace was {{the first}} part of a project that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> later <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} of a pier.|$|R

5|$|Written by Brian Finch. The scripts for the two-part story were {{commissioned}} as Livanthian on 14 August 1983. It was later adapted by Paul Finch (Brian's son) for Big Finish as a late {{addition to their}} The Lost Stories series in January 2010. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Doctor arriving in medieval times.|$|E
5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. A story idea {{considered}} for the fourth series, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> character of Trinity Wells, an American news anchor previously featured in Doctor Who, investigating a series of strange events occurring in Ealing and surrounding Sarah Jane.|$|E
5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{planned for}} the fourth series, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> return of UNIT, as they, along with Sarah Jane, {{investigated}} a mysterious cold effecting residents of Bannerman Road. This episode would have ended with the revelation that the Doctor had caused it.|$|E
5000|$|Benjamin West. This {{painting}} was displayed in Paris between 1794 and 1801 and Broc <b>would</b> <b>have</b> certainly <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> piece. It is currently kept at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{sweet to}} believe I could inspire you. But I know--and you know--that if I {{had not been}} here you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> through <b>the</b> {{engineering}} problem just the same... Now, be honest." ...|$|R
60|$|Had {{his eyes}} been open he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> through <b>the</b> rapidly-vanishing gloom a long, low, black line which half encircled the two crafts and {{told that they}} were running into a harbor or bay.|$|R
5|$|Universities also placed highly on her {{education}} agenda. Legislation {{which would have}} been voted on in November 2010 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> introduction of a national universities regulator; however, this was delayed until 2011 following criticisms from the hig{{her education}} sector. It was also announced by her government that legislation to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency would also be introduced early 2011.|$|E
5|$|Aldwych is {{a closed}} {{station on the}} London Underground, located in the City of Westminster in Central London. It was opened in 1907 with the name Strand, after the street on which it is located, and was the {{terminus}} of the short Piccadilly line branch from Holborn that was {{a relic of the}} merger of two railway schemes. The station building is close to the Strand's junction with Surrey Street, near Aldwych. During its lifetime, the branch {{was the subject of a}} number of unrealised extension proposals that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> tunnels through the station extended southwards, usually to Waterloo.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Spain's General Francisco Franco briefly {{considered}} a naval building program after seizing {{power in the}} Spanish Civil War. Franco concluded several agreements with the Italian government that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> building of four Littorio-class battleships in Spain. The Italians promised to provide all necessary technical and material support {{for the construction of}} the ships. The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and enlarge the existing shipyards in Spain, so that they could handle a vessel as large as the Littorio class. The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II, {{and as a result of}} limited Spanish industrial capacity.|$|E
60|$|As {{the night}} was dark Everingham could see nothing of His Eminence's {{expression}} of face. If he <b>had,</b> he probably <b>would</b> only <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> same mask of polite blandness which the Cardinal usually wore.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A staunch {{supporter}} of the veneration of saints, Ibn Qudamah <b>would</b> <b>have</b> frequently <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque in his native Damascus, where Zaynab bint Ali (d. 684) is venerated as the city's patron-saint ...|$|R
6000|$|If it {{had been}} lighter, Cicely <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that <b>the</b> Queen was not pleased at the inquiry, but she only heard the answer from Jean's bed, [...] "Hout no, I wad she knew nought of thae brands. How should she?" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{character}} that the player controlled would change as they progressed through the game. The creators sought {{to have the}} player control Spock {{during one of the}} Vulcan's mind melds. The ending of the game <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> player control Kirk, Spock and Chekov in an attempt to stop the titular superweapon. The interface for the game revolved around a menu which appears after the mouse button is held down while the cursor is hovering over an object. This was to prevent the need for controls to be shown on screen at all times, {{in a manner similar to}} LucasArts games of that period.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, pre-production {{began again}} {{on a film}} with a treatment called Planet of the Titans and subsequent script produced by British writers Chris Bryant and Allan Scott {{with the intention of}} keeping costs down by filming in the United Kingdom. There were difficulties in ensuring that both William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy were signed to the film as Shatner's deal with Paramount had expired and Nimoy was concerned with unauthorized merchandising. Philip Kaufman was signed up to direct, after several others were asked first. The plot <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> crew investigating the homeworld of the mythical Titans, and in escaping through a black hole are hurled into the prehistoric past where they teach early man how to make fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{suitability}} {{of the prison}} was finally brought to a head at the 1821 assizes in York, when an official complaint was made and an investigation begun. The decision was taken to purchase Clifford's Tower and the Waud house, {{with the aim of}} demolishing them both to make room for a new, more modern prison. Sydney Smith, the famous wit, writer and vicar of Foston-le-Clay, successfully led a campaign to save Clifford's Tower, emphasising the historic importance of the location for the surrounding city. An alternative proposal, put forward by architect Robert Wallace, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> conversion of Clifford's Tower back into a habitable building to form the hub of a radial prison design, but this was turned down.|$|E
60|$|Had {{she watched}} she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been surprised. She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that <b>the</b> {{pedestrian}} on coming up made {{straight for the}} arched doorway: that as he paused with his hand upon the latch the lamplight fell upon the face of Henchard.|$|R
60|$|Had {{the farmer}} {{narrowly}} watched the pile {{when he went}} to close <b>the</b> door, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> besides <b>the</b> familiar twine of smoke from its summit, a quivering of the air around the mass, showing that a considerable heat had arisen inside.|$|R
5000|$|He drew an enraged Imre Thököly in oriental garb {{behind bars}} (though it is {{unlikely}} that Mitelli <b>would</b> ever <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian rebel and Ottoman sympathiser as a prisoner in person). The Ottoman menace was still alive for Christian in this era.|$|R
5|$|Written by Johnny Byrne, a plot outline {{for this}} story, {{also known as}} The Place of Serenity, was {{submitted}} to the production office by Byrne in July 1983. The two-part story <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Doctor visit the planet Serenity, {{which is part of}} the same union that Traken belonged to. The rulers of Serenity are assisted by a computer known as Prophecy and the villains of the piece, Auga and Mura, are attempting to overthrow the rulers. It was later adapted by Jonathan Morris for Big Finish as part of their The Lost Stories series in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Six {{versions}} of the 8-foot high vault were built, each with specific uses. One of the vaults was a façade built onto {{the front of a}} semitruck and was used for filming close shots of the vault destroying street cars. Another vault was a reinforced, four-wheel self-drive vehicle that was connected to 30-foot cables and dragged through the streets of San Juan by the two stunt Dodge Chargers. The four-ton vault was driven by stunt driver Henry Kingi, who had to wear a temperature controlled suit to compensate for the temperatures within that could exceed 100 degrees. A scene where the vault tumbled as the cars rounded a corner was a practical effect, and the result was more violent than the filmmakers had anticipated. Over 200 vehicles were destroyed by the vault during filming. Several stunts had to be cut including a final scene that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> vault hanging {{over the edge of the}} Teodoro Moscoso Bridge. This stunt was abandoned when it was determined that even the powerful Chargers would not be able to support the vault's weight.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and how they were able to determine the new route selected.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{made the}} best of his way from the doomed premises; while Kenyon--who <b>would</b> willingly <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> tower crumble down before his eyes, on condition of Hilda's safety--determined, late as it was, to attempt ascertaining if she were in her dove-cote.|$|R
50|$|Example: If {{the radiant}} {{was at an}} average {{altitude}} of 30&deg; during the observation period, the observer's hourly rate {{will need to be}} divided by 0.5 (sin 30&deg;) to know how many meteors they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> if <b>the</b> radiant was at the zenith.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of 10 hours, American viewers will be shown {{approximately}} three hours of advertisements, twice what they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in <b>the</b> 1960s. If a 1960s show is rerun today, the content may be edited by nine minutes {{to make room for}} the extra advertisements.|$|R
5|$|The studies {{looked at}} {{minimizing}} required {{modifications to the}} Gemini spacecraft. Three docking methods were considered. The first was use of the existing docking system used on Gemini-Agena missions. This would have allowed the mission to be accomplished with little modification to the Gemini spacecraft needed, however crew transfer {{could only have been}} accomplished by means of an Extra-vehicular activity (EVA). Changes that would have been required included strengthening the nose, installing two solid rockets to be used for a separation burn, adding the necessary equipment to perform the transfer EVA, and providing provisions for flight to and from the station. The number of retro-rockets would have been increased from four to six. A second method <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft dock in the same way, but after docking, the spacecraft would be swung round and attached {{to the side of the}} space station. A tunnel would then have been placed over the Gemini's hatches, allowing the crew to transfer to the station without performing an EVA. Some modifications to the hatches would have been required. The final proposed docking method was to use a port mounted on the rear of the equipment module, which would have allowed the crew to transfer directly between the spacecraft and space station, through the docking port.|$|E
5|$|The Avon then {{flows through}} Bathford, {{where it is}} joined by the Bybrook River, and Bathampton where it passes under the Bathampton Toll Bridge. It is joined by the Lam Brook at Lambridge in Bath and then passes under Cleveland and Pulteney Bridges and over the weir. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine, owner of the Coalbrookdale Ironworks, with Henry Goodridge as the architect, {{on the site of}} a Roman ferry crossing. Named after the 3rd Duke of Cleveland, it spans the River Avon at Bathwick, and enabled further {{development}} of Georgian Bath to take place {{on the south side of}} the river. It was designed by architect Henry Goodridge to take the traffic of his day, horse-drawn vehicles and pedestrians, and was constructed using Bath Stone and a cast iron arched span. Pulteney Bridge was completed in 1773 and is designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. The bridge was designed by Robert Adam, whose working drawings are preserved in the Sir John Soane's Museum, and is one of only four bridges in the world with shops across the full span on both sides. It is named after Frances Pulteney, heiress in 1767 of the Bathwick estate across the river from Bath. Pulteney approached the brothers Robert and James Adam with his new town in mind, but Robert Adam then became involved in the design of the bridge. In his hands the simple construction envisaged by Pulteney became an elegant structure lined with shops. Adam had visited both Florence and Venice, where he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Ponte Vecchio and the Ponte di Rialto. But Adam's design more closely followed Andrea Palladio's rejected design for the Rialto. Pulteney Bridge stood for less than 20 years in the form that Adam created. In 1792 alterations to enlarge the shops marred the elegance of the façades. Floods in 1799 and 1800 wrecked the north side of the bridge, which had been constructed with inadequate support. It was rebuilt by John Pinch the elder, surveyor to the Pulteney estate, in a less ambitious version of Adam's design. 19th century shopkeepers altered windows, or cantilevered out over the river as the fancy took them. The western end pavilion on the south side was demolished in 1903 for road widening and its replacement was not an exact match. In 1936 the bridge became scheduled as a national monument, with plans being made for the restoration of the original façade. The restoration was completed in time for the Festival of Britain in 1951, with further work being carried out in 1975. Bath and North East Somerset council have discussed plans to ban vehicles from the bridge and turn it into a pedestrianised zone, however it remains open to buses and taxis.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, a {{proposed}} merger {{that had been}} months in the pipeline with Canadian Pacific was abandoned abruptly. The proposed merger <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> joining of two companies worth over $20 billion each.|$|E
60|$|This defeat cut closer {{into the}} Judge's life than {{anything}} {{that had come to}} him since the death of his son. If Bradley had not been so blind in his selfish suffering he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> how <b>the</b> Judge <b>had</b> aged and saddened since the morning.|$|R
