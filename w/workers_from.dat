5|$|Nauru had {{residents}} as of July , {{making it}} the second smallest sovereign state after Vatican City. The population was previously larger, but in 2006 1,500people left the island during a repatriation of immigrant <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by wide-scale reductions-in-force in the phosphate mining industry. It is the least-populated country in Oceania.|$|E
5|$|Paris grew in {{population}} from about 400,000 in 1640 to 650,000 in 1780.

5|$|The long blocks {{along the}} avenues make the walk {{as long as}} 20 minutes to the westernmost parts of the area.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued at 0900UTC for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti from Port-au-Prince to the Dominican border. This advisory was upgraded {{the next morning}} to a {{tropical storm}} warning and a hurricane watch, and that night was further upgraded to a hurricane warning. The Haitian coastal authority advised all small craft to stay in port, while at Port-au-Prince, all flights to southern Haiti from Toussaint Louverture International Airport were canceled. More than 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying areas and <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> World Vision again pre-positioned relief supplies.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2001 census, 96% of the {{population}} was White British, and 2.1% non-white (mainly of British Asian origin). Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland; though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed immigrant <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to other regions of the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square before it is re-opened to the public the following morning. Few traces of the previous night's celebration remain after the cleanup process is completed: following the 2013–14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that by 8:00a.m., it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square, using 190 <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ben Tillman, his mother, and his wounded brother James (who died in 1866) {{worked to}} rebuild Chester plantation. They signed the plantation's freedmen as workers. They were {{confronted with the}} {{circumstance}} of several men refusing {{to work for them}} and legally leaving the plantation. From 1866 to 1868, Ben Tillman went with several <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> the plantation to Florida, where a new cotton-planting belt had been established. The Tillmans purchased land there. Tillman was unsuccessful in Florida—after two marginal years, the 1868 crop was destroyed by caterpillars.|$|E

5|$|Attempts {{to import}} <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> Myanmar and Bangladesh have failed. Indonesian {{president}} Joko Widodo has reportedly {{said that he}} considers the export of domestic labour a national embarrassment, pledging that his government will end the practice. In February 2015 there were 331,989 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, of which 166,743 were from the Philippines – an increase of 7,000 from the previous year, {{with the number of}} Indonesians remaining static.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s and {{increased}} prosperity on the mainland, Chinese domestic workers were dominant. Until the 1990s, workers then came {{primarily from the}} Philippines; the percentage is now shifting from Philippine workers to Indonesian and other nationalities. During the 1990s Indonesia and Thailand followed the Filipino model of labour export to deal with domestic economic crises, and Hong Kong families began hiring <b>workers</b> <b>from</b> those countries as well. The Indonesians provided competition, since those workers were often prepared to accept half the minimum wage.|$|E
