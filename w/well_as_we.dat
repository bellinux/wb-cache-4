We would use those same cards when figuring out stories for the series." [...] Later, Spotnitz noted that the cards were also in his handwriting [...] "because the prop guy couldn’t do it as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could because that’s really the way we did it. It’s a very emotional love story and it’s really about our love for these characters as writers". The writers eventually settled on the title of [...] "Milagro," [...] which means miracle in Spanish.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things have not gone as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|E
500|$|Phillips {{claimed the}} Dexter staff {{did not know}} how the finale would {{conclude}} until late in the season, but Phillips said Rita's death began to feel inevitable as the story evolved. [...] However, Julie Benz said she had been told John Lithgow knew about it {{from the beginning of the}} season. Phillips said the staff felt obligated to do more than simply kill the Trinity Killer in the final episode, especially because he felt the death of the third season antagonist (played by Jimmy Smits) was not handled [...] "as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could have". The writers discussed the idea of having Debra find out about Dexter's secret life, but it was decided they could not anticipate how drastically the series would be changed by that revelation. Benz heard rumors from David Zayas that her character would be killed in the episode, but she was not officially notified until late September, when the producers held a meeting with her the day before the season finale script was distributed to the cast. She said, [...] "It was a tough meeting. In a bizarre way, it felt like a scene from Defending Your Life." [...] Benz was unhappy about the news but she handled it professionally.

500|$|By {{the middle}} of August 1797, after six weeks of {{constant}} easterly winds that kept his ships trapped in their harbour, De Winter decided that an attempt to join the French at Brest as {{the first stage of}} an invasion of Ireland was impractical and he abandoned the plan. In part this decision was due to the strength of Duncan's reconstituted fleet, which had increased to 17 ships of the line with the addition of the vessels returned from the Nore. Duncan's men were also better trained and more experienced than their Dutch counterparts, having spent considerably longer at sea and having been taught to fire three rounds a minute to the Dutch two. In addition to his concerns about the proficiency of his men, De Winter was also worried about their loyalty: the dominion of France over the Batavian Republic and the country's enforced participation in distant theatres of warfare were unpopular among the Dutch people. Although De Winter was an avowed republican, who had fought in the French Army against the Netherlands between 1793 and 1795, support for the House of Orange remained strong among the Dutch population and with the fleet's sailors. Wolfe Tone wrote in frustration that [...] "The destiny of Europe might have been changed for ever [...] [...] [...] the great occasion is lost, and we must do as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can." ...|$|E

500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us with an expression that suggests he knows as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E

They were found guilty of treason. Roland Freisler, head judge of the court, sentenced them to death. The three were executed the same day by guillotine at Stadelheim Prison. All three were noted for the courage with which they faced their deaths, particularly Sophie, who remained firm despite intense interrogation, and intimidation by Freisler during the trial. She replied: [...] "You know as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do that the war is lost. Why are you so cowardly that you won't admit it?"

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to prove their status as serious musicians, Venom {{recorded}} At War with Satan in 1984. The epic 20-minute title track, with substantial progressive rock influences, took up the first side of the LP. The B-side {{was focused on the}} rapid-fire, three-minute [...] "scorchers" [...] Venom were known for, including [...] "Stand Up And Be Counted". A live video, The Seventh Date of Hell: Live At Hammersmith Odeon, was also released that year. In 1985, Venom released their fourth studio album, Possessed, which was not as successful as their previous albums. By this time Venom had released several singles (Warhead, Die Hard and Manitou to name a few) and live EPs (The Assault Series including Canadian Assault, American Assault and French Assault). Cronos and Abaddon appeared on the Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge video with Slayer and Exodus. Dunn then left the band to pursue a solo career. Cronos cites the Possessed album as underestimated. [...] "I don't think there's any songs that are kind of overlooked, I just think some songs maybe weren't recorded as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could have recorded them.

2500|$|Wesley's {{attitude}} toward Dryden deserves a moment's pause. In the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry" [...] {{he observed that}} a speech of Satan's in Paradise Lost is nearly equalled in Dryden's State of Innocence. Later in the same essay he credited a passage in Dryden's King Arthur with showing an improvement upon Tasso. There is no doubt as to his vast respect for the greatest living poet, but his remarks do not indicate that he ranked Dryden with Virgil, Tasso, or Milton; for he recognized as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> that the power to embellish and to imitate successfully does not constitute the highest excellence in poetry. In the Epistle to a Friend he affirmed his admiration for Dryden's matchless style, his harmony, his lofty strains, his youthful fire, and even his wit—in the main, qualities of style and expression. But by 1700 Wesley had absorbed enough of the new puritanism that was rising in England to qualify his praise; now he deprecated the looseness and indecency of the poetry, and called upon the poet to repent. One other point calls for comment. Wesley's scheme for Christian machinery in the epic, as [...] described in the [...] "Essay on Heroic Poetry", is remarkably similar to Dryden's. Dryden's {{had appeared in the}} essay on satire prefaced to his translation of Juvenal, published late in October 1692; Wesley's scheme appeared soon after June 1693.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of people have said that we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we probably need to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> should have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 July at 11:49a.m. Prince Lichnowsky {{sent the}} fourth British offer of mediation, {{this time from}} King George V as well as Grey. Lichnowsky wrote that the King desired that [...] "British-German joint participation, with the {{assistance}} of France and Italy, may be successful in mastering in the interest of peace the present extremely serious situation." [...] At 4:25p.m. on 28 July, Lichnowsky reported to Berlin that [...] "since appearance of Austrian demands nobody here believes in possibility of localizing conflict." [...] The Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, and the Private Secretary to Grey, Sir William Tyrrell, saw Grey's conference offer as [...] "the only possibility of avoiding a general war" [...] and hoped [...] "to get full satisfaction for Austria, as Serbia would be more apt to give in to the pressure of the Powers and to submit to their united will than to the threats of Austria". Tyrrell relayed Grey's view that if Serbia were invaded, [...] "world war would be inevitable". Lichnowsky in his dispatch to Berlin offered [...] "an urgent warning against believing any further in the possibility of localization [...] ". When Sir Edward Goschen, the British Ambassador in Berlin, presented Grey’s conference proposal to Jagow, the Germans totally rejected the offer. In a letter to Grey, Bethmann Hollweg stated that Germany [...] "could not summon Austria before a European court of justice in her case with Serbia". Austrian troops began to concentrate in Bosnia as a preparatory step towards invading Serbia. Falkenhayn told the German government, [...] "It has now been decided to fight the matter through, regardless of the cost," [...] and advised Bethmann Hollweg to order a German attack on Russia and France at once. Moltke supported Falkenhayn by submitting the assessment that 1914 was a [...] "singularly favourable situation" [...] for Germany to go to war as both Russia and France were not prepared whereas Germany was. Once the Russian Great Military Programme would be completed by 1917, Moltke stated that Germany {{would never be able to}} entertain the prospect of a victorious war again and so should destroy both France and Russia while it was still possible. Moltke ended his assessment that [...] "We shall never hit it again so <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> do now." [...] Jagow backed up Moltke by sending a message to Vienna telling the Austrians they must attack Serbia at once because otherwise the British peace plan might be accepted.|$|E
