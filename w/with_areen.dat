40|$|Boundary {{extension}} (BE) is {{a phenomenon}} in which the boundary of a picture is reportedly extended in memory. The model known to best fit <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> is the Extension-Normalization model (intraub, 1996), which explains BE by the dual memory process. While focusing on this model, this paper reviews relevant literature dealing <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> It highlights the necessity of defining the phenomenon itself more precisely and of constructing appropriate methods, with which to measure BE. Additionally, the paper considers the possibility that, BE has multiple origins and discusses perceptual and clinical factors associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> that were not addressed in previous research...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{developing}} esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) for patients <b>with</b> Barrett's esophagus (<b>BE)</b> is approximately 0. 5 % per year. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> estimate and perceive their risk {{of developing}} EAC. DESIGN: Questionnaire study. SETTING: Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> who were undergoing surveillance endoscopy based on histologic and flow cytometric results. PATIENTS: A total of 192 patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individual patients were asked to estimate the numerical risk to develop EAC for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> in general and for themselves. How patients perceived their own risk was measured {{on a scale from}} "very small" to "very large. " RESULTS: At least 1 question was filled out by 169 patients (88 % response). Sixty percent of respondents underestimated the numerical risk for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE,</b> in general, to develop EAC, while even more patients (69 %) underestimated their own risk. Most respondents perceived their own risk as very small or small (63 %). LIMITATIONS: Risk estimations may depend on the response scale used. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> underestimated the numerical risk and perceived their {{risk of developing}} EAC as (very) low. Despite a low perceived risk, all patients in this group adhered to endoscopic surveillanc...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: GQ 1 b {{antibody}} (GQ 1 b-Ab) {{is detected}} in approximately two-thirds of sera of patients <b>with</b> Bickerstaffs encephalitis (<b>BE).</b> Whilst {{some of the}} remaining patients have antibodies to other gangliosides, many patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> are reported to be seronegative. METHODS AND RESULTS: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibody (VGKC-Ab) at high titer was detected during the diagnostic work-up of one patient <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> Sera of an additional patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and nine patients with Miller Fisher syndrome (MF) (all GQ 1 b-Ab positive) were investigated for VGKC-Ab and other anti-neuronal antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation using 125 I-dendrotoxin-VGKC and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Two patients with MF exhibited moderate titer VGKC-Abs. Regardless of positivity for VGKC or GQ 1 b antibodies, serum IgG of all patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF reacted with the molecular layer and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in a distinctive pattern. CONCLUSION: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies might be involved in some cases of BE or MF. The common staining pattern despite different antibody results suggests {{that there might be}} other, as yet unidentified, antibodies associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{evaluated}} the coexistence of bronchiectasis (BE) and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in series of patients diagnosed primarily <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the characteristics of patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> associated <b>with</b> COPD included in the Spanish Bronchiectasis Historical Registry and compare them to the remaining patients <b>with</b> non-cystic fibrosis <b>BE.</b> We conducted a multicentre observational study of historical cohorts, analysing the characteristics of 1, 790 patients who had been included in the registry between 2002 and 2011. Of these, 158 (8. 8 %) were registered as BE related to COPD and were compared to the remaining patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> of other aetiologies. Patients <b>with</b> COPD <b>were</b> mostly male, older, had a poorer respiratory function and more frequent exacerbations. There were no differences in the proportion of patients with chronic bronchial colonisation or in the isolated microorganisms. A significantly larger proportion of patients with COPD received treatment with bronchodilators, inhaled steroids and intravenous antibiotics, but there was no difference in the use of long term oral or inhaled antibiotherapy. During a follow-up period of 3. 36 years, the overall proportion of deaths was 13. 8 %. When compared to the remaining aetiologies, patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> associated <b>with</b> COPD presented the highest mortality rate. The multivariate analysis showed that the diagnosis of COPD in a patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> as a primary diagnosis increased the risk of death by 1. 77. Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> related to COPD have the same microbiological characteristics as patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> due to other aetiologies. They receive treatment with long term oral and inhaled antibiotics aimed at controlling chronic bronchial colonisation, even though the current COPD treatment guidelines do not envisage this type of therapy.

40|$|Patients with Barrett 2 ̆ 7 s {{esophagus}} (BE) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are at {{a higher}} risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). We examined this risk in two large national cohorts of patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and GERD alone and provided risk ratios comparing the risk in both cohorts. ^ This was a retrospective cohort study of US veterans <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and GERD alone diagnosed between 2003 and 2009, identified from a total of 121 Veterans 2 ̆ 7 Affairs facilities nationwide. All cases of EA were verified by detailed medical chart review. ^ We identified 29, 536 <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and 486, 676 patients with GERD who met our eligibility criteria. Most patients in both cohorts were men and white, {{with a mean age of}} 59. 8 and 61. 8 years, respectively. The incidence rate of EA in patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> was 3. 215 per 1, 000 person-years, and 0. 206 per 1, 000 person-years in patients with GERD alone. The incidence of EA in patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> increased <b>with</b> age compared to patients with GERD alone.

40|$|Background and aims: Barrett’s {{esophagus}} (BE) and colorectal neoplasms {{share similar}} risk factors. Previous {{studies have shown}} variable prevalence of colon polyps in patients <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> Our aims were to determine the prevalence and incidence of colon polyps in patients <b>with</b> <b>BE,</b> compared to those without BE. Methods: In this case-control study, the study group included patients, aged 50 – 75 years, <b>with</b> biopsy-proven <b>BE,</b> who underwent colonoscopy at Cleveland Clinic from January 2002 to December 2011. The control group consisted of age- and sex-matched patients who underwent colonoscopy and also an endoscopy with no evidence of BE {{during the same time}} period. Exclusion criteria for both groups were family- or personal previous history of colon cancer or polyps, prior colonic resection, inflammatory bowel disease and familial polyposis syndromes. Patient demographics, comorbidities, medication use and endoscopic and colonoscopic details were collected, including biopsy results. Results: A total of 519 patients were included in the study; 173 patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> in the study group and 346 without BE in the control group. Mean age at index colonoscopy was 61 8 years and 75 % of patients were male. On index colonoscopy, patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> {{were more likely to have}} polyps than controls (45 % vs 32 %, respectively; P = 0. 003). Patients underwent between one and five colonoscopies during the follow-up. On multivariate analysis—after adjusting for age, gender and diabetes—patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> were 80 % more likely to have any type of polyp, and 50 % more likely to have adenomas found during colonoscopy...|$|R
