5|$|As well as {{deflecting}} {{the solar}} wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly {{from outside the}} Solar system. (Many cosmic rays are {{kept out of the}} Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, a {{redistribution}} divided Whitlam's electorate of Werriwa in two, {{with his}} Cronulla home {{located in the}} new electorate of Hughes. Although Whitlam <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> ALP support in either division, he chose to continue standing for Werriwa and moved from Cronulla to Cabramatta. This meant even longer journeys for his older children to attend school, since neither electorate had a high school at the time, and they attended school in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Initially, de Peyster {{had been}} {{selected}} to lead {{an assault on the}} breastworks outside the city, however the night before the assault he noticed the city aflame from a signal tower and informed General Weitzel. The men of the corps then entered the city unmolested. Admiral David Farragut later claimed that de Peyster was due as much credit as he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> had he actually taken the city by storming it, because doing it without bloodshed still carried the same intent.|$|E

The high wage also meant that Nash was not required to find additional employment to cover his family's expenses, and in so doing, {{became one of the}} first fully professional Australian rules football players.|$|E
5|$|On October3, it was {{reported}} that he was retained by Boston under the reserve clause. When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed {{that he would like to}} quit pitching and play first, that is if a team would give him the opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in the pitching rotation instead. It was also likely that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> less salary playing at first.|$|E
5|$|Pending the Disney {{acquisition}} of Pixar, {{the two companies}} created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, if the acquisition fell through, {{to ensure that this}} one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels.

5|$|The Augustan History {{contains}} {{details of}} Zenobia's early life, although their credibility is doubtful. According to Augustan History, the queen's hobby {{as a child}} was hunting. Apparently not a commoner, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl. According to the Augustan History, {{in addition to her}} Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, Zenobia was reportedly fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin. Around age 14 (c. 255) she became the second wife of Odaenathus, the ras (lord) of Palmyra.|$|E
5|$|George VI's {{coronation}} at Westminster Abbey {{took place}} on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony {{in a show of}} support for her son. There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India. Rising Indian nationalism made the welcome that the royal party <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> likely to be muted at best, and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.|$|E
5|$|His cousin is fellow Dominica {{international}} footballer Jefferson Louis, {{with whom}} he was paired as Dominica's strikers in the second leg against Barbados. During his time as a semi-professional Pacquette worked as a school caretaker and a truancy officer. At his school, he participated in coaching with the sixth formers. Pacquette and his Havant & Waterlooville teammates <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> £10,000 each if they had beaten Liverpool in the FA Cup, which {{he said he would}} spend on helping his local community.

5|$|Lindemann's first gunnery officer—Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider—had {{been awarded}} the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 May 1941. Traditionally, the {{commanding}} officer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> this award before any other crew member was so honoured. This exception had been criticized by various circles in the Wehrmacht. It is thought likely that Ernst Lindemann's cousin, the former General der Kavallarie (General of the Cavalry) Georg Lindemann, intervened. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, with whom Lindemann shared a 20-year comradeship dating to {{the early days of}} the Reichsmarine, presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Mrs Lindemann on Tuesday, 6 January 1942, in Dahlem. Raeder went on to provide moral and emotional support to Lindemann's mother and widow.|$|E
5|$|To {{support the}} household, in late 1874 Coolbrith took a {{position}} as the librarian for the Oakland Library Association, a subscription library that had been established five years earlier. In 1878, the library was reformed as the Oakland Free Library, the second public library created in California under the Rogers Free Library Act (Eureka was first). Coolbrith earned a salary of $80 per month, much less than a man <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received.</b> She worked 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Her poetry suffered as a result. She published only sporadically over the next 19 years—working as Oakland's librarian was the low point of her poetic career.|$|E
5|$|Hood {{was due to}} be modernised in 1941 {{to bring}} her up to a {{standard}} {{similar to that of}} other modernised World War I-era capital ships. She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> new, lighter turbines and boilers, a secondary armament of eight twin 5.25-inch gun turrets and six octuple 2-pounder pom-poms. Her 5-inch upper armour strake would have been removed and her deck armour reinforced. A catapult would have been fitted across the deck and the remaining torpedo tubes removed. In addition the conning tower would have been removed and her bridge rebuilt. The ship's near-constant active service, resulting from her status as the Royal Navy's most battle-worthy fast capital ship, meant that her material condition gradually deteriorated, and by the mid-1930s she was in need of a lengthy overhaul.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, the U.S. Senate {{added an}} {{amendment}} to the surface transportation bill that authorized a one-year extension to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Oregon counties <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> a total of $102 million from the legislation in 2012, to be divided among all 33 counties that currently receive payments. In 2008, Oregon received $250 million from the program. The full transportation bill, including the amendment, passed the Senate by a 74–22 vote, but the U.S. House of Representatives refused to vote on the Senate bill, instead passing a three-month extension to the current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension. In July 2012, the Secure Rural Schools Act renewal amendment was included in the transportation bill approved by Congress and signed by the President. This was widely expected to be the last renewal of the program, but in September 2013, Congress passed another one-year extension to the program, though again at reduced levels.|$|E

How he acquired the cup is not known, but he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> many gifts from CharlesVI, and had both lent the king money and bought from him things such as the library of the Palais du Louvre, in the uneasy period when Charles had made peace with the English and made HenryV his heir. After {{the death of his}} brother HenryV, Bedford struggled to stem the resurgent French resistance, which was energised by Joan of Arc. He died in Normandy in 1435, leaving HenryVI as his heir.|$|E
5|$|The program used import {{subsidies}} to pump US {{dollars into the}} South Vietnamese treasury. The regimes sold these dollars to business people who held licenses to import American goods. The businessmen bought the US dollars from the Saigon treasury with their South Vietnamese piasters at half the official exchange rate; they then used this cheaply acquired American currency to import US goods. This meant that American manufacturers would still get {{the same amount of}} US currency they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> for selling their goods on the free market, while South Vietnamese importers could get twice as much goods for the same money. The piasters that the Saigon government collected from selling the US aid dollars were to be placed in a fund held by the National Bank of Vietnam, which was to be used to fund the expansion and training of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, national police and civil service.|$|E
