The hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft. Hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles, severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows. Wheat, corn, soybeans, and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage. [...] Hail is one of Canada's most expensive hazards. [...] Rarely, massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma. [...] Hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history. [...] One of the earliest known incidents occurred around the 9th century in Roopkund, Uttarakhand, India, where 200 to 600 nomads seem to have died of injuries from hail the size of cricket balls. The largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the United States fell on July 23, 2010 in Vivian, South Dakota; it measured [...] in diameter and [...] in circumference, weighing in at [...] This broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7inches diameter and 18.74inches circumference (still the greatest circumference hailstone) which fell in Aurora, Nebraska in the United States on June 22, 2003, as well as the record for <b>weight,</b> <b>set</b> by a hailstone of [...] that fell in Coffeyville, Kansas in 1970.|$|E

It was necessary to make a circuit in hopes of finding some practicable way of getting down. The guides and pioneers went on, leading the army after them, and soon got upon a glacier which lay in their way. There was fresh snow upon the surface, covering the ice and concealing the crevasses, as they are termed--that is, the great cracks and fissures which extend in the glaciers down through the body of the ice. The army moved on, trampling down the new snow, and making at first a good roadway by their footsteps; but very soon the old ice and snow began to be trampled up by the hoofs of the horses and the heavy tread of such vast multitudes of armed men. It softened to a great depth, and made the work of toiling through it an enormous labor. Besides, the surface of the ice and snow sloped steeply, and the men and beasts were continually falling or sliding down, and getting swallowed up in avalanches which their own <b>weight</b> <b>set</b> in motion, or in concealed crevasses where they sank to rise no more.|$|E

40|$|In {{operational}} networks, nodes {{are connected}} via multiple links for load sharing and redundancy. This {{is done to}} make sure that a failure of a link does not disconnect or isolate some parts of the network. However, link failures have an effect on routing, as the routers find alternate paths for the traffic originally flowing through the link which has failed. This effect is severe in case of failure of a critical link in the network, such as backbone links or the links carrying higher traffic loads. When routing is done using the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol, the original weight selection for the normal state topology may not be as efficient for the failure state. In this paper, we investigate the single link failure issue with an objective to find a <b>weight</b> <b>setting</b> which results in efficient routing in normal and failure states. We engineer Tabu Search Iterative heuristic using two different implementation strategies to solve the OSPF <b>weight</b> <b>setting</b> problem for link failure scenarios. We evaluate these heuristics and show through experimental results that both heuristics efficiently handle <b>weight</b> <b>setting</b> for the failure state.

40|$|In this project, seven {{operational}} <b>weighting</b> <b>sets</b> {{have been}} selected and have been applied to the intervention profiles of the EU 28, the World and the Netherlands, not on time series. Three sets are available for the weighting applied on midpoint level. Three sets are available for the weighting applied on endpoint level. One set is available for the integrated modelling and weighting, applied on intervention level. All <b>weighting</b> <b>sets</b> applied on midpoint level refer to interactive panel weighting, i. e. EPA, BEES, and NOGEPA. Two <b>weighting</b> <b>sets</b> applied on endpoint level refer to panel weighting, i. e. Ecoindicator 99 and LIME. One <b>weighting</b> <b>set,</b> ReCiPe damage, refers to weighting on endpoint level using damage cost based on willingness-to-pay (WtP) valuation, which is itself based on panels but usually not interactive panels. All methods have specific advantages and disadvantages, on which diverging views exist. Midpoint approaches have a clear modelling basis with mutually inconsistent elements and they rely on extensive subjective estimates in the combined further-modelling-and weighting step. Endpoint models can have a weak modelling step after the midpoint and then are conceptually similar to the valuation step in the economics oriented integrated modelling and weighting. The integrated modelling approach has some strong points in modelling (e. g. in climate modelling), but is weak in its further modelling. The valuation step {{of this approach is}} best specified, based on thoroughly tested but not unquestionable methods. The seven selected and expanded operational weighting methods have been combined into a single meta-weighting <b>set.</b> This combined <b>weighting</b> <b>set</b> can be varied as to the strength of the individual methods in determining the outcome. The application to a time series of European data suggests {{that there is not a}} wide divergence between the different weighting methods, at least as developed and applied in this report. This means that the choice of specific weighting methods may not have an overarching influence on outcomes and the combined set of meta-weights may reasonably reflect different positions in weighting. Nevertheless, this may also be linked to some of the adaptations and extrapolations across methods made in this project. JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|R
