40|$|An {{analysis}} of the choice between conduit loans and traditional whole loans in commercial mortgages. The author compares conduit and <b>whole</b> <b>loan</b> programs, and discusses their differences {{and the effects of}} information technology on the mortgage choice problem. Conduit lending produces a more volatile source of funding in posted loan rates and more stability in terms of capital availability. The specific loan program characteristics associated with conduit lending are the greater ease of accessing loan program information, faster loan closing and broader selection. The longer-run implications are that higher quality borrowers will eventually disintermediate mortgage brokers due to improvements in information technology. This suggests that there will be fewer brokers working more efficiently with a larger number of borrowers. Consequently, deep as opposed to broad service provision is the inevitable result of advancing information technology and internet-based transactions. ...|$|E

50|$|The typical {{structure}} for the securitization of commercial real estate loans is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC). A REMIC is a creation of the tax law that allows the trust to be a pass-through entity which {{is not subject to}} tax at the trust level. The CMBS transaction is structured and priced {{based on the assumption that}} it will not be subject to tax with respect to its activities; therefore, compliance with REMIC regulations is essential. CMBS has become an attractive capital source for commercial mortgage lending because the bonds backed by a pool of loans are generally worth more than the sum of the value of the <b>whole</b> <b>loans.</b> The enhanced liquidity and structure of CMBS attracts a broader range of investors to the commercial mortgage market. This value creation effect allows loans intended for securitization to be aggressively priced, benefiting Borrowers.|$|R
40|$|Asset-backed {{securities}} represent one of {{the largest}} and fastest growing financial markets. Under securitization, agents perform functions (for fees) that would alternatively be performed by a vertically integrated lender with ownership of a <b>whole</b> <b>loan.</b> We examine how outsourcing impacts performance using data on 357 commercial mortgage-backed securities deals with over 46, 000 individual loans. To alleviate agency conflicts in managing troubled loans, underwriters often sell the first-loss position to the special servicer, the party who is charged with handling delinquencies and defaults. When holding the first-loss position, special servicers appear to behave more efficiently, making fewer costly transfers of delinquent loans to special servicing, but liquidating a higher percentage of loans that are referred to special servicing. Special servicers are also more likely to own the first loss position in deals that require additional effort (deals with higher delinquencies). Market pricing reflects the existence of agency costs. Despite the apparent reduction of agency costs, the first-loss position is increasingly owned by a party other than the special servicer. We pose a number of explanations, including conflicts between junior and senior securities holders (the asset substitution problem) and risk aversion among special servicers. Consistent with asset substitution, we show that special servicers delay liquidation when they hold the first-loss position in deals with more severe delinquency problems. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{the fallout}} from {{subprime}} losses clearly demonstrates, the credit risk in res idential mortgages is large and economically significant.

The Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF) was established for this purpose in Nigeria. However the livestock sector has suffered neglect in terms much needed attention by policy makers. The activities of the Scheme regarding the livestock sector were evaluated. Secondary data between 1978 and 2002 were collected on relevant variables and analysed. Results of the analysis showed that the performance of the scheme in the last 25 years to improve and empower the financial capacity of farmers especially livestock farmers through credit facilities has not been encouraging. Of the <b>whole</b> <b>loans</b> guaranteed, less than 10 % and 20 % in terms of number and volume approved and disbursed went to the livestock sector. This is grossly inadequate to meet the provision of adequate animal protein need of Nigerians.

40|$|During the 1960 s and 1970 s, the U. S. {{government}} closely regulated the single-family {{housing finance}} system. The regulation {{manifested itself in}} a highly specialized system with four notable characteristics: portfolio restrictions against investments in corporate assets, tax inducements to invest in residential mortgages, prohibitions against investing in ARMS, and deposit rates ceilings. All were removed in the 1980 s, and, not surprisingly, the housing finance system changed markedly. Between early 1982 and 1989, two-fifths of all new loans had adjustable, not fixed, rates, and savings and loans reduced their holdings of FRMs (both <b>whole</b> <b>loans</b> and mortgage pass-throughs) by 15 to 20 percent. Moreover, the fraction of conventional FRM originations that have been pooled into pass-throughs rose from less than one-twentieth before 1981 to over one-half after 1985. With the opportunity of borrowers to shift to lower coupon ARMs when rates rise and with {{the integration of the}} home mortgage market with capital markets generally, one would expect that the U.

40|$|This paper {{sets forth}} a simple method for {{estimating}} the credit risk economic capital associated with securitization exposures, which {{are defined as}} credit exposures created by repackaging the cash flows {{from a pool of}} assets into various tranches or asset-backed securities. Our approach is motivated by the need for an effective and easily implemented regulatory capital rule for securitization exposures. Consequently, it is designed to be fully compatible with the model underpinning the Basel Committee’s (2001) proposed Internal Ratings-Based Approach (“IRBA”) to regulatory capital requirements against <b>whole</b> <b>loans</b> and other bank assets. Cost-effective application {{to a wide variety of}} securitizations and participating institutions dictates that our approach be parsimonious, in the sense of using minimal information on the contents of the securitized pool and on the contractual design of the securitization, as well as computationally tractable. The role played by securitizations in unraveling the 1988 Capital Accord demonstrates the need for a regulatory capital regime that is based on an internally consistent approach to quantifying portfolio credit risk. Since 1988, securitizations have become a major funding vehicle and portfolio risk management tool for banks. Concurrently, however, banks also have learned to exploit inconsistencies within the current Accord, under which credit risks assumed through securitizatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Using an actuarial model, {{we examine}} the delay in credit loan payments. It is assumed that the default arrival process follows the Poisson process and the loss sizes {{are assumed to be}} {{independent}} and identical exponential. We also assume that the delay between default occurrence and partially (or fully) recovered payment is an independent identical exponential random variable. For the recovery rate, we assume that it follows Beta distribution. Using the relationship between the shot noise process and accumulated/discounted aggregate losses process and applying the piecewise deterministic Markov processes theory, we obtain the explicit expressions of the expected value of losses occurred and the expected value of part (or <b>whole)</b> of <b>loan</b> paid with the delay. Based on these first moments, we define and predict the hidden cost of delay in a credit loan portfolio. Numerical examples are also provided based on these explicit expressions of the hidden cost of delay in a credit loan portfolio. Key words: Delay in credit loan portfolio; accumulated/discounted aggregate losses; shot noise process; piecewise deterministic Markov process; the expectation of partial (or <b>whole)</b> payment of <b>loans</b> with the delay; the predictor of the hidden cost of delay...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the factors driving the borrower’s decision to terminate commercial mortgage contracts with the lender through either prepayment or default. Using loan-level data, we estimate prepayment and default functions in a proportional hazard framework with competing risks, allowing us to ac-count for unobserved heterogeneity. Under a strict definition of mortgage de-fault, we do not find {{evidence to support the}} existence of unobserved hetero-geneity. However, when the definition of mortgage default is relaxed, we do find some evidence of two distinctive borrower groups. Our results suggest that the values of implicit put and call options drive default and prepayment actions in a nonlinear and interactive fashion. Prepayment and default risks are found to be convex in the intrinsic value of call and put options, respec-tively. Consistent with the joint nature of the two underlying options, high value of the put/call option is found to significantly reduce the call/put risk since the borrower forfeits both options by exercising one. Variables that proxy for cash flow and credit conditions as well as ex post bargaining powers are also found to have significant influence upon the borrower’s mortgage termination decision. A better understanding of commercial mortgage termination through default or prepayment has important academic as well as practical implications. With their relatively simple financial structure—one underlying property and one collateralized debt obligation—commercial mortgages provide an ideal eco-nomic setting to test the rationality of investors and the empirical applicability of contingent claim models. From a practitioner’s perspective, the identifica-tion of factors relating to default and/or prepayment help efficiently deter-mine not only the appropriate spreads in the underwriting of <b>whole</b> <b>loans,</b> bu...|$|R
