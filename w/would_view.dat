5|$|An {{episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season was filmed and {{broadcast}} live, twice, {{on the evening}} of October 14, 2010. The two separate recordings resulted in a live telecast of the episode to American viewers on both the West and East Coasts, to ensure both <b>would</b> <b>view</b> a live performance. Filmed in front of a live audience, the episode aired at 8:30pm EDT and PDT on NBC. A ratings success, the episode was also met with positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield {{attempted}} to defuse public concern by staging the London {{opening of the}} comedy Prince Karl as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning that critics <b>would</b> <b>view</b> it {{as an attempt to}} obtain favorable publicity for the production. Although some press reports suggested that Mansfield stopped performing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in London because of the murders, financial reasons are more likely. Despite widespread publicity due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England. In December they performed Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and other plays in Liverpool and Derby, then continued to other cities and performed other plays.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1943 {{national}} elections in French Mandatory Syria, the French authorities attempted {{to negotiate with}} Quwatli {{as head of the}} National Bloc to issue a treaty that guaranteed an independent Syria's alignment and close military cooperation with France, in return for French help in securing Quwatli's election to the presidency. Quwatli refused, believing the Syrian people <b>would</b> <b>view</b> such negotiations negatively. He was also confident that the National Bloc would win the elections regardless of French support. Quwatli did win the vote, becoming Syria's president on 17 August 1943.|$|E

5|$|The {{post-production}} {{schedule for}} Up in the Air was shorter than Jason Reitman's previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas an editing deadline is usually from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman {{was involved in}} post-production while shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he <b>would</b> <b>view</b> them. He flew home every weekend {{to work with her}} for a few hours on Saturday or Sunday in order to stay on schedule.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the Doctor, Jack {{is more of a}} conventional action hero, as well as outwardly flirtatious and capable of acts which the Doctor <b>would</b> <b>view</b> as less than noble. In the programme's narrative, Jack begins as a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century, who comes to travel with the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose (Billie Piper). As a consequence of his death and resurrection in the 2005 Doctor Who finale, Jack becomes immortal and is stranded on 19th century Earth. There he becomes a member of Torchwood, a British organization dedicated to combating alien threats. He spends over a century waiting to reunite with the Doctor, over which time he becomes Torchwood's leader. Eventually, he reunites with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) for several appearances in Doctor Who. Aspects of the character's backstoryboth prior to meeting the Doctor, and during his many decades living on Earthare gradually revealed over Torchwood (and to a lesser extent, Doctor Who) through the use of flashback scenes and expository dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Rohayah (also {{known by}} the pseudonyms Nyonya Eni and Siti Hayati; {{abbreviated}} Yah) is Tono's childhood friend and later lover, {{as well as a}} popular kroncong singer. After Tono, who is three years her elder, graduated from elementary school, Yah was forcibly married to a man twenty years her senior and brought from Bandung to Palembang. After escaping him and returning to Bandung, where she found that her parents had died, she moved to Batavia and became a prostitute; she also became a popular kroncong singer under the pseudonym Siti Hayati. When she discovers that Tono has become a doctor in Batavia, she pretends to be a patient and seduces him. Although the two fall deeply in love, Yah decides to leave Tono and move to New Caledonia because she feels that society <b>would</b> <b>view</b> the doctor poorly if he married a former prostitute.|$|E

50|$|In many societies, for a {{woman to}} date or have boyfriends - even if refraining from full sexual {{intercourse}} - <b>would</b> already be <b>viewed</b> as a violation of traditional values. (See technical virginity; honor killing.) On the other hand, lesbian sexual activity would not normally be an object of concern. Meanwhile, a rape victim <b>would</b> be <b>viewed</b> as having lost her virginity by force.|$|R

25|$|The Greek {{philosophers}} {{were the}} earliest Western thinkers to address chance and randomness. Around 400 BC, Democritus presented {{a view of}} the world as governed by the unambiguous laws of order and considered randomness as a subjective concept that only originated from the inability of humans {{to understand the nature of}} events. He used the example of two men who would send their servants to bring water at the same time to cause them to meet. The servants, unaware of the plan, <b>would</b> <b>view</b> the meeting as random.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009 case R. v. Grant, the Supreme Court of Canada {{created a}} new test to {{determine}} when the administration of justice has been brought into disrepute (replacing the 1987 test in R. v. Collins). The Grant test lists three factors the courts must consider: (1) {{the seriousness of the}} Charter-infringing conduct (focusing on a review of how society <b>would</b> <b>view</b> the actions of the state), (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused (focusing on a review of how the state's actions affected the accused), and (3) society's interests in the adjudication of the case on its merits (focusing on a review of the importance and reliability of the evidence).|$|E

The treatment group in the unpaired design <b>would</b> be <b>viewed</b> as analogous to the post-treatment measurements in the paired design, and the control group <b>would</b> be <b>viewed</b> as analogous to the pre-treatment measurements. We could then calculate the sample means within the treated and untreated groups of subjects, and compare these means to each other.|$|R
25|$|From 1906 until mid-1914, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom was {{the party}} seen as most {{supportive}} of women's suffrage—the right {{of women to}} vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organised to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women. In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict. Millicent Garrett Fawcett of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics <b>would</b> <b>view</b> the women with greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting {{them the right to}} vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} boycott {{activities}} intensified, and gained {{a new and}} highly powerful ally — the Soviet Union. During Israel's early years it was seen by the USSR as a potential ally due to the significant socialist aspirations advocated by its founders and applied in its conception. The Soviet Union {{was one of the}} first countries to recognize Israel de jure upon its establishment in 1948. However, as Israel's democratic nature became evident and its ties with Western states were solidified, the Soviet Union <b>would</b> <b>view</b> Israel as an enemy in the West vs. East dichotomy of the Cold War. Instead, the Soviet Union would form an alliance with the revolutionary Arab regimes, Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and later in the decade Iraq, united in anti-American and anti-Israel political objectives. The clout of the Soviet Union gave the boycott new international legitimacy and guaranteed anti-boycott resolutions a veto at the UN Security Council. The tertiary boycott, formerly ignored as an affront to international trade relations, became enforceable through the sheer political and economic power of the Soviet Union. In 1958, Air France capitulated to Arab League demands after being denied overflight and landing rights in Arab states for eighteen months due to its alleged investment in Israeli development projects.|$|E

500|$|When other Nazi leaders urged Hitler {{to leave}} Berlin and {{establish}} a new centre of resistance in the National Redoubt in Bavaria, Goebbels opposed this, arguing for a heroic last stand in Berlin. His family (except for Magda's son Harald, who {{had served in the}} Luftwaffe and been captured by the Allies) moved into their house in Berlin to await the end. He and Magda may have discussed suicide and the fate of their young children in a long meeting on the night of 27 January. He knew how the outside world <b>would</b> <b>view</b> the criminal acts committed by the regime, and had no desire to subject himself to the [...] "debacle" [...] of a trial.

500|$|Biller {{incorporated}} the Vidiians into the episode, believing that their technology would present a conceivable {{method by which}} Torres could be separated. The Vidiians were featured in an earlier season one episode titled [...] "". Biller explained that Klingons were shown to be more resistant [...] to disease than other species in previous Star Trek installments, and reasoned that a Vidiians scientist <b>would</b> <b>view</b> them as a promising way to discover a cure for the disease. Biller {{said that he had}} difficulty writing Sulan as a sympathetic villain. He looked to Gene Roddenberry's approach to portraying antagonists in the Star Trek franchise: [...] "liens should never be patently evil. They may have a set of values that differ from our own, but be careful of making them mustache-twirling villains." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's moral choices do {{not have}} any {{connection}} to gameplay, as the team feared that players <b>would</b> <b>view</b> them as gameplay mechanics and disconnect them from the story. The consequences of each choice were designed to be unpredictable to create tension for the player. Both approaches are applied to let players make decisions based on their own will instead of [...] "gaming the system". Williams also added that they attempted to make violence in the game [...] "meaningful". While the game's basic premise is to have the Delta Squad rescue civilians in Dubai, the game by its nature tasks players to kill with their firearms. Therefore, the team added a lot of dialogue to justify and rationalize the characters' violent actions, creating complex plot points, drama and climaxes. The team also added conversations between enemy soldiers in an attempt to humanize them.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{presence}} of pro-American {{figures in the}} cabinet and Quwatli's initially warm ties with the US, {{relations between the two}} countries began to unravel amid the nascent Cold War and the view that Quwatli was becoming a detriment to US interests in the region. Quwatli developed close relations with the SCP and its head Khalid Bakdash, which was a contributing factor to the US Congress's rejection of Quwatli's arms request for the Syrian Army in late 1947. Quwatli also rejected the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline in Syria (to connect the oilfields of Saudi Arabia to Lebanon). Quwatli feared construction of the pipeline would threaten the mostly British-owned Iraq Petroleum Company and upset the UK, as well as the Syrian public, who he believed <b>would</b> <b>view</b> the project [...] "as a new form of indirect foreign economic control", according to Moubayed. US support for Israel, particularly under Truman, and Quwatli's adamant opposition to Zionism was a further source of tension.|$|E
500|$|Locke {{knocking}} Boone out [...] "marked a huge turning point" [...] in {{the development}} of his character. According to the writers, there was huge debate over whether Locke was good or bad; his decision {{was meant to be a}} shocking moment for viewers, since they thought people <b>would</b> <b>view</b> it as a sign that Locke was turning bad. This was characteristic of the series– the writers liked to depict a character in a certain way so that one's opinion would be made up, then they would reveal something else that would change one's mind. Locke's scene with Sayid was introduced late into production, because the episode was running short and Locke did not have scenes without Boone; Sayid's scene with Jack was also added later. Many future plot points are introduced into the episode, such as Sayid observing a magnetical anomaly, main characters crossing paths (Sawyer is being arrested in the police station where Boone is filing a complaint) and Michael's box of drawings, which sets up the following episode, [...] "Special".|$|E

[...] Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the Coventry University Business School, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but [...] "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." [...] He said, [...] "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." [...] David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the United States, warned: [...] "I would say a wise owner [...] <b>would</b> <b>view</b> his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you really do want to allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull." ...|$|E
