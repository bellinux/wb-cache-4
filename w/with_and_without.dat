5|$|The {{observation}} {{of a total}} solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity.

The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.|$|E
