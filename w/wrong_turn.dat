5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on July 20, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. Dean remained behind and assisted the US troops in evacuating the city until the last convoy was ready to leave Taejon. As the last convoy of troops moved out of the city and fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot. In the ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> and was separated from the rest of the American forces.|$|E
5|$|A {{young boy}} named Cooper and his girlfriend, Amber, are seen searching frantically for {{civilisation}} after {{they take a}} <b>wrong</b> <b>turn.</b> They are caught in a storm and head to a nearby mansion to seek shelter. Once outside, Cooper checks his map, but is unaware that someone is watching. Baron von Ghoul, the game's main antagonist, looks down from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and Amber. Amber is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the Ghouly Mansion, with Cooper in pursuit. Once inside the mansion, Cooper realises that Amber {{is nowhere to be}} seen in the Grand Hallway. Crivens, the mansion's butler, tells him to go to the archives where Amber is held. On the way, a huge group of boxing skeletons challenge Cooper to a boxing match, with Cooper emerging victorious. Upon reaching the archives, Cooper finds Amber being held hostage by a mad scientist named Dr. Krackpot. Krackpot then shoots Amber with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature.|$|E

5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations Room Unit as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7April, in recognition of his leadership of No.3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.|$|E
5|$|The race's {{fourth stage}} saw very rainy {{conditions}} throughout, which caused the roads to turn muddy and streams nearby the roads to overflow. The thirty riders that began the stage took the <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> onto Sabina rode for over , {{once they had}} reached Civita Castellana, before realizing their errors. This, when combined with the weather and road conditions, caused the riders to protest to the race jury and get the stage cancelled. The riders then road a train to Rome {{for the start of}} the next stage. At the finish in Rome there were over 20,000 paying spectators waiting to see the finish of the stage. When news broke of the stage's cancelling, the spectators grew angry and the organizers refunded their tickets they had purchased to view the race. The route of the added ninth stage came from the route of the Giro di Lombardia, despite the initial protest of the Italian Velocopie Union. The prize money for the stage was split among the fourteen riders that noticed the mistake.|$|E
5|$|Although Bart {{initially}} {{intends to}} drop out of the group as soon as possible, he decides to attend a meeting to avoid a pop quiz at school. Bart dislikes the first meeting, but when he finds out that he gets to have a pocket knife, he decides to keep attending. After a while, Bart starts to enjoy being a member of the Junior Campers, which Homer mocks him relentlessly for. When a father-son rafting trip is scheduled, neither Bart nor Homer want to go together but the end up mistakenly offering and accepting the invitations to do so. Homer does not enjoy the experience, especially when he learns that he and Bart have to share a raft with Ned and his son, Rod. Due to Homer losing the map after making it into a makeshift hat, they accidentally take the <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> and find themselves lost at sea. They stay stranded with no food or water for several days, as no rescue is forthcoming; the Springfield Police Department refuses to search for them because the Coast Guard boat they were using is out of refreshments. After several other failed attempts at being rescued or finding food, the raft springs a leak after Homer accidentally drops a pocket knife he was intending to gift to Bart. All seems lost, but then Homer smells his way to a Krusty Burger on an off-shore oil rig. They are saved, and Bart is proud of his father.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on 20 July, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. His command was reinforced by several more light tanks from the 1st Cavalry Division. As the tanks fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot. In the ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> and was separated from the rest of the American forces. Unable to turn back, Dean and his party attempted to retreat to American lines on their own, but 35 days later, alone and lost in the hills, Dean was captured by North Korean forces. For most of his incarceration, the North Koreans were not aware of his rank. Dean repeatedly attempted to make the North Koreans kill him for fear of divulging information under torture. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured. Eventually his rank was uncovered, but they were unable to gather any intelligence from him.|$|E
25|$|A navigational error. According to the {{scientists}} who conducted the post-mortem, the most likely explanation for the incident was simply that the whale was seeking to return to its normal feeding grounds in the North Atlantic and took a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn,</b> mistakenly swimming west up the Thames rather than taking the longer route around the coast.|$|E

25|$|Also on 23 March, a British Army {{engineering}} unit made a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> {{near the town}} of Az Zubayr, which was still held by Iraqi forces.

25|$|On October 12, 2000, two Israeli army reservists, Vadim Norzhich and Yosef Avrahami were lynched in Ramallah. They {{had taken}} a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn,</b> and were set upon by a mob, enraged in {{particular}} by the Muhammad al-Durrah incident in Gaza. A frenzied crowd killed the two IDF reservists, mutilated their bodies, and dragged them through the streets. Later that afternoon, the Israeli army carried out an air strike on Ramallah, demolishing the police station. Israel later succeeded in capturing and prosecuting some {{of those involved in}} the deaths of the reservists.|$|E
25|$|Now the Kandyans {{concentrated}} {{their attack}} on the middle column. After heavy fighting they were repulsed, but this took some time during which the middle column became separated from the vanguard, who were continuing their running battle. In the confusion the elephants carrying Dona Catarina and other valuables, including the ammunition reserves, left the column and wandered into the forest. Meanwhile the advance guard, now proceeding without a guide, took a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> and stumbled into a marshy field. Here the Kandyans surrounded and overwhelmed them. Following them in, the second column mounted a better resistance, managing to hold out for three hours, but they were eventually annihilated after their captains Henrique Pinto and Diogo Borges were killed.|$|E

25|$|Botham {{has been}} a prodigious fundraiser for {{charitable}} causes, undertaking a total of 12 long-distance charity walks. His first, in 1985, was a 900-mile trek from John o' Groats to Land's End. His efforts were inspired after a visit to Taunton's Musgrove Park Hospital in 1977 whilst receiving treatment for a broken toe. When he took a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> into a children's ward, he was devastated to learn {{that some of the}} children had only weeks to live, and why. At the time, he was an expectant father himself. Since then, his efforts have raised more than £12million for charity, with leukaemia research the main cause to benefit. In recognition of this work, Botham in 2003 became the first-ever President of Bloodwise, the UK's leading blood cancer charity.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the afternoon, Hood {{had brought}} up Stewart's corps across Rutherford Creek and {{directed}} {{him to move}} north of Spring Hill and cut off the Federal column. After taking a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn,</b> Stewart ended up at Forrest's headquarters at the Caldwell house. There he conferred with Forrest about {{the positions of the}} army, when suddenly one of Cheatham's staff officers arrived and directed in Hood's name that Stewart's corps move to support Brown's attack. After Stewart's column retraced its route, he arrived at Brown's command post, but was confused about the apparent disagreement in orders he was receiving, so he traveled back to Hood's headquarters for clarification. He informed Hood that because his men were tired and had been on the move since daylight—it was now 11 p.m.—he had ordered them to bivouac while they waited. Hood accepted the situation and told Stewart to head in the direction of Franklin in the morning after the men had rested.|$|E
25|$|Attenborough's {{acting career}} started {{on stage and}} he {{appeared}} in shows at Leicester's Little Theatre, Dover Street, prior to his going to RADA, where he remained Patron until his death. Attenborough's fist major credited role was provided in Brian Desmond Hurst's The Hundred Pound Window (1944) playing Tommy Draper who helps rescue his accountant father who has taken a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> in life. Attenborough's film career had, however, began in 1942 in an uncredited role as a sailor deserting his post under fire in the Noël Coward/David Lean production In Which We Serve (his name and character were accidentally omitted from the original release-print credits), a role which would help to type-cast him for many years as a spiv or coward in films like London Belongs to Me (1948), Morning Departure (1950) and his breakthrough role as Pinkie Brown in John Boulting's film adaptation of Graham Greene's novel Brighton Rock (1947), a part that he had previously played to great acclaim at the Garrick Theatre in 1942.|$|E

25|$|Positions of the German launch units {{changed a}} number of times. For example, Artillerie Init 444 arrived in the {{southwest}} Netherlands (in Zeeland) in September 1944. From a field {{near the village of}} Serooskerke, five V-2s were launched on 15 and 16 September, with one more successful and one failed launch on the 18th. That same date, a transport carrying a missile took a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> and ended up in Serooskerke itself, giving a villager the opportunity to surreptitiously take some photographs of the weapon; these were smuggled to London by the Dutch Resistance. After that the unit moved to the woods near Rijs, Gaasterland in the northwest Netherlands, to ensure that the technology did not fall into Allied hands. From Gaasterland V-2s were launched against Ipswich and Norwich from 25 September (London being out of range). Because of their inaccuracy, these V-2s did not hit their target cities. Shortly after that only London and Antwerp remained as designated targets as ordered by Adolf Hitler himself, Antwerp being targeted in the period of 12 to 20 October, after which time the unit moved to The Hague.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, {{a convoy}} from the 3rd Infantry Division, {{including}} the female American soldiers Jessica Lynch, Shoshana Johnson, and Lori Piestewa, was ambushed {{after taking a}} <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Piestewa, were captured. Piestewa died of wounds shortly after capture, while the remaining five prisoners of war were later rescued. Piestewa, who was from Tuba City, Arizona, and an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, was {{believed to have been}} the first Native American woman killed in combat in a foreign war. On the same day, U.S Marines from the Second Marine Division entered Nasiriyah in force, facing heavy resistance as they moved to secure two major bridges in the city. Several Marines were killed during a firefight with Fedayeen in the urban fighting. At the Saddam Canal, another 18 Marines were killed in heavy fighting with Iraqi soldiers. An Air Force A-10 was involved in a case of friendly fire that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside. A Marine from Marine Air Control Group 28 was killed by enemy fire, and two Marine engineers drowned in the Saddam Canal. The bridges were secured and the Second Marine division set up a perimeter around the city.|$|E
25|$|The advance {{along the}} coastal road {{was preceded by}} heavy {{artillery}} bombardment and airstrikes, but quickly became bogged down and was soon behind schedule. The narrowness of the road forced a slow advance, and Israeli armor became stuck in a large traffic jam. Several armored vehicles were knocked out by PLO fighters with anti-tank weaponry hiding in three groves along the road. One of the lead battalions, {{which was supposed to}} bypass Tyre and establish a blocking position {{to the north of the}} city, made a <b>wrong</b> <b>turn</b> and found itself in the center of the city, where it was ambushed. At eight in the evening the force finally crossed the Litani River and headed towards Sidon. In the central sector, the mission went as planned. The two Israeli divisions bypassed Beaufort Castle on both sides. Although an order to postpone the capture of Beaufort Castle was issued, it did not reach Israeli forces in time to prevent the operation, and Israeli troops of the Golani Brigade captured the castle in the fiercely-fought Battle of the Beaufort. The road junction at Nabatieh was also secured by the end of the first day. Meanwhile, the easternmost force penetrated into the Bekaa Valley and bore down on the Syrian positions. One division bypassed Mount Hermon via a road bulldozed by Israeli military engineers and cleared the town of Hasbaiya before swinging right and advancing towards Rachaiya. Though Israeli forces halted in the floor of the valley, they were flanking Syrian forces from the east and west. The Syrians put up minimal resistance and conducted some harassing artillery fire. By the end of the first day, the operation had gone almost entirely according to plan, though the advance along the coastal road was behind schedule.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1940s, {{influenced}} by the studies of his former professor Edward C. Tolman, Tryon decided to test the theory that intelligence is an inherited trait. To do this, he tested the ability of laboratory rats to navigate a maze: rats who took fewer <b>wrong</b> <b>turns</b> {{to get through the}} maze and reach the food at the end were termed [...] "maze-bright," [...] while those who took many <b>wrong</b> <b>turns</b> were termed [...] "maze-dull." [...] Tryon then interbred the maze-bright rats with other maze-brights, and maze-dull rats with other maze-dulls. With each successive generation, the ability to navigate the maze increased in the brights and decreased in the dulls. Known as Tryon's Rat Experiment, this study was highly influential in the field of psychology for showing that specific behavioral traits may be hereditary.|$|R
