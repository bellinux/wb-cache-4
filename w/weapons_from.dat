5|$|On 13 October, the JNA mostly {{destroyed}} and abandoned its barracks at Oštarije, and a JNA weapons storage facility in Rijeka was damaged {{in a fire}} caused by a thunderstorm. The ZNG removed some <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> the latter while the firefighters were called in to save individual storage structures. The next day, the JNA began moving the remaining <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> the damaged storage to elsewhere in the city. While a convoy of 18 trucks was moving through Rijeka, 15 vehicles carrying weapons were diverted and captured by the ZNG. At the same time, personnel at the JNA's Borongaj barracks in Zagreb were allowed to evacuate in return for free passage of a convoy carrying humanitarian aid to Vukovar, where the battle to control the city was in progress.|$|E
5|$|A related {{experiment}} {{which also}} had Teller's endorsement {{was a plan}} to extract oil from the tar sands in northern Alberta with nuclear explosions, titled Project Oilsands. The plan actually received {{the endorsement of the}} Alberta government, but was rejected by the Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to have nuclear <b>weapons,</b> <b>from</b> a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E

5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first.

5|$|Agents Phil Coulson, Melinda May, and Grant Ward break an {{undercover}} agent {{out of a}} hostile base, receiving classified S.H.I.E.L.D. Level 8 intel. Trainee Skye is frustrated when Coulson refuses to tell the team what the information is, based on their clearance level. At The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility run by Agent Victoria Hand, it is revealed that a South Ossetian separatist group has built a weapon called the Overkill device, which uses sonic vibrations to trigger other <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> great distances.

5|$|At {{the height}} of the revolt, Hananu {{effectively}} created a quasi-independent state between Aleppo and the Mediterranean Sea. Hananu's rebels first began administering captured territory in Armanaz, where the rebels coordinated with that town's municipality to impose taxes on landowners, livestock owners and farmers to fund their operations. From there, Hananu's administrative territory expanded to other towns and villages, including Kafr Takharim, and the district centers Harim, Jisr al-Shughur and Idlib. The municipal councils of these towns were not replaced, but repurposed to support the financial needs of the rebels and promote their social convictions. Kafr Takharim became the legislative center of rebel territory with a legislative committee in place to collect money and <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> local sources, and a supreme revolutionary council to oversee judicial matters.|$|E
5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{domestic}} {{debate over the}} permanent management of the nuclear program, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{was created by the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946 to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> the military. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District would remain until it too was abolished on 15 August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Halos arsenal {{consists}} of <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> science fiction. The game has been praised for giving each weapon a unique purpose, thus making each useful in different scenarios. For example, plasma weapons {{need time to}} cool if fired too rapidly, but cannot be reloaded and must be discarded upon depletion of their batteries, whereas conventional firearms cannot overheat, but require reloading and ammunition. In contrast to the large weapon inventories of contemporary FPS games, Halo players may carry only two weapons at once, calling for strategy when managing firearms.|$|E
5|$|Ike {{reported}} {{in his testimony}} afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him.

Ike testified that he picked up the <b>weapons</b> <b>from</b> William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later.|$|E
