The British planned to supply rafts for a river crossing that night as the Poles were desperately needed on the northern bank.

The Canadian Red Cross set up headquarters in Escuminac to assist the victims. Due to storm fatalities, 24adults became widows, and 83children lost a father. As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families. The fund raised $400,000 in a few months from donations from throughout Canada, as well as Pope John XXIII and Queen Elizabeth II, the latter who was {{on a tour of the}} country at the time.|$|E
5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

25|$|On 10 November 2006 Raviraj led a {{demonstration}} outside the UNICEF office in Colombo protesting against the Vaharai bombing in which 45 {{civilians were killed}} by army shelling. The following morning Raviraj {{took part in a}} live discussion on TV Derana between 7.00am and 7.30am. Afterwards he returned to his home in Manning Town, Narahenpita, had breakfast and changed for work. Raviraj had to drive to work himself as his driver was on leave. He had intended to use his wife's car but finding its battery drained got into his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (reg WP KE 1279). Raviraj's police bodyguard Sergeant Lokuwellamurage Shantha Laxman Lokuwella got onto the passenger seat. At 8.39am, as Raviraj was driving slowly down Martha Road and turning into Elvitigala Mawatha, a motorcycle (reg JE 3507) coming from the opposite direction stopped nearby. The motorcycle's passenger got down, removed his helmet, crossed the road and <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pavement with a bag over his shoulder. As Raviraj's vehicle went past, the motorcycle passenger ripped open the shoulder bag and fired the T-56 hidden inside. Raviraj's vehicle was hit from the front, side and rear at point blank range. After firing an entire magazine the assassin ran back to the motorcycle which then sped off, turning into Martha Road. The shoulder bag, with the T-56 inside, and the assassin's helmet were left at the roadside. According to the police a rickshaw parked nearby also drove off after the shooting. They believed that its driver had been a look out who had tipped off the assassins about the location of Raviraj's vehicle using a mobile phone.|$|E
500|$|Furthermore, {{the battle}} was one {{instance}} in which Moller's and Seydlitz's awareness of Frederick's operational objectives led to battlefield success. [...] For example, not content with the single attack and recall, the coup de main, Seydlitz withdrew his squadrons into a copse, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. When the moment was right, he led his cavalry forward again in the coup de grâce, the finishing blow. Similarly, Moller's artillery <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reverse angle of the hill until the French were in range, then mounted the Janus and laid down a thorough and precise pattern of artillery fire; the concussion of Moller's thorough cannonade could be felt several miles away. Rossbach proved that the column {{as a means of}} tactical deployment on battlefield was inferior to the Prussian battle line; the massed columns simply could not hold in the face of either Moller's fire or Seydlitz's cavalry charges. The greater the formation of men, the greater the loss of life and limb.|$|E
500|$|Boganda {{is one in}} a {{long line}} of African {{political}} leaders who, in an attempt to develop specifically national political cultures, were presented (or presented themselves) as the great national leader, glorified and sometimes nearly deified. They were hailed as the fathers of their nations and considered wise in the ways of understanding the best interests of their peoples. Others who became particular objects of hero-worship include Léopold Sédar Senghor, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Moktar Ould Daddah, Ahmed Sékou Touré, Modibo Keïta, Léon M'ba and Daniel Ouezzin Coulibaly. Boganda did little to discourage wide circulation of tales about his supernatural powers, putative invulnerability and even immortality. Shortly before his death, a large crowd <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore of the Ubangui River to see him cross by walking upon the waters. He did not show up, but apparently a good many people still believed that he could have made the miraculous crossing. More than just a charismatic political leader, he was seen as the [...] "black Christ", a great religious figure endowed with extraordinary powers. Along with Congo-Brazzaville's Fulbert Youlou, who remained a priest while president, Boganda was not particularly concerned with his religious mission once he entered politics, but he unabashedly used the enormous popular respect for the Church and the cloth to political advantage. He successfully manipulated religious symbols (clerical garb, crosses, baptism, disciples, acolytes, etc.) for political purposes.|$|E

500|$|As the Pope was, at that time, {{prisoner}} of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, {{as a result}} of the Sack of Rome in May 1527, Knight had some difficulty obtaining access. In the end he had to return with a conditional dispensation, which Wolsey insisted was technically insufficient. Henry now had no choice but to put his great matter into Wolsey's hands, who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry's favour, even going so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England, with a special emissary, Lorenzo Campeggio from the Pope himself to decide the matter. But the Pope never had empowered his deputy to make any decision. The Pope was still a veritable hostage of Charles V, and Charles V was loyal to his aunt, Catherine. The Pope forbade Henry to contract a new marriage until a decision was reached in Rome, not in England. Convinced that Wolsey's loyalties lay with the Pope, not England, Anne, as well as Wolsey's many enemies, ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529. George Cavendish, Wolsey's chamberlain, records that the servants who <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> king and Anne at dinner in 1529 in Grafton heard her say that the dishonour that Wolsey had brought upon the realm would have cost any other Englishman his head. Henry replied, [...] "Why then I perceive...you are not the Cardinal's friend." [...] Henry finally agreed to Wolsey's arrest on grounds of praemunire. Had it not been for his death from illness in 1530, he might have been executed for treason. A year later in 1531 (fully two years before Henry's marriage to Anne), Queen Catherine was banished from court and her rooms were given to Anne.|$|E
500|$|Somerset {{made their}} debut in {{first-class}} cricket against Lancashire on 8 June 1882. The Western Daily Press noted that Somerset {{were not able}} to field a full-strength team in the match, missing Evans, Ramsay and Roe. However, the Lancashire team which faced them was described by the same paper as being [...] "very second-rate". The weather was showery most of the day, and play was abandoned at half five because of the rain, with Lancashire on 231 for 8 having won the toss and batted first. Heavy rain overnight made the ground unplayable on the second day, so play resumed the following day, although rain continued to threaten. The original wicket was badly damaged, being described in the York Herald as [...] "a puddle", and so the stumps were moved to enable play to begin. Somerset took the final two Lancashire wickets in the first ten minutes, bowling them out for 237. Fowler and Sainsbury opened the batting for Somerset, and put on eighteen runs together before being dismissed in quick succession. The Western Daily Press recorded that [...] "after this disaster <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> visitors." [...] Only two other batsmen scored any runs for Somerset, and they were all out for 29 runs, the second lowest first-class total at the time. Somerset followed-on, and their second innings proceeded in much the same fashion as the first; the pair scored 35 runs, {{while the rest of the}} team only added a further 6. Somerset lost the match by an innings and 157 runs. The Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette defended Somerset's performance on the third day slightly, noting that the poor condition of the pitch favoured the Lancashire bowlers. Lancashire's George Nash took eight wickets in the first innings, including four in one four-ball over, while fellow spin bowler Jack Crossland collected six in the second innings.|$|E

On 5 October Gough issued a Memorandum on Attacks which summarized {{the lessons of the}} battle. Gough pointed out that maintaining the momentum of an attack required succeeding waves and reserves not be kept waiting for opportunities to intervene in the battle, because communication delays left them with no time to act. Brigadiers should reorganize the troops holding successive objectives, since these troops became reserves once the advance had moved on.|$|E

2500|$|Juan Seguín {{stated that}} with him, 15 men also entered {{to defend the}} Alamo. Lindley {{believes}} that the Flores brothers were defending the Alamo during the siege. After serving at the Battle of Béxar, Salvador {{was one of the}} few, 100 or so, that remained at the Alamo with Neill. His brother Manuel, and other Tejanos (15) entered on February 23. Neill's roster places Captain Flores in the Alamo as an artillery officer. Captain Flores also appears on Colonel Neill's voting tally, as well. Somehow, they seem to have exited soon after Seguin's departure, thus putting them on the Alamo survivor list. In 1907, Enrique Esparza claimed that Santa Anna called an armistice and he remembers some Flores leaving then. [...] They took this opportunity to gather Alamo reinforcements, bringing along a couple more of the Flores brothers (according to Seguin, they had a Tejano force of 100 when they regrouped in Gonzales), and secure their families (having not been seen, since abruptly entering the Alamo). They then rendezvoused with Seguin, now in Gonzales. [...] The company headed for the Alamo. The Tejano defenders were joined by up to fourteen more men from Gonzales (led by former Alamo couriers Alsbury and Sutherland). They proceeded toward the Alamo. There they <b>waited</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cibolo Creek to team up with Fannin. The Alamo fell before they could reach it.|$|E
