5|$|Because postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem fetal extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem fetal extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|Currently, curium is {{not used}} as a nuclear fuel owing to its low {{availability}} and high price. 245Cm and 247Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore {{could be used in}} portable nuclear weapons, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat. Curium-247 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} period Scotland {{continued}} to produce important architects, including James Stirling (1926–92), who, with James Gowan (1923–) designed the Flats at Ham Common, London (1955–58), considered a landmark {{in the development}} of modernist, brutalist residential planning, a style which would have a profound impact in Scotland. Their later work, almost all of it outside Scotland, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> influential on an international scale.|$|E

5|$|RAF night fighter defences {{were still}} in their infancy. Most fighters lacked radar and in any case, radar was {{short-range}} and unreliable. Instead, they flew outside the anti-aircraft guns' fields of fire on likely approach routes using the pilots' vision to locate enemy aircraft. In later years, the night fighter defences <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> sophisticated. But in 1940, they were not effective. Just 28 sorties were flown against the nocturnal raids.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led {{a search}} to {{determine}} the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any PlanetX would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> eccentric, and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planet's orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted PlanetX sceptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.|$|E
5|$|The diamond {{stingray}} {{is found}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean from southern California to northern Chile, as well as around the Galápagos and Hawaiian Islands; it is very abundant around Baja California and in the Gulf of California. At the northern and southern extremes of its range, it is generally only present during periods of suitably warm water brought about by El Niño. There is a record of this ray from off British Columbia, which is unconfirmed and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> anomalous as it is known to be a tropical and warm-temperate species.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere, at Portobello Barracks, {{an officer}} named Bowen Colthurst summarily {{executed}} six civilians, including the pacifist nationalist activist, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. These instances of British troops killing Irish civilians <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> controversial in Ireland.|$|R
5|$|X-10 {{supplied}} the Los Alamos Laboratory {{with the first}} significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> likely that a plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The Los Alamos Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon—a far more difficult feat.|$|E
5|$|In April 1944, {{experiments}} by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on {{the newly}} reactor-produced plutonium from Oak Ridge and the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced material on which the original measurements had been made had much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was thus implosion — a far more difficult engineering task.|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria had {{instructed}} the War Office {{to strike a}} new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal {{was meant to be}} a simple decoration that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services. To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of Prince Albert, vetoed the suggestion that the award be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London.|$|E
50|$|In {{the film}} Inglourious Basterds, the {{character}} of Hans Landa, who is Austrian, prominently displays the Germanic Proficiency Runes badge, even though for an SD Colonel to possess the award <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>highly</b> unusual.|$|R
50|$|TXA was {{discovered}} in 1962 by Utako Okamoto. It has {{been included in the}} WHO list of essential medicines. TXA is inexpensive and treatment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered <b>highly</b> cost effective in high, middle and low income countries.|$|R
50|$|All {{songs are}} {{independently}} verified by three sources, {{and the decision}} of the production team as to what the correct version of the lyrics are is final. However, stated in the rules, if a contestant felt that the lyrics they locked in were definitely correct, yet proven differently, they had every opportunity to contest the decision after filming, but the likelihood the decision <b>would</b> <b>be</b> reversed <b>was</b> <b>highly</b> unlikely to happen.|$|R
5|$|The {{implosion}} project {{remained a}} backup until April 1944, when experiments by Emilio G. Segrè and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced plutonium from the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the B Reactor at the Hanford site {{showed that it}} contained impurities {{in the form of}} the isotope plutonium-240. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than plutonium-239. The cyclotron-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> likely that it would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E

60|$|The boy had {{got into}} a facetious way of calling Mrs Willis by any term of endearment that {{suggested}} itself at the moment, which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>highly</b> improper and disrespectful {{if it had not}} been the outflow of pure affection.|$|R

25|$|Critics dismiss this as demagogy, {{noting that}} {{according}} to the ACP's own studies, {{at the peak of}} construction there would be fewer than 6,000 jobs created, and that some of these <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> skilled posts filled by foreigners because there are no Panamanians qualified to fill them.|$|E
25|$|Because {{both the}} {{pavilion}} and crown are comparatively shallow, step cut stones {{are generally not}} as bright and never as fiery as brilliant cut stones, but rather accentuate a diamond's clarity (as even the slightest flaw <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> visible), whiteness, and lustre (and therefore good polish).|$|E
25|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} lethal wildlife control {{is needed to}} control the population of a species. This control can be localized or regional. Localized population control {{is often used to}} control species that are residents of the airfield such as deer that have bypassed the perimeter fence. In this instance sharpshooting <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> effective, such as is seen at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E

25|$|Hayes was a {{computer}} hobbyist, {{and felt that}} modems <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> compelling to users of the new 8-bit computers that would soon be known as home computers. However, existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users. What was needed was a single modem that could do it all; connect directly to the phone, answer incoming calls, dial numbers to initiate outgoing calls, and hang up when the call was complete.|$|E
25|$|When I {{was left}} alone with the Duke of Portland and Lord Fitzwilliain, we entered more deeply and more confidentially into the business. They agreed Fox's conduct had been very ill-judged, and very distressing: that to {{separate}} from him <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> disagreeable, yet that to remain with him after what he professed, was giving their tacit approbation to the sentiments he had avowed in the House of Commons, on the Parliamentary Reform, which sentiments were in direct contradiction to theirs.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December the Rates Bill was published, {{with the}} new Environment Secretary Patrick Jenkin making it clear he would resign {{if he could not}} get it enacted. It was {{anticipated}} that the Bill <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> controversial especially with members of the House of Lords and Jenkin was said to have reminded them of the Salisbury Convention which prevented the Lords from rejecting any Bill mentioned in an election manifesto. The Bill was soon under criticism in Parliament by Conservative MPs Geoffrey Rippon and Anthony Beaumont-Dark, and outside it by David Howell.|$|E
5000|$|Grainger is also {{privy to}} [...] "The Wind"'s {{memories}} from {{times and places}} unknown to any other human - all of which he keeps to himself, though in several episodes {{it is clear that}} the information <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>highly</b> appreciated by Grainger's employers.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{state of}} ego depletion, an individual’s {{impaired}} ability to self-regulate can be implicated {{in a wide range}} of undesirable and maladaptive behaviors, such as acts of aggression.
