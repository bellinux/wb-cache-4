5|$|Although it is {{designed}} to be used with the QUAD II, 303, or 405 power amplifiers with limiters, a power amplifier capable of delivering 15 watts per channel suffices – excessive voltage input is known to cause arcing within the speaker panels. In fact, the instructions book states that any properly-regulated amplifier delivering no more than 33V is unlikely to cause damage to the speaker. Electrostatic speakers are more accurately rated by voltage, not power. In the ESL's case, at the rated nominal impedance of 16 ohms, the limit of 33 volts would be reached when the amplifier's power output reaches 15 watts (if it <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> a conventional load).|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} as an able politician and a likable man, during his presidency Pierce served only as a moderator among the increasingly bitter factions that <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> the nation towards civil war. To Pierce, who saw slavery as a question of property rather than morality, the Union was sacred; because of this, he saw the actions of abolitionists, and the more moderate Free Soilers, as divisive and {{as a threat to}} the constitutionally-guaranteed rights of southerners. Although he criticized those who sought to limit or end slavery, he rarely rebuked southern politicians who took extreme position or opposed northern interests.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the huge}} numbers of {{newcomers}} <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered. Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1975, Catholic civilians Colm McCartney and Sean Farmer {{were stopped}} {{in their car}} at another fake British Army {{checkpoint}} at Altnamachin (near Newtownhamilton). They <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> home from a Gaelic football match in Dublin. The two men were found shot dead nearby. Earlier that night, three RUC officers in an unmarked car had been stopped at the same checkpoint but allowed through. However, the officers suspected that the checkpoint was fake. After receiving radio confirmation {{that there were no}} authorised checkpoints in the area that night, they reported the incident and requested help from the British Army to investigate it, but no action was taken. RUC officer John Weir claims that UDR corporal Robert McConnell was involved in the attack.|$|E

On the second, the cast and crew <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> from the set, and a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and waited a further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was a possibility that rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E
5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E

5|$|Gilliat {{served with}} the Rifle Corps in Northern Ireland and Palestine prior to the {{outbreak}} of World War II, and was captured during the Battle of Dunkirk {{as part of the}} British Expeditionary Force. He made several attempts to escape, with one attempt lasting several days, but was transferred to the prisoner-of-war camp Oflag IV-C (Colditz Castle) in 1940 where he remained {{until the end of the}} war. He was mentioned in dispatches and later rewarded with an MBE. After the war Gilliat served as Deputy Military Secretary to Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma during his brief term as the last Viceroy of India in 194748, and as Comptroller to Malcolm Macdonald, the High Commissioner for South-East Asia. In September 1947, while in Mountbatten's service, Gilliat and the author Alan Campbell-Johnson <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> through the Paharganj district of Delhi when they were fired upon. The driver of their car was killed in the incident, and Gilliat suffered a substantial loss of blood, and a superficial head wound.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Holloway's missed flight, Jug and Beth Twitty {{and friends}} flew to Aruba by private jet. Within {{four hours of}} landing on the island, the Twittys presented the Aruban police with {{the name and address}} of Van der Sloot as the person with whom Holloway left the nightclub. Beth stated that Van der Sloot's full name was given to her by the night manager at the Holiday Inn, who supposedly recognized him on a videotape. The Twittys and their friends went to the Van der Sloot home with two Aruban policemen to look for Holloway. Van der Sloot initially denied knowing Holloway's name, but he then told the following story, which was corrorborated by Deepak Kalpoe, who was present in the house: Van der Sloot related that they drove Holloway to the California Lighthouse area of Arashi Beach because she wanted to see sharks; they later dropped Holloway off at her hotel at around 2:00a.m. According to Van der Sloot, Holloway fell down as she exited the car but refused his help. He stated that as he and Kalpoe <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> away, Holloway was approached by a dark man in a black shirt similar to those worn by security guards.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 12, 1964, Armando Schmerber and a {{passenger}} <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> home after drinking at a tavern and bowling alley in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California when their car skidded {{off the road and}} struck a tree. Schmerber and his companion were injured in the crash and taken to a hospital for treatment. When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused. Although they did not possess a search warrant, officers instructed attending physicians to take a blood sample from Schmerber. The blood sample indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest. The blood sample was ultimately admitted into evidence at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors. Schmerber objected to the admissibility of the blood sample, claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, and his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} {{criticism}} of MIS companies generally, and Great Southern Group (as the largest {{company in the}} sector) in particular, suggesting that their appetite for land for plantations and agribusiness was driving up land prices in some regions, and distorting some commodity markets. In 2004, Great Southern's leading competitor Timbercorp reported a rise in plantation land prices from around A$3,000 to around A$6,000 per hectare in just five years. The high demand for forestry MIS schemes led to plantations being expanded on to less suitable land, with timber growth and yield then falling below projections that were based on better quality plantations. Some farmers claimed that MIS <b>were</b> <b>driving</b> up prices in agricultural water markets. Opinion was also divided about whether the expansion of MIS properties in a region was causing shrinkage of towns or was, conversely, stimulating employment.|$|E
