In September 1944, Rosenberg {{suggested}} to Feklisov that he should consider recruiting his brother-in-law, David Greenglass, and his wife. On September 21, 1944, Feklisov reported to Moscow: [...] "They are young, intelligent, capable, and politically developed people, strongly believing {{in the cause of}} communism and wishing to do their best to help our country as much as possible. They are undoubtedly devoted to us." [...] David wrote to his wife: [...] "My darling, I most certainly <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be part of the community project [...] that Julius and his friends [...] have in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|MacLachlan was {{not given}} time to settle in. His first flight was in a Tiger Moth on 2 March 1937 in which he gained a 45-minute {{experience}} in an open-cockpit. He flew solo {{for the first time}} on 9 March after rapidly coming to grips with his trainer. He wrote, [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> hear I went solo today...Mr Sharp did a slow roll. It was pretty grim when we were upside down with nothing but 6,000 feet of air between us and the ground.....I simply love flying." [...] MacLachlan was the youngest trainee of the group and after 23 solo and 28 hours dual flight he passed as an average grade pilot on the 27 April. He had come second overall in his examinations. He travelled to RAF Uxbridge the following month. There, he was commissioned acting pilot officer service number 39639 on 18 May 1937. He was posted to No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham in Lincolnshire. He flew the Hawker Hart and the Hawker Audax {{for the first time on}} 20 May 1938. He enjoyed the speed of the aircraft immensely and indulged in his passion for motor cars by buying an Austin 7 from a Nottingham dealership with his first pay cheque for £14 7s.|$|E
500|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B on an A+ to F scale, writing that the [...] "episode didn’t really take {{advantage}} of Jack Burton's return to the show. Instead, it pushed him off to the sidelines {{to make room for}} a storyline that had no earthly business in this episode." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a nice break from the Volkoff drama". Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus wrote, [...] "This story line has the potential to bring lots of drama but the way that it has been building up to this moment." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the episode [...] "fun stuff just lacking in drama where drama was required." [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse wrote that the episode reminded her [...] "of all the reasons I fell in love with this show a year ago. It's fun, and funny without being campy, but more importantly, it's got heart. It's an episode that made me think, 'This is why people fight for this show season after season.' If it helps turn out more episodes like these, Gary Cole can drop by anytime he likes. I, for one, <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see him." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Phillip Stead {{thought that}} Fleming [...] "continues uninhibitedly to deploy his story-telling talents {{within the limits}} of the Commander Bond formula." [...] Stead saw that the {{hijacking}} of the two bombs [...] "gives Bond some anxiety but, needless to say, does not prevent him from having a good deal of fun in luxury surroundings", whilst [...] "the usual beatings-up, modern style, are ingeniously administered to lady and gentleman like". As to why the novels were so appealing, Stead considered that [...] "Mr. Fleming's special magic lies in his power to impart sophistication to his mighty nonsense; his fantasies connect with up-to-date and lively knowledge of places and of the general sphere of crime and espionage." [...] Overall, in Stead's opinion, with Thunderball [...] "the mixture, exotic as ever, generates an extravagant and exhilarating tale and Bond connoisseurs <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> have it." [...] The critic for The Times wrote that Thunderball [...] "relies for its kicks far less than did Dr. No or Goldfinger on sadism and a slightly condescending sophistication." [...] The upshot, in the critic's opinion, was that [...] "the mixture—of good living, sex and violent action—is as before, but this is a highly polished performance, with an ingenious plot well documented and plenty of excitement." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1787 the {{government}} of New York had almost entirely given up plans to subjugate Vermont, but still claimed jurisdiction. As {{a member of the}} legislature of New York, Hamilton argued forcefully and at length in favor of a bill to recognize the sovereignty of the State of Vermont, against numerous objections to its constitutionality and policy. [...] Consideration of the bill was deferred to a later date. [...] In 1787 through 1789 Hamilton exchanged letters with Nathaniel Chipman, a lawyer representing Vermont. In 1788 the new Constitution of the United States went into effect, with its plan to replace the unicameral Continental Congress with a new Congress consisting of a Senate and a House of Representatives. [...] Hamilton wrote: One of the first subjects of deliberation with the new Congress will be the independence of Kentucky , for which the southern states will be anxious. [...] The northern <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> find a counterpoise in Vermont. In 1790 the New York legislature decided to give up New York's claim to Vermont if Congress decided to admit Vermont to the Union and if negotiations between New York and Vermont on the boundary between the two states were successfully concluded. [...] In 1790, negotiators discussed not only boundary, but also financial compensation of New York land-grantees whose grants Vermont refused to recognize because they conflicted with earlier grants from New Hampshire. Compensation in the amount of 30,000 Spanish dollars was agreed to, and Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791.|$|E
500|$|In the US, {{the film}} was not subject to any {{censorship}} at all, and was released virtually intact to AIP's usual mix of drive-ins and grindhouses. However, {{in an attempt to}} link the film with Roger Corman's earlier Edgar Allan Poe series of films, it was retitled The Conqueror Worm. Brief prologue and epilogue narrations (by Price) taken from Poe's poem were added to justify the new title. As Danny Peary noted in his Cult Movies book, the film went nearly unnoticed by critics during its US release: [...] "The few snoozing trade reviewers who saw it treated it as just another entry in AIP's Edgar Allan Poe series... and gave it such dismal notices that future bookings were scarce." [...] Hollywood Citizen News was appalled by the film: [...] "A disgrace to the producers and scripters, and a sad commentary on the art of filmmaking... a film with such bestial brutality and orgiastic sadism, one wonders how it ever passed customs to be released in this country." [...] The trade journal Box Office noted that: [...] "Fans of the horror film <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> know that Vincent Price is back to add another portrait to his gallery of arch-fiends... bathed in the most stomach-churning gore imaginable..." [...] Variety opined that [...] "Dwyer gives evidence of acting talent, but she and all principals are hampered by Michael Reeves's mediocre script and ordinary direction." [...] Despite the lack of critical support, the movie was a modest success stateside, earning $1.5 million for AIP according to Cinefantastique magazine. In his biography of Reeves, Benjamin Halligan claims the film made $10 million in the US.|$|E

2500|$|Medwin {{rebelled against}} his father's wish that he become a lawyer, causing a quarrel, {{the result of}} which was Thomas' {{omission}} from his father's will, executed in 1829. There {{was a period of}} drift in Medwin's life, in which he attempted to live beyond his means as a gentleman. Considerable debts appear to have been paid by his family. These activities involved much carousing and gambling at his club in Brighton and generally spending money on collecting art. Shelley recalled Medwin as painting well and [...] "remarkable, if I do not mistake, for a particular taste in, and knowledge of the belli arti – Italy is the place for you, the very place – the Paradise of Exiles... If you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see an old friend, who <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see you... come to Italy." [...] Medwin's financial situation could not continue as it was, and by 1812 he had accepted a military commission in the 24th Light Dragoons, a regiment where he could pursue his social pretensions.|$|E

2500|$|Madame Nhu Trần Lệ Xuân, Nhu's wife, {{inflamed}} {{the situation}} by mockingly applauding the suicides, stating, [...] "If the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> supply the gasoline." [...] The pagoda raids stoked widespread public disquiet in Saigon. Students at Saigon University boycotted classes and rioted, which led to arrests, imprisonments, and {{the closure of the}} university; this was repeated at Huế University. When high school students demonstrated, Diệm arrested them as well; over 1,000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of Saigon civil servants, were sent to re-education camps, including, reportedly, children as young as five, on charges of anti-government graffiti. Diệm's foreign minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned, shaving his head like a Buddhist monk in protest. When he attempted to leave the country on a religious pilgrimage to India, he was detained and kept under house arrest.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1963, the Buddhist crisis {{broke out}} after nine Buddhist protesters {{were killed in}} Huế while protesting {{a ban on the}} Buddhist flag on Vesak, the {{birthday}} of Gautama Buddha. This prompted the Buddhist majority to stage widespread demonstrations against Diệm, who discriminated in favour of Catholics, for religious equality. The movement threatened the stability of the family's rule. Nhu was known to favor a stronger line against the Buddhists. He had made statements calling for the suppression of the protests through his English-language newspaper, the Times of Vietnam. During this time, his wife Madame Nhu, herself a Catholic convert from Buddhism and the de facto first lady (due to Diệm's bachelor life), inflamed the situation by mockingly applauding the suicides of Thích Quảng Đức and others, referring to them as [...] "barbecues", while Nhu stated [...] "if the Buddhists want to have another barbecue, I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> supply the gasoline".|$|E
