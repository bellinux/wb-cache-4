Only two months later, President Johannes Brand of the Orange Free State offered Reitz the position of chairman of the newly formed Appellate Court of the Orange Free State, {{despite the fact that}} Reitz was not fully qualified (inter alia too young). Reitz refused the offer for this reason, but <b>when</b> <b>another</b> candidate also refused, Brand insisted on the nomination of Reitz, and convinced the Volksraad to appoint him.|$|E

In 2004, three Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) {{in the areas of}} information technology, education and diplomatic ties, and co-operation-in-general were signed. Bilateral co-operation between both countries was also extended to defence matters in 2008 <b>when</b> <b>another</b> MoU was signed, which proposed for joint military trainings and collaboration in the defence industry between the Malaysian and Vietnamese militaries.

Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him thumbs up. Blythe insisted that he never saw Nosek nor came into contact with him.
