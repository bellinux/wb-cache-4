25|$|The concept {{goes back}} {{at least as far}} as Aristotle who, in Poetics, {{referred}} to narration and action as different modes or manner of representing something. For many years, fiction writing was described has having two types: narration and dialogue. Evan Marshall, in The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing (1998) noted that writers should know what they are doing at all times. He described what he called fiction-writing modes—the types of writing of which all fiction is made. He listed five modes: action, summary, dialogue, feelings/thoughts, and background, each with its own set of conventions regarding how, when, and <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used.|$|E
25|$|One major form {{of motor}} {{regulation}} within cells for dynein is dynactin. It {{may be required}} for almost all cytoplasmic dynein functions. Currently, {{it is the best}} studied dynein partner. Dynactin is a protein that aids in intracellular transport throughout the cell by linking to cytoplasmic dynein. Dynactin can function as a scaffold for other proteins to bind to. It also functions as a recruiting factor that localizes dynein to <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> There is also some evidence suggesting that it may regulate kinesin-2. The dynactin complex is composed of more than 20 subunits, of which p150(Glued) is the largest. There is no definitive evidence that dynactin by itself affects the velocity of the motor. It does, however, affect the processivity of the motor. The binding regulation is likely allosteric: experiments have shown that the enhancements provided in the processivity of the dynein motor do not depend on the p150 subunit binding domain to the microtubules.|$|E
500|$|The {{first step}} towards a {{permanent}} memorial to Nelson was taken on 18 November 1805 {{by the city}} aldermen, who after sending a message of congratulation to King George III, agreed that the erection of a statue would form a suitable tribute to [...] Nelson's memory. On 28 November, after a public meeting had supported this sentiment, a [...] "Nelson committee" [...] was established, chaired by the Lord Mayor. It contained four of the city's Westminster MPs, alongside other city notables including [...] Arthur Guinness, {{the son of the}} brewery founder. The committee's initial tasks were to decide precisely what form the monument should take and <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> put. They had also to raise the funds to pay for it.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{equipment}} is used for processing concrete, from hand tools to heavy industrial machinery. [...] Whichever equipment builders use, however, {{the objective is to}} produce the desired building material; ingredients must be properly mixed, placed, shaped, and retained within time constraints. Any interruption in pouring the concrete can cause the initially placed material to begin to set before the next batch is added on top. This creates a horizontal plane of weakness called a cold joint between the two batches. Once the mix is <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> the curing process must be controlled to ensure that the concrete attains the desired attributes. During concrete preparation, various technical details may affect the quality and nature of the product.|$|E

2500|$|Skepticism {{had existed}} even before Yamano's blog post. [...] The National Archive wrote in {{warning that the}} Archives version of the {{photograph}} {{did not have a}} date. [...] Dorothy Cochrane, a curator at the aeronautics department of the National Air and Space Museum, called the new evidence merely a [...] "blurry photograph" [...] and cited the existing evidence from radio transmissions that suggested that the Electra was at least close to Howland Island, 800 miles away from the Marshall Islands. [...] Author Fukiko Aoki, who researched and wrote a 1982 book, Looking for Amelia, was similarly critical before the revelations from Yamano. [...] Aoki located an elderly officer, part of the 1937 crew of the Kōshū Maru, who denied the ship's involvement. [...] Aoki subsequently researched the Kōshū Maru ship log which showed it as having been 1,500 miles away at the time of Earhart's disappearance. [...] It was also argued that to reach and somehow land on the remote atoll where she purportedly crashed would have required Earhart, though low on fuel, to change her northeast course as she neared Howland Island and fly hundreds of miles northwest. [...] Additionally, had Japanese officials found Earhart, they would have had substantial motivation to rescue and return her considering her fame. [...] The claims of a U.S. government cover-up also came under criticism; the documentary prominently mentions [...] "a report dated January 7, 1939 that Earhart was a prisoner in the Marshall Islands." [...] TIGHAR, a group that advocates the Gardner Island hypothesis of the disappearance, investigated the 1939 government report, which was not hard to find, and found that it was a report on an obvious prankan implausible tale found in France from someone who did not identify themselves. [...] The message told of being kidnapped by the Japanese, having his crew killed, finding Earhart in custody, then being sent to Europe on an unnamed Japanese ship. [...] TIGHAR wrote that the photo was [...] "neither lost nor evidence" [...] and that the picture had been [...] "exactly <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> and was exactly what it was labeled to be, a picture of Jaluit Harbor," [...] criticizing the [...] "lost and misfiled photo" [...] element of The Lost Evidence as well.|$|E
