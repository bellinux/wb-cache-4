It was clear that Edward <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E

5|$|Henry II died in 1189 and was {{succeeded by}} Richard I. Rhys {{considered}} {{that he was}} no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Gower and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard.

5|$|Neither paramountcy nor the {{subsidiary}} alliances {{could continue}} after Indian independence. The British took {{the view that}} {{because they had been}} established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan. At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.|$|E
5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E
5|$|Years {{of civil}} war had left Rome {{in a state of}} near lawlessness, but the Republic <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his {{authority}} without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.|$|E

5|$|Zwingli {{was obliged}} to state {{the terms of the}} armistice. He demanded the {{dissolution}} of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Zurich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence. The first Land Peace of Kappel, der erste Landfriede, ended the war on 24 June.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{had long}} broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson {{was one of a}} group of Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of LMAs involve the outsourcing of one television station's operations to another, occasionally, a company may operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA {{even if it does}} not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Hornets owner Tom Benson) entered into a shared services agreement with Raycom Media to run the former company's Fox affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, WVUE-DT; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station's ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including Baton Rouge, Jackson, Biloxi, Lake Charles and Shreveport) but not within New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> sell WVUE outright.|$|E

5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{diplomatic}} context at Constance {{included the}} revolt of the Bohemian Hussites, who looked upon Poland {{as an ally}} in their wars against Sigismund, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław on condition that he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague, which he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> do. After Władysław's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, Władysław's nephew, Sigismund Korybut, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429 — apparently with Władysław's blessing — but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for Captain Segond, when dawn broke on 18 October, HMS Anson was {{revealed}} {{only a short}} distance off, limping southwards after the damage its rigging and masts had suffered before the battle on 12 October. Although his ship was almost unmanageable, Captain Durham <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> lose a second opportunity to engage, and slowly brought his vessel to bear on Loire, which was unable to escape. Accompanying Anson was Kangaroo, recovered from the damage of 16 October and ready for further action. At 10:30, Anson and Loire began firing on one another, neither able to effectively manoeuvre and both relying on firepower to overwhelm their opponent. Kangaroo closed on the unprotected stern of Loire, firing {{as she did so}} and repeatedly raking the immobile French ship. By 12:00 Loire had lost her mainmast and was leaking badly, forcing Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the sixth prize of the campaign.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The team {{project has}} become an {{essential}} component in undergraduate education, espe-cially in the information science and technology curricula. Often, the students are also required to utilize a “Collaborative Learning Tool ” such as Blackboard? to carryout their collaborative activi-ties. However, many students, dare I say the majority of students, cringe at {{the mere mention of}} a “Team Project”. There are many reasons for this reaction, but one reason is that the students <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> collaborate. They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> collaborate with each other, and they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> use the collaborative learning tools effectively. The research in collaborative learning has indicated a need for students to learn how to collaborate, and to engage in non-task interactions to build socio-emotional connections that lead to effective collaboration.

5|$|With {{his newly}} {{acquired}} flotillas, the Flanders Flotilla′s commander - Admiral Ludwig von Schröder - decided {{to launch a}} raid in the Dover Strait against the Dover Barrage {{as well as any}} Allied shipping that could be found in the Channel. Although the British had prohibited transports from being in the Channel at night in anticipation of a German raid, the Dover Barrage <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> meet such an attack. Facing Schröder′s 23 boats, the Dover Barrage was guarded by only the old destroyer , the yacht Ombra, and the naval trawler H. E. Straud. The four divisions of drifters manning the barrage′s anti-submarine nets were armed with only a single rifle each for defence. In addition to the forces guarding the Barrage, there were six Tribal-class destroyers at Dover that could be called upon {{in the event of a}} raid as well as several units of Harwich Force dispersed at the Downs.|$|E
5|$|In Arnhem {{at around}} 03:30, the leading units of 11 Para reached 1st Parachute Brigade and the 2nd South Staffords, {{just as they}} started a new attempt to fight through to the bridge. As the {{battalion}} had just arrived and had no appreciation of the ground, it was held in reserve and played no part in the attack. By dawn and under intense fire, the attack faltered and 11 Para were ordered {{to carry out a}} left flanking attack to relieve the pressure on the South Staffords. Only the intervention of Major-General Urquhart, just freed from where he had been trapped, stopped the 11 Para assault. Having recognised the futility of the battle Urquhart <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> reinforce failure. At 11:00 the Major-General ordered 11 Para still in the outskirts of Arnhem to support the advance of 4th Parachute Brigade by occupying the high ground on the north-west outskirts of Arnhem. At 14:30 the battalion was caught in the open and subjected to a mortar attack. The attacked caused heavy casualties including the commanding officer lieutenant-Colonel George Lea, unable to proceed around 150 of the survivors were forced to withdraw towards Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|It {{culminated in}} a period during 1937 when all the powers where {{prepared}} {{to give up on}} non-intervention. Ciano complained to his government that Italian forces in Italy were ready but not being used; the Soviet Union <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> discuss belligerent rights; Delbos was considering proposing mediation by Roosevelt and the Pope, whilst simultaneously preparing French war plans; Britain's new Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, saw securing a friendship with the Italian Benito Mussolini as a top priority. Eden confided he wished Franco to win, so Italian and Germany involvement would be scaled back; Chamberlain considered Spain a troublesome complication to be forgotten. By the end of July 1937, the Committee was in deadlock, and the aims of a successful outcome to the Spanish Civil War was looking unlikely. Unrestricted Italian submarine warfare began on 12 August. The British Admiralty believed that a significant control effort was the best solution, of four which were put forward, in response to attacks on British shipping. On 27 August it was decided by the Committee that naval patrols did not justify their expense and would be replaced, as planned, with observers at ports.|$|E
