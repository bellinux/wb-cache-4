5000|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of Sardar's thought is that 'there {{is more than}} one way to be human'. 'I do not regard [...] "the human" [...] either as [...] "the" [...] or as a priori given', he has said. 'The western <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> human is one amongst many. Similarly, the Islamic <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> human is also one amongst many. The Australian aboriginal <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> human is also another <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> human. I see each culture as a complete universe with its own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> knowing, <b>being</b> and doing - and hence, its own <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> human'. The corollary is that there are also different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> knowing. The question that Sardar has always asked is: 'how do you know? The answer depends a great deal on who 'you' are: 'how you look at the world, how you shape your inquiry, the period and culture that shapes your outlook and the values that frame how you think'.|$|R

40|$|In Norway, {{children}} who attend a kindergarten {{have a legal}} right to receive care. This legal right is the juridical context {{of the present study}} and I describe care as a legal “shall”-obligation for adults in kindergarten. The study investigates the notion <b>of</b> adult´s caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> in relation to {{children who}} are in a situation where they express a need of care. One aim of the study is to show how a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> is facilitated and hampered. Furthermore, the thesis aims to examine the nature <b>of</b> this caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> I also wish {{to examine the relationship between}} a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> and the upbringing and the rearing of children. The care function of kindergarten is seen, in my study, to have priority over the upbringing function. A 5 ½ months fieldwork was carried out in a kindergarten. I use the methodology of participant observation and individual interviews with seven preschool teachers and assistants. The analytic tools are constructed in a way that allows me to perform three different analyses: an empirically-based analysis, a theoryinspired analysis and a superior analysis. All findings are related to observations. The theoretical framework is constituted by the philosophical perspectives of Knud E. Løgstrup and Reidar Myhre´s pedagogical theories about child rearing. In the first analysis I examine how a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> can be facilitated. However, this analysis also points to one superior finding by indicating that a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> is facilitated by a unifying contradiction between closeness and distance. By this I mean that seemingly contradictory concepts, such as closeness and distance, need to be unified in caring. The two other analyses are related to observations of situations where children are crying and I investigate the ways in which these children are met by the adults. One main finding of the superior analysis is that the grown-ups’ <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> has a general conditioning effect on the children. Since small children are highly formative, the very bodily presence of kindergarten adults will, in some way or other, have an effect on the children. This unintentional influence can be referred to as premeditated normative childrearing – it will happen whether the adult is aware of it and plans on it vi or not. Meditated normative childrearing can be said to have a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> as its prerequisite. Furthermore, meditated normative childrearing without caring and caring child rearing can be described as a separating contradiction. The two elements here are in an either-or relationship. The second main finding has to do with how a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> can be hampered. I regard a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> as a culturally, moral “ought”- obligation. It does not seem possible to have a caring attitude without showing a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> The adult is the care. A caring attitude and a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> that is without comfort and ignores, punishes or rejects children, can thus be referred to as a separating contradiction. I describe the latter as caring deceit and a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> that is void of care. If an adult fails to respond spontaneously to a child who expresses emotional difficulties, his/her care is inadequate. However, postponed caring is better than no caring at all. Caring is described as a pre-culturally, ethical “ought”- obligation. My third main finding has to do with how a caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> is promoted. Here, I focus on the importance of employing an ongoing care-based pedagogical assessment (Norwegian: skjønn) in order to understand the child´s situation and to be able to change a difficult situation to the better for the child. The term “pedagogical” here refers to the upbringing of the child. One of my findings is that care and childrearing are two sides of the same coin when it comes to the adults´ <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> Care can be seen as a pre-cultural necessity of life, while child-rearing can be seen as a cultural necessity. My three main interpretive findings can be summarized as follows: A caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> is regarded as a culturally, moral “ought”- obligation which has a legal “shall”- obligation as a prerequisite on the one hand and a pre-culturally, ethical “ought”- obligation on the other. To esteem a life is the leading cultural value in this ethical understanding. In other words, the caring <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> is located in the area where these three normative obligations meet...|$|R

500|$|Ultimately, the {{producers}} turned to 30-year-old Sean Connery for five films. It is often reported that Connery won the role through a contest {{set up to}} [...] "find James Bond". While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a Gregory Peck quality, but proved unable {{to cope with the}} role. When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery [...] "put on an act and it paid off" [...] as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude. When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as he went to his car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond. After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.

500|$|Sean Connery was {{the first}} actor to portray Bond on film in Dr. No (1962). An amateur bodybuilder, {{he had come to}} the {{attention}} of the Bond film producers after several appearances in British films from the late 1950s. At a muscular 6'2", Fleming originally disapproved of his casting as James Bond, believing him to be an overgrown stuntman who lacked the finesse and elegance to play James Bond; he envisaged a suave actor, such as David Niven playing the role. Producer Albert R. Broccoli—known to all as Cubby—disagreed with Fleming's view, later commenting that [...] "I wanted a ballsy guy... put a bit of veneer over that tough Scottish hide and you've got Fleming's Bond instead of all the mincing poofs we had applying for the job". Eon's choice of Connery was also based on his looks and sex appeal, an appeal that would later be echoed by Honor Blackman who said, after appearing with Connery in Goldfinger, [...] "He was exceedingly handsome, virile and sexy and that really was the tenor of what the script was always trying to display". After Connery was chosen, director Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser, and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.

2500|$|The second intuition animating Heidegger's {{philosophy}} {{derives from}} the influence of Edmund Husserl, a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history.

But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is always already situated in a world and in <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> Thus Husserl's understanding that all consciousness is [...] "intentional" [...] (in {{the sense that it}} is always intended toward something, and is always [...] "about" [...] something) is transformed in Heidegger's philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in [...] "care". This is the basis of Heidegger's [...] "existential analytic", as he develops it in Being and Time. Heidegger argues that describing experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter.
