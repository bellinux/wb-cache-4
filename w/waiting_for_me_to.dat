500|$|Musically, [...] "Deuces" [...] is a slow, down-tempo R ballad that {{displays}} {{elements of}} house and pop music. The song has {{a length of}} four minutes and thirty-six seconds. It is backed by synth chords and [...] "eerie harmonies", with Brown's [...] "smooth vocals" [...] making use of auto-tune effects. According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, the song contains lyrical content about [...] "breaking {{it off with a}} girl after failed attempts to make the relationship work". In the first verse, Brown sings: [...] "All that bullshit is for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture / Always hoping for the worst, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> fuck up / You'll regret the day when I find another girl, that knows just what I need / She knows just what I mean." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the Volume 4 world tour, Black Sabbath {{returned}} to Los Angeles {{to begin work}} on their next release. Pleased with the Volume 4 album, the band sought to recreate the recording atmosphere, and {{returned to}} the Record Plant studio in Los Angeles. With new musical innovations of the era, the band were surprised to find that the room they had used previously at the Record Plant was replaced by a [...] "giant synthesiser". The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said. [...] "Everybody was sitting there <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come up with something. I just couldn't think of anything. And if I didn't come up with anything, nobody would do anything." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Wanna Go" [...] is a dance-pop and hi-NRG song, which {{features}} a heavy bassline and drum fills; the latter are reminiscent of English band New Order's song [...] "Blue Monday" [...] (1983). Spears squeals and chuckles throughout the song, and her vocals are processed. In the pre-chorus, she draws out the [...] "e"'s in lines such as [...] "Shame on me / To need release / Uncontrollably." [...] The section also has a whistled hook, which was compared by Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice {{to the music of}} French recording artist Bob Sinclar and American recording artist Frankie Knuckles. In the chorus, Spears stutters [...] "I-I-I wanna go-o-o/All the wa-a-ay/ Taking out my freak tonight". Ryan Brockington of the New York Post compared [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] to the music of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007). In the lyrics, Spears sings about losing inhibitions, as evident in lines such as [...] "I-I-I wanna sho-o-ow/All the dir-ir-irt/I got (sic) running through my mind.", while playfully apologizing for her need for sexual release. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated that she sings about [...] "the scrum that surrounds her" [...] in [...] "Lately people got me all tied up / There's a countdown <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> erupt". According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing, [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] is written in the key of D minor, with an electropop beat infused metronome of 138 beats per minute. Spears' vocals range from the low note of D3 to the high note of D5.|$|E

60|$|He shut up his notes, and, {{steadily}} {{watching my}} face, <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak first.|$|R

500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's {{waiting for you to}} come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
60|$|He propounded no scheme, but {{stood in}} an easy {{attitude}} of attention, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> continue.|$|E
60|$|He <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{declare that}} I quite {{understood}} that he expressly said that he admitted nothing.|$|R
5000|$|Me esperas, a comer peras? : {{literally}} [...] "will you <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> eat pears?- [...] "Will you <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> me?" ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak, {{and then}} irritated by my silence struck at me sharply with that wicked little tongue of hers.|$|R
60|$|LILY. I can't, because Isey {{never goes}} to sleep, {{if she is}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|E
60|$|I {{could hardly}} {{understand}} {{whether she was}} in jest or in earnest. She went on without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reply.|$|E
60|$|Hans {{surveyed}} me with {{a watery}} eye as though <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> explain them, but I looked haughty and declined to oblige.|$|E
6000|$|... "The villain! why did not he <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{have the}} comfort of killing him? Dog!" [...] and he kicked the corpse with his foot.|$|R
60|$|He was all {{interested}} attention, and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on, though I {{could see in}} his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been shaken.|$|R
6000|$|He {{would have}} {{released}} her, but she lingered in his embrace. [...] "Will you promise that if there's ever {{anything like it}} again, you won't <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{want to hang}} me,' {{answered}} the young man; 'the gallows are all ready and the hangman is only <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop playing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lose strength!" [...] Jacob chuckled. [...] "I {{never felt}} so fit in my life. How high is it from this window?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{be worse}} off, so God help us," [...] said Emma, and without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lead her she swung herself over the edge.|$|E
60|$|She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as {{was only}} natural, when I {{knew she was}} lying in <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do wrong; and she denounced <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.|$|R
60|$|Guest leaned towards me. His {{eyes were}} bright and alert, and his manner was {{perfectly}} composed. He was more used to such crises than I was. He asked no question; he <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|R
60|$|It {{would seem}} that in this {{farewell}} call I was permitting myself an exaggeration {{of what had been}} to Alice only a pleasant association, <b>for</b> she greeted <b>me</b> composedly and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> justify my presence.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. He's been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{look at him}} {{all through}} dinner. Shall I do it, {{and you can see}} what an idiot he looks? ...|$|E
60|$|The news I got on {{reaching}} London was this: {{my mother}} did not understand that her daughter was dead, and they were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell her.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} he was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say something; so I asked if his great work had not cost a vast {{expenditure}} of time and pains.|$|E
60|$|She <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on. She {{was deeply}} interested. I {{could hear her}} breath coming fast, though we were walking at a snail's pace. I longed to confide in her absolutely, but I dared not.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gereth {{looked at}} her with a slight {{increase}} of hardness. [...] "You've done everything you need for modesty, my dear! If he's sick with love of you, you haven't had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> inform you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Davy," [...] said he, [...] "we are to {{live here}} for a while, you and I. What {{do you think of}} our headquarters?" [...] He did not <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reply, but continued, [...] "Can you suggest any improvement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Howld yer jaw, you jabbering apes!" [...] he exclaimed, {{in great}} wrath. [...] "Give me a lantern, or a candle, {{and let me}} begone. The boys are all <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm pretty {{certain they}} will, sir," [...] the man declared. [...] "They sat about <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be disengaged, {{but when my}} time off came, I hopped out the back way. They'll be there again to-night, sure enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|It threw some light, {{but not a}} glare, and I was {{a little}} disappointed, also to some degree embarrassed. He was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on, so, in default of {{anything}} else to say, I asked, [...] "Is it valuable?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{while we}} hotfooted {{it across the}} sand it seemed all the rifles on Indian hill were turned loose on us. I got to the spring a little ahead, so that Jed had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> fill my pails.|$|R
60|$|Isobel did not move, but {{she turned}} very pale. Her eyes seemed {{fastened}} upon mine. She <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak. The situation was embarrassing enough {{so far as}} I was concerned, for Lady Delahaye was obviously in earnest. I tried to gain time.|$|R
6000|$|The wretched girls still sat {{silent and}} obstinate, {{with their heads}} down. I tremble again as I write of what {{happened}} next. Papa fixed his eyes on me. He said, out loud: [...] "Eunice!"--and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> rise and answer, as my sister had done.|$|R
