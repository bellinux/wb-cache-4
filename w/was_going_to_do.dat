5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her and closes the door to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E

25|$|Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry {{stated that}} he {{expected}} Clinton to face some tough questions, but thought she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a good job at (being Secretary of State). Christopher Hitchens of Vanity Fair called her nomination a ludicrous embarrassment on the edition of November 18, 2008 of Hardball due to the Clintons' overseas connections, her actions during the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary. Senator John Cornyn (R-Texas) voted against a unanimous voice approval, citing ethical concerns. He sought not to block the nomination through a filibuster, but to voice his opposition to her policies. Senator David Vitter (R-Louisiana) also voted against Clinton in Committee citing her husband's foreign donations for his non-profit entities.|$|E

Exhorting them to join the coup on the grounds that Diệm's regime was unable to keep the military going forward, he stated that all the generals except Cao were in the plot, while Đính <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. According to one account, Đính intended for loyalists to report Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace.|$|E

25|$|In 1844 {{their mother}} took {{the girls to}} Paris to {{continue}} their studies, first with Francesco Piermarini, {{and then with the}} distinguished tenor Marco Bordogni. Bordogni thought highly of Sophie: it is said that he allowed her to sing only scales and solfeggi which he composed for her, for two whole years. After that time mother Crüwell wanted to remove her, saying that she had learnt scales enough and that if she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> nothing else she might as well get married and give it up. Bordogni persuaded mother that she would have a wonderful career, and that she should go on to complete her studies in Milan. A first public appearance in January 1846 was reported in the musical journal Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished {{all she had to}} do was wear a wig. The nightly process she went through in the setting of her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E

At that time, the 7th Division {{was under}} the control of the IV Corps that was commanded by Diệm loyalist General Cao. This division was on the outskirts of Saigon and its stance would be critical in determining the success or failure of a coup. Exhorting the 7th Division officers to join the coup on the grounds that the Diệm regime was unable to keep the military going forward, he stated that all the generals except Cao were in the plot, while Đính <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. According to one account, Đính had intended that loyalists would report Có's activities to Diệm and Nhu so that it would give him an opportunity to orchestrate a stunt to ingratiate himself with the palace and make the coup easier to carry out.|$|E

25|$|On 7 March, Thamesdown {{passed a}} motion declaring its {{inability}} to set a rate. The council's chief executive, David Kent, wrote to all councillors after the meeting telling them that a rate had to be set {{by the end of}} March, and pressure appeared also from the Department of Health and Social Security which warned on 21 March {{that there would be a}} problem paying Housing Benefit to the council if no rate was made. The council felt sufficiently concerned to avoid budget chaos that it set up a special resources sub-committee to agree emergency measures for ordering supplies. On 25 March the Mayor summoned a special council meeting for 28 March, while senior councillors discussed options with the borough solicitor. The meeting on 28 March saw prolonged disruption from the public gallery by those who supported continued defiance, and Mayor Harry Garrett called on the police to keep order. Among the councillors the decision was taken to approve a legal rate of 196.65p; a council spokesman claimed that the council would be going ahead with what it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anyway.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|Immediately upon {{taking office}} in 1993, Chrétien {{cancelled}} {{the contract to}} buy the EH-101 helicopters and paid a $157.8 million termination fee to AgustaWestland. Additionally, Chrétien kept his Red Book promise of spending $6billion on infrastructure {{to stimulate the economy}} out of recession by signing the necessary orders, and to cancel the privatization of Pearson airport. The consortium that was due to take ownership of Pearson sued for breach of contract, which led the government to settle out of court in April 1997 for $60 million in damages. Chrétien phoned President Bill Clinton of the United States in November 1993 to ask him to renegotiate aspects of NAFTA. Clinton bluntly refused, saying that it had been extremely difficult to get Congress to ratify NAFTA, and if NAFTA was renegotiated, then he would have to submit the renegotiated treaty again for ratification, which was not something that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{just for the sake of}} Chrétien. Clinton informed the Prime Minister that he either scrap NAFTA or accept it as it was, and at most he could offer were a few cosmetic concessions like writing a letter saying the United States was not interested in taking over Canada's energy and water. Chrétien chose the latter, and sought to portray Clinton's letter as a major American concession that constituted a renegotiated NAFTA, though in fact Clinton's letter was not legally binding and meant nothing. Only treaties ratified by Congress are legally binding on the U.S. government and presidential letters impose only a moral obligation, not a legal one, on the U.S government.|$|E
