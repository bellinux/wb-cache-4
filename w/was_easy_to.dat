5|$|For {{many years}} there was {{confusion}} between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). Until 1984, {{the latter was}} circumscribed as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda (river banksia), which has whorled leaves like B.verticillata. Thus it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> perceive B.verticillata as falling {{within the range of}} variation of this broadly defined species. The confusion was largely cleared up once B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon.|$|E

Vanderweyde stated the spring balance used in Crookes' experiment was unreliable as it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> manipulate by deception and suggested he should repeat the experiment by using a chemical balance.|$|E
5|$|As it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> {{find and}} kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} {{and later by}} Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, {{and it may have}} competed with domestic livestock for forage. The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E
5000|$|Maintainability. It <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> fix bugs {{because the}} source code <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> read and {{the intent of}} its author <b>is</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> grasp. This might be {{achieved}} by reducing large monolithic routines into a set of individually concise, well-named, single-purpose methods.

Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> get lost. While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> see at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well {{in front of the}} aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E

The small-scale attack by JG had achieved considerable damage. Total American losses were 10 destroyed and 31 damaged. The Germans lost eight fighters, including seven Bf 109s, and three damaged. No damage was done at Le Culot airfield.|$|E
5|$|Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth {{to pitch}} two {{exhibition}} games in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, {{he was not}} restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in The Babe Ruth Story (1948)—that the young pitcher {{had a habit of}} signaling his intent to throw a curveball by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.|$|E
5|$|On graduating a year later, Ramage {{once again}} {{expressed}} {{a preference for}} a flying job, so he received command of Heavy Attack Wing One, which was based at Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. This wing consisted of the nuclear attack squadrons flying the A3D Skywarrior, detachments from which were posted to the aircraft carriers. The post was a senior one for a captain; Robert Goldthwaite had held the post {{while he was a}} rear admiral. Ramage had never flown the A3D before, so he started by becoming carrier qualified on it, which required eight carrier landings. To his surprise, he found that the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> fly, and he was successful at lifting the training level of the entire wing.|$|E

From this perspective, speaker cabinets need to have easy-to-access horns, speakers, and crossover circuitry, so that repairs or replacements can be made. [...] Some rental companies often rent powered amplifier-mixers, mixers with onboard effects, and powered subwoofers for use by non-professionals, which <b>are</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> set up and use.|$|R
5|$|The {{first section}} near Woolwich was under {{construction}} by 1921, as it ran on open land that <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> purchase, but {{plans for the}} remainder of the route had not yet been decided and there were delays due to compulsory purchasing of properties. In 1925, The Times announced a replacement bridge for the Woolwich Ferry was planned as part of the South Circular project to tie in with the East Ham and Barking Bypass (now the A13). A significant amount of new housing had been built along the route of the South Circular since the original 1903 plans, and building costs had risen because of labour and because of further demolition required. In 1927, the Governors of Dulwich College formally objected to the road as it would put the Memorial Library right next to a main road and remove part of the college green.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its drawbacks, however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E
5|$|Under Guatemalan law, Maya stelae {{and other}} archaeological {{artefacts}} are {{property of the}} Guatemalan government {{and may not be}} removed from the country without its permission. In the case of Machaquilá Stela2, the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> prove. The stela itself was cut into pieces, with the face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in Belize, where it was packed into boxes and shipped to California. There it was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions. The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E

5|$|Under Kistiakowsky's leadership, X-Division {{designed}} the complex explosive lenses needed to compress the fissile plutonium pit. These employed two explosives with significantly different velocities of detonation {{in order to}} produce the required wave form. Kistiakowsky chose Baratol for the slow explosive. After experimenting with various fast explosives, X-Division settled on Composition B. Work on molding the explosives into the right shape continued into 1945. The lenses needed to be flawless, and techniques for casting Composition B and Baratol had to be developed. The ERL managed to accomplish this by devising a procedure for preparing Baratol in a form that <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> cast. In March 1945, Kistiakowsky became part of the Cowpuncher Committee, so-called because it rode herd on the implosion effort. On July 16, 1945, Kistiakowsky watched as the first device was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later a Fat Man implosion-type nuclear weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Voss {{was one of}} {{the test}} pilots for the F.I triplane {{prototype}} which developed into the Fokker Dr.I. He was summoned to Schwerin, and on 5 July 1917 {{was one of the}} first pilots to test fly Fokker F.I s/n 103/17. Although the Fokker had some drawbacks, such as its low speed and slowness in a dive, Voss loved the new craft. It <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> fly with light controls, could out-manoeuvre any previous aircraft, mounted twin machine guns, and had a rapid rate of climb. The same climbing ability that put it at 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) within three minutes of takeoff lent itself to the combat tactic of zooming upwards out of combat to gain the height advantage on opponents. Voss enthusiastically recommended the Fokker's adoption while never progressing to testing the Pfalz Dr.I. He left Schwerin with an assignment for command of another jasta.|$|E
5|$|War now {{broke out}} between Henry and his brothers. Henry mobilised a {{mercenary}} {{army in the}} west of Normandy, but as William Rufus and Robert's forces advanced, his network of baronial support melted away. Henry focused his remaining forces at Mont Saint-Michel, where he was besieged, probably in March 1091. The site <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> defend, but lacked fresh water. The chronicler William of Malmesbury suggested that when Henry's water ran short, Robert allowed his brother fresh supplies, leading to remonstrations between Robert and William Rufus. The events of {{the final days of}} the siege are unclear: the besiegers had begun to argue about the future strategy for the campaign, but Henry then abandoned Mont Saint-Michel, probably as part of a negotiated surrender. He left for Brittany and crossed over into France.|$|E
