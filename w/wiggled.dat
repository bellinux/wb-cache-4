25|$|Some {{forms of}} neglect {{may also be}} very mildâ€”for example, in a {{condition}} called extinction where competition from the ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception of the contralesional stimulus. These patients, when asked to fixate on the examiner's nose, can detect fingers being <b>wiggled</b> on the affected side. If the examiner were to wiggle his or her fingers on both the affected and unaffected sides of the patient, the patient will report seeing movement only on the ipsilesional side.|$|E
25|$|Anglerfish {{are named}} for their {{characteristic}} method of predation. Anglerfish typically {{have at least}} one long filament (the illicium) sprouting {{from the middle of the}} head, protruding above the fish's eyes and terminating in an irregular growth of flesh (the esca) at the tip of the filament. The filament can move in all directions and the esca can be <b>wiggled</b> so as to resemble a prey animal, thus acting as bait to lure other predators close enough for the anglerfish to devour them. Some deep-sea anglerfishes of the bathypelagic zone emit light from their escas to attract prey. This bioluminescence is a result of symbiosis with bacteria.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Technics {{started making}} their SL-1200 {{turntable}}, {{which became the}} most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque direct drive design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ <b>wiggled</b> the record {{back and forth on}} the platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.|$|E
25|$|Two {{pilots were}} {{captured}} by Israeli soldiers {{and taken to}} Tel Aviv for interrogation, and were later released. Another was rescued by Bedouins and {{handed over to the}} Egyptian Army, which turned him over to the RAF. Later that day, four RAF Spitfires from the same squadron escorted by seven Hawker Tempests from No. 213 Squadron RAF and eight from No. 6 Squadron RAF went searching for the lost planes, and were attacked by four IAF Spitfires. The Israeli formation was led by Ezer Weizman. The remaining three were manned by Weizman's wingman Alex Jacobs and American volunteers Bill Schroeder and Caesar Dangott. The Tempests found they could not jettison their external fuel tanks, and some had non-operational guns. Schroeder shot down a British Tempest, killing pilot David Tattersfield, and Weizman severely damaged a British plane flown by Douglas Liquorish. Weizman's plane and two other British aircraft also suffered light damage during the engagement. The battle ended after the British <b>wiggled</b> their wings to be more clearly identified, and the Israelis eventually realized the danger of their situation and disengaged, returning to Hatzor Airbase.|$|E

Clementine cake may be dense and moist, and its flavor may improve a day or more after preparation, because the ingredients intermingle and coalesce to enhance its flavor as it ages.

500|$|The {{clinical}} examination narrows the source {{down to a}} specific tooth, teeth, or a non-dental cause. [...] Clinical examination moves from the outside to the inside, and from the general to the specific. [...] Outside of the mouth, the sinuses, muscles of the face and neck, the temporomandibular joints, and cervical lymph nodes are palpated for pain or swelling. In the mouth, the soft tissues of the gingiva, mucosa, tongue, and pharynx are examined for redness, swelling or deformity. [...] Finally, the teeth are examined. [...] Each tooth that may be painful is percussed (tapped), palpated {{at the base of}} the root, and probed with a dental explorer for dental caries and a periodontal probe for periodontitis, then <b>wiggled</b> for mobility.|$|E
500|$|On {{the sixth}} season of American Idol, Blake Lewis [...] {{performed}} {{a cover of}} [...] "I Need to Know" [...] on April 10, 2007, {{as part of the}} program's Latin-themed round. Anthony's then-wife Jennifer Lopez was the guest mentor for the contestants. Lewis's cover of the song was well received by the judges Paula Abdul, Simon Cowell, and Randy Jackson. However, it received mixed reactions from critics. Joey Guerra of Today called Lewis's choice wise and said Blake [...] "seems like an actual artist". Craig Berman from Houston Chronicle wrote a positive review; he said that the risks Lewis took with his vocals [...] "paid off with the best effort of the night". Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly questioned Cowell's comment that Lewis's was the best performance of the night. Slezak wrote that Anthony's cover sounded almost exactly the same as Anthony's original recording. Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times said that Lewis [...] "perspired and <b>wiggled</b> creepily" [...] in contrast to Anthony's confident performances. Jim Cantiello of MTV wrote that Lewis [...] "finishes each line with an affected orgasmic sigh" [...] and that his performance was [...] "icky".|$|E

2500|$|Gould's {{interest}} {{in music and}} his talent as a pianist became evident very early. Both his parents were musical, and his mother, especially, encouraged the infant Gould's early musical development. Before his birth, his mother planned for {{him to become a}} successful musician, and thus exposed him to music during her pregnancy. As a baby, he reportedly hummed instead of crying and <b>wiggled</b> his fingers as if playing chords, leading his doctor to predict that he would [...] "be either a physician or a pianist". By the age of three, Gould's perfect pitch was noticed. He learned to read music before he could read words. When presented with a piano, the young Gould was reported to strike single notes and listen to their long decay, a practice his father Bert noted was different from typical children. Gould's {{interest in}} the piano proceeded side by side with an interest in composition. He would play his own little pieces for family, friends, and sometimes large gatherings, including, in 1938, a performance at the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church (a few blocks from the Gould house) of one of his own compositions. At the age of six, he was taken {{for the first time to}} hear a live musical performance by a celebrated soloist. This left a tremendous impression. He later described the experience: ...|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most people}} who came to Gettysburg, the Rathvon family was aware that the {{president}} of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, was going to make some remarks. [...] The family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet. [...] At the head of the procession rode Abraham Lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen. [...] Rathvon describes Lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground; he also mentions the long eloquent speech given by Edward Everett of Massachusetts whom Rathvon accurately described as the [...] "most finished orator of the day." [...] Rathvon then goes on to describe how Lincoln stepped forward and [...] "with a manner serious almost to sadness, gave his brief address." [...] During the delivery, along with some other boys, young Rathvon <b>wiggled</b> his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of Mr. Lincoln and looked up into what he described as Lincoln's [...] "serious face." [...] Rathvon recalls candidly that, although he listened [...] "intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly," [...] he explains, [...] "boylike, I could not recall any of it afterwards." [...] But he explains that if anyone said anything disparaging about [...] "honest Abe," [...] there would have been a [...] "junior battle of Gettysburg." [...] In the recording Rathvon speaks of Lincoln's speech allegorically [...] "echoing through the hills." ...|$|E
