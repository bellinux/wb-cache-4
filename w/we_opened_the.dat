[...] Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC) when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and civil rights organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, [...] "I will not participate in any program that has racist overtones.

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of {{comparative}} advantage with monopolistic competition, that incorporates heterogeneous firms and endogenous mark-ups. We analyse how these features vary across countries with different factor endowments, and across markets of different size. In this model we can obtain trade gains via two channels. First, when <b>we</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> economy, most productive firms start to export their product, then, they demand more producing factors and wages rises, thus, those firms that are less productive {{will be forced to}} stop to produce. Second channel is via endogenous mark-ups, when <b>we</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> economy, the competition gets ``tougher'', then, mark-ups falls, thus, those firms that are less productive will stop to produce. We also show that comparative advantage works as a ``third channel'' of trade gains, because, all trade gains results are magnified in comparative advantage industry of both countries. We also make a numerical exercise to see how endogenous variables of the model vary when trade costs fall...|$|R
