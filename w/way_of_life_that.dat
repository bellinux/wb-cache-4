The islands' inhabitants had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism {{and the presence of}} the military during the First World War led the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered. The changes made to the island by visitors in the nineteenth century disconnected the islanders from the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> had allowed their forebears to survive in this unique environment. Despite construction of a small jetty in 1902, the islands remained at the weather's mercy.|$|E

25|$|The British philosopher Alan Watts took a close {{interest}} in Zen Buddhism and wrote and lectured extensively on {{it during the}} 1950s.

25|$|Transhumant grazing is an {{important}} aspect of the cultural heritage of the Australian Alps, an area of which has been included on the Australian National Heritage List. Colonists started using this region for summer grazing in the 1830s, when pasture lower down was poor. The practice continued during the 19th and 20th centuries, helping make Australia's pastoral industry viable. Transhumant grazing created a distinctive <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> is {{an important}} part of Australia's pioneering history and culture. There are features in the area that are reminders of transhumant grazing including abandoned stockman's huts, stock yards and stock routes.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the utility}} of the horse as a means of {{transportation}} became clear the horses (actually ponies) began being bred for strength, and by the 3rd millennium BC they were strong enough to pull chariots. By 2000 BC, war chariots had spoked wheels, thus being made more manoeuvrable, and dominated the battlefields. The growing use of the horse, combined with the failure, roughly around 2000 BC, of the always precarious irrigation systems that had allowed for extensive agriculture in the region, gave rise and dominance of pastoral nomadism by 1000 BC, a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> would dominate the region for the next several millennia.|$|E

25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church {{have come to understand}} Zion as primarily a community <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still believe that, when they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E
25|$|While {{residents}} {{in and around}} the town still extract some lead and silver from the hillsides, the town is best known for being in middle of much of the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, with two sanctuaries open to the public nearby: Sierra Chincua and El Rosario. The town’s association with the butterflies came when magazines such as National Geographic and México Desconocido began promoting it, along with neighboring Ocampo. The town hosts an annual monarch butterfly festival each year in February to bid goodbye as the insects head north again. The festival consists of artistic and cultural events as well as those related to the region’s traditions and customs. Another annual cultural event is the Day of the Miner on 11 July, which is held to honor a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> many in the town do not wish to lose. The rest of the municipality’s annual festivals are religious including the feasts of Santa Cruz on May 3, San Simon on October 28 and the Immaculate Conception on December 8.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{downfall}} of the Siad Barre government, there was effectively no formal monocentric government law in Somalia. While some urban areas such as Mogadishu had private police forces, many Somalis simply returned to the traditional clan-based legal structures for local governance and dispute resolution. Identified by The New York Times as [...] "legendary individualists", Somalis have been thought of as particularly conducive to anarchist forms of social organisation; social scientists have identified the pastoralist <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> a great many Somalis lead as in tension with formal statist legal systems.

2500|$|Watts disliked {{much in the}} {{conventional}} idea of [...] "progress".

Watts decried the suburbanization of the countryside and the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> went with it. In one campus lecture tour, which Watts titled [...] "The End to the Put-Down of Man", Watts presented positive images for both nature and humanity, spoke {{in favor of the}} various stages of human development (including the teenage years), reproached excessive cynicism and rivalry, and extolled intelligent creativity, good architecture and food.|$|E
40|$|I examine an {{objection}} against autonomy-minded liberalism sometimes made by philosophers such as John Rawls and William Galston, that it rules out <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> {{which do not}} themselves value freedom or autonomy.

2500|$|With {{the outcry}} over {{developments}} in Kansas {{strong in the}} North, defenders of slavery—increasingly committed to a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> abolitionists and their sympathizers considered obsolete or immoral—articulated a militant pro-slavery ideology that would {{lay the groundwork for}} secession upon the election of a Republican president. Southerners waged a vitriolic response to political change in the North. Slaveholding interests sought to uphold their constitutional rights in the territories and to maintain sufficient political strength to repulse [...] "hostile" [...] and [...] "ruinous" [...] legislation. Behind this shift was the growth of the cotton textile industry in the North and in Europe, which left slavery more important than ever to the Southern economy.|$|E
2500|$|As at the Bangladesh shows, {{there was}} a poignancy to this 1972 performance, {{following}} the death of Allauddin Khan in September that year. As their music guru, Baba had remained a revered figure in their lives, and a man considered a saint in his home town of Maihar. In My Music, My Life, Shankar's 1968 autobiography, he writes admiringly of Baba [...] "follow a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> was a beautiful fusion of the best of both Hinduism and Islam", and being similarly broadminded in his musical vision by [...] " [...] us away from the confines of narrow specialization that prevailed in our music".

2500|$|The {{second stage}} of the Marshall Plan, which began in 1950, {{concentrated}} on productivity of the economy. According to Michael J.

[...] The program, as instructed by American lawmakers, targeted improvement in factory-level productivity, labor-management relations, free trade unions and introduction of modern business practices. The Economic Cooperation Administration, which operated until December 1951, distributed around $300 million in technical assistance and attempted steering the Austrian social partnership (political parties, labor unions, business associations and executive government) in favor of productivity and growth instead of redistribution and consumption.|$|E

2500|$|According to Olivelle, {{and other}} {{scholars}} such as Edward Crangle, the concept of Sramana exists in the early Brahmanical literature. The term is used in an adjectival sense for sages who lived a special <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> the Vedic culture considered extraordinary. However, Vedic literature does not provide details of that life. The term did not imply any opposition to either Brahmins or householders. In all likelihood states Olivelle, during the Vedic era, neither did the Sramana concept refer to an identifiable class, nor to ascetic groups {{as it does in}} later Indian literature. Additionally, in the early texts, some pre-dating 3rd-century BCE ruler Ashoka, the Brahmana and Sramana are neither distinct nor opposed. The distinction, according to Olivelle, in later Indian literature [...] "may have been a later semantic development possibly influenced by the appropriation of the latter term [...] by Buddhism and Jainism".|$|E
