5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E
5|$|Males having short, cut hair {{are in many}} {{cultures}} viewed as being under society's control, such as while in the military or prison or as punishment for a crime. Although recently in The United States {{it has become more}} socially acceptable and more common for men to have hair reaching all the <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> their upper back. Long, thick hair has been a sign of wealth, power or prominence throughout time and history.|$|E
5|$|Given the chaos, the {{governor}} of Yunnan ignored the imperial orders of evacuation. The Mongol army commanded by Prince Ye-sin Timour, a grandson of the emperor, marched south toward Pagan. According to mainstream traditional (British colonial era) scholarship, the Mongol army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate; fought its <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Pagan {{with the loss of}} 7000 men; occupied the city; and sent out detachments to receive homage, one of which reached south of Prome. But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary Mongol/Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary completeness of the conquest.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, three Predators {{consisting}} of Scar, Celtic and Chopper arrive and kill all the humans on the surface. They make their <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the pyramid and arrive {{just as the}} team unwittingly activates the structure. The Alien Queen awakes from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Aliens. Conflict erupts between the Predators, Aliens, and humans, resulting in several deaths. Celtic and Chopper are killed by an Alien, and Weyland buys Alexa and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa (Raoul Bova) enough time to escape from Scar, giving {{his life in the}} process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and an Alien with a shuriken before unmasking and marking himself with the blood of the facehugger. After Alexa and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attaches itself to Scar due to him not wearing his mask.|$|E
5|$|The planned {{movement}} of the 20th Division to Madang was revised {{in the light of}} events in the Bismarck Sea. The operation was postponed for two days, and the destination was altered from Madang to Hansa Bay further west. To reduce the Allied air threat, the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March, and that at Dobodura on 11 March. Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 was lost in the air, but the Allied fighters claimed to have shot down nine Japanese planes. The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March, and the troops made their <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Madang on foot or in barges. The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys. It toiled on the road for the next few months, but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by New Guinea's weather and the rugged terrain of the Finisterre Range.|$|E
5|$|When {{the safety}} car {{came in on}} lap42, Hamilton led, while Heidfeld and Piquet were running second and third. Behind them were Massa, Kubica, Kovalainen, Trulli, Vettel, Alonso, Webber, Rosberg and Räikkönen. Webber's Red Bull had been {{dripping}} oil {{for a couple of}} laps after picking up debris from Glock's crash, and on lap40 he pulled out of the race. Räikkönen quickly passed Rosberg, and then overtook the squabbling Vettel and Alonso on the <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the hairpin, while Hamilton desperately tried to pull away at the front. Räikkönen passed Trulli twolaps later, while Kovalainen overtook Kubica for fifth place. Coulthard and Barrichello collided on the 48thlap with both cars pitting for repairs. Barrichello retired threelaps later due to damage sustained {{as a result of the}} incident. Hamilton pitted on lap50, coming out behind Heidfeld, Piquet, Massa and Kovalainen. Kovalainen let his teammate past at the hairpin one lap later, meaning that Hamilton was now fourth. On lap52, Heidfeld set a new fastest lap time of 1:15.987. He was the only driver to go under one minute 16 seconds during the Grand Prix. At the end of the following lap, Heidfeld entered the pits with a sizeable gap over Piquet, returning to the field comfortably ahead of Kovalainen, but behind Hamilton.|$|E

5000|$|At this point, McElvaine argues, there arose {{an almost}} irresistible metaphor, the very {{widespread}} acceptance {{of which has}} misshaped human life through all of recorded history.

25|$|Almost all {{production}} in Alsace is of AOC wine, {{since there is}} no Vin de pays region which covers Alsace. Thus, the only alternative to producing AOC wine is to declassify it all the <b>way</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Vin de table, which generally means that neither grape varieties, region of origin or vintage may be identified. However, this solution is mostly avoided since edelzwicker and gentil may be blended from several varieties, i.e. varieties that exceed the AOC rules in the concerned season.|$|E
