25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: <b>wet</b> <b>wood,</b> wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally {{do a good job of}} keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E
25|$|Wood burning: when wood is burned, it {{is usually}} best to dry it first. Damage from {{shrinkage}} {{is not a problem}} here, and the drying may proceed more rapidly than in the case of drying for woodworking purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons going up the chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100°C exhaust temperature, about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning <b>wet</b> <b>wood</b> is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.|$|E
2500|$|In an 1834 {{letter to}} Silliman, Morey wrote: “It {{is now more}} than twenty years since I have been in the constant, I may say daily {{practice}} of making experiments on the decomposition of water, by mixing with its vapor that of spirits of turpentine, and a great portion of atmospheric air.” This would seem to understate the scope of some research that led to such diverse discoveries as the liquid fueled internal combustion engine, a method for carbonating water, and odd bubbles formed by molten resin. The last two appeared in journals in England and Germany, respectively. Morey noted differences in flames near knots, perhaps rich in sap, or in <b>wet</b> <b>wood.</b> Eventually he experimented with anything he could find: “tar, rosin, rough turpentine, or the spirit, or alcohol, or any kind of oil, fat, or tallow; mineral coal, pitch-pine wood, and the knots, birch bark, pumpkin, sun-flower, flax, and other seeds; as well as many other substances.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The hearth and spindle {{can both}} be {{constructed}} from any medium-soft, dry, non-resinous wood, and work best when both {{are made from}} the same piece of wood; however, with practice almost any wood combination can be used provided the parts contain little or no resin or moisture. The most important factor is whether the wood is dry enough to ignite, as <b>wet</b> <b>wood</b> will not work; yucca, aspen, white cedar, basswood, buckeye and most willows all work very well. Combinations such as hazel and poplar also work well. The bow should be stiff but slightly limber and around {{the distance from the}} users armpit to their fingertips. The bearing block (handhold) can be made of anything that is harder than the spindle. Bone, antler, shell and stone work best, as they can be easily greased, do not create as much friction, and do not burn; however, hard woods such as maple and tulip and red cedar are quite serviceable and often easier to find and work. [...] Some effective materials used to grease the bearing block include sebum, animal and plant oils, or even moist vegetation.|$|E

50|$|This {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} called wet look, since <b>wetting</b> <b>wood</b> with water often displays the chatoyancy, albeit only until the wood dries.

40|$|Thermogravimetry, {{differential}} thermal analysis, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} in oxygen flux {{were used}} to characterize two wood types: fir and chestnut woods.

The samples were woods in powder obtained during sawing. Complementary characterization of the woods was performed by estimating the crystallinity of cellulose by means of X-ray powder diffraction. In order to simulate the degradation of <b>wet</b> <b>woods,</b> fir and chestnut woods were put into deionised water and into artificial sea water for several weeks; some samples of woods contained Cu and Fe nails to ascertain the effect of these metals on the degradation process.

60|$|He struck {{something}} hard with his knees, and {{was conscious of}} a sudden chill as the brine washed over one leg, but he had his hands clenched tight on a strip of <b>wet</b> <b>wood,</b> and somebody seized him by the shoulder.
