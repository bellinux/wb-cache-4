5|$|After {{three seasons}} of below average cyclone activity, the 2002–03 season was {{slightly}} above average, featuring ten cyclones and seven severe tropical cyclones. One of the cyclones, Cyclone Erica, originated from the Australian region but later {{moved into the}} South Pacific, where it impacted New Caledonia. Throughout the season, a moderately warm El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) generated a shift of cyclone activity away from Australia and towards the open waters of the southern Pacific. As a result, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) between November 2002 and June 2003 was negative, averaging -7.2. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Pacific <b>were</b> <b>above</b> average; {{for most of the}} tropical regions, SSTs <b>were</b> <b>above</b> 29°C (84°C). At various times, Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) pulses increased convective activity and thus cyclone development in the basin. Five pulses of the MJO and Equatorial Rossby waves (ER) were responsible for most of the cyclone activity during the season. Cyclone Zoe, the strongest cyclone of the season, was the only cyclone with no connection to any identified MJO or ER wave. By April, an easterly trade wind anomaly took place, signifying the end of the El Niño pattern that had persisted for much of the year.|$|E
5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters.

If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of their children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent.

5|$|In 1841, 12% of Trafford's {{population}} was middle class compared to 14% in England and Wales; this increased to 21% in 1931 (15% nationally) and 55% in 2001 (48% nationally).

This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and Fourth Division were formed, but for the moment, Palace <b>were</b> <b>above</b> all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the Fulham game. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table in the following season, 1922–23, finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.|$|E
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring <b>were</b> <b>above</b> average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E

The figures for crime statistics were all recorded during the 2006/7 financial year.

5|$|The {{voters of}} Henderson County chose Dixon to {{represent}} them at the state constitutional convention of 1849. The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie {{by a vote of}} 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures {{to protect the rights of}} slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property <b>were</b> <b>above</b> constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic. Though some of these ideas were challenged, all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850.|$|E
5|$|At this time, private loyalty-review {{boards and}} anti-communist {{investigators}} {{began to appear}} to fill a growing demand among certain industries to certify that their employees <b>were</b> <b>above</b> reproach. Companies that {{were concerned about the}} sensitivity of their business, or who, like the entertainment industry, felt particularly vulnerable to public opinion made use of these private services. For a fee, these teams would investigate employees and question them about their politics and affiliations. At such hearings, the subject would usually not have a right to the presence of an attorney, and as with HUAC, the interviewee might be asked to defend himself against accusations without being allowed to cross-examine the accuser. These agencies would keep cross-referenced lists of leftist organizations, publications, rallies, charities and the like, as well as lists of individuals who were known or suspected communists. Books such as Red Channels and newsletters such as Counterattack and Confidential Information were published to keep track of communist and leftist organizations and individuals. Insofar as the various blacklists of McCarthyism were actual physical lists, they were created and maintained by these private organizations.|$|E
5|$|By 1988, {{building}} costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed {{for a foreign}} loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, {{in addition to the}} operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers <b>were</b> <b>above</b> 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put {{under the control of the}} Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor).
