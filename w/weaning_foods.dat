40|$|Nutrition {{in infancy}} - Clinical studies on dietary intake, {{metabolism}} and growth Our aims were {{to try to}} determine an appropriate formula protein concentration to be used {{during the second half}} of infancy and to evaluate the effects on plasma lipids when breast milk was exchanged for formula and/or <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Both aspects were studied with special regard to the influence of traditional <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Nutrient intake, protein and fat metabolism, and growth were studied from 3 to 12 months in Swedish and Italian infants. Breast milk was gradually exchanged for formula with the same fat but different protein concentrations (13, 15 or 18 / 20 g/l) and given together with Swedish or Mediterranean <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Swedish infants given the lowest protein (13 g/l) formula had lower total dietary intake of protein and indices of protein metabolism more similar to those of breast-fed infants in mid-infancy compared with infants assigned to higher protein (15 - 18 g/l) formulas. Sufficient amounts of protein was provided to Swedish and Italian infants, since serum proteins and growth were normal in both populations. However, plasma concentrations of some essential amino acids were lower in Italian infants fed low-protein formula, despite higher protein intake. This may indicate that dietary protein from Italian <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> was less available in mid-infancy compared with protein from Swedish <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Dietary intake of protein was found to be associated with plasma levels of insulin-releasing amino acids, with renal excretion of C-peptide from insulin synthesis and also with growth. High dietary supply of protein may probably increase growth by promoting insulin release during infancy. Swedish breast-fed infants had higher plasma cholesterol than those fed formula, possibly since breast milk provides much saturated fat, more cholesterol and less unsaturated fat than formula. These differences decreased {{during the second half of}} infancy, when more <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> were provided. Moreover, residual effects of breast milk on the plasma lipid profile were lost soon after the termination of breast-feeding. Plasma lipids were lower in Italian infants at 6 and 12 months of age, partly since Italian <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> – and possibly also breast milk – differed in lipid composition from Swedish ones. Higher protein and lower fat and energy contents of Italian compared with Swedish <b>weaning</b> <b>foods,</b> may explain why Italian infants were given excessive protein but less fat and energy in late infancy. In conclusion, protein needs during mid- and late infancy seem to be better met by lower (13 g/l) than by higher (18 g/l) protein-containing formula when combined with high-quality <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Plasma lipids respond to changes in dietary intake from breast milk to formula and <b>weaning</b> <b>foods,</b> and differ between the Swedish and Italian infant populations in mid- and late infancy, which may partly be due to differences in fat composition of their <b>weaning</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|E

40|$|Five million {{children}} aged {{less than five}} years die annually due to diarrhoea. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify some possible contributing factors for persistent diarrhoea. Seven <b>weaning</b> <b>foods,</b> including a locally-made food, were evaluated by estimating the microbial load using the most probable number method and aflatoxin levels (AFM 1, AFG 1, AFG 2, and AFB 2) by immunoaffinity column extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with detection of fluorescence. The results showed that the locally-made weaning food had the highest microbial count (2, 000 cfu/g) and faecal streptococcal count (25 cfu/g). Moulds isolated were mainly Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. glaucus, Cladosporium sp., and Penicillium sp. The home-made weaning food recorded the highest fungal count (6, 500 cfu/g). AFM 1 of the <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> was 4. 6 - 530 ng/mL. One weaning food had AFB 1 level of 4, 806 ng/g. Aflatoxin metabolites, apart from AFM 1 and AFB 1 present in the <b>weaning</b> <b>foods,</b> were AFG 1 and AFG 2. There were low microbial counts in commercial <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> but had high levels of aflatoxins (AFM 1, AFG 1, AFG 2, AFB 1, and AFB 2).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology to design feasible interventions to improve <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> hygiene practices of families living in extreme poverty. Educational messages to promote specific behavioural changes were defined and tested by utilizing {{a combination of}} ethnographic, survey and observational methods, and integrating viewpoints and suggestions of mothers and caretakers into the decision-making process. This new approach culminated in a household trial in which five groups, each of 15 non-practising mothers, were invited to adopt defined behaviours (handwashing before and after defined events, boiling water for reconstituting powdered milk, feeding gruel by spoon rather than bottlefeeding, not storing gruels and milks, and all four together). All initiated the advocated behaviours and most (53 - 80 %) sustained the new behaviours and practised them every time during a one-month period. Of the four advocated behaviours, spoon-feeding {{was the most difficult}} to adopt wholly. The methodology was developed in response to the high priority given to reducing <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> contamination for diarrhoeal disease control, and the lack of any existing methodology for defining appropriate educational interventions in resource-poor regions.

Apparent zinc absorption (isotope intake minus fecal excretion, expressed as the % of dose administered) was 31. 1 +/- 8. 3 % (x +/- SD) from the iron-fortified food and 28. 6 % 28. 6 +/- 10. 5 % from the unfortified food. These values were not significantly different, thus iron fortification of the <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> did not reduce zinc absorption...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{addition}} of different proportions of fermented and malted sorghum flours on the proximate composition, viscosity, pH and consumer acceptability of extruded instantised sorghum <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> were evaluated. The main {{objective was to}} increase the nutrient density of the weaning porridges through viscosity reduction, since low nutrient density {{has been identified as}} major obstacle in young child feeding. The extrudates did not differ greatly in their proximate composition. Addition of malted sorghum flour resulted in porridges with greatly reduced viscosities (1000 - 3000 cP). However, its addition caused an overall reduction in consumer acceptance. Addition of fermented sorghum flour resulted in some viscosity reduction, although not to the same extent achieved by malt addition. Samples made from plain and plain/fermented materials seemed to appeal to a number of consumers. It is concluded that porridges made from composites of extruded plain/malted/fermented sorghum flours seem to offer the best route to address the identified problem of child nutrition. To improve product consumer acceptability, it is recommended that approved food colours and flavours be incorporated in the extruded sorghum <b>weaning</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} inter-relationships {{between the}} feeding, health, {{and growth of}} infants (aged 0 - 24 months) in low-income households in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Mixed-longitudinal {{data were collected from}} a sample of 113 infants and their mothers in Kebele 11, Keftegna 24 from November 1987 to April 1988. Breastfeeding is the culturally esteemed mode of infant feeding. The culture-specific concept of weaning places the emphasis on the termination of breastfeeding, with little consideration of {{the quality and quantity of}} <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> As a result, <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> are basic and monotonous. Survival data analysis shows that weaning is commenced at the mean age of 9. 2 months, and completed at the median age of 20 months. A probabilistic model is proposed that includes a set of inter-related 'infant-centred', 'mother-centred', and other factors such as the seasonal availability of <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> influencing the process of weaning. Culturally-prescribed norms appear to play little or no part in the timing of weaning, in particular, the infant's age is of secondary importance. Direct observations of suckling behaviour and infant care reveal that 'on demand' breastfeeding was practised, and the mean duration of suckling sessions was 10. 96 minutes. The duration of breastfeeding was influenced significantly by maternal body-mass index. Seasonal patterns were detected in the prevalence of fever, coughing, and vomiting in the infants. Associations between morbidity and other data using log-linear models suggest that infant's diarrhoea is closely linked to the level of household hygiene, maternal education, and mother's morale. Infant's ilnesses caused appreciable deficits in weight, but not in stature. Processes of 'catch-up' and 'catch-down' growth are demonstrated by the seasonal effect of diarrhoeal illness on weight. Avenues for further research and policy reform suggested by the findings of this study are discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Favism is a {{potential}} obstacle {{to the use of}} the fava bean in the development of a locally produced, inexpensive <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> for the Middle East and North Africa. The purposes of this study were to define the epidemiology of favism, to evaluate the advisability of using the fava bean in a <b>weaning</b> <b>food,</b> and to suggest ways of avoiding or eliminating the toxic factor in the bean. Field observations, locally acquired data, and a literature review suggested that the use of the fava bean in a <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> would be hazardous, but that the hazard might be overcome by using certain strains of the bean or, more particularly, by using old dried beans. The disease is usually directly related in time to the harvesting and availability of fresh beans, but it is also associated with fresh dried beans. On the basis of the age distribution of the disease, patterns of bean consumption, and local food taboos it appears that the toxic factor is concentrated in the skin of the bean, that it is heat-stable, that in dried beans it decreases with age, and that it crosses into the breast milk of lactating mothers. It also appears that disease expression may be a result of the interaction of several host factors, such as nutritional status and the consumption of other foods. These observations are consistent with the results of laboratory studies, which incriminate vicine, divicine, and DOPA in the etiology of favism...|$|R
