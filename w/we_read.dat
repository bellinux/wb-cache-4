25|$|In Le Couteulx’ book of 1890 <b>we</b> <b>read</b> that ‘Le Chien de St Hubert actuel’ is very big, from 0m,69 to 0m,80 (27½-31½in) high. This {{does not}} {{accord with the}} 16th century {{descriptions}} of the St Hubert given above, nor with the FCI standard, {{but the idea that}} the St Hubert is much bigger (up to 0.915m, 36 in) than the Bloodhound persisted well into the 20th century, among some St Hubert enthusiasts.|$|E

25|$|But as fame {{of their}} unbeaten status spread, {{so did the}} status of their haka.

Nepia then led the All Blacks in their famous war dance, which was very impressive. One could almost hear a pin drop while it was rendered. The crowd again sang 'Sosban Fach' in reply.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close {{and listen to what}} she has to say like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is struck by the fact that even as <b>we</b> <b>read</b> her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
25|$|The speech which Weston {{delivers}} at the book's climax (in Chapter 20), and Ransom's {{effort to}} render {{it into the}} Old Solar spoken by the Malacandrians, demonstrate the enormous gulf in cultural and moral perceptions, which renders Weston's value judgements utterly untranslatable and {{may be said to}} make them absurd; thus creating a sort of social criticism. The “translation” that <b>we</b> <b>read</b> is to be understood as a back-translation into English of what Ransom said in Old Solar.|$|E

25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text <b>we</b> <b>read</b> there are different ways in which <b>we</b> <b>read</b> depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E
25|$|A Nielsen {{study shows}} {{consumers}} want {{a more personal}} connection {{in the way they}} gather information. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, hard facts. When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. But when <b>we</b> <b>read</b> a story, not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than hard facts.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the campaign, as related by Livy, and {{illustrated}} by the incidental anecdotes of Plutarch, are full of horror and they make clear that Cato reduced Hispania Citerior to subjection with great speed and little mercy. <b>We</b> <b>read</b> of multitudes who, after they had been stripped of all their arms, put themselves to death because of the dishonour, of extensive massacres of surrendered victims, and the frequent execution of harsh plunders. The phrase bellum se ipsum alet—the war feeds itself—was coined by Cato during this period. His proceedings in Hispania were not discrepant with the received idea of the fine old Roman soldier or with his own firm and over-assertive temper. He claimed to have destroyed more towns in Hispania than he had spent days in that country.|$|E

500|$|The Greek {{historian}} Strabo {{believed the}} Phoenicians originate from Bahrain. Herodotus {{also believed that}} the homeland of the Phoenicians was Bahrain. This theory was accepted by the 19th-century German classicist Arnold Heeren who said that: [...] "In the Greek geographers, for instance, <b>we</b> <b>read</b> of two islands, named Tyrus or Tylos, and Aradus, which boasted {{that they were the}} mother country of the Phoenicians, and exhibited relics of Phoenician temples." [...] The people of Tyre in particular have long maintained Persian Gulf origins, and the similarity in the words [...] "Tylos" [...] and [...] "Tyre" [...] has been commented upon. However, there is little evidence of any human settlement at all on Bahrain during the time when such migration had supposedly taken place.|$|E
500|$|Robert Fulford in the Toronto-based {{magazine}} Maclean's, {{noted that}} [...] "the characteristic which makes Fleming appear so silly also helps make him so popular: his moral simplicity.

[...] Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times, noted that Bond's mission [...] "is aimed at restoring Britain's pre-World War II place among the powers of the world. And on that subject, above all others, Ian Fleming's novels are endlessly, bitterly eloquent." [...] The Boston Globes Mary Castle opined that the agent's trip was [...] "Bond's latest and grimmest mission", which she called [...] "Escapism in the Grand Manner".|$|E

500|$|Azaria's work on {{the show}} has won him four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2015. He was also {{nominated}} for the award in 2009 and 2010, but lost to co-star Dan Castellaneta and guest star Anne Hathaway respectively. He was nominated again in 2012. Azaria, {{with the rest of}} the principal cast, reprised all of his voice roles from The Simpsons for the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie. Azaria notes that he spends [...] "an embarrassingly small amount of time working on The Simpsons." [...] He works for [...] "an hour on Thursdays when <b>we</b> <b>read</b> through the script, then four hours on Monday when we record it, and I'll pop in again once or twice." [...] He concludes it is [...] "the best job in the world, as far as I'm concerned." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to fire me, {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when <b>we</b> <b>read</b> the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement.

The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world up when <b>we</b> <b>read</b> it. Can you imagine a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head."
