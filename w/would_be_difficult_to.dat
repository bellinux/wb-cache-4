5|$|Blomkamp {{declared}} the project dead in late 2007, but Jackson replied {{that the film}} would still be made. Blomkamp and Jackson collaborated on District 9, but the director told /Film {{that he was no}} longer considering working on a Halo film if the opportunity arose, saying that after working on the film for five months before the project's collapse it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> return. The rights for the film have since reverted to Microsoft.|$|E

5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> identify, since {{it would not be}} singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper is more like short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E

5|$|Vulcanoids, {{should they}} exist, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect {{due to the}} strong glare of the nearby Sun, and {{ground-based}} searches can only be carried out during twilight or during solar eclipses. Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E
5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were considered and debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|However, Graham {{suggests}} that Lord Steyn's comments {{were limited to}} the use of the Parliament Acts and would not apply to legislation enacted using the ordinary legislative procedure. He also argues that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> explain how courts would refuse to apply legislation unless human rights were involved, citing the example of the removal of judicial review: using fundamental common law principles to interpret legislation is very different from striking down legislation supported by the elected House of Commons, and would be even more contentious if the legislation only substantially modified judicial review procedure.|$|E

5|$|On April 30, {{producers}} began scouting {{locations in}} Africa {{in order to}} film the feature in the upcoming weeks. The original plan was to shoot three days worth of scenes in Africa and then have Simi Valley, California fill in for the location. After realizing it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> fake, {{it was decided to}} shoot the majority of the film on location in Cape Town, South Africa. Filming took place from June 4 to June 20 with the final scenes being shot in Los Angeles, California. By July 13, principal shooting of the film had been completed and post-production had begun.|$|E
5|$|On {{the season}} {{having a big}} {{crossover}} in early 2017 like previous seasons, Bell said that any crossover {{will not be as}} large scale as the first season crossover with , which changed the premise of the series, and noted that the MCU film being released at that time is Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> tie-in with as it is not set on Earth, and takes place earlier in the MCU continuity than the season is set.|$|E
5|$|Squall was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modelled after late actor River Phoenix. Squall's weapon, the gunblade, also made so that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> master. In order to make players understand Squall's silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character's thoughts open to them. Squall's first voiced appearance {{was in the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for all other English-speaking appearances.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Sholay {{began as a}} four-line snippet which screenwriter pair Salim-Javed told G. P. Sippy and Ramesh Sippy; two other producer/director teams had earlier {{rejected}} the idea. Ramesh Sippy liked the concept and hired them to develop it. The original idea of the film involved an army officer who decided to hire two ex-soldiers to avenge {{the murder of his}} family. The army officer was later changed to a policeman because Sippy felt that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> get permission to shoot scenes depicting army activities. Salim-Javed completed the script in one month, incorporating names and personality traits of their friends and acquaintances.|$|E
5|$|The smash {{success of}} Docter's 2009 film Up {{encouraged}} those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film {{with a more}} sophisticated story. Inside Out is the first Pixar film without input from co-founder and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer John Lasseter, who was focused on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios in Los Angeles {{at the time of}} its production. Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making Inside Out, but acknowledged it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> market.|$|E

5|$|Two {{proposed}} {{forms for}} dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar {{fields such as}} quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually {{also included in the}} cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish from a cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the naming}} scheme as {{originally}} developed, these substems mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, a vowel, then another consonant. The final letter may be dropped if the resulting name <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> pronounce otherwise. Examples include -ci(r)- for the circulatory system, -li(m)- for the immune system (lim stands for lymphocyte) and -ne(r)- for the nervous system. The final letter is usually omitted if the following source substem begins with a consonant (such as -zu- or -xi-), but not all target substems are used in their shortened form. -mul-, for example, is never reduced to -mu- because no chimeric or humanized antibodies targeting the musculoskeletal system ever received an INN. Combination of target and source substems results in endings like -limumab (immune system, human) or -ciximab (circulatory system, chimeric, consonant r dropped).|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> counterfeit.|$|E

5|$|The BDF and its {{superior}} headquarters, the Seventh Area Army, initially disagreed {{over where}} the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade should be deployed. In July 1944 the BDF {{believed that the}} Allies were likely to invade northern Borneo in January 1945 or later, and wanted to station the brigade in this area. However, the Seventh Area Army judged that Allied forces {{were more likely to}} attack the Brunei Bay region in western Borneo to support a drive on Singapore. Moreover, the area army believed that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> transfer units from northern to western Borneo due to the island's rugged terrain. The BDF eventually won the debate, and the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade's units were landed in the Sandakan area of north-east Borneo as they arrived from Japan.|$|E
5|$|The entire park {{is within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, making it the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state (Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming). Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment for a crime committed solely in the unpopulated Idaho portion of the park (and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> do so for a crime committed solely in the lightly populated Montana portion). One defendant, who was accused of a wildlife-related crime in the Montana portion of the park, attempted to raise this argument but eventually pleaded guilty, with the plea deal including his specific agreement not to raise the issue in his appeal.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making {{it more likely that}} the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
