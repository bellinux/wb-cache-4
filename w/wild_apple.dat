Across the meadow, to dine on the remembrance of field mice--alas! safe {{now under the}} crust; along the brook, where he once caught frogs; through the thicket, where the grouse were hatched; past the bullbrier tangle, where the covey of quail once rested nightly; into the farmyard, where the dog is loose and the chickens are safe under lock and key, instead of roosting in trees; across the highway, and through the swamp, and into the big bare empty woods; till in the sad gray morning light he digs under the <b>wild</b> <b>apple</b> tree and {{sits down on the}} snow to eat a frozen apple, lest his stomach cry too loudly while he sleeps the day away and tries to forget that he is hungry.|$|E
60|$|He lived most of {{the time}} on a ridge behind the 'Fales place,' an {{abandoned}} farm on the east of the old post road. This was his middle range, a place of dense coverts, bullbrier thickets and sunny open spots among the ledges, where you might, with good-luck, find him on special days at any season. But he had all the migratory instincts of a Newfoundland caribou. In winter he moved south, with twenty other grouse, {{to the foot of the}} ridge, which dropped away into a succession of knolls and ravines and sunny, well-protected little valleys, where food was plenty. Here, fifty years ago, was the farm pasture; but now it had grown up everywhere with thickets and berry patches, and <b>wild</b> <b>apple</b> trees of the birds' planting.

The fruit, according to him, is about {{an inch and a half}} in diameter, and is intensely acid. Yet they make fine sweet-meats, and also cider of them.

60|$|Fourth. There is a {{fruit that}} is wild. 'I looked for grapes and it brought forth wild grapes' (Isa 5:4). I observe, that {{as there are}} trees and herbs that are wholly right and noble, fit indeed for the vineyard; so there are also their semblance, but wild; not right, but ignoble. There is the grape, and the wild grape; the vine, and the wild vine; the rose, and canker rose; flowers and wild flowers; the apple, and the <b>wild</b> <b>apple</b> which we call the crab. Now, fruit from these wild things, however they may please the {{children}} to play with, yet the prudent and grave count them of little or no value. There {{are also in the}} world a generation of professors that, notwithstanding their profession, are wild by nature; yea, such as were never cut out, or off, from the wild olive-tree, nor never yet planted into the good olive-tree. Now, these can bring nothing forth but wild olive berries, they cannot bring forth fruit unto God. Such are all those that have lightly taken up a profession, and crept into the vineyard without a new birth, and the blessing of regeneration.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the ground}} was not yet quite covered, and again {{near the end of}} winter, when the snow was melted on my south {{hillside}} and about my wood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there. Whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high, which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust, for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently covered up by drifts, and, it is said, [...] "sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two." [...] I used to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of the woods at sunset to [...] "bud" [...] the <b>wild</b> <b>apple</b> trees. They will come regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little.

From 6000 to 7000 feet, plants of the temperate regions blend with the tropical; such as rhododendron, oak, ivy, geranium, berberry, clematis, and shrubby Vaccinia, which all made their appearance at Loongtoong, another Bhoteea village. Here, too, I first saw a praying machine, turned by water; it was enclosed in a little wooden house, and consisted of an upright cylinder containing a prayer, and with the words, [...] "Om mani padmi om," [...] (Hail to him of the Lotus and Jewel) painted on the circumference: it was placed over a stream, and made to rotate on its axis by a spindle which passed through the floor of the building into the water, and was terminated by a wheel.|$|E
