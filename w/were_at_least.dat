5|$|Throughout Madagascar, a {{total of}} 68casualties were {{reported}} and 100,000people were left homeless. Damage totaled to more than $250million (1984USD).

5|$|A {{little more}} than thirty years later, in August 1964, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom led an expedition from Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History which discovered more skeletal material near Bridger. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the type specimen (YPM 5205) of Deinonychus was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.|$|E

5|$|At {{its final}} {{landfall}} in Guangdong, Imbudo produced strong winds, with a peak gust of 200km/h (124mph) measured at Shangchuan Island. At Yangjiang, gusts reached 159km/h (99mph), causing eleven boats to sink. There, over 10,000trees fell {{due to the}} strong winds, more than half in the city, and 7,649homes were damaged or destroyed. In Zhanjiang, the storm damaged power lines and water pumps, leaving residents without access to water. Imbudo spawned tornadoes in Luoding and Zhanjiang, damaging dozens of houses and killing 6,000chickens. Throughout Guangdong, Imbudo destroyed 595,000houses and caused ¥1.9billion (CNY, $230million USD). There <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> eight deaths in the province.|$|E

Cornell {{was one of the}} first Universities to elect trustees by direct election. (Harvard was probably the first to shift to direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.|$|E

In comparison, over a similar time period, the entries for cocaine and MDMA were accessed approximately 2400 times. After mephedrone was made illegal the number of inquiries to the NPIS fell substantially, to only 19 in June 2010.|$|E
