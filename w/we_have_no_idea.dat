5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti" [...] {{was directed by}} Simon Brand, and was premiered through Vevo on July 19, 2013. Amaris Castilloof of Latina summarized that Fernández and Aguilera [...] "appear {{to be in an}} abandoned mansion and overwhelmed with a tremendous desire for each other." [...] She provided a mixed review for the video, questioning if the [...] "glimpses of skin touching, scenes of someone swimming (<b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who) with luxurious pearls, and a cheesy telenovela-esque embrace" [...] were overdone.|$|E

Everything {{that was done}} at that time, we did it really without very much research. We just said let's build a line, let's design the stores, the marketing, the dollar price points. We went with bright colours and tasty colours {{because it was a}} food store, and all of these things were all done intuitively, and it worked.|$|R

500|$|In 1998, Hawke {{appeared}} alongside Gwyneth Paltrow and Robert De Niro in Great Expectations, {{a contemporary}} film {{adaptation of the}} Charles Dickens novel of the same name, directed by Alfonso Cuarón. During the same year, Hawke collaborated with Linklater again on The Newton Boys, based on {{the true story of}} the Newton Gang. Critical reviews for both films were mixed. The following year, Hawke starred in Snow Falling on Cedars, based on David Guterson's novel of the same title. The film met with an unenthusiastic reception; Entertainment Weekly noted, [...] "Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who Ishmael is or why he acts as he does." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Acércate" [...] {{was leaked}} onto the Internet {{prior to the}} album's release; a first in Queen's 15-year career. Originally {{entitled}} [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} infringement and included on the album retitled [...] "Acércate". Reflecting on the situation Queen stated: [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song. We have good chemistry and friendship. We tried to change the song and lyrics, but with their agenda, which is tight, and mine too, we could not do it again. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who hacked, all the music was in a studio and to mobilize it to another was what someone did." [...] The collaboration stemmed from Queen's previous collaboration with Wisin & Yandel on their seventh studio album La Revolución (2009) on [...] "Perfecto" [...] which also featured Yaviah.|$|E
500|$|This episode marked Hardin's first {{appearance}} as Deep Throat. Series creator Chris Carter {{stated that the}} character {{was inspired by the}} historical Deep Throat, an informant who leaked information about the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. This Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. Carter created the character {{to bridge the gap between}} Mulder and Scully and the shadowy conspirators working against them; describing Deep Throat as a man [...] "who works in some level of government that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> exists". Carter was drawn to Hardin after seeing him in The Firm, and described the casting as an [...] "easy choice". Hardin flew to Vancouver every few weeks to film his scenes. Carter called Hardin's portrayal [...] "very, very good".|$|E

500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{has stated}} that the {{character}} of Deep Throat was [...] "of course" [...] inspired by the historical Deep Throat. The real Deep Throat was an informant leaking information on the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. After the conclusion of The X-Files, this Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence on the fictional Deep Throat was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. In the film, Sutherland's X reveals information {{about the possibility that}} the assassination of John F. Kennedy was orchestrated by elements within the American government. Carter felt he needed to create a character who would bridge the gap between FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and the shadowy conspirators who were working against them; he conceived of a character [...] "who works in some level of government that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> exists".|$|E
500|$|An {{agreement}} {{signed by}} Disney and Stokowski on December 16, 1937, allowed the conductor to [...] "select and employ a complete symphony orchestra" [...] for the recording. Disney hired a {{stage at the}} Culver Studios in California for the session. It began at midnight on January 9, 1938, and lasted for three hours using eighty-five Hollywood musicians. As production costs of The Sorcerer's Apprentice climbed to $125,000, it became clearer to Disney and his brother Roy, who managed the studio's finances, that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own. Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum. He said, [...] "because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what can be expected from such a production." [...] Ben Sharpsteen, a production supervisor on Fantasia, noted that its budget was {{three to four times}} greater than the usual Silly Symphony, but Disney [...] "saw this trouble {{in the form of an}} opportunity. This was the birth of a new concept, a group of separate numbers—regardless of their running time—put together in a single presentation. It turned out to be a concert—something novel and of high quality." ...|$|E
500|$|The lead single, [...] "La Vida es Así", was {{released}} on May 11; the music video (directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on May 17 in Miami and premiered on mun2 on June 22 and VEVO on June 28. Queen said that the genre of bachata is meaningful, since it reveals more feelings. The a cappella version of [...] "La Vida es Así" [...] was sent to Tainy and Keko Musik for production, allowing Queen to pick the version she preferred. The Keko Musik version was later released as a pre-order bonus track for Drama Queen on iTunes. The second single, [...] "Amor Puro" [...] {{was released}} for Puerto Rican radio on September 24. The music video (also directed by Marlon Pena) was shot on September 28, and premiered on VEVO November 30. The video was also filmed in Miami, at the Spanish monastery of St. Bernard of Clairvaux (a historic building dating to 1133 in Sacramenia, Segovia, Spain, later reconstructed in Miami). [...] "Acércate" [...] was leaked online before the album was released, the first time Queen experienced copyright infringement in her 15-year career. Originally titled [...] "No Te Equivoques", it was re-recorded {{in response to the}} copyright violation and retitled [...] "Acércate". She said, [...] "Sometimes they try to hurt you are when you do well. I'm proud and grateful that Wisin & Yandel have gone with me to the studio to record the song.

Despite this awkwardness, [...] is very interesting because every infinite model of TST restricted to three types satisfies Amb.

Jagannathan, the character played by Lal Sir , is like that. He will do anything to win". He describes Peruchazhi as a spoof about how a politician from Kerala ends up being the chief political adviser to a state election campaign in California and the havoc he creates while chasing success there. Since Vaidyanathan wanted the protagonist to have international appeal, he named him [...] "Ulaganathan" [...] (conqueror of the world) in his original Tamil script; in Malayalam the name was changed to [...] "Jagannathan", its meaning unchanged.|$|E
