Carter Dotson of TouchArcade found VA-11 HALL-A to be [...] "kind of an odd one" [...] and [...] "certainly something unique", writing that [...] "I'm not completely {{sure what to}} make of it, and I'm interested to see how it works out when completed. After all, a game that's story-driven lives and dies on the quality of said story." [...] He compared it to Her Story as something that could [...] "prove to be [...] very cool." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Kyle LeClair of Hardcore Gamer, writing that [...] "VA-11 Hall-A sure looks great and has quite a unique hook to it, so we'll be sure to try and wet our whistles with it <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> on the PC". Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun claimed that although [...] "VA-11 Hall-A, whose punctuation I already resent having to type, is skirting with genres I don't care about: anime-styled visual novels", he found VA-11 HALL-As branching-style plotline to be more engaging that an average [...] "linear and relatively uninteractive" [...] visual novel.

6000|$|MY DEAR HODGSON,--We are not {{answerable}} for {{reports of}} speeches in the papers; {{they are always}} given incorrectly, and on this occasion more so than usual, from {{the debate in the}} Commons on the same night. The Morning Post should have said eighteen years. However, you will find the speech, as spoken, in the Parliamentary Register, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out.</b> Lords Holland and Grenville, particularly the latter, paid me some high compliments {{in the course of their}} speeches, as you may have seen in the papers, and Lords Eldon and Harrowby answered me. I have had many marvellous eulogies [1] repeated to me since, in person and by proxy, from divers persons ministerial--yea, ministerial!--as well as oppositionists; of them I shall only mention Sir F. Burdett. He says it is the best speech by a lord since the [...] "Lord knows when," [...] probably from a fellow-feeling in the sentiments. Lord H. tells me I shall beat them all if I persevere; and Lord G. remarked that the construction of some of my periods are very like Burke's!! And so much for vanity. I spoke very violent sentences with a sort of modest impudence, abused every thing and every body, and put the Lord Chancellor very much out of humour: and if I may believe what I hear, have not lost any character by the experiment. As to my delivery, loud and fluent enough, perhaps a little theatrical. I could not recognize myself or any one else in the newspapers [2].|$|E
60|$|I {{have left}} Windsor these ten days, and am deep in pills with asafoetida, and a steel bitter drink; and I find my head {{much better than}} it was. I was very much discouraged; for I used to be ill {{for three or four}} days {{together}}, ready to totter as I walked. I take eight pills a day, and have taken, I believe, a hundred and fifty already. The Queen, Lord Treasurer, Lady Masham, and I, were all ill together, but are now all better; only Lady Masham expects every day to lie in at Kensington. There was never such a lump of lies spread about the town together as now. I doubt not but you will have them in Dublin before this comes to you, and all without the least grounds of truth. I have been mightily put backward in something I am writing by my illness, but hope to fetch it up, so as to be ready when the Parliament meets. Lord Treasurer has had an ugly fit of the rheumatism, but is now near quite well. I was playing at one-and-thirty with him and his family t'other night. He gave us all twelvepence apiece to begin with: it put me in mind of Sir William Temple.(2) I asked both him and Lady Masham seriously whether the Queen were at all inclined to a dropsy, and they positively assured me she was not: so did her physician Arbuthnot, who always attends her. Yet these devils have spread that she has holes in her legs, and runs at her navel, and I know not what. Arbuthnot has sent me from Windsor a pretty Discourse upon Lying, and I have ordered the printer to come for it. It is a proposal for publishing a curious piece, called The Art of Political Lying, in two volumes, etc. And then there is an abstract of the first volume, just like those pamphlets which they call The Works of the Learned.(3) Pray get it <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>out.</b> The Queen has a little of the gout in one of her hands. I believe she will stay a month still at Windsor. Lord Treasurer showed me the kindest letter from her in the world, by which I picked out one secret, that there will be soon made some Knights of the Garter. You know another is fallen by Lord Godolphin's death: he will be buried {{in a day or two}} at Westminster Abbey. I saw Tom Leigh(4) in town once. The Bishop of Clogher has taken his lodging for the winter; they are all well. I hear there are in town abundance of people from Ireland; half a dozen bishops at least. The poor old Bishop of London,(5) at past fourscore, fell down backward going upstairs, and I think broke or cracked his skull; yet is now recovering. The town is as empty as at midsummer; and if I had not occasion for physic, I would be at Windsor still. Did I tell you of Lord Rivers's will? He has left legacies to about twenty paltry old whores by name, and not a farthing to any friend, dependent, or relation: he has left from his only child, Lady Barrymore,(6) her mother's estate, and given the whole to his heir-male, a popish priest, a second cousin, who is now Earl Rivers, and whom he used in his life like a footman. After him it goes to his chief wench and bastard. Lord Treasurer and Lord Chamberlain are executors of this hopeful will. I loved the man, and detest his memory. We hear nothing of peace yet: I believe verily the Dutch are so wilful, because they are told the Queen cannot live. I had poor MD's letter, N.3,(7) at Windsor: but I could not answer it then; poor Pdfr was vely kick(8) then: and, besides, it was a very inconvenient place to send letters from. Oo thought to come home the same day, and stayed a month: that was a sign the place was agreeable.(9) I should love such a sort of jaunt. Is that lad Swanton(10) a little more fixed than he used to be? I think you like the girl very well. She has left off her grave airs, I suppose. I am now told Lord Godolphin was buried last night.--O poo Ppt! lay down oo head aden, fais I...; I always reckon if oo are ill I shall hear it, and therefore hen oo are silent I reckon all is well.(11) I believe I 'scaped the new fever(12) for the same reason that Ppt did, because I am not well; but why should DD 'scape it, pray? She is melthigal, oo know, and ought to have the fever; but I hope it is now too late, and she won't have it at all. Some physicians here talk very melancholy, and think it foreruns the plague, which is actually at Hamburg. I hoped Ppt would have done with her illness; but I think we both have that faculty never to part with a disorder for ever; we are very constant. I have had my giddiness twenty-three years by fits. Will Mrs. Raymond never have done lying-in? He intends to leave beggars enough; for I daresay he has squandered away the best part of his fortune already, and is not out of debt. I had a letter from him lately.|$|E
