25|$|A <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prism</b> {{is another}} {{birefringent}} polarizer {{consisting of two}} triangular calcite prisms with orthogonal crystal axes that are cemented together. At the internal interface, an unpolarized beam splits into two linearly polarized rays which leave the prism at a divergence angle of 15°–45°. The Rochon and Sénarmont prisms are similar, but use different optical axis orientations in the two prisms. The Sénarmont prism is air spaced, unlike the Wollaston and Rochon prisms. These prisms truly split the beam into two fully polarized beams with perpendicular polarizations.

25|$|The system {{consists}} of a special prism (Nomarski prism, <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prism)</b> in the condenser that splits light in an ordinary and an extraordinary beam. The spatial {{difference between the two}} beams is minimal (less than the maximum resolution of the objective). After passage through the specimen, the beams are reunited by a similar prism in the objective.|$|E
25|$|When an {{arbitrary}} {{beam of light}} strikes {{the surface of a}} birefringent material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. Unpolarized light consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to Snell's law of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective refractive index which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prism</b> which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a birefringent material such as calcite.|$|E

40|$|The neutron Larmor {{diffraction}} {{technique has}} been implemented using superconducting magnetic <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prisms</b> in both single-arm and double-arm configurations. Successful {{measurements of the}} {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of a single-crystal copper sample demonstrates that the method works as expected. The experiment involves a new method of tuning by varying the magnetic field configurations in the device and the tuning results agree well with previous measurements. The difference between single-arm and double-arm configurations has been investigated experimentally. We conclude that this measurement benchmarks the applications of magnetic <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prisms</b> in Larmor diffraction and shows in principle that the setup can be used for inelastic phonon line-width measurements. The achievable resolution for Larmor diffraction is comparable to that using Neutron Resonance Spin Echo (NRSE) coils.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a digital three-wavelength holographic interferometer {{based on the}} use of two <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prisms.</b> This provides an in-line setup with quasi common-path and as a consequence there is no additional independent reference wave to be added. Thus, immunity to external perturbations such as vibrations or thermal perturbations is achieved. Furthermore, the set-up exhibits a single shot and real time capability which is very useful to study dynamic events. By using the two <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prisms</b> in an astigmatic configuration, spatial carrier frequencies can be adjusted both in amplitude and orientation. The digital hologram processing is based on Fourier processing and filtering around the carrier spatial frequency so that phase shifting is not required.

50|$|A Nomarski prism is a {{modification}} of the <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prism</b> that is used in differential interference contrast microscopy. It is named after its inventor, Polish physicist Georges Nomarski. Like the <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prism,</b> the Nomarski prism consists of two birefringent crystal wedges (e.g. quartz or calcite) cemented together at the hypotenuse (e.g. with Canada balsam). One of the wedges is identical to a conventional Wollaston wedge and has the optical axis oriented parallel {{to the surface of}} the prism. The second wedge of the prism is modified by cutting the crystal in such a manner that the optical axis is oriented obliquely with respect to the flat surface of the prism. The Nomarski modification causes the light rays to come to a focal point outside the body of the prism, and allows greater flexibility so that when setting up the microscope the prism can be actively focused.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the {{improvements to the}} image replicating imaging spectrometer (IRIS) {{and the development of}} novel applications in the field of oximetry. IRIS is a snapshot multispectral device with a high transmission output and no need of inversion for data recovering, hence, with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). IRIS shows great versatility due to the possibility of choosing multiple contiguous or non-contiguous wavelengths inside its free spectral range. IRIS uses a set of waveplates and <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prisms</b> to demultiplex the spectral information of an object and replicate the image of such object in different wavelengths. The birefringent nature of IRIS means that different wavelengths are separated by the <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prisms</b> with different angles, introducing multiple images of the same object. In addition, the spectral transmission function shows multiple spectral sidelobes that contaminate each IRIS band with light belonging to other wavelengths. These issues can lower the performance of IRIS as a multispectral imaging device. In this thesis, these problems were assessed with the introduction of a filter plate array placed in the image plane of the optical system. This filter array is a set of narrow-band filters (Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) = 10 ± 2 nm) that removes undesired wavelengths from each IRIS band. Since the spectral transmission of IRIS is replicated along the free spectral range, the filters can be designed to match any of the present spectral lobes in IRIS. The design and fabrication of a filter array enhance the performance of IRIS as a multispectral imaging device: it allows wavelength selection and improves spectral and spatial image quality. The design and manufacture of the corresponding filter holder and camera adapter were critical in terms of offering an easy filter-camera implementation. The filter plate allowed the removal of other dispersed wavelengths by the <b>Wollaston</b> <b>prisms,</b> improving image registration between the set of spectral images created by IRIS, and so, improving the quality of the registered spectral 3 -D cube. The implemented improvements on IRIS allow high quality, calibration-free oximetry using eight different wavelengths optimised for oximetry. Two main experiments were performed: 1) Using an inverted microscopy interfaced with IRIS and a linear spectral unmixing technique, we measured the deoxygenation of single horse red blood cells (RBC) in vitro in real time. The oximetry was performed with a subcellular spatial resolution of 0. 5 μ m, a temporal resolution of 30 Hz, and an accuracy (standard error of the mean) of ± 1. 1...|$|R
