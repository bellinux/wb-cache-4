25|$|Even {{when not}} under indictment, he {{prepared}} for inevitable charges (knowing the FBI <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him).</b> Almost {{every day he}} would return from his residence to his mother's apartment at 225 Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village and emerge dressed in a bathrobe and pajamas or a windbreaker and shabby trousers. Accompanied by one or two bodyguards, he crossed {{the street to the}} Triangle Civic Improvement Association — a dingy storefront club that served as his headquarters — where he played pinochle and held whispered conversations with his associates. Regular visitors to the Triangle included senior Genovese caporegimes Liborio Bellomo, John Ardito, Tino Fiumara, Ernest Muscarella and Daniel Leo. From Gigante's 1990 indictment and after his incarceration (in La Tuna, Texas) these men ran the crime family, with all major choices authorized by Gigante from his prison cell.|$|E
500|$|Several {{incidents}} hindered {{the production}} of the episode. The prop department for The X-Files initially made a fake ransom note for the scene wherein Mrs. LaPierre automatically writes the kidnappers message. A crew member for the show later took the note, along with a folder of other documents to one of the filming locations. Before arriving at the location, he stopped {{to make a phone call}} from a pay phone. A person, however, <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> from their house and, being suspicious, called the police. Unfortunately for the crew member, he left the folder and note, which included the line [...] "Don't do anything or we'll kill your baby" [...] at the booth. When the individual went back to retrieve the note, he was promptly arrested. Director Kim Manners later called the situation a [...] "mess".|$|E
2500|$|The album characterizes {{a person}} who becomes trapped in a {{lighthouse}} after leaving the earth. He tries to fight against his destiny, which Atropos and her other two sisters decided for him but he finds out he can't overcome his destiny so he starts writing his [...] "Will to Live". And in the end when he's dying, he's saying his last words in [...] "An Audience" [...] that he feels Atropos is {{standing next to him}} and she's ready to cut his thread of life and finish him. But we find out that this person was in love with Atropos and he was waiting for his time to come, which Atropos comes along then he can see her face and say goodbye to this world. That's when he starts describing beauty of Atropos to his only audience that <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> dying, which is a [...] "Snail" [...] and asking that snail to describe Atropos' beauty to anyone he see.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a murmur}} of sympathy and agreement, and Leland {{saw that the}} rest <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> curiously.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} face Geraldine Conyers, who had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> with interest. Lady Anselman at once {{introduced}} them.|$|R

2500|$|A Saturday-evening game {{left the}} Buccaneers {{as the first}} winners of the 1981 season. The Buccaneers scored on a 55-yard pass from Doug Williams to Kevin House, and a 10-yard Williams run. The Buccaneers' rushing attack struggled, {{although}} Jerry Eckwood had an apparent 39-yard touchdown run that was called back due to penalty. Williams was held to 8 completions on 22 attempts for only 108 yards, but was able to lead a 76-yard scoring drive in the fourth quarter, after the Vikings had closed to within 7–6 {{on a pair of}} Rick Danmeier field goals. The Vikings answered with a 72-yard drive of their own that ended in a 4-yard Steve Dils touchdown pass to Joe Senser. With Tampa Bay holding a 14–13 lead, Neal Colzie sealed the victory by returning his second interception of the day 82 yards for a touchdown, preventing the Vikings' potentially game-winning field goal attempt. McKay later said, [...] "Neal pulled us out of the fire. As I <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> run it back, I could only think how glad I was we picked him up last year". Dils passed for 361 yards on 62 attempts, still the most pass attempts against the Buccaneers in a game. The Buccaneers set several team records which still stand, including most passing attempts, completions, and first downs, and Dana Nafziger's 6 special teams tackles.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> {{so long for}} nothing,' {{returned}} Nadgett. 'I never watched a man so close as I have watched him.' ...|$|R
60|$|Stephen, {{checked by}} {{the crowd at the}} door, halted irresolutely. From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's dark eyes <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Norgate made no reply. He {{felt that}} his {{companion}} <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|The action had {{a horrible}} suggestiveness to the guilty wretch who <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Again Aynesworth {{preferred}} to reply by a gesture only. Barrington <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> steadily.|$|E
6000|$|She {{continues}} to smile, but she <b>is</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> closely. 'I haven't {{been for a}} walk. Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?' ...|$|R

60|$|There {{could be}} no mistake. The live eye that had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> {{through a hole in}} the {{tapestry}} was gone. The firelight no longer shone on a reflecting surface.|$|R
6000|$|Lawrence {{looked from}} the {{note to the}} cashier, who had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> as he read. [...] "Does Mr Candy want me to leave three dollars with you?" [...] he asked.|$|R
60|$|Kiki {{looked up}} and saw that a sparrow, perched upon a branch, <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then for {{a moment}} or two she was silent. She <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> a little curiously.|$|E
60|$|He just {{glanced at}} it, proving he knew well its wording. Mary Louise <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> closely.|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} a pause. Jasper Grinder looked anxiously toward the outer cave, to see if Baxter or the guide <b>were</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b> But the two were talking earnestly between themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who is {{that man}} {{you have just}} been talking to, Gulston? I have <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> for some time. He has not been dancing, but has been {{standing}} in corners looking on." ...|$|R
50|$|Detective Craddock finds Thubway Tham {{working in}} a cigar store. Tham says he is {{reformed}} and {{wants to be an}} honest businessman. Craddock leaves him alone, but says he will <b>be</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Constable <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> mutely, {{striving to}} read in his grave eyes the effect of her pleadings.|$|E
60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> {{with that}} curious {{look in her}} eyes which he never wholly understood--half mocking, half tender.|$|E
60|$|Ella <b>was</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him.</b> Her {{eyes were}} very bright, {{and there was}} more colour than usual in her cheeks.|$|E
