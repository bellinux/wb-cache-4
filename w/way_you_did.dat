2500|$|On 25 November 2016, Deep Purple {{announced}} Infinite as {{the title}} of their twentieth studio album, which was released on 7 April 2017. In support for the album, Deep Purple embarked on 13 May 2017 in Bucharest, Romania on The Long Goodbye Tour due to end on 15 December 2017 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the time of the tour's announcement in December 2016, Paice told the Heavyworlds website it [...] "may be the last big tour", adding that the band [...] "don't know". He described the tour as being long in duration, and said: [...] "We haven't made any hard, fast plans, but it becomes obvious that you cannot tour the same <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> when you were 21. It becomes more and more difficult. People have other things in their lives, which take time. But never say never." [...] On 3 February 2017, Deep Purple released a video version of [...] "Time for Bedlam", the first track taken from the new album and the first new Deep Purple track for almost four years.|$|E

6000|$|Meanwhile {{the two men}} {{remaining}} in the sitting-room drew nearer to each other, and the opera-singer broke the silence by saying, 'How could you insult me in the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> calling me a fellow, and accusing me of poisoning her mind toward you, when you knew very well I was as ignorant of your relation to her as an unborn babe?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> feel? Well, it {{was very}} simple.

I'm sure I don't know why you should lose your temper like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You say it {{yourself}} often enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} forget," [...] Anna said calmly, [...] "that it is {{necessary}} for me also--to live. I arrived here with something less than five pounds in my pocket. My reception at West Kensington you know of.

He said you were a crook and that they had got to watch you. Well, I knew then why you had come here.

6000|$|... "Come {{down to the}} house, Kilmeny. I have {{something}} there to show you--something lovelier than you have ever seen before," [...] he said, with boyish pleasure shining in his eyes.

6000|$|Jim and {{the warden}} listened with growing {{interest}} and appreciation while Pat unfolded the story. When it ended the warden gravely arose {{and walked over}} to Sparrer. [...] "Shake hands over again, son," [...] said he, to the boy's great confusion.

6000|$|His father, who {{had retired}} from the {{military}} profession rather early in life, had wished him {{to go into the}} army; but he was not urgent, speaking to him less like a father to a son than a middle-aged gentleman to a young friend in whom he took a considerable interest, but who was his own master. [...] "It's all very well to say 'Go into the army,'" [...] his son would answer; [...] "but I can't do it in the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> and I strongly object to the competitive system." [...] And so the matter ended.|$|E
