500|$|All {{tickets for}} the Wonder World Tour were sold {{exclusively}} through paperless ticket delivery, meaning that fans did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card {{used to make the}} purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry. All groups were to enter the concert together, and ushers issued seat locator slips. The method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008–10). However, it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing. This was done in response to the extensive ticket scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour and in order to give fans the opportunity to purchase good tickets at face value. Cyrus' manager and president of Morey Management Group, Jason Morey, stated, [...] "The focus was, 'How do we take all the information <b>we</b> <b>gathered</b> last time out and {{do a better job of}} it?' It was important to us to address the issue of demand. We thought that of every single option that was available out there, this was a really viable option, to go with the paperless ticketing." [...] As with the Best of Both Worlds Tour, one dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer.|$|E

And we’re elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on Twitter—if anyone deserves global notoriety it’s Kony." [...] She added: [...] "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge {{of one of the most}} brutal rebel groups in Africa." [...] HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, [...] "we definitely support the message of the film and we think it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA." [...] Amnesty International, which had documented what it described as the LRA's [...] "horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda" [...] and for years had been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested, welcomed the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: [...] "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," [...] but added: [...] "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights", especially because [...] "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.|$|E

None of our talks was taped and I never took a paper and pencil when I talked with him. His key people were the commanders. Nothing could happen on the Serbian side without Milošević's order or his knowledge." ...|$|E

2500|$|Borzou Daragahi Iraq {{correspondent}} for the Los Angeles Times, {{in an interview with}} PBS, questioned the study based on their earlier research in Iraq, saying, [...] "Well, we think—the Los Angeles Times thinks these numbers are too large, depending on the extensive research we've done. Earlier this year, around June, the report was published at least in June, but the reporting was done over weeks earlier. We went to morgues, cemeteries, hospitals, health officials, and <b>we</b> <b>gathered</b> as many statistics as we could on the actual dead bodies, and the number we came up with around June was about at least 50,000. And that kind of jibed with some of the news report that were out there, the accumulation of news reports, in terms of the numbers killed. The U.N. says that there's about 3,000 a month being killed; that also fits in with our numbers and with morgue numbers. This number of 600,000 or more killed {{since the beginning of the}} war, it's way off our charts." ...|$|E
2500|$|ISM activist Richard Purssell testified, [...] "hey began {{demolishing}} one house. <b>We</b> <b>gathered</b> {{around and}} called out to them {{and went into the}} house, so they backed out. During the entire time they knew who we were and what we were doing, because they didn't shoot at us. We stood in their way and shouted. There were about eight of us in an area about 70 square meters. Suddenly, we saw they turned to a house they had started to demolish before, and I saw Rachel {{standing in the way of}} the front bulldozer." [...] Human-rights activists and Palestinians say that the demolitions had also been accompanied by gunﬁre from Israeli snipers. The director of Rafah's hospital, Dr. Ali Moussa said that 240 Palestinians, including 78 children, had been killed since the Al-Aqsa Intifada began in 2001, [...] "Every night there is shooting at houses in which children are sleeping, without any attacks from Palestinians." [...] The United Nations said that 582 Rafah homes were demolished and 721 damaged, with 5,305 people made homeless.|$|E
