25|$|It is {{difficult}} to differentiate the <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> Provincial Pampa de Achala from the Pampa de Achala itself. The <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> was purposely created to protect the Pampa. Its boundaries are set by geographical features: the northern boundary reaches the provincial route RP 28 (formerly the National Road RN 20), which surrounds the massif of Los Gigantes. The southern boundary is Mount Champaquí, 2,790 meters high. Its eastern and western limits are set by the high altitude of 1,500 meters. In this region are the highest peaks of the province.|$|E
25|$|The {{region was}} {{declared}} a Provincial <b>Water</b> <b>Reserve</b> in 1999 {{due to the}} area receiving the most precipitation in the province (in the form of both rain and snow), providing most of the water resources for Cordoba and surrounding provinces.|$|E
25|$|The canal connects seven natural moraine-dammed lakes: Necko, Białe, Studzieniczne, Orle, Paniewo, Krzywe and Mikaszewo; and 11 rivers: Biebrza, Netta, Czarna Hańcza, Klonownica, Plaska (Sucha Rzeczka, Serwianka), Mikaszówka, Perkucia, Szlamica, Wolkuszanka, Ostaszanka and Neman. The natural {{waterways}} are interconnected by cuttings and hydraulic installations with {{locks and}} weirs, including towpaths along the canal bank {{and a system}} of roads, bridges and buildings. A <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> feeding the canal is provided from outside the buffer zone by the Sajno, Serwy and Wigry lakes, all {{within the boundaries of}} the protected area. Six historic sluices, Przewięź, Paniewo, Perkuć, Sosnówek, Tartak and Kudrynki, are easy to access from the green trail used by hikers and cyclists.|$|E

25|$|Stoke Newington East and West Reservoirs, to {{the north}} of Clissold Park, are quite {{substantial}} for urban facilities. Stoke Newington Reservoirs were constructed in 1833 to purify the New River water and to act as a <b>water</b> <b>reserve.</b> The West Reservoir is now a leisure facility, offering sailing, canoeing and other water sports, plus Royal Yachting Association-approved sailing courses. On its western edge stands the former filter house, now set out as a visitor centre with a café; some of the old hydraulic machinery can be viewed in the main hall. The pumping station at the reservoir gates, converted to a climbing centre in 1995 was designed in a distinctive castellated style by Robert Billings under the supervision of William Chadwell Mylne and built in 1854–56.|$|E
25|$|The reactor is {{equipped}} with an emergency core cooling system (ECCS), consisting of dedicated <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> tank, hydraulic accumulators, and pumps. ECCS piping is integrated with the normal reactor cooling system. In case of total loss of power, the ECCS pumps {{are supposed to be}} powered by the rotational momentum of the turbogenerator rotor for the time before the diesel generators come online. The Chernobyl disaster occurred during a botched test of this system. The ECCS has three systems, connected to the coolant system headers. In case of damage, the first ECCS subsystem provides cooling for up to 100 seconds to the damaged half of the coolant circuit (the other half is cooled by the main circulation pumps), and the other two subsystems then handle long-term cooling of the reactor.|$|E
25|$|The Rigole de la plaine carries {{water from}} the Sor tapped from an offtake at Pont Crouzet for {{irrigation}} before emptying into the Canal du Midi. In addition individual samples are collected from the water on the area between Revel and the seuil de Naurouze. In 1980 the Lac de la Ganguise was built near Castelnaudary providing a <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> of 22 million m3. In 2005 the dam was raised to reach a capacity of 44 million cubic metres. Near the old basin of Naurouze the Naurouze pumping station helps to regulate {{the water in the}} Canal du Midi and the lake. An underground pipe, the gallery of Mandore, provides the Naurouze with additional {{water from the}} Rigole de la plaine to Lake Ganguise. Conversely, during the dry season, Lake Ganguise can supply the Canal du Midi if the water supply of the Rigole de la plaine is not enough.|$|E

50|$|South Tarawa {{has very}} limited water {{resources}} for its rapidly growing population. During the frequent droughts, {{the only source}} of water is the shallow freshwater lens which permeates the coral rock of the atoll. The water lenses at Bonriki and Buota have been declared as <b>water</b> <b>reserves,</b> and have a combined sustainable yield of 1,300 m3 per day. Other previously declared <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> have been relinquished for urbanisation, or abandoned due to over-pumping and pollution from human settlement.|$|R
25|$|The average {{precipitation}} {{for the area}} is 800mm. In summer precipitation {{is in the form}} of rain, and generally in the winter it is found in the form of snow. Fog is common all year due to the humid winds from the east; the cold winds from the south are also not uncommon. An intricate network of streams, ponds, lakes and springs give this region the characteristic function as a 'sponge' that absorbs and retains the moisture throughout the year, channeling it into the water sources which supplied much of the population of the province. It is a natural basin for precipitation, and for this reason, the provincial government declared the region as the provincial <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> of Pampa de Achala. The area contains the headwaters of four major rivers of the province: Suquía (or First River), Xanaes (or Second River) and Ctalamochita (or Third River) flowing towards the eastern margin of the Sierras. Towards the western side of the region we find the headwaters of the Rio Mina Clavero river.|$|E
500|$|The first core {{of freshly}} frozen lake ice was {{obtained}} on 10 January 2013 {{at a depth}} of [...] However, as soon as the ice was pierced, water from the underlying lake gushed up the borehole, mixing it with the Freon and kerosene used to keep the borehole from freezing. A new borehole was drilled and an allegedly pristine water sample was obtained in January 2015. [...] The Russian team plans to eventually lower a probe into the lake to collect water samples and sediments from the bottom. It is hypothesized that unusual forms of life could be found in the lake's liquid layer, a fossil <b>water</b> <b>reserve.</b> Lake Vostok contains an environment sealed off below the ice for millions of years, in conditions which could resemble those of the ice-covered ocean of Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus.|$|E

50|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are living parts of plant and contain 65 to 95 percent water. When food and <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> are exhausted, produce dies and decays. Anything that increases {{the rate at which}} a product's food and <b>water</b> <b>reserves</b> are used up increases the likelihood of losses. Increases in normal physiological changes can be caused by high temperature, low atmospheric humidity and physical injury. Such injury often results from careless handling, causing internal bruising, splitting and skin breaks, thus rapidly increasing water loss.|$|R

The river is the main <b>water</b> <b>reserve</b> for the people and the cattle in the large dry land. [...] There is no other consistent river that can be [...] exploited by the population in Nyagatare. Few of the rivers [...] found there such as Nyiragahaya, Kayihenda, Karuruma, Nayagasharara and Kaborogota are erratic and intermittent.
