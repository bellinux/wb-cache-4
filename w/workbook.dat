40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} Division One teacher beliefs about and usage of reading <b>workbooks.</b> In order to do so, a questionnaire consisting of three components was devised. The com­ponents were demographic information, two open-ended items, and 22 forced-choice statements. A four-point scale for the 22 items was developed using the following categories and numerical values: strongly agree, 4; agree, 3; disagree, 2; strongly disagree, 1. The intent was to force teachers to take definite, rather than neutral, positions in their responses. No formal statistical analysis of the data was undertaken. Instead, simple percentages were used to determine whether or not each hypothesis was accepted or rejected. Categories were identified to determine the magnitude of acceptance or rejection. The study identified the following: 1. The use of <b>workbooks</b> is widespread. 2. Teachers believe that <b>workbooks</b> are an important instructional aid in the teaching of reading. 3. Teachers believe that <b>workbooks</b> are the products of scientific investigations of the reading process and instructional practice. 4. Teachers believe that <b>workbooks</b> ensure the covering of essential reading skills. 5. Other supplementary materials are used but they play a subsidiary role to <b>workbooks.</b> 6. Teachers do not believe that <b>workbooks</b> facilitate class manage­ment in dealing with grouping procedures, or that they facilitate individualization of instruction. Suggestions for future research included an examination of the <b>workbooks</b> teachers in the study use, an examination of teacher approaches and practices, and an investigation of the existence of external pressures on teachers to use <b>workbooks...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{report by}} B. Sreejan, senior {{reporter}} with the Thiruvananthapuram bureau of The New Indian Express (12 April 2007), {{stated that the}} original chemical examination report of the vaginal swab and vaginal smear of Abhaya {{has been found to}} have been tampered with. The manuscript of the <b>workbook</b> report from the Chemical Examination Laboratory shows over-writing in four places. Using a whitener and a different ink, the word ‘‘not’’ has been added to the word ‘‘detected,’. The lab explained that it was quite normal to make corrections in the manuscript. Even Varghese P Thomas, the first investigating officer, said the post mortem and lab reports had ruled out rape, leaving no scope for suspicions on the veracity of the report.|$|E
25|$|Excel Mobile is a {{spreadsheet}} program that can edit XLSX files. It can edit and format text in cells, calculate formulas, search within the spreadsheet, sort rows and columns, freeze panes, filter the columns, add comments, and create charts.

40|$|A {{telemetry}} dictionary database {{includes a}} component for receiving spreadsheet <b>workbooks</b> of telemetry data over a web-based interface from other computer devices. Another component routes the spreadsheet <b>workbooks</b> to a specified directory on the host processing device. A process then checks the received spreadsheet <b>workbooks</b> for errors, and if no errors are detected the spreadsheet <b>workbooks</b> are routed to another directory to await initiation of a remote database loading process. The loading process first converts the spreadsheet <b>workbooks</b> to comma separated value (CSV) files. Next, a network {{connection with the}} computer system that hosts the telemetry dictionary database is established and the CSV files are ported to the computer system that hosts the telemetry dictionary database. This {{is followed by a}} remote initiation of a database loading program. Upon completion of loading a flatfile generation program is manually initiated to generate a flatfile to be used in a mission operations environment by the core ground system...|$|R
40|$|The poor {{performance}} of South African learners on {{national and international}} benchmark tests in mathematics and literacy has prompted the South African Department of Basic Education (DBE) to devise intervention strategies, {{one of which is}} the provision of <b>workbooks</b> for learners. This paper is based on a case study of six Grade 3 teachers’ use of DBE <b>workbooks.</b> Data from classroom observations and interviews are reported and analyzed in relation to literature on mathematical and pedagogical resources. The key finding is that teachers use the <b>workbooks</b> in disparate ways as a resource and {{that the majority of the}} teachers in the case study use the <b>workbooks</b> in ways that do not resonate with the DBE’s intentions. We argue that the provision of resources alone may not lead to improved teaching and learning in primary school mathematics classrooms and that pre-service and in-service teacher education programmes need to include a focus on how resources such as <b>workbooks</b> can be utilized optimall...|$|R
25|$|Into the 1990s, {{a number}} of merit badge counselors {{developed}} worksheets {{as a way for}} Scouts to document their work.

Merit badge <b>workbooks</b> are used by counselors, summer camps, and merit badge colleges. <b>Workbooks</b> have also been developed for ranks, Cub Scout belt loops, and Webelos activity pins.|$|R
