Mr. Britling's thoughts were quick and sanguine and his actions even more eager than his thoughts. Already while {{he was a young man}} Mr. Britling had found his acts elbow their way through the hurry of his ideas and precipitate humiliations. Long before his reasons were marshalled, his resolutions were formed. He had attempted a thousand remonstrances with himself; he had sought to remedy the defects in his own character by written inscriptions in his bedroom and memoranda inside his <b>watch</b> <b>case.</b> [...] "Keep steady!" [...] was one of them. [...] "Keep the End in View." [...] And, [...] "Go steadfastly, coherently, continuously; only so can you go where you will." [...] In distrusting all impulse, scrutinising all imagination, he was persuaded lay his one prospect of escape from the surprise of countless miseries. Otherwise he danced among glass bombs and barbed wire.|$|E

By inserting gasket sealed pushbuttons {{into the side of}} this unique <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> design, Gallet was able to expand the water resistant characteristics of the Schmitz Frères concept to the more complex wrist-worn chronograph. Originally engineered by Gallet for the adverse conditions of the battlefield, the Clamshell chronograph derived its nickname from the way that the upper and lower sections of the <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> compressed together over a specially flared crystal, protecting the delicate inner mechanisms from the intrusion of water, dirt, dust, and caustic chemicals.|$|E
