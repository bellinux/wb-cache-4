5|$|Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, {{which he}} founded in 1988 with his {{daughter}} Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>solve</b> important problems together—using a strategic bootstrapping approach for accelerating our progress toward that goal. In 2005, Engelbart received a National Science Foundation grant to fund the open source HyperScope project. The Hyperscope team built a browser component using Ajax and Dynamic HTML designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents).|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} {{above is}} easy to use, {{but it is not}} defined for Lie groups that are not matrix groups, and {{it is not clear that}} the exponential map of a Lie group does not depend on its representation as a matrix group. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>solve</b> both problems using a more abstract definition of the exponential map that works for all Lie groups, as follows.|$|E
