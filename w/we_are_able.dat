Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to join the eternal.|$|E

40|$|In {{the absence}} of mitogen, {{administration}} of Dexamethasone (Dex) induces apoptosis, or programmed-cell death in the Nb 2 lymphoma cell. Addition of prolactin (Prl), on the other hand, blocks this effect. As a model for apoptosis, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to investigate this Dex-Prl {{interaction by means of}} a morphological approach: one that could be visualized under a light microscope. This approach allowed us to achieve several aims. First, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to develop a method of cell quantification beﬁtting a morphological study based upon the hemacytometer. Second, with Trypan Blue exclusion, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to verify Dex/Prl-responsiveness in the Nb 2 cells. Third, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to reﬁne and characterize the TUNEL (Tdt-dependent dUTP-biotin Nick End Labeling) assay as a means of detecting apoptosis in both log phase and synchronized cells. With the synchronized cells, we observed that the time frame of apoptosis onset as measured by Trypan Blue and the TUNEL assay, occurred between 6 and 8 hours. Fourth, using immunocytochemistry (ICC), <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to characterize and establish speciﬁcity of affinity puriﬁed polyclonal rabbit antibodies directed against the signal proteins, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), STATSb, NFkB and lkBα.

25|$|Some theorists {{argue that}} the {{capacity}} of working memory decreases as we age, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to hold less information. In this theory, declines in working memory are described {{as the result of}} limiting the amount of information an individual can simultaneously keep active, so that a higher degree of integration and manipulation of information is not possible because the products of earlier memory processing are forgotten before the subsequent products.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to {{apprehend}} and represent nature to {{ourselves in the}} successive forms which its development assumes {{since it is the}} same spirit of which we become aware in self-consciousness, though here unconsciously. The variety of its forms is not imposed on it externally, since there is no external teleology in nature. Nature is a self-forming whole, within which only natural explanations can be sought. The function of Naturphilosophie is to exhibit the ideal as springing from the real, not to deduce the real from the ideal.|$|E

To be specific, the DNA sequence analysis approach allows us to estimate the effects of mutations with very small effects, which are hardly detectable through mutagenesis experiments.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we conduct a {{comprehensive}} evaluation of feature weights, feature selection and classifiers in sentiment analysis. For almost all configurations of feature selection, feature weights and classifiers <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to maintain classification accuracy while using a vastly reduce feature set. In fact, {{for more than}} half of the configurations <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to statistically significantly improve accuracy over the baseline where no feature selection was performed. Our work is also the first to use SentiWordNet in document-level sentiment analysis. By using SentiWordNet <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to introduce three novel feature weighting methods and two novel feature selection methods. Furthermore, we pioneer the use of TF-IDF as a feature weighting method, and we independently developed Categorical Proportional Difference as a feature selection method, before finding that this idea had already been published. Using our results <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to confirm and contradict some of the key ideas that are common in sentiment analysis. In particular, by using our two novel feature selection meth-ods, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> to confirm that in movie reviews the sentiment of the reviewer is conveyed through nuanced subjective language rather than individual, highly subjective terms. We also demonstrate why using feature frequency as a weighting method performs poorly in other work...|$|R
