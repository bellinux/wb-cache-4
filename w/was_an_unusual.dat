5|$|Hurricane Vince <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{hurricane}} {{that developed}} in the northeastern Atlantic basin. Forming in October during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, it strengthened over waters thought to be too cold for tropical development. Vince was the twentieth named tropical cyclone and twelfth hurricane of the extremely active season.|$|E
5|$|In September 1833, Governor Irwin sailed for London, {{partly to}} give his own account of the {{events leading up to}} the killing. This <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> measure, {{especially}} given his regiment was about to leave for a tour of duty in India. The Colonial Office indicated satisfaction with Irwin's administration of the colony.|$|E
5|$|Cora <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, {{similar to the}} tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the Windward Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E

5|$|Cyclonic Storm Komen <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{tropical}} cyclone that originated near {{the southern coast}} of Bangladesh and later struck the same country while drifting over the northern Bay of Bengal. The second named storm of the 2015 season, Komen brought several days of heavy rainfall to Myanmar, Bangladesh, and India. It formed as a depression on July26 over the Ganges delta and moved in a circular motion around the northern Bay of Bengal. Komen intensified into a 75km/h (45mph) cyclonic storm and moved ashore southeastern Bangladesh on July30. The system turned westward over land and was last noted over eastern India on August2.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Doria <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> and erratic {{hurricane}} {{that existed}} during September 1967. The fourth named storm and hurricane of the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season, Doria developed on September 8 off {{the east coast}} of Florida. It meandered until attaining tropical storm status, at which point the storm accelerated towards the northeast. On September 10, Doria intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After moving out to sea, the storm turned westward towards the United States. A compact cyclone, Doria weakened to a tropical storm shortly before moving ashore in the Mid-Atlantic States. The storm ultimately dissipated on September 21.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific proper (east of 140°W), sixteen {{tropical}} storms and eight hurricanes formed. Four of the hurricanes became major hurricanes by reaching Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. These numbers {{are close to the}} long-term averages of fifteen tropical storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. There were also four unnamed tropical depressions. The only system to enter or form in the central Pacific (between 140°W and the international dateline) <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> high-latitude hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Indian cavalry {{participated in}} actions {{on both the}} Western and Palestinian fronts {{throughout}} the war. Members of the 1st and 2nd Indian Cavalry Divisions were active on the Western Front, including in the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line and at the Battle of Cambrai. A charge by the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Division ended successfully at the Battle of Cambrai despite being against a position fortified by barbed wire and machine guns. This successful ending <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> occurrence during the war. Several Indian cavalry divisions joined Allenby's troops {{in the spring of}} 1918 after being transferred from the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Operation Pig Bristle <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{transport}} task {{conducted by}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in May 1946. The operation was ordered by the Australian Government {{in response to a}} national shortage of paint brushes, which was hindering house-building efforts. No. 38 Squadron of the RAAF was given the task of transporting 25 tonnes of pig bristles from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong, from where the bristles were shipped to Australia. The squadron completed this task over a two-week period.|$|E
5|$|The 1957–58 season <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> one for Manchester City, {{which became}} the first and thus far only English team both to score and to concede 100 goals in a season. Trautmann played in 34 matches, and {{though he did not}} play in the 9–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, an 8–4 defeat to Leicester City was a record for the most goals conceded by Trautmann in a match in his career, and in the entire season he kept only two clean sheets.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} first hint that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could of course be a line of sight effect, its apparent motion in the sky suggested that it was physically close to it. Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Beryl <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclone that formed over southeastern Louisiana in August 1988. The second tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed from a slow-moving trough of low pressure on August 8. It tracked southeastward into the coastal waters of eastern Louisiana, and Beryl reached peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) while located about 75miles (120km) southeast of New Orleans. The storm {{turned to the}} northwest over Louisiana and Texas, and slowly dissipated. The remnants of Beryl continued northward into the central United States, dropping some rainfall and providing relief to a severe heat wave.|$|E
5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what {{he thought}} <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that enables him to glimpse criminal acts committed {{by the people who}} make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David {{stands in the middle of}} a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the wife and their two children captive.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; this <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> and {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article recommends that flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Princess was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. The Princess was serviced by a freight elevator, which <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making the Princess by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Elita <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{tropical}} cyclone that made landfall on Madagascar three times. The fifth named storm of the 2003–04 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Elita {{developed in the}} Mozambique Channel on January 24, 2004. It strengthened to {{tropical cyclone}} status before striking northwestern Madagascar on January 28; {{it was the first}} storm to strike western Madagascar at that intensity since Cyclone Cynthia in 1991. Elita weakened to tropical depression status while crossing the island, and after exiting into the southwest Indian Ocean, it turned to the west and moved ashore in eastern Madagascar on January 31. After once again crossing the island, the cyclone reached the Mozambique Channel and re-intensified. Elita turned to the southeast to make its final landfall on February 3 along southwestern Madagascar. Two days later, it underwent an extratropical transition; the remnant system moved erratically before dissipating on February 13.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ekeka <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone that attained major hurricane status {{during the month}} of February. The first storm of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Ekeka developed on January 28 well to the south of Hawaii. It gradually intensified to reach major hurricane status on February 2, although it subsequently began to weaken due to unfavorable wind shear. It crossed the International Date Line as a weakened tropical storm, and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status. Ekeka continued westward, passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk State, before dissipating on February 9 about 310miles (500km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The storm did not cause any significant damage or deaths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Delius began a {{fruitful}} association with German supporters of his music, the conductors Hans Haym, Fritz Cassirer and Alfred Hertz at Elberfeld, and Julius Buths at Düsseldorf. Haym conducted Over the Hills and Far Away, which he gave under its German title Über die Berge in die Ferne on 13 November 1897, {{believed to be}} the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in St. James's Hall in London, which included Over the Hills and Far Away, a choral piece, Mitternachtslied, and excerpts from the opera Koanga. This occasion <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.|$|E
5|$|Marmarosa {{returned}} to Pittsburgh due to health reasons in 1948. He began performing much less frequently, {{and had a}} presence only locally for around a decade. Friends and fellow musicians had commented from an early stage that Marmarosa <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> character. His mental stability was probably affected by being beaten into a coma when in his teens, by a short-lived marriage followed by permanent separation from his children, and by a traumatic period in the army. He made comeback recordings in the early 1960s, but soon retreated to Pittsburgh, where he played occasionally into the early 1970s. From then until his death three decades later, he lived with family and in veterans' hospitals.|$|E
