25|$|A <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to the Local Council of the USSR Council of Ministers was {{announced}} by the Chairman of Religious Affairs Konstantin Kharchev. Congratulations to the cathedral asked the guests of honor. At the first meeting on the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus' {{was made by the}} Metropolitan of Kiev and Galich Philaret (Denisenko).|$|E
60|$|Old Brownbie again grunted, {{but said}} no <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome.</b> That, however, {{was to be}} taken for granted, without much {{expression}} of opinion.|$|E
6000|$|... "But am I wrong now {{to bring}} you one in person? I have thought so much of seeing you again! Will you not say a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you take}} a chair?" [...] Julian repeated, observing that the visitor {{appeared}} neither to heed nor to hear his first <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm right glad you're back again, Squire," [...] he said, {{looking at}} him with curious intentness, [...] "and yet the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> stick in my throat." ...|$|R
6000|$|All unconscious, {{she came}} with outstretched hands and <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> but an {{astonished}} cry of 'Lucy!' met her, and casting {{her eyes on}} her dress, she screamed, 'Oh goodness! it's ink!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, dead! Have ye no <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> for a chum after a month's absence?" [...] said Slugs, {{holding out}} his horny hand to the Black Swan, who gravely grasped and shook it.|$|E
60|$|He {{saw that}} Murray {{had not noticed}} him but was {{advancing}} straight toward Ethel, and that a faint tinge of color showed in her face. Then after a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to the man he turned away.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite cool," [...] said Colonel Zane; [...] "but I {{want you}} to see the sunset in the valley. A good many of your future neighbors may come over to-night for a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome.</b> It's the border custom." ...|$|E
60|$|Her friend {{received}} {{her in a}} strangely quiet way, with just a kiss which was not warm, a few commonplace <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> and a smile which did not linger long on her lips.|$|R
60|$|A fresh roar of cheering broke out, {{and then}} the boys who had been at school with Frank jumped from their forms and crowded round him, each striving to grasp his hand, and all {{shouting}} <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> and congratulation.|$|R
60|$|Theodora blushed crimson, {{and all the}} glad <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> were {{spoken by}} Percy; but he then fell into the background, taking charge of Johnnie, while the other three walked on together, Theodora's arm within that of her eldest brother.|$|R
60|$|But the Fairies took each a hand, {{and flew}} lightly over the stream. The Queen and her {{subjects}} came to meet her, and all seemed glad to say some kindly <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> {{to the little}} stranger. They placed a flower-crown upon her head, laid their soft faces against her own, and soon {{it seemed as if}} the gentle Elves had always been her friends.|$|E
60|$|Out of the {{darkness}} on the step, there rose something dark. He put out his hand. A persuasive tongue, gently licking it, pleaded for a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome.</b> The crippled animal could only have got to the door in one way; the gate which protected the house-enclosure must have been left open. First giving the dog a refuge in the kitchen, the footman--rigidly performing his last duties--went to close the gate.|$|E
6000|$|Holt and {{the other}} farmers were shown into the room, and Holt {{as a matter of}} course became the spokesman. When Caldigate had shaken hands with them all round, each muttering his <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> then Holt began: 'We wish you to know, squoire, that we, none of us, ain't been {{comfortable}} in our minds here at Folking since that crawling villain Crinkett came and showed himself at our young squire's christening.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stands the}} candle on the chimney-piece in the clerk's hall and taps his dry cheek {{with the key}} as he {{addresses}} these <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to Mademoiselle Hortense. That feline personage, with her lips tightly shut and her eyes looking out at him sideways, softly closes the door before replying.|$|R
6000|$|Randal's first <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> {{relieved}} the Captain {{of certain}} modest doubts of his reception, {{which appeared to}} trouble him {{when he entered the}} room. [...] "I am glad to find you remember me as kindly as I remember you." [...] Those were his first words when he and Randal shook hands.|$|R
60|$|He walked once round {{among the}} guests, and spoke a few <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> at each table; {{and as he}} did so the tenants got up and bowed and wished health to the old squire, {{happiness}} to the young one, and prosperity to Greshamsbury; but, nevertheless, it was but a tame affair.|$|R
60|$|Home no {{more home}} to me, whither must I wander? Hunger my driver, I go where I must. Cold blows the winter wind over hill and heather; Thick drives the rain, and my roof {{is in the}} dust. Loved of wise men was the shade of my roof-tree. The true <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> was spoken in the door - Dear days of old, with the faces in the firelight, Kind folks of old, you come again no more.|$|E
60|$|He {{arrived in}} the middle of the afternoon, and he saw no one at the hotel except the Harmons till toward dinner-time. Then the ladies coming in from {{shopping}} had a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> for him; some of them stopped and shook hands at the office, and when they began to come down to dinner they spoke to him, and there again some of them offered their hands; they said it seemed an age since he had gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{begin by}} scolding me," [...] she said, before I could utter a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome.</b> [...] "There {{will be time}} enough for that {{in the course of}} the next six weeks. I beg pardon, with all {{possible}} humility, for the offense of coming ten days before my time. Don't ask me to account for it, please; if you do, I shall be obliged to confess the truth. My dear sir, the fact is, this is an act of impulse." ...|$|E
60|$|The train {{rolled into}} the station and rapidly disgorged its crowd of passengers, amongst whom Julian {{was one of the}} first to alight. Catherine found herself trembling. The shy <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> which had formed {{themselves}} in her mind died away on her lips as their glances met. She lifted her face to his.|$|R
5000|$|I {{could have}} {{let out a}} yell of joy and relief. The formal <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> were {{pronounced}} by Sir Cuthbert Wallace who, as Dean of the Medical School of St. Thomas’, had rebuked me {{a few years earlier}} for being so frivolous as to go off to South America before I had qualified. (ibid, 2002) ...|$|R
60|$|These odd <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> were {{spoken in}} a clear, ringing, {{pleasant}} voice. The offered hand--rather large, but beautifully formed--was {{given to me}} with the easy, unaffected self-reliance of a highly-bred woman. We sat down together at the breakfast-table in as cordial and customary a manner {{as if we had}} known each other for years, and had met at Limmeridge House to talk over old times by previous appointment.|$|R
6000|$|Home no {{more home}} to me, whither must I wander? [...] Hunger my driver, I go where I must. [...] Cold blows the winter wind over hill and heather; [...] Thick drives the rain, and my roof {{is in the}} dust. [...] Loved of wise men was the shade of my roof-tree. [...] The true <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> was spoken in the door— [...] Dear days of old, with the faces in the firelight, [...] Kind folks of old, you come again no more.|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} to America in July. Clemens sent him <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> [...] with glowing reports {{of his own}} undertakings. The story on which he [...] was piling up MS. was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, begun [...] seven years before at Quarry Farm. He had no great faith in it [...] then, and though he had taken it up again in 1880, his interest had [...] not lasted to its conclusion. This time, however, {{he was in the}} [...] proper spirit, and the story would be finished.|$|E
60|$|A {{few words}} {{explained}} to their surprised compatriots {{that they were}} fugitives {{who had been in}} shelter in the town, and many a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> was muttered, and furtive handshakes given. In return the boys were able to give the news of the arrival of the British before Delhi, and the commencement of the siege, all of which was new to the garrison, who had been for twenty-two days without a word from the outer world. At last the column reached the ghat, or landing-place, fixed upon for their embarkation.|$|E
60|$|I {{had only}} {{to look at his}} face--pitiably pale and agitated--to see that he was a {{sensitive}} man, not always able to control his nerves on occasions which tried his moral courage. A kind, I might almost say a noble face, and a voice unaffectedly persuasive, at once prepossessed me in his favor. The few <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> that I spoke were intended to compose him. They failed to produce the impression on which I had counted.|$|R
6000|$|The three Calenders bowed low on entering, {{and thanked}} the ladies for their {{kindness}} and hospitality. The ladies replied with <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome,</b> {{and they were}} all about to seat themselves when the eyes of the Calenders fell on the porter, whose dress was not so very unlike their own, though he still wore all the hair that nature had given him. [...] "This," [...] said one of them, [...] "is apparently one of our Arab brothers, who has rebelled against our ruler." ...|$|R
40|$|I vastly {{appreciate}} {{the opportunity of}} being with you all today to help launch what, I am certain, will prove an extraordinary workshop. I bring you specific greetings and <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> from colleagues in eastern Washington {{and elsewhere in the}} interior Pacific Northwest and particularly from the organization that John Munn and I work for, the College of Agriculture and Home Economics and Cooperative Extension, Washington State University. We are delighted indeed to have this meeting in our corner of the world this year...|$|R
6000|$|Admitted to the garden, in {{the deep}} shadow of the shrubs, I could see nothing {{distinctly}} of {{the woman with the}} rough voice, except that she wore a man's hat. Closing the gate behind us, without a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> or explanation, she led the way to the house. Mrs. Macallan followed her easily, knowing the place; and I walked in Mrs. Macallan's footsteps as closely as I could. [...] "This is a nice family," [...] my mother-in-law whispered to me. [...] "Dexter's cousin is the only woman in the house--and Dexter's cousin is an idiot." ...|$|E
60|$|The Doctor {{opened the}} door with a key he carried, and led the way into a low but pretty ample hall with rooms on either side. The door of one of these stood open, and the Doctor entered it, with a <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to his guest. It, too, was a low room, half surgery and half parlour, with shelves of books and bottles against the walls, which were of a very dark hue. There was a fire in the grate, the night being damp and chill. Leaning against the chimney-piece looking down into it, stood the Doctor's Assistant.|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll be {{surprised}} some, and disappointed some," [...] said Lem, cheerily; [...] "they {{was kind of}} plannin' a little celebration when you come back, Will--you and Cynthy. Amandy Hatch was a-goin' to bake a cake, and the minister was callatin' to say some <b>word</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome.</b> Wahn't goin' to be anything grand--jest homelike. But you was right to come if you was tuckered. I guess Cynthy fetched you. Rias he kep' store and done it well,--brisker'n I ever see him, Rias was. Wait till I put some of them things back, and make you more comfortable, Will." ...|$|E
60|$|Few {{were the}} <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> uttered by Angut, for Eskimos are not {{addicted}} to ceremonial; nevertheless, with the promptitude of one ever ready to learn, he seized his visitor's hand, {{and shook it}} heartily in the manner which Rooney had taught him--with the slight mistake that he shook it {{from side to side}} instead of up and down. At the same time he pointed to a deerskin seat on the raised floor of the hut, where Kannoa had already placed a stone dish of smoking viands.|$|R
60|$|In language, learning, {{and manners}} Verronax the Arvernian was, however, a highly {{cultivated}} Roman, as Sidonius perceived {{in the first}} <b>word</b> <b>of</b> respectful <b>welcome</b> that he spoke when presented to the Bishop.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on the <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>welcome</b> to the {{symposium}} on Religion and the Body on 16 June 2010. In a religious context ‘truth’ is like a mantra, a certain imperative to believe in sacred things. The concept of truth and falseness arises, when we as humans compare reality, as we experience it through our senses, with the representation we have in our memory, a comparison of new information with stored information. If we look for the truth, we have to search in the human mind. There we will also find religion...|$|R
