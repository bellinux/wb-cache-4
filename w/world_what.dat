25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his <b>world.</b> <b>What</b> Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when trying to understand themselves.|$|E
