500|$|The lyrics in [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] {{were aimed}} {{primarily}} at Biggie and Puffy. Shakur viciously insults Biggie throughout, {{the first line}} by Shakur is [...] "That's why I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker", and threatens retaliation in [...] "Hit 'Em Up", saying [...] "Now you're about to feel the wrath of a menace." [...] He also used the song as a platform to express his belief that Biggie was guilty of stealing his style of rapping, and was merely imitating his lifestyle. This notion is addressed in the verse in [...] "Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style." [...] He also touches topically on their early friendship with the line [...] "Biggie, remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> let you sleep on the couch?" [...] and their subsequent fallout. Towards {{the end of the}} song Tupac disses Mobb Deep, saying [...] "Don't one of you niggas got sickle cell or something? You fucking with me, nigga you fuck around and get a seizure or a heart attack", referring to Prodigy, a member of Mobb Deep, suffering from sickle cell disease. Mobb Deep responded by releasing [...] "Drop a Gem on 'em", which was released shortly after Tupac's death, however recorded before. [...] "Hit 'Em Up" [...] features much profanity and was issued a Parental Advisory label, using the word [...] "fuck" [...] and [...] "motherfucker" [...] over 35 times in the song.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really good at it. I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually back in the days <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{evidence}} given {{on the first}} day of the inquest into Kempton's death by her friend Rose Heinberg, Kempton was at the New Court Club in Percy Street with Heinberg, when a man called [...] "Micky" [...] told her that a Chinese man named [...] "Billy" [...] wanted to meet her. The four of them went by taxi to a Chinese restaurant in Regent Street. There Billy asked her to come outside and according to Heinberg, when Kempton returned her mouth was twitching. Heinberg asked if Kempton was eating something to which Kempton replied [...] "I have been drugged ... I know I have been drugged, because a year ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> take drugs, my mouth used to twitch. I used to have to eat chewing-gum to make people think I was eating sweets." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 December 2016, a {{day before}} her return, it was {{reported}} that Michelle would be returning, but that the part had been recast to Jenna Russell. Of her casting, Russell said: [...] "It is a great honour to play such an iconic character. I know the audience loved Michelle Fowler so much, and even though she hasn’t been on our screen for 20 years, she’s very much in the fans’ psyche. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> watch EastEnders all those years ago, she was one of my favourite characters. I’m extremely excited for what is in store for Michelle." [...] Executive producer Sean O'Connor said he is [...] "thrilled to have secured Jenna Russell to play Michelle Fowler, one of the show’s most celebrated characters" [...] and [...] "the Square really has missed her over the past twenty years." [...] O'Connor added, [...] "Jenna was always in mind when I [...] first started planning for Michelle’s return". O'Connor also said Michelle is [...] "still flawed, complicated and infuriating after two decades away, but still loveable all the same. It’s going to be appointment TV watching Michelle’s car crash of a life unravel all over again." ...|$|E
