500|$|It {{was also}} {{performed}} at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The performance began with Gaga lying on the floor, on a set that was described as an ornate mansion. Gaga staggered across the stage and pirouetted behind a dancer in a lily-white wheelchair. She {{made her way to}} a white grand piano which she played by placing one foot up on the keyboard. Once again, she staggered across the stage, with theatrical blood dripping from her ribcage. She collapsed on the stage wailing in agony as one of the dancers gently lifted her. Gaga then hung liflessly with one hand rising above her dancers and blood smeared on her face with a golden halo being projected on the screen behind her. The ending climax of the performance pays homage to a similar-sounding ending climax in [...] "A Day In The Life" [...] by The Beatles. She later commented that the performance was for her fans: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> honest and real and not just give a performance where I was jacking off on stage the whole time about my record," [...] It was really for my fans, who I knew would be at home cheering and swooning." [...] In a poll conducted by Billboard, the performance was ranked as the fourth best in the history of MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
2500|$|In August, a re-routed tour {{schedule}} was announced {{with a greater}} emphasis on Canadian dates, where Taking the Long Way had gone five-times-platinum. The tour's shows themselves generally refrained from any explicit verbal political comments, letting the music, especially the central performance of [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] (which typically received a thunderous ovation during and after the song), speak for itself. [...] As part of the tour, the Dixie Chicks became the first major band to hire a designated blogger [...] "all-access" [...] to keep up with them in their promotional activities and tour. [...] When the Chicks performed again at Shepherds Bush Empire, site of [...] "The Incident", Maines joked that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> the audience hadn't heard before, but instead said, [...] "Just so y'all know, we're ashamed the President of the United States is from Texas," [...] to much laughter and applause.|$|E

6000|$|... "Something's {{upon his}} mind still," [...] Elma cried, looking hard at him. [...] "He's dying! he's dying! But he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> else before he dies, I'm certain. ... Mr. Kelmscott, it's to you. Oh, Cyril, stand back! Mother, leave them alone! I'm sure from his eye he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Kelmscott." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> you--only {{you would}} {{misunderstand}} it.|$|R
60|$|FANNY. Mr Trotter: I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{you about}} this play.|$|R
60|$|He {{became aware}} of the lapse. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> to get on to a new more {{ordinary}} footing.|$|E
60|$|Lenore <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> to {{show her}} feeling, to make her task seem lighter, {{but she could not}} speak.|$|E
60|$|Beauty Stanton could not, to {{save her}} life, speak the words she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>Something</b> impeding, totally unexpected, seemed to have arisen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no; {{not exactly}} about the diamonds;--though perhaps it is. But first, Frank, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “All Kirwan got was, ‘I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{in public}} because I am under great pressure, I am {{in fear of}} my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} just running away {{for half a}} moment, Jerry?" [...] she said winningly. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> uncle Peter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} {{your best to}} kill me with fear," [...] cried Signora Teresa. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more, but her voice failed her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you." [...] Nat <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> more, but {{his voice}} {{suddenly}} broke and he turned away to hide his emotion, and then walked away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't think that. He was riled up, and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> extra mean. And it was mean--as mean as dirt!" [...] added Andy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> Your mother hasn't heard." [...] He {{announced}} Emily's {{ignorance of}} what he hadn't told her, {{as if it were}} a grievance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something.</b> Elam, {{if you do}} this insane thing, I won't marry you. I {{refuse to}} marry you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look up at me, Zack," [...] she said, {{returning}} to the bath, and sitting in the chair by its side; [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
60|$|I went to {{the window}} because, undoubtedly, {{it would be easier to}} address her {{severely}} from behind, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> that would sting her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ahem!' There {{he stood}} like an idiot. He was not {{prepared}} for such a speech; {{he did not know}} what to say, although he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> witty. 'Ahem!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with you?" [...] he boomed. [...] "You look as if you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> and was scared to say it. What's troubling you? Confound it, speak up, can't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'd say the truth, Mr Daly--divil a less--and I'd {{do as much}} as that now; but I thought Mr Lynch was <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{about the}} property?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have been}} quite touched by {{the change in the}} poor old man. When he sat down beside me, he said in a very gentle way, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> you, miss." ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps, {{but it is}} an open question, Steve is the one who is most {{surprised}} to hear this. He seems <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> on the subject, but a look of entreaty from Alice silences him.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "I {{hope you}} will not be disappointed, but I have not danced for ten years. I brought you here because I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{just a day}} or two more--just two {{or three}} days," [...] she panted. Then {{controlling}} herself, she added in another manner, [...] "She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> to me--the last day--something very particular, but she couldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|A sort of pity {{seized on}} Harz. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> {{that would be}} consoling but could find no words; and {{suddenly}} he felt disgusted. What link was there between him and this man; between his love and this man's love? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "John," [...] said Jess, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> you. When {{people are}} delirious, or when {{delirium}} is coming on, they sometimes {{say things that}} they are not responsible for, and which had better be forgotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{are going}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it now?" [...] she remarked quickly, {{colouring}} as she met his gaze. [...] "Do stop a minute, Clym, and let me speak first, for oddly enough, I have been <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Uncle Hatto, {{you have}} not heard me. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> you, if it will not take too much of your time." [...] In answer to which, Uncle Hatto muttered something which was unheeded, to signify that Isa might speak.|$|R
60|$|The squire was livid. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>{{something}}</b> awful, {{something that}} would crush the fearless lad before him--but the words would not come. He caught up his silk hat and waved it fiercely {{in the face of}} Ralph and his mother.|$|E
6000|$|I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> exculpatory but I {{scarcely}} {{knew what}} note to strike. I could only look vaguely about {{me at the}} starry darkness and the sea that seemed to sleep. 'Well, with these splendid nights, this perfection of weather, people are beguiled into late hours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I'm glad of that," [...] I {{answered}} lamely. It {{was very}} ridiculous, but I {{could think of}} nothing else to say. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> brilliant, but it wouldn't come; so I stood still and looked at her and got rather red in the face.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain said}} that he did, and stood silent awhile, with {{the air of a}} man who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> but is half afraid to. At last, with a desperate {{appearance}} of resolution, he bent down to the old man’s ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> serious," [...] replied old Mazey, with impenetrable solemnity. [...] "It's {{been on my}} mind to {{come here}} and make a clean breast of it, for the last hour or more. Mark my words, young woman. I'm going to disgrace myself." ...|$|R
50|$|In systems {{where you}} might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> about {{universe}} types, there is a hierarchy of universe types, each containing the one below it in the hierarchy.
