Its term [...] "troubled child" [...] is a good summary of the position of the human being in relation to God. The wording of its conclusion, [...] "In deine tiefen Wunden, da ich stets Heil gefunden" [...] ("into Your deep wounds, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always found salvation") leads to the following recitative. The voice is accompanied by an obbligato viola (violoncello piccolo in the Leipzig version) in a lively figuration.|$|E

[...] Also borrowing elements from downbeat and electronic music she discovered on recent trips to Europe, her vision of the album eventually resulted in a mixture that Knowles has described as a [...] "'60s/70s vintage soul record with hints of electronica." [...] In an interview with Billboard magazine, Geffen Records chairman Ron Fair said of the album prior to release, [...] "Her record is totally bananas ... It's not what people would expect from her. The music is more electric and international. She's in her own lane." ...|$|E
500|$|If {{they and}} their shepherds go, that {{is the end of}} the Lakeland <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> climbed, walked, skied and skated for nearly 80 years; of the Lakeland I have written about nearly all my life. The {{destruction}} of entire flocks meant that the shepherds were forced to undergo the process of again heafing (the local term for hefting) their new sheep to the hills. Normally, ewes teach this behaviour to their lambs, but with no more ewes left acquainted with a particular heaf the behavior had to be taught all over again to new ewes, inevitably involving much rounding up of flocks that had strayed over the often inaccessible fells. Unheafed sheep might also cause overgrazing by wandering if they replaced the original Herdwicks. The Cumbria Hill Sheep Initiative was set up to [...] "reassess the position and circumstances" [...] in the aftermath of the disease; tough government restrictions in order to prevent another outbreak are still in place.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

He sailed {{at a time when}} English military preparations were underway to relieve the Huguenots at La Rochelle. He was dismayed to find that the war with France had spread to Newfoundland, and that he had to spend most of his time fighting off French attacks on English fishing fleets with his own ships the Dove and the Ark. As he wrote to Buckingham, [...] "I came to builde, and sett, and sowe, but I am falne to fighting with Frenchmen [...] ". His settlers were so successful against the French that they captured several ships, which they escorted back to England to help with the war effort. Baltimore was granted the loan of one of the ships to aid in his defence of the colony, as well as a share of the prize money.|$|E
500|$|White was ever-present in Australia's {{triumph in}} the 2009 Champions Trophy, saving his best {{performance}} for the final where, having been promoted to number four, he scored a patient 62 against New Zealand to help Australia recover from 6/2 to ease to a six wicket victory. The following ODI series against India saw White remain at number four due to injuries to Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin, and he made three half-centuries including a remarkable 57 off 33balls including 5sixes. After being {{in and out of}} the Australian set-up earlier in his career, White claimed [...] "I think my best position is up around <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been batting", a statement backed up by an average of 41.71 in his 18appearances since his call-up to face England earlier that year. The higher responsibility placed on White as a batsman was balanced by a much lower responsibility with the ball; across the whole of the 2009 season, he only bowled three balls in One Day International cricket.|$|E
500|$|This {{storm of}} {{publicity}} caused {{a flurry of}} activity as readers around France scrambled to obtain the novel. Balzac's friend and La Caricature editor Charles Philipon wrote to the author one week after publication: [...] "there is no getting hold of La Peau de chagrin. Grandville had to stop everything to read it, because the librarian sent round every half-hour {{to ask if he}} had finished." [...] Friends near and far wrote to Balzac indicating their similar difficulties in locating copies. The second edition was released one month later, and it was followed by parodies and derivative works from other writers. Balzac's friend Théophile Gautier included a comical homage in his 1833 story collection Les Jeunes-France when, during a recreation of the feast from Balzac's novel, a character says: [...] "This is the point at which I'm supposed to pour wine down my waistcoat... It says so in black and white on page 171 of La Peau de chagrin... And this is <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to toss a 100-sou coin in the air {{to see whether or not}} there's a God." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2010, Robbie {{confirmed}} rumours {{that she}} was to leave Neighbours after almost three years. Of her reason to leave Robbie said [...] "I {{want to go to}} America; it's always been my goal to work in Hollywood. It's the one stage in my life <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> absolutely nothing holding me down". Robbie filmed her final scenes in October and her character left on-screen in early 2011. Robbie later revealed her character's exit is positive and that Donna departs Ramsay Street for a fashion design school in New York. Robbie said [...] "It is very daunting for Donna at first. Ringo was the one who applied for Donna to do this course – it's like he's doing this one last thing for her." [...] She said that Donna becomes determined to be a success and that it is her last chance to live up to Ringo's expectations of her. Robbie added that she wanted Donna to go to rehab or have a dramatic death, but she got a [...] "boring old happy ending" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set you have so many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|For the crew's space suits, Scott was {{inspired}} to include spherical glass helmets after reading a story in Steve Jobs' biography about building an office out of Gorilla Glass. Scott said, [...] "If I'm in 2083 and I'm going into space, why would I design a helmet that has blind spots. What I want is something <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> 360 [...] Glass, by then, will be light and you won't be able to break it with a bullet." [...] The interior of the prop helmets had nine functioning video screens, internal lighting, an air supply provided by two fans, and battery packs concealed within a backpack. The helmet's exterior featured a functional light source and high definition video cameras with a transmitter and recorder. For the suit itself, Scott wanted to avoid the unwieldy NASA-style suit. His frequent collaborator, Janty Yates, used medical research concepts relating to skin replacement treatments and materials to develop a garment that would be believable, flexible and comfortable. The outfit comprised a neoprene suit worn under an outer space suit, a base to which the helmet could be attached, and a backpack.|$|E

500|$|Chamberlain's {{fall from}} power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, [...] "Few men can have known such a {{reversal}} of fortune in so short a time." [...] He especially regretted the loss of Chequers as [...] "a place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been so happy", though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote [...] "I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind." [...] As Lord President he assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences. Attlee later remembered him as [...] "free {{from any of the}} rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike". As chairman of the Lord President's Committee, he exerted great influence over the wartime economy. When Axis feelers for peace reached the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the Low Countries conquered and France tottering, Halifax urged following up and seeing if the actual offer was worthwhile. The battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet lasted three days, and Chamberlain's statement on the final day that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the feelers should not be pursued at that time helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This {{is a movie}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had to {{deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E
