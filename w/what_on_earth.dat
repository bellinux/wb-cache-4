Nicols recalled the [...] "dykes" [...] in the audience who had come to see them at FIG's first performance: they were into disco and soul and sat patiently through the other improvisers, but when FIG came on, [...] "They laughed their heads off." [...] A review in the improvised music magazine Musics said that FIG's set [...] "was a welcome contrast to the previous performances [...] which had been singularly humourless."

Before agreeing to do the Sweet Thursday project, the duo had considered other projects for their next work together, such as an adaptation of the film Saratoga Trunk. A proposal made by attorney David Merrick to adapt a series of works by Marcel Pagnol to which Merrick held the stage rights fell through when the duo were not willing to have Merrick be an associate producer; Merrick took the project elsewhere, and it was developed into the hit Fanny. Afterwards, Hammerstein stated, [...] "Why the hell did we give up Fanny? <b>What</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> were we trying to prove?

Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics wrote that Duff sounds {{like she is}} bored and [...] "going through the motions" [...] on the song. She further stated that Duff has [...] "lost her sauciness and ironically, her spunk" [...] in the song. Avoledo concluded her review by calling [...] "the bland electro pop" [...] song an [...] "insult to the genre. It's like spilling ramen on a Vivenne Westwood evening gown." [...] A reviewer from CBBC Newsround commented that the song is so repetitive that you will feel like [...] "you've listened to it 20 times after just one play". The reviewer praised the heartbeat present on the track, writing that it [...] "make it {{a bit of a}} foot-tapper", but deemed the lyrics to be [...] "meaningless". The reviewer concluded that: [...] "You'll find yourself humming it but will be hard pushed to remember <b>what</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> she was singing about!" [...] Spence D. of IGN wrote that [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] does not try for subtlety as it utilizes the [...] "much overused heartbeat" [...] for the [...] "foundation rhythm" [...] of the song.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened to be talking about it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? <b>What</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E

[...] Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue.

2500|$|On the night, Labour's {{candidate}} Judith Tizard {{came within}} 406 votes {{of winning the}} traditionally National-held seat of Remuera; she had been forecast as the winner by initial vote counting. Tizard's near-win fueled Lange's misgivings about the direction his government was taking. He commented, [...] "That election night was a great revelation for me. That was an apprehension on my part that we had actually abandoned our constituency. And it set me to think <b>what</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> have we done that we come within 400 votes of winning the true-blue seat of Remuera.

[...] The authors of the letter include doctors who [...] "are apparently sympathetic to the views of David Duke, a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard." [...] One of the doctors responded by saying: [...] "I legitimately use my right of freedom of opinion and do not agree or value the politics of the government of Israel, nor of many others, including Jews in and out of Israel." [...] A second one responded with: [...] "I didn't know who David Duke was, or that he was connected to the Ku Klux Klan.
