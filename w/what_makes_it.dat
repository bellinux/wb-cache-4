5|$|Weather, {{seen from}} an anthropological perspective, is {{something}} all humans {{in the world}} constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside. There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> change, the effect it has on humans in different situations, etc. Therefore, weather is something people often communicate about.|$|E
5|$|Mary Watts died in 1938, and {{was buried}} {{alongside}} George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, {{which she had}} herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52of the intended 120spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be {{a symbol of the}} Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> of value in the present day.|$|E
5|$|The analog {{technique}} {{is a complex}} way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar {{technique is}} used in medium range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E

25|$|Note that a {{compound}} engine (including multiple-expansion engines, see below) {{can have more}} than one set of variable-pressure cylinders. For example, an engine might have two cylinders operating at pressure x and two operating at pressure y, or one cylinder operating at pressure x and three operating at pressure y. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> compound (or double-expansion) as opposed to multiple-expansion is that there are only two pressures, x and y.|$|E

A solid girder or beam of equal strength would have substantial weight and material cost as compared to a truss. For a given span, a deeper truss will require less material in the chords and greater material in the verticals and diagonals. An optimum depth of the truss will maximize the efficiency.|$|E

The subject is usually asked to hold the cards and may rotate them. Whether the cards are rotated, and other related factors such as whether permission to rotate them is asked, may expose personality traits and normally contributes to the assessment.|$|E

25|$|Secularization has had {{its impact}} in Germany as {{elsewhere}} in Europe; nevertheless, 28.9% {{of the total population}} is Catholic (23.761 million people as of December 2015), down 4% compared to the year 2000. Before the 1990 unification of the Federal Republic of Germany (or West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (or East Germany), Catholics were 42% of the population of West Germany. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> easier to know religious statistics in Germany is that Christian taxpayers must declare their religious affiliation as church tax is deducted by the state to be passed on to the relevant church in the state where the taxpayer lives.|$|E
25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If you notice in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E

His performance remains {{as one of the}} greatest individual performances in the PBA history. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> more remarkable is that while he was playing in the court, his wife Millote was giving birth to their first daughter. He came off the bench late in the first quarter and left the game in the middle of the fourth, in a game where he could have possibly scored 100 points or more.|$|E

25|$|Proliferation resistance. In 2016, Nobel Laureate {{physicist}} Dr Carlo Rubbia, former Director General of CERN, {{claimed a}} {{primary reason for}} the United States cutting thorium reactor research in the 1970s is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> so attractive today: thorium is difficult {{to turn into a}} nuclear weapon.The LFTR resists diversion of its fuel to nuclear weapons in four ways: first, the thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233, which then decays to uranium-233. If the protactinium remains in the reactor, small amounts of U-232 are also produced. U-232 has a decay chain product (thallium-208) that emits powerful, dangerous gamma rays. These are not a problem inside a reactor, but in a bomb, they complicate bomb manufacture, harm electronics and reveal the bomb's location. The second proliferation resistant feature {{comes from the fact that}} LFTRs produce very little plutonium, around 15kg per gigawatt-year of electricity (this is the output of a single large reactor over a year). This plutonium is also mostly Pu-238, which makes it unsuitable for fission bomb building, due to the high heat and spontaneous neutrons emitted. The third track, a LFTR doesn't make much spare fuel. It produces at most 9% more fuel than it burns each year, and it's even easier to design a reactor that makes only 1% more fuel. With this kind of reactor, building bombs quickly will take power plants out of operation, and this is an easy indication of national intentions. And finally, use of thorium can reduce and eventually eliminate the need to enrich uranium. Uranium enrichment is one of the two primary methods by which states have obtained bomb making materials.|$|E
