500|$|According to the musicologist Walter Everett, Sgt. Pepper {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote {{more than half of the}} album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases. Sessions began on 24 November 1966 in Abbey Road Studio Two, the first time that the Beatles had come together since September. Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, they booked open-ended sessions that allowed them to work as late as they wanted. They began with three songs that were thematically linked to their childhoods: [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] and [...] "Penny Lane". The first session saw the introduction of a new keyboard instrument called the Mellotron, the keys of which triggered tape-recordings of a variety of instruments, enabling its user to play keyboard parts using those voices. McCartney performed the introduction to [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] using the flute setting. The track's complicated production involved the innovative splicing of two takes that were recorded in different tempos and pitches. Emerick remembers that during the recording of Revolver, [...] "we had got used to being asked to do the impossible, and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary." [...] In Martin's opinion, Sgt. Pepper [...] "grew naturally out of Revolver", marking [...] "an era of almost continuous technological experimentation".|$|E
500|$|Fear of a Black Planets {{success with}} critics and {{consumers}} {{was viewed as}} a significant factor to hip hop's mainstream emergence in 1990, which Billboard editor Paul Grein said was [...] "the year that rap exploded". In a July 1990 article, Kot compared Public Enemy's influence on hip hop with the album {{at the start of the}} 1990s to the impact of Bob Dylan, George Clinton, and Bob Marley on each of their respective genres and eras, having [...] "given it legitimacy and authority far beyond its core following". Chuck D later said of the album in retrospect, [...] "If It Takes a Nation was our 'nation' record, Fear of a Black Planet was our 'world' record". With respect to hip hop, the album was important in the field of sampling, as copyright lawyers took notice of The Bomb Squad's production and such a sample-heavy work would not be cost effective in the future. Chuck D later said of its sampling issues, [...] "We got sued for everything. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> door on sampling was gonna close". Subsequent use of sampled material, particularly the use of whole songs on top of a beat, by other hip hop artists prompted stricter sampling laws. Fear of a Black Planet was the group's commercial apex, with sales dropping off for their subsequent albums. Chuck D said it was their most successful record, [...] "not because of all the hype and hysteria. It was a world record. Because of all the different feels and the different textures and the flow it had".|$|E

2500|$|On 17 February 2009 (the {{second day}} of the trial) half of the charges against The Pirate Bay were dropped. According to defense lawyer Per Samuelson, [...] "This is a sensation. It is very rare to win half the case in just one and a half days and it is clear the {{prosecutor}} took strong note of what we said yesterday". Peter Danowsky, legal counsel for the music companies, stated [...] "It's a largely technical issue that changes nothing in terms of our compensation claims and has no bearing whatsoever on the main case against The Pirate Bay. In fact it simplifies the prosecutor’s case by allowing him to focus on the main issue which is the making available of copyrighted works." [...] The prosecutor was unable to prove that the [...]torrent files brought as evidence were actually using The Pirate Bay's tracker. Furthermore, prosecutor Håkan Roswall did not adequately explain the function of DHT which allows for so-called [...] "trackerless" [...] torrents. These shortcomings in the evidence resulted in prosecutor Håkan Roswall having to drop all charges relating to [...] "assisting copyright infringement", leaving [...] "assisting making available" [...] as the remaining charge. Roswall stated that [...] "everything related to reproduction will be removed from the claim". Sanna Wolk, a doctor in law and researcher at Stockholm University observed that [...] "this is not surprising, at least for those who follow the matter. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Pirate Bay wasn't making any copies directly".|$|E
