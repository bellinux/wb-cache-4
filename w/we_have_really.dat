25|$|Now {{remember}} that the velocity function is simply the derivative of the position function. So what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> shown is that integrating the velocity simply recovers the original position function. This is the basic idea of the theorem: that integration and differentiation are closely related operations, each essentially being the inverse of the other.|$|E

Britney represents the spirit of Tommy Jeans and of youth today. I cannot think of a better way to continue this exciting year by sponsoring one of today's hottest, young recording artists".|$|E
500|$|Prior to launch, General Manager of Six Flags Fiesta Texas John Odum stated Superman: Krypton Coaster was [...] "the big-league ride <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> needed". He {{stated the}} design of the ride, which interacts with the quarry wall, would make a thrilling ride: [...] "being that close to the wall there is a good sense of speed". In May 2000, two months after Superman: Krypton Coaster opened, it was {{reported}} that the park was [...] "off to a flying start" [...] for the season. Six Flags Fiesta Texas officials stated the ride proved popular in its first year of operation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{his great}} eyes," [...] said my young lady attentively. She had evidently heard all about his great eyes--the beaux yeux for which alone <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> done it all.|$|R
60|$|A {{throng of}} curious, {{laughing}} men crowded around as we marched in, and {{not until the}} uniforms of our prisoners could be seen did they believe <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> made a capture.|$|R
60|$|Olson, Whitely, Wilson, and I {{stood for}} a moment looking at one another. It seemed {{incredible}} that man could be so perfidious--that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> seen with our own eyes the thing that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> seen; but when we returned to the fort, the shattered wall gave us ample evidence that there was no mistake.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> {{and truly}} done all we can?" [...] she said, turning and {{twisting}} Mrs. Catherick's letter in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} thank you for {{explaining}} things so well," [...] she said. [...] "It's the first time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> learned much about my brother's life in Canada." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, Mr. Quatermain, {{these are}} the first words <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> had since that party at Ragnall before I was married, when, {{as you may have}} forgotten, you took me in to dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Captain Martin and I were in {{the thick}} of it. There was very little {{fighting}} to do, for we chose a time when the troops were all busy with Cathelineau's and Stofflet's attack; and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> only to open the door of the prison, to get them out." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “We had 250 female bands {{perform in}} clubs and coffeeshops {{and all kinds}} of places in {{downtown}} Seattle. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> A-list artists come and speak and perform. And all levels performed, actually. It was eclectic and interesting. It was a really big deal because for me all the people I admired were in the same room,” said DeSantis.|$|R
6000|$|They were silent. 'If papa {{had been}} alive, what a {{wonderful}} absorbing interest this story would have had for him,' said Cytherea by-and-by. 'And how strangely knowledge comes to us. <b>We</b> might <b>have</b> searched for a clue to her secret half the world over, and never found one. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> <b>had</b> any motive for trying to discover more of the sad history than papa told us, <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> gone to Bloomsbury; but not caring to do so, we go two hundred miles in the opposite direction, and there find information waiting to be told us. What {{could have been the}} secret, Owen?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There’s a {{practical}} side too. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> {{enough to do}} {{to look after the}} genuine article. You can’t say we are not effective. But we don’t intend to let ourselves be bothered by shams under any pretext whatever.” ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bowen sat {{before the}} hearth in her salon, {{with her hands}} fallen in her lap. At thirty-eight the {{emotions}} engrave themselves more deeply in the face {{than they do in}} our first youth, or than they will when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> aged, and the pretty woman looked haggard.|$|E
6000|$|... 'At any rate,' Mr. Hawtrey continued, 'I {{see nothing}} at present but {{to let the}} matter go on, and for you to obtain, if possible, some decisive proof of the man's {{connection}} with these letters. So far <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> only the most shadowy grounds for our suspicion against him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{it was a}} good {{opportunity}} to air our voices in this resounding piazza," [...] replied one of the artists. [...] "Besides, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> some hopes of summoning Trajan to look at his column, which, you know, he never saw in his lifetime. Here is your model (who, they say, lived and sinned before Trajan's death) still wandering about Rome; and why not the Emperor Trajan?" ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} for me to set down what we said or did when it was seen that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> escaped from as dangerous a venture as human beings ever embarked in. I dare say we acted like a party of simples, and certain it is that the older members of the crew were no less boisterous in their rejoicings than we lads.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2010, Walsh won the Republican primary election, taking about 34 {{percent of}} the vote in a six-person field and moving into the {{district}} from Winnetka in April. The Republican establishment refused to put much stock into the district with National Republican Congressional Committee member Tom Erickson, saying, [...] "In the primary, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> liked Dirk Beveridge or Maria Rodriguez. Those are the two candidates who <b>we</b> thought <b>really</b> <b>had</b> the potential to make this a very competitive race." [...] Walsh's campaign responded that that GOP establishment was [...] "a bit tone deaf when it comes to independent, conservative reform candidates".|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I should love it," [...] she declared, [...] "but I simply shouldn't dare {{to think}} of it. You don't understand, I am afraid, {{the way we live}} down at Wellham Springs. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> no servants, and we do {{everything}} ourselves. I couldn't attempt to manage a house like this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I {{shall have}} to earn my own living. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> very little money and we must, both of us, do something. Now I {{have been trying to}} do in earnest what I have done for my own {{pleasure}} all my life. Do you know what that is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{travelled}} but slowly, at first, {{and it is}} {{only the}} last two days <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> made fair journeys; but {{there was no reason for}} any great haste. The world is all our own, and, at any rate, as long as we were in the forest, there was no fear of wanting food.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{wondered}} whether <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> seen Jana {{in the forest}} on the previous night, but coming {{to the conclusion that}} it was useless to investigate the matter, made no inquiries, especially as these would have revealed to Harût the route by which we approached the temple. Only I pointed out to him that proper defences should be put up here without delay, that is if they meant to make a stronghold of the mountain.|$|R
60|$|However, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> {{no use for}} an American {{literary}} centre {{before the}} Civil War, for {{it was only after}} the Civil War that <b>we</b> <b>really</b> began to <b>have</b> an American literature. Up to that time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a Colonial literature, a Knickerbocker literature, and a New England literature. But as soon as the country began to feel its life in every limb with the coming of peace, it began to speak in the varying accents of all the different sections--North, East, South, West, and Farthest West; but not before that time.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> no {{design to}} stay long at Paris, so indeed, {{excepting}} the city itself, {{there was not}} much to be seen there. Cardinal Richelieu, who was not only a supreme minister in the Church, but Prime Minister in the State, was now made also General of the King's Forces, with a title never known in France before nor since, viz., Lieutenant-General [...] "au place du Roi," [...] in the king's stead, or, as some have since translated it, representing the person of the king.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alice is {{a charming}} girl," [...] said Mrs. Grant impressively. [...] "She is a beauty {{and she is}} also sweet and sensible, which beauties are not always. We are all very much pleased with Leo's choice. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> no more time to spare just now. The wedding is at seven o'clock and it is four already." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will try}} my hand at that paper for H. W. to-morrow, if I {{can get a}} yard of {{flooring}} to sit upon; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> been in that state of topsy-turvyhood that even that has been an unattainable luxury, and may yet be for eight-and-forty hours or so, for anything I see to the contrary.|$|E
60|$|One {{question}} more. Whence {{comes the}} mud? The answer is, Mainly from the detritus of the mountains. There {{it has two}} origins. Part of it is glacial, {{part of it is}} leaf-mould. In order to feel <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> got to the very bottom of the mud problem--and we are nothing if not thorough--we must examine in brief these two separate origins.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{will have}} a look at them before we decide, Bertie. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> not <b>really</b> {{examined}} them since the first day; I really forget what stores we found in the two side-rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What can I do for you, Mr. Bass? <b>We</b> <b>have</b> some <b>really</b> {{good things}} here. For example, this Swiss watch, which I will sell you cheap, for {{one hundred and}} fifty dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, it {{is a kind}} {{of musical}} instrument,' she said. 'But don't let us talk any more about it. This is the second time I have seen you, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>really</b> <b>had</b> a good chance to say {{anything}} to each other.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{will not}} think so badly of my countrymen as to suppose {{for a moment that}} [...] "The Biglow Papers" [...] will not become the {{intimate}} friends of all good fellows in England; and when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> made friends with a book, we like to know something about our friend's father; so I shall add the little I know of the history of James Russell Lowell.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is indeed," [...] Gervaise replied earnestly. [...] "But I {{should be}} glad, sir, {{if you will}} allow that the time should begin to count afresh from our present start. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> had but {{a short period of}} service, for we wasted a week at Genoa, and ten days on our journey back here, so that we have had really no more than a month's active service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] she said, with {{a little}} sigh, [...] "that you are right. I {{do not think that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>really</b> {{improved}} with the centuries. My own ancestors sacked towns and held the inhabitants to ransom. To-day I sit down to bridge opposite a man with a well-filled purse, and my one idea is to lighten it. Nothing, I am convinced, but the fear of being found out, keeps us reasonably moral." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{their first}} march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the settlements, they had plundered and {{stripped}} the inhabitants, totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining the {{people if they}} remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> wanted any. How different was the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march through the most inhabited part of our country, from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint {{for the loss of}} a pig, a chicken, or even an apple! ...|$|R
5000|$|Nancy Youdelman:" [...] Looking back 25 years later, I {{have mixed}} {{feeling about the}} Feminist Art Program - <b>We</b> <b>had</b> {{something}} <b>really</b> incredible and unique and somehow we could not get beyond personalities and create a lasting support system ...|$|R
60|$|The skeletons {{went with}} us {{throughout}} Herculaneum, and descended into the cell, all green with damp, under the basilica, and lay down, fettered and manacled {{in the place}} of those found there beside the big bronze kettle in which the prisoners used to cook their dinners. How ghastly the thought of it was! If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>really</b> seen this kettle and the skeletons there--as we did not--we could not have suffered more than we did. They took all the life out of the House of Perseus, and the beauty from his pretty little domestic temple to the Penates, and this was all there was left in Herculaneum to see.|$|R
