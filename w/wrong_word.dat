25|$|Tongans {{make use}} of {{different}} Tongan words and expressions when addressing, referring to, or speaking {{in the presence of}} persons of different social standing. It is a serious social mistake to use the <b>wrong</b> <b>word</b> in the wrong context. Hence, on many formal occasions, hereditary orators, the matāpule, speak on behalf of commoners who might not know the correct language. They also conduct ceremonies on behalf of the king and nobles.|$|E

Holloway also owned other {{properties}} including a flat in St John's Wood in North West London, which he used when working in the capital, and a flat in Manhattan during the My Fair Lady Broadway years. The final {{years of his life}} were spent in Angmering, West Sussex, with Violet. Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson, Gracie Fields, Maurice Chevalier, Laurence Olivier and Arthur Askey, who said of him, [...] "He was the nicest man I ever knew. He never had a <b>wrong</b> <b>word</b> to say about anyone. He was a great actor, a super mimic and a one-man walking comic show." [...] While working in the US, Holloway numbered among his friends Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Burgess Meredith and Groucho Marx.|$|E

Melvin Belli, her parents' lawyer, {{said that they had}} passed a lie detector test [...] "with flying colors". Barr was even part of an incest recovery group, something she said her parents knew about but for which they were [...] "in denial". On February 14, 2011, Barr and Geraldine appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Barr admitted that the word [...] "incest" [...] could have been the <b>wrong</b> <b>word</b> to use and should have waited until her therapy was over before revealing the [...] "darkest time" [...] in her life. She told Oprah, [...] "I was in a very unhappy relationship and I was prescribed numerous psychiatric drugs... to {{deal with the fact that}} I had some mental illness... I totally lost touch with reality... (and) I didn’t know what the truth was... I just wanted to drop a bomb on my family". She added that not everything was [...] "made up", saying, [...] "Nobody accuses their parents of abusing them without justification". Geraldine said they did not speak for 12 years, but had recently reconciled.|$|E

500|$|The Duff family {{formed a}} {{janitorial}} services company, Windy City Maintenance Inc., {{one month after}} Daley's inauguration. Bruce DuMont, president of the Museum of Broadcast Communications, said that Daley recommended that Dumont's wife Kathy Osterman, then director of the Mayor's Office of Special Events, award city contracts to Duff family companies. Daley denied steering contracts to the Duffs, {{and said he would}} [...] "look into" [...] the allegations, while stopping short of promising to do so, saying [...] "I don't promise. That's the <b>wrong</b> <b>word</b> to use. You know... promising, promising. We do look into it, yes." [...] In September 2003 a federal investigation led to indictments of Patricia Green Duff, her sons John M. Duff and James Duff, and others on charges they won nearly $100 million in city contracts through the city's set-aside program by misrepresenting their companies as women- and minority-owned. John M. Duff pleaded guilty to 33 counts of racketeering, fraud and other charges on January 10, 2004. A 1978 state law designed by Illinois Democrats gave the Mayor the power to appoint to fill vacancies in the City Council rather than holding special elections, and by 2002 {{more than a third of}} the Council's 50 aldermen were initially appointed by Daley. The [...] Council became even more of a rubber stamp than in Richard J. Daley's terms. In the 18 months from January 12, 2000 to June 6, 2001, only 13 votes in the [...] Council were divided, less than one a month. 32 aldermen supported the mayor 90-100% of the time and another 14 80-89% of the time.|$|E

For many Italians, that confused and incoherent speech was the final proof that something was wrong with Mussolini.|$|E

[...] and that [...] "I wouldn't say the war is winnable in Afghanistan — that's the <b>wrong</b> <b>word.</b> Can we contain the Taliban and make life better for the locals, if we get more troops?

2500|$|On June 8, 1981, Cotten had a {{heart attack}} {{followed}} by a stroke that affected his speech center. He began years of therapy which in time made it possible for him to speak again. As he began to recover, he and Orson Welles talked on the phone each week for a couple of hours: [...] "He was strong and supportive," [...] Cotten wrote, [...] "and whenever I used the <b>wrong</b> <b>word</b> (which was frequently) he would say, 'That's a much better word, Jo, I'm going to use it.'" [...] He and Welles would meet for lunch and reminisce, and when Cotten said he had written a book Welles asked for the manuscript and read it that same night. In a phone conversation on October 9, 1985, Welles told his friend and mentor Roger Hill that Cotten had written a book, and Hill asked how it read. [...] "Gentle, witty, and self-effacing, just like Jo," [...] Welles replied. [...] "My only complaint is that it's too brief." [...] Welles died the following day. [...] "Somewhere among his possessions is a manuscript of this book," [...] Cotten wrote on the last page of his autobiography, published in 1987 under the title Vanity Will Get You Somewhere.|$|E

Then match the results of the word segmentation and the error dictionary, and correct some <b>wrong</b> <b>words</b> by the error dictionary.

60|$|That false notion springs out of men's selfishness. They {{think of}} sin as {{something}} which only hurts themselves; {{when they do}} wrong they think merely, 'What punishment will God inflict on ME for doing wrong?' They are wrapt up in themselves. They forget that their sins are not merely a matter between them and Christ, but between them and their neighbours; that every wrong action they commit, every <b>wrong</b> <b>word</b> they speak, every wrong habit in which they indulge themselves, sooner or later, more or less hurts their neighbours-- ay, hurts all mankind.|$|E

We know {{what we want to}} say, and how we wish to appear, but, just as a patient in aphasia uses the <b>wrong</b> <b>word,</b> we use the wrong manifestation.'

30|$|The {{result of}} our {{procedure}} is the percentage of correctly recognized words of a sequence—the word recognition rate. It is robust to reading errors.

This corresponds to the perception by a human listener and, therefore, reflects the definition of intelligibility.|$|R
