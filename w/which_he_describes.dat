5|$|According to a DJ Premier fan blog, The Source's {{website and}} other sites, DJ Kool Herc fell gravely ill in early 2011 and {{was said to}} lack health insurance. He had surgery for kidney stones, with a stent placed to relieve the pressure. He needed {{follow-up}} surgery but St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, the site that performed the previous surgery, has requested that he make a deposit toward the next surgery, because he has missed several follow-up visits. The hospital {{said it would not}} turn away uninsured patients in the emergency room. DJ Kool Herc and his family set up an official website on <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> his medical issue and the larger goal of establishing the DJ Kool Herc Fund to pioneer long-term health care solutions. In April 2013, Campbell recovered from surgery and moved into post-medical care.|$|E
5|$|Intrigued by the article, Valiente wrote {{a letter}} to Williamson in 1952, who in turn put her in contact with Gardner. Valiente and Gardner wrote several letters back-and-forth, with the latter {{eventually}} suggesting that she meet him at the home of his friend and fellow Wiccan Edith Woodford-Grimes ("Dafo"), who lived not far from Bournemouth, in the Christchurch area. Before she left the meeting, Gardner gave her a copy of his 1949 novel, High Magic's Aid, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> a fictionalised account of Wiccan initiates in the Middle Ages; he allegedly did so in order to gauge her opinion on ritual nudity and scourging, both of which were present in his tradition of Gardnerian Wicca.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, such works as Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue and 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade were exemplars {{of the theme}} of sado-masochism and {{influenced}} later erotic accounts of Sadism and masochism in fiction. De Sade (as did the later writer Sacher-Masoch) lent his name to the sexual acts <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> in his work.|$|E

In 813 {{and again}} in 1206, after the Battle of Rodosto, it was sacked by the Bulgarians, but it continued to appear {{as a place of}} considerable note in later Byzantine history. It was also ruled by the Venetians between 1204 and 1235. The 11th-century Byzantine historian Michael Attaleiates owned property in Raidestos <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> in his will.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known published {{record of}} Liquidambar styraciflua is {{in a work}} by Spanish naturalist Francisco Hernández published posthumously in 1615, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> the species as a large tree producing a fragrant gum resembling liquid amber, whence the genus name Liquidambar. In John Ray's Historia Plantarum (1686) it is called Styrax liquida. However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the Govorner of Cuba, in the year 1517.|$|E
25|$|One {{objective}} of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary was {{to offer their}} own interpretation for motivations behind Grendel's behavior and for what happened when Beowulf was in the cave of Grendel's mother. They justified these choices by arguing that Beowulf acts as an unreliable narrator in {{the portion of the}} poem in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> his battle with Grendel's mother. These choices also helped them to better connect the third act to the second of their screenplay, which is divided in the poem by a 50-year gap.|$|E

25|$|Crews {{completed}} his undergraduate education at Yale University in 1955. Though his degree was in English, Crews entered the Directed Studies program {{during his first}} two years at Yale, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> as his greatest experience because the program was taught by a coordinated faculty and required students to distribute their courses among sciences, social sciences, literature, and philosophy. He received his Ph.D in Literature from Princeton University in 1958. Crews cited Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Hawthorne, and Freud as his major influences during his time at Princeton.|$|E
25|$|Francione's Animals, Property, and the Law (1995) was {{the first}} {{extensive}} jurisprudential treatment of animal rights. In it, Francione compares the situation of animals {{to the treatment of}} slaves in the United States, where legislation existed that appeared to protect them, while the courts ignored that the institution of slavery itself rendered the protection unenforceable. He offers as an example the United States Animal Welfare Act, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> as an example of symbolic legislation, intended to assuage public concern about the treatment of animals, but difficult to implement.|$|E
25|$|Juan de Grijalva {{was one of}} {{the first}} Spaniards to explore Mexico and {{traveled}} on his expedition in 1518 with Juan Díaz. Diaz wrote Itinerario de Grijalva before 1520, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> the aftermath of a sacrifice on an island off the coast of Veracruz. He said,When he reached said tower the Captain asked him why such deeds were committed there and the Indian answered that it was done as a kind of sacrifice and gave to understand that the victims were beheaded on the wide stone; that the blood was poured into the vase and that the heart was taken out of the breast and burnt and offered to the said idol. The fleshy parts of the arms and legs were cut off and eaten. This was done to the enemies with whom they were at war.|$|E

25|$|Tal was {{a strong}} believer {{in the value of}} {{electronic}} instruments and their potential to transcend the limitations of acoustical means of sound production. Tal regarded electronic music as a new music language, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> as unstable and lacking a crystallized definition. He viewed the computer as an instrument which compels the composer to disciplined thinking. In return, it stores the data it was fed with absolute faithfulness. Nevertheless, when the computer is ill-used, the composer's incompetence will be revealed, as he is unable to unite computer with the realm of music. But according to Tal, composing electronic music has another aspect too: when the composer chooses the computer's music-notation as his tool for creating, he concomitantly annuls the performer's role as an interpreter. From that point on, it is only the composer's mental capacity that counts, and the performance is independent of the interpreter's virtuosity.|$|E
25|$|Mill {{preferred}} {{to take a}} more theoretical approach to social subjects than the empirical one common at the time. His best known literary work is his History of British India, in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> the acquisition of the Indian Empire by England and later the United Kingdom. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the Hindu civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country. Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's History of India by notable economist Amartya Sen.|$|E
25|$|The only {{words of}} Jesus {{on the cross}} in the Mark and Matthew accounts, this is a {{quotation}} of Psalm 22. Since other verses of the same Psalm are cited in the crucifixion accounts, it is often considered a literary and theological creation. Geza Vermes, however, {{points out that the}} verse is cited in Aramaic rather than the Hebrew in which it usually would have been recited, and suggests that by the time of Jesus, this phrase had become a proverbial saying in common usage. Compared to the accounts in the other Gospels, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> as 'theologically correct and reassuring', he considers this phrase 'unexpected, disquieting and in consequence more probable'. He describes it as bearing 'all the appearances of a genuine cry'. Raymond Brown likewise comments that he finds 'no persuasive argument against attributing to the Jesus of Mark/Matt the literal sentiment of feeling forsaken expressed in the Psalm quote'.|$|E
