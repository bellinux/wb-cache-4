5|$|The {{major league}} {{game in the}} United States was {{originally}} targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the National League's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the <b>workweek</b> daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. A century later, the situation was very different. With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices—football, basketball, and hockey—professional baseball had become among the most blue-collar-oriented of leading American spectator sports.|$|E
5|$|In October 1973, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC, {{consisting}} of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared significant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and other industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A previous embargo attempt was largely ineffective {{in response to the}} Six-Day War in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and OPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy rationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil production, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a time, the UK imposed an emergency three-day <b>workweek.</b> Seven European nations banned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of gasoline that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days when gasoline could be purchased, based on license plate numbers. Even after the embargo ended in March 1974 following intense diplomatic activity, prices continued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with unemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and bond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a dramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to raising {{the wages of}} his workers, Ford also introduced a new, reduced <b>workweek</b> in 1926. The decision was made in 1922, when Ford and Crowther described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week, but in 1926 it was announced as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week. (Apparently the program started with Saturday being a workday and sometime later it was changed to a day off.) On May 1, 1926, the Ford Motor Company's factory workers switched to a five-day 40-hour <b>workweek,</b> with the company's office workers making the transition the following August.|$|E

50|$|The Licentiate of Engineering is an {{intermediate}} postgraduate degree used {{only in a}} few countries, among them Sweden and Finland, and {{can be seen as}} an academic step halfway between a Master's and a PhD.

The Licentiate of Engineering corresponds to 120 ECTS credits (80 <b>workweeks</b> (old credits)), or nominally two years of full-time work, whereas a PhD amounts to 240 ECTS credits (160 <b>workweeks</b> (old credits)), or a nominal period of four years of full-time work (one old credit equals one week of full-time studies). However, {{as a result of the}} differences in requirements and individual performance, the time to complete a Licentiate of Engineering degree varies.
