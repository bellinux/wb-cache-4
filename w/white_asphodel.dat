50|$|Asphodelus albus, {{common name}} <b>white</b> <b>asphodel,</b> is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant {{belonging to the}} genus Asphodelus.|$|E
50|$|In Ancient Greece, <b>white</b> <b>asphodel</b> was {{associated}} with mourning and death. Its presence was held to facilitate the transition of the dead to Elysium, {{and it is a}} feature of the Asphodel Meadows.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of its relief and {{geographic}} situation, the Ubaye Valley has an [...] "abundance of plant and animal species". The fauna is largely constituted of golden eagles, marmots, ibex and vultures, and the flora includes a large proportion of larches, génépis and <b>white</b> <b>asphodels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Matthew Ward's {{translation}} of Albert Camus' [...] "The Stranger" [...] the plateau {{next to the}} beach where Mersault will shoot an Arab is [...] "covered with yellowish rocks and the <b>whitest</b> <b>asphodels</b> set against the already hard blue of the sky"(49). Camus, Albert. [...] "The Stranger". translated by Matthew Ward. Vintage Books; New York, 1989. Page 49.|$|R
6000|$|... * Take this rough {{distinction}} {{of the four}} tribes: lilies, superior ovary, <b>white</b> seeds; <b>asphodels,</b> superior ovary, black seeds; irids, inferior ovary, style (typically) rising into central crest; amaryllids, inferior ovary, stamens (typically) joined in central cup. Then the rushes are a dark group, through which they stoop to the grasses.|$|R
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>asphodel</b> is {{commonly}} found in meadows and heathland of central Spain, southwest France, and along the southern Alps to the western Balkans up to an altitude of 2000 m. It is also found on the continent Africa, mainly in Libyan territory. Soils with a high lime content are preferred.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>asphodel</b> {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 50 - 120 cm. The plain stem is {{supported}} by fleshy, thickened roots (rhizomes). The leaves, which originate {{from the base of}} the stem, are gutter-shaped and glaucous (covered by a waxy coating), about 20 - 22 mm wide and 50 - 70 cm long. The white hermaphroditic flowers are funnel-shaped, 4 cm of diameter, with six elongated petals. The flowering period extends from April through June. The egg-shaped yellow-green seed capsules are usually 8 - 10 mm in length.|$|E
60|$|GILBERT. Like the Persephone of whom Landor tells us, {{the sweet}} pensive Persephone around whose <b>white</b> feet the <b>asphodel</b> and {{amaranth}} are blooming, he will sit contented 'in that deep, motionless quiet which mortals pity, {{and which the}} gods enjoy.' He will look out upon the world and know its secret. By contact with divine things he will become divine. His will be the perfect life, and his only.|$|R
25|$|The {{upper section}} of Charles V Wall has {{recently}} been restored by the Bonita Trust, together with the Government of Gibraltar. The wall is in good condition and is fitted with a handrail {{and it is possible}} to walk along it from the foot to the top of The Rock. The upper section of Charles V Wall lies within the Upper Rock Nature Reserve which was established in 1993 and covers about 40% of Gibraltar's total land area. Inglis Way, one of the walks within the reserve begins at Queen's Gate near the foot of the upper section of the wall at Prince Ferdinand's Battery. It leads through a region of esparto grass, <b>white</b> asparagus, common <b>asphodel</b> and germander.|$|R
50|$|The {{area of the}} Rock {{through which}} the path passes {{is one of the}} richest in Gibraltar for flora and fauna. The start of the path is {{relatively}} sparsely vegetated and includes species such as <b>White</b> Asparagus, Common <b>Asphodel,</b> Germander and Esparto Grass. Its later sections proceed through dense vegetation that is typical of Mediterranean maquis shrubland - a widespread biome in southern Europe that consists of densely growing evergreen shrubs adapted to resist droughts. The trees along the path are predominantly olives. These have all grown since the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83) when the Upper Rock's original woodland was felled by the British garrison to serve as fuel. It is thought that the present arboreal flora of Gibraltar is the result of seeds being brought onto the Rock by birds. The maquis flora includes dense knots of creepers such as smilax, December clematis, pipe fine and black bryony, while ferns such as southern polypody and the rusty-back fern exploit the shade provided by the canopy. Many species of aromatic herbs and flowers also grow alongside the path, including purple Jerusalem sage and bee orchids. The fauna includes various species of birds that are adapted to life in the maquis, including the Sardinian warbler, wren and woodcock. Barbary partridges {{can be seen in the}} more open areas adjoining the path. Europe's largest lizard, the ocellated lizard, also lives in the vicinity, along with Iberian wall lizard, Algerian sand racer and Moorish gecko.|$|R
