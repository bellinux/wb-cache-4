It sometimes eats unusual items such as cotton cake, soybean meal, domestic animal droppings, beans, and cultivated grain such as corn, wheat, and sorghum.|$|E
5|$|Sterility in a non-polyploid hybrid {{is often}} a result of {{chromosome}} number; if parents are of differing chromosome pair number, the offspring will have an odd number of chromosomes, which leaves them unable to produce chromosomally-balanced gametes. While that is undesirable in a crop such as wheat, for which growing a crop that produces no seeds would be pointless, it is an attractive attribute in some fruits. Triploid bananas and <b>watermelons</b> are intentionally bred because they produce no seeds and are also parthenocarpic.|$|E
5|$|In the Caucasus and Transcaucasia, golden jackals {{primarily}} hunt hares and mouse-like rodents, {{and also}} pheasants, francolins, ducks, coots, moorhens, and passerines.

5|$|The town {{began to}} develop after the {{completion}} of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, which was designed to facilitate farming. At this time, many farmers came to Omak looking for homes. Fruits including apples, berries, peaches, plums and <b>watermelons</b> were cultivated after 1910. Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high school sports. During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the megaproject ended. By 1950, the city was home to various buildings and structures including the St. Mary Mission church, which satisfied residential needs.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, <b>watermelons,</b> cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat <b>watermelons</b> that let him spit out seeds, or flaming enemies that let him spit out fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the physical properties of Western Sudan <b>watermelon</b> (Citrullus vulgaris) and <b>watermelon</b> seeds {{to be used in the}} design of a machine to harvest and separate <b>watermelon</b> seeds from the pulp. The samples were selected from the 2003 / 04 and 2004 / 05 growing seasons. The actual volume of <b>watermelon</b> was determined by water displacement method and then the <b>watermelon</b> density and specific gravity were determined. The three axial diameters were measured using an overhead projector. The relationship between the actual volume and the measured dimensions was determined to verify that the estimated volume may be used as a criterion to decide that if these dimensions were sufficient to define <b>watermelon</b> form. The shape of Western Sudan <b>watermelon</b> was resembled by sphere, oblate spheroid and prolate spheroid. The predicted <b>watermelon</b> volumes using the three geometric shapes models were related to the actual volumes. The actual <b>watermelon</b> surface area was determined using a digital planimeter then the rind thickness was measured using a vernier caliper. The predicted surface areas using the three geometric shapes were related to the actual surface areas. The actual <b>watermelon</b> surface area was related to its weight and volume by assuming a linear and non-linear regression models. The predicted surface areas using these two models were related to the actual surface areas. The initial moisture content of <b>watermelon</b> seeds was determined using an air oven method. Then the specific gravity of <b>watermelon</b> seeds was determined using the method of pycnometer and toluene. The weight of 100 seeds, the percentage of red and brown seeds and the percentage of large seeds were recorded to be used in grading the <b>watermelon</b> seeds. The oil content of each <b>watermelon</b> seed variety was found using a soxhelt extracting apparatus. The results showed that both the <b>watermelon</b> density and specific gravity were 0. 876 g/cc and 0. 892, respectively. The estimated <b>watermelon</b> volume can be used as adequate criterion then the measurement of three axial dimensions, gave a complete theoretical specification of the <b>watermelon</b> shape and size. The oblate spheroid model was found to be more accurate in predicting the volume and surface area of Western Sudan <b>watermelon</b> compared to the sphere and the prolate spheroid models. This suggested that the <b>watermelon</b> shape can be described by an oblate spheroid. The average rind thickness of <b>watermelon</b> was 0. 37 mm. Linear regression models were developed to correlate the <b>watermelon</b> surface area with both its weight and volume. It was found that there was strong correlation between the <b>watermelon</b> surface area and its volume than with its weight. Also it was found that the oblate spheroid model was the most accurate predictor of the <b>watermelon</b> surface area among the models tested. The average initial moisture content of the <b>watermelon</b> seeds dried at 105 ± 1 °C for 48 hrs was 38. 2 % (moisture, w. b.). Based on this moisture content, the average specific gravity of the <b>watermelon</b> seeds was 1. 016. The <b>watermelon</b> seeds involved in this study were graded as Super Casheir, Casheir, Normal White and Farrasha – third. The <b>watermelon</b> seeds yield a valuable amount of oil ranged from 20. 05 to 24. 05 %. Key Words: Western Sudan watermelon; physical properties; criterion...|$|R

40|$|Grafting <b>watermelon</b> onto {{bottle gourd}} {{rootstock}} {{is commonly used}} method to generate resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON), but knowledge {{of the effect of}} the root exudates of grafted <b>watermelon</b> on this soil-borne pathogen in rhizosphere remains limited. To investigate the root exudate profiles of the own-root bottle gourd, grafted-root <b>watermelon</b> and own-root <b>watermelon,</b> recirculating hydroponic culture system was developed to continuously trap these root exudates. Both conidial germination and growth of FON were significantly decreased in the presence of root exudates from the grafted-root <b>watermelon</b> compared with the own-root <b>watermelon.</b> HPLC analysis revealed that the composition of the root exudates released by the grafted-root <b>watermelon</b> differed not only from the own-root <b>watermelon</b> but also from the bottle gourd rootstock plants. We identified salicylic acid in all 3 root exudates, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid in root exudates from own-root bottle gourd and grafted-root <b>watermelon</b> but not own-root <b>watermelon,</b> and abundant cinnamic acid only in own-root <b>watermelon</b> root exudates. The chlorogenic and caffeic acid were candidates for potentiating the enhanced resistance of the grafted <b>watermelon</b> to FON, therefore we tested the effects of the two compounds on the conidial germination and growth of FON. Both phenolic acids inhibited FON conidial germination and growth in a dose-dependent manner, and FON was much more susceptible to chlorogenic acid than to caffeic acid. In conclusion, the key factor in attaining the resistance to Fusarium wilt is grafting on the non-host root stock, however, the root exudates profil...|$|R

5|$|San Martín {{moved the}} {{regiment}} from Retiro to Rosario, nearing {{the river at}} San Pedro and San Nicolás. He was following the Spanish ships and moved at night to avoid detection. San Martín had one hundred and twenty men for this action, reinforced at Rosario by a militia of seventy men {{under the command of}} Celedonio Escalada. Those reinforcements included twenty two rifleman, thirty cavalry, a small cannon and men armed with knives. Escalada had made other actions against the royalists before this battle. San Martín discovered that the royalists intended to pillage the San Carlos Convent and pressed the march to arrive there first. A hundred royalists landed on San Lorenzo, but the only food available to them was some chickens and <b>watermelons.</b> Aware of the risk of pillage, the population had removed the cattle from the area before the royalists arrived. Escalada arrived in San Lorenzo before the bulk of the patriot army, but the dust trail from the path to Rosario revealed their presence. Escalada attacked them but their ship had a longer range than his cannon, keeping him at bay. He was forced to retire when he found a Paraguayan prisoner who had escaped from the ship. The Paraguayan disclosed the size of the royalist army and their plan of attacking the convent with a larger force, suspecting that the local money was kept in it. They did not attack the convent right away, requiring time to prepare the two field cannons. Escalada returned with San Martin and relayed the news. The march from Retiro to the convent took only five days, thanks to the cadet Ángel Pacheco. Pacheco moved ahead of the regiment and prepared horses in advance at the relay positions. The whole army arrived on scene during the night of 2 February and hid inside the convent. They entered through the rear door and were not allowed to light fires or speak during the night. San Martín studied the enemy and the battlefield from the convent's tower, using a monocular.|$|E
