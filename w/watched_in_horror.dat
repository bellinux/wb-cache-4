5|$|Pattle's {{success in}} the air was overshadowed by events on the ground. The Allied forces were routed at Vevi and the Battle of the Metaxas Line had ended in total defeat for the Greek Army on 9 April. Covering the Greek forces from Larissa, Pattle claimed another Do 17 and SM.79 along with a Bf 109 damaged for his 35th and 36th aerial victories. Interceptions would now be more {{difficult}} for the port of Salonika fell. Observers at the port had been able to telephone his operations hut to warn him of approaching enemy aircraft over Mount Olympus. Pattle had to send pairs of fighters to patrol the area, which helped act as a rudimentary warning system. The effect was that there was little warning of impending attacks. The Germans, now operating from forward airfields, slipped through unnoticed. On 13 April, Pattle witnessed 15 Bf 109s strafe the airfield as three Hurricanes took off. Two veteran pilots were killed in the very brief battle in exchange for two Bf 109s. Pattle searched for the Hurricane pilots and found one fighter with a parachute beside it but no pilot. Pattle was to be further disheartened. One of the German pilots bailed out and Pattle <b>watched</b> <b>in</b> <b>horror</b> as the Greek soldiers guarding the airfield shot him dead as he floated down in his parachute. One of the Bf 109s crash-landed perfectly. He ordered that no-one should approach the Bf 109 in case it was rigged with explosives. The pilot was likely Hans-Jakob Arnoldy.|$|E

For {{two days after the}} ARVN left the area, the Wing Commander at Phan Rang fought on with the forces under his command.|$|E
25|$|The Hellfire Club {{was then}} {{able to claim}} Jean {{as one of their}} members. By using the {{combined}} telepathic powers of both Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos, they mentally tricked Jean into doing what they wanted by using images of Scott and Professor X. But the mental contact was interrupted by Scott's unusually strong physic/telepathic connection to Jean. The Stepford Cuckoos then tried to release the Phoenix Force so they could be hosts, and seemingly succeeded. Emma was shocked when she learned the true purpose was for the Inner Circle to control the vastly limitless power and energy of the Phoenix when she originally thought that they were trying to release the Phoenix back into space to prevent the world from destruction. Jean and Cyclops then left to fight the Phoenix, but not before Jean angrily pinned Emma to the wall and telekinetically bound Emma with iron pipes after seeing Emma passionately kiss Cyclops (leading her to suspect that Emma may have plotted to steal Cyclops from her). Jean was unable to subdue the Phoenix herself, prompting Cyclops to attack the cosmic entity, only to be struck down as Jean <b>watched</b> <b>in</b> <b>horror.</b> Before the Phoenix could kill Cyclops, Emma, freed by Wolverine, arrived and took the Phoenix Force into herself, seemingly dying in the process by shattering into several diamond fragments. Jean has rejoined the X-Men and her memories have since returned and appeared to have reconciled with Cyclops.|$|E

500|$|Suspicion soon {{arose in}} the {{threatened}} city that the fire was no accident. The swirling winds carried sparks and burning flakes long distances to lodge on thatched roofs and in wooden gutters, causing seemingly unrelated house fires to break out far from their source and giving rise to rumours that fresh fires were being set on purpose. Foreigners were immediately suspects because of the current Second Anglo-Dutch War. Fear and suspicion hardened into certainty on Monday, as reports circulated of imminent invasion and of foreign undercover agents seen casting [...] "fireballs" [...] into houses, or caught with hand grenades or matches.
