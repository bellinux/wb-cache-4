5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

In {{view of the}} worsening economic crisis in 2008–2009, as of January 2009 the Prime Minister's salary was cut to $3.04 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers was reduced by 18% to $1.57 million. In November 2009 the Public Service Division announced that pay increments would be deferred {{for a second time}} in 2010 because of the uncertain economic recovery. A minister's 2009 salary of $1,494,700 per year was therefore 22% lower than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she received in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she wants.

25|$|Sex {{education}} may be taught informally, {{such as when}} someone receives information from {{a conversation with a}} parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.|$|E

500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first thing [...] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. The second thing is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she likes without being hindered." ...|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983.

[...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E

There is gentle grace, a restrained and quiet elegance, an ethereal, out-worldly beauty, and above all else - a life that throbs and pulsates and thereby enlivens the bronze sculpture. By means of [...] the facial expressions, the gestures or mudras the overall body posture and other accompanying bronzes we can imagine the surroundings and the religious context of the figure of the god or goddess; what instrument or weapon he or she is holding; <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is leaning on; and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is doing or about to do.|$|E

2500|$|Viewers {{of child}} {{pornography}} who are pedophiles are particularly obsessive about collecting, organizing, categorizing, and labeling their child pornography collection according to age, gender, sex act and fantasy. According to FBI agent Ken Lanning, [...] "collecting" [...] pornography {{does not mean that}} they merely view pornography, but that they save it, and [...] "it comes to define, fuel, and validate their most cherished sexual fantasies." [...] An extensive collection indicates a strong sexual preference for children, and if a collector {{of child pornography}} is also a pedophile, the owned collection is the single best indicator of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she wants to do.

During this time, a [...] "sender" [...] observes a randomly chosen target and tries to mentally send this information to the receiver. [...] The receiver speaks out loud during the thirty minutes, describing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she can see.

2500|$|After the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, Thomson saw evidence of the relatively short habitable age of the Earth as tending to contradict Darwin's gradualist explanation of slow natural selection bringing about biological diversity. Thomson's own views favoured a version of theistic evolution sped up by divine guidance. His calculations showed that the Sun could not have possibly existed long enough to allow the slow incremental development by evolution – unless some energy source beyond <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> any other Victorian era person knew of was found. He was soon drawn into public disagreement with geologists, and with Darwin's supporters John Tyndall and T.H. Huxley. In his response to Huxley's address to the Geological Society of London (1868) he presented his address [...] "Of Geological Dynamics", (1869) which, among his other writings, challenged the geologists' acceptance that the earth must be of indefinite age.|$|E
