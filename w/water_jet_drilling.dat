40|$|AbstractComposite {{laminates}} {{are used}} in many applications in industries like aerospace and aircraft due to their extremely high strength to weight ratio and corrosion resistance properties. The composite laminates are difficult to machine materials, which results into low drilling efficiency and drilling-induced delamination, thus {{it is important to}} develop an innovative advanced drilling process to overcome the difficulties related in the machining of composite materials. This work is focused on comprehensive experimental characterization to understand the effect of cutting parameters on the delamination extent during abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> of carbon fiber reinforced polymer. Processing parameters, such as standoff distance and water pressure plays dominant role in delamination than abrasive flow rate. It also describes the development of different techniques for controlling the delamination in abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> process, such as backup plate, pre-drilled hole and water immersion (under water).

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) The growing need of {{creating}} a network of sensors in critical environment to monitor, sense and alert an operator about the environment {{gives rise to the}} research work carried out in the area of power supply to these sensors. Wireless sensors are usually designed to run on batteries. However, as the number of sensors increases and the devices decrease in size, there is clearly a need to explore alternatives to battery power for wireless sensors. Reliable, efficient and environmentally friendly energy harvesting methods could be adopted to design and build a new electronic device {{that could be used to}} replace or supplement batteries in wireless sensors. This thesis focuses on potential ambient sources of power that can be harvested to run low power wireless sensors in mining environments. It discusses several techniques for converting energy from such sources into useful electrical power. In particular, piezoelectric power conversion technique is described in detail. Drilling is a crucial component in both underground and surface mining. <b>Water</b> <b>jet</b> assisted <b>drilling</b> is an example of a new drilling technology employing wireless sensors. There are various forms of energy that could potentially be used to power wireless electronic sensors provided the waste energy can be tapped in an intrinsically safe way. In this particular project, the required power to run sensors could be generated by converting mechanical vibration produced from <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> assisted <b>drilling</b> into electrical energy with an intrinsically safe circuit. Various power scavenging methods were researched, but vibration-to-electricity conversion using piezo-ceramic material was selected as the most promising method for this project. Piezo-based energy conversion is not normally good for mining applications because of intrinsic safety issues. In the case of <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> assisted <b>drilling,</b> however, the environment is much more suitable for piezo-electric conversion. A detailed computer model for this type of power conversion has been developed. The mechanical model of the vibration spectrum is based on test data from the Contents 2 CRC-Mining group. A power conversion circuit has been built, detailed circuit simulations studied and the experimental results are demonstrated. An example vibration scenario consisting of (20 x 10 ^- 6) rms strain is considered. Based on this, and a detailed model of a 70 mmx 25 mm PZT piezoelectric patch with 0 : 2 mm thickness, our computer simulation studies and experiments demonstrate the ability to harvest up to 210 mW of power...|$|R

Results showed that the surface texture can be characterized by (i) maximum peak-to-valley distance and (ii) periodicity. Acquired maps confirm that electro-eroded surfaces are an envelope of craters randomly distributed with total excursion up to 1. 7 μm with a crater size of 15 μm.

Scientists hoped to use a hot <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> to <b>drill</b> a borehole 36 centimeters (14 inches) wide down through the ice to the lake, to enable a probe to retrieve sediment and water to be analyzed for microorganisms.

40|$|In {{orthopaedic}} surgery, <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> provides {{several advantages}} over classic drilling with rigid drilling bits, {{such as the}} always sharp cut, absence of thermal damage and increased manoeuvrability. Previous research showed that the heterogeneity of bone tissue can cause variation in drilling depth whilst <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling.</b> To improve control over the drilling depth, a new method is tested consisting of two water jets that collide directly below the bone surface. The expected working principle is that after collision the jets will disintegrate, with the result of eliminating the destructive power of the coherent jets and leaving the bone tissue underneath the focal point intact. To assess the working principle of colliding water jets (CWJ), the influence of inhomogeneity of the bone tissue on the variation of the drilling depth {{and the impact of}} jet time (t(wj)) on the drilling depth were compared to a single water jet (SWJ) with a similar power. 98 holes were drilled in 14 submerged porcine tali with two conditions CWJ (impact angle of 30 degrees and 90 degrees) and SWJ. The water pressure was 70 MPa for all conditions. The water jet diameter was 0. 3 mm for CWJ and 0. 4 mm for SWJ. t(wj) was set at 1, 3, 5 and 8 s. Drilling depth and hole diameter were measured using microCT scans. A non-parametric Levene's test was performed to assess a significant difference in variance between conditions SWJ and CWJ. A regression analysis was used to determine differences in influence of t(wj) on the drilling depth. Hole diameter differences were assessed using a one way Anova. A significance level of p < 0. 05 was set. Condition CWJ significantly decreases the drilling depth variance caused by the heterogeneity of the bone when compared to SWJ. The mean depth for CWJ was 0. 9 mm (SD 0. 3 mm) versus 4. 8 mm (SD 2. 0) for SWJ. t(wj) affects the drilling depth less for condition CWJ (p < 0. 01, R- 2 = 0. 30) than for SWJ (p < 0. 01, R- 2 = 0. 46). The impact angle (30 degrees or 90 degrees) of the CWJ does not influence the drilling depth nor the variation in depth. The diameters of the resulting holes {{in the direction of the}} jets is significantly larger for CWJ at 90 degrees than for 30 degrees or a single jet. This study shows that CWJ provides accurate depth control when <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> in an inhomogeneous material such as bone. The maximum variance measured by using the 95 % confidence interval is 0. 6 mm opposed to 5. 4 mm for SWJ. This variance is smaller than the accuracy required for bone debridement treatments (2 - 4 mm deep) or drilling pilot holes. This confirms that the use of CWJ is an inherently safe method that can be used to accurately drill in bone...|$|E

The mining industry requires a viable and sustainable approach to overcome the current downtrend. This is only possible by concurrently focussing on productivity improvement and operating costs reduction, delivered through both incremental and step change technology development. Four technologies are presented in this paper: fibre optic borehole sensing has been demonstrated to reveal detailed information about gas flow influx, water level and borehole blockage events occurring along the length of a surface-to-inseam lateral. Fibre optic gas sensing has also been investigated, and this technology promises a remote, intrinsically safe, distributed solution. Recent developments in continuous <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> technology have demonstrated a step change increase in drilling rates and flexibility for coal seam degassing, applicable in both surface-to-inseam and underground in-seam applications.

40|$|Conventional {{water-jet}} nozzle {{systems have}} been developed and partially used in the oil and gas industry to drill horizontal sidetracks. However, this technique still presents a few shortcomings associated with tube buckling and water jet sagging. Due to these problems, the drilled hole deviates from the desired path and does not reach the target reservoir. The issue becomes more complex due to the continuously moving boundaries representing the borehole profile, which is, in turn, governed by the nozzle dynamics. A mathematical model representing the dynamics of <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> confined in a borehole along with drilling mud is developed to predict the sagging phenomenon during the drilling process. The closed form solution of the governing equation is obtained for horizontal drilling in shallow formation layers. The solution shows the strong influence of nozzle vibration and the magnitude of thrust force at the nozzle tip on the profile and the diameter of drilled hole. For sidetrack drilling of greater than 400  m length, the magnitude of sagging {{is large enough to}} miss the target reservoir.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{patented}} {{and transferred}} to industry an abrasive-enhanced water-jet rock drill. This drill incorporates three novel components: a collimator, jet deflectors for cutting clearance, and an unpressurized swivel, which rotates at 1, 000 rpm while passing 20 gpm of an abrasive slurry flowing at 1, 000 ft/s. Drilling occurs through the action of a 10, 000 -psi, 2 O-gpm <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> into which is entrained 72 lb/min of abrasives. The pumps, hoses, and fittings are those commonly used in the water-jet-cleaning industry. Only inexpensive, common sandblasting abrasives are used.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} depths of coal mines and the low permeability of some coal seams, conventional methods of gas drainage in underground mines are facing many problems. To improve gas extraction, a new technique using <b>water</b> <b>jets</b> to <b>drill</b> tree-type boreholes in coal seams is proposed. A self-propelled water-jet drilling nozzle was designed to drill these boreholes. The configuration of the self-propelled nozzle was optimized by conducting drilling experiments and self-propelling force measurements. Experimental {{results show that the}} optimal self-propelled nozzle has a forward orifice axial angle at 25 °, a radial angle at 90 °, a center distance of 1. 5 mm, and backward pointing orifices with an axial angle of 25 °. The self-propelling force generated by the jets of the nozzle with 30 MPa pump pressure can reach 29. 8 N, enough to pull the hose and the nozzle forward without any external forces. The nozzle can drill at speeds up to 41. 5 m/h with pump pressures at 30 MPa. The radial angles of the forward orifices improve the rock breaking performance of the nozzle and, with the correct angle, the rock breaking area of the orifices overlap to produce a connecting hole. The diameter of boreholes drilled by this nozzle can reach 35. 2 mm. The nozzle design can be used as the basis for designing other self-propelled nozzles.

40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> of rock {{is shown}} to be a {{feasible}} method for potential improvement in gaining access to the earth's resources. Drilling rates of up to 280 in. /min in sandstone and 40 in. /min in granite have been achieved. While the addition of polymers to the jet stream is found advantageous the low (15 %) level of improvement and the difficulty in maintaining concentrate negated further development. The application of confining pressure was found to reduce jet performance, but this was found to be a function more of the rock response than of the jet parameters. Field tests of water jets underground indicated the jet system could be modified to cope with this change. Water jets were found to be more effective, for drilling larger holes, where a combined water jet:roller bit system was developed and laboratory and field trials of this are described. As well as determining the controlling parameters affecting jet drilling performance, and proving that rock compressive strength is not one of them, the research examined other methods of improving jet cutting performance. At jet pressures below 10, 000 psi abrasive laden jets were found most advantageous while, for drilling granite, a cavitating flow proved more effective at pressures above 10, 000 psi. A reason for this is postulated. Experiments to develop a standardized cavitation resistance test for rock specimens have also been undertaken...|$|E

Methods for making access holes with light-weight equipment are described. These included augering, <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling,</b> rotary water jet drill-ing, and driving. Pipe or tubing was placed in the access holes and logged at discrete, closely-spaced depth intervals, usually one metre, t o obtain the temperature profiles. Temperature profiles in the Norton Sound area of the Bering Sea show that permafrost is absent except possibly very near shore in areas of rapid shore-line retreat. Subzero temperatures were found in all holes drilled in Kotzebue Sound, and in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. Holes drilled in the Chukchi Sea near Barrow suggest that the shore-line is stable, or nearly so, and that ice-bearing per-mafrost is probably thin or absent a kilometre or more off-shore. In the Beaufort Sea (Elson Lagoon) near Barrow, the shore-line is retreating rapidly (i. e., a few metres per year) whereas. temperature pro-files near Prudhoe Bay suggest a retreat rate of a metre per year or less. The depth to ice-bonded per-mafrost, as determined by temperature measurements, increases with distance off-shore when the soil conditions are constant. However, ice-bonded permafrost may be found near the sea bed in areas of very fine-grained compact soils even when these occur far off-shore. The thermal data has been use...|$|E

According {{to the state of}} art (Marbun et al. 2011), radial drilling is implemented through a special high pressure tube to form the water jet to penetrate and drill several lateral boreholes in one or several layers, which is an effective way to increase the drainage area and improve the oil recovery. Dickinson et al. (1989) first introduced the radial drilling system and predicted the promising expectation of this drilling system. Dickinson et al.

As for all of the researches above, most of them are just focused on the application status or the techniques of the radial drilling system, but almost no research was carried out to probe how to optimize the radial drilling branch length and branch number in terms of reservoir engineering respect, which is quite important for the multi-layer water drive reservoirs.|$|E

40|$|Using water jets for {{orthopedic}} {{procedures that}} require bone drilling can be beneficial {{due to the}} absence of thermal damage and the always sharp cut. Previously, the influence of the water jet diameter and bone architectural properties on the drilling depth have been determined. To develop water jet instruments that can safely drill in orthopedic surgery, the impact of the two remaining primary factors were determined: the jet time (tjet [s]) and pressure (P [MPa]). To this end, 84 holes were drilled in porcine tali and femora with water jets using Ø 0. 4 mm nozzle. tjet was varied between 1, 3 and 5 s and P between 50 and 70 MPa. Drilling depths Lhole (mm), diameters Dhole (mm) and the volume of mineralized bone per unit volume (BV/TV) were determined with microCT scans. A non-linear regression analysis resulted in the predictive equation: Lhole= 0. 22 * tjet(0. 18) * (1. 2 -BV/TV) * (P- 29) (R(2) = 0. 904). The established relation between the machine settings and drilling depth allows surgeons to adjust jet time and pressure for the patient׳s BV/TV to drill holes at a predetermined depth. For developers, the relation allows design decisions to be made that influence the dimensions, flexibility and accuracy of water jet instruments. For a pressure of 50 MPa, the potential hole depth spread indicated by the 95 % confidence interval is < 1. 6 mm for all tested jet times. This maximum variance is smaller than the accuracy required for bone debridement treatments (2 - 4 mm deep), which confirms that <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling</b> can be applied in orthopedic surgery to drill holes in bone with controlled dept...|$|E
40|$|On February 12 th, 2014, a {{sinkhole}} {{occurred at}} the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The collapse happened inside {{part of the building}} known as the Skydome and eight Corvettes on display were lost into the void that opened in the concrete floor. In this region of Kentucky, known as the Pennyroyal sinkhole plain, subsidence and cover collapse sinkholes are commonly found throughout the landscape. This iconic karst region in the United States is also home to Mammoth Cave, the longest cave in the world, and thousands of other caves and karst features. Investigation of the sinkhole collapse began immediately while the Corvettes were extracted from the debris cone inside the void. Techniques used for investigation included <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>drilling,</b> downhole cameras and drone footage, a microgravity surface survey, and mapping of the void and accompanying cave. After exploration of the sinkhole by karst researchers and compilation of the data, the cause of the sinkhole was determined to be a cave roof collapse in a breakout dome. The cave underlying the collapse is about 220 feet (67 m) long and 39 feet (12 m) wide on average with an average depth of 65 - 85 feet (20 - 25 m). The structural integrity of the bedrock (thinly interbedded limestone and chert located at a contact between two major limestone units) is lacking in the area. Talus and breakdown are abundant in the cave in which the sinkhole formed. The progression of the roof failure likely occurred over a long span of time, eventually giving way due to a variety of conditions, including speleogenetic and climatic factors.

On the assumption that rock is homogeneous and isotropic, a numerical model was developed to simulate rock fracture under high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> based on continuum damage mechanics and nonlinear finite element method. The dynamic effect of rock was simulated by the dynamic contact method under high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> The numerical simulation results showed that rock failure occurred within several milliseconds and the evolvement of it was for step under high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> and that the stress propagation in rock rapidly decayed with {{the distance from the}} jet centre. On the whole, the numerical results clearly exhibited the process of rock fracture and the extent of the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> under high pressure <b>water</b> <b>jet.</b> It was important to the application of jet cutting rock theory and the development of <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experiment}} focused on the visualisation and structural analysis of flat continuous high-speed <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> used in descaling process are presented in this paper. The aim of the work was to test {{the applicability of the}} shadowgraph technique, combined with image processing and analysis methods, to visualise the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> structure and analyse its main quantitative parameters. Volume percentage of water and air in the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> structure, size of droplets and water bunches and other parameters were measured on digital images taken at various distances from the nozzle outlet. Knowledge of the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> structure below the nozzle can facilitate an optimal setting of technological conditions of the <b>water</b> <b>jetting</b> with respect to the maximum disintegration effect on treated material. The described methods can also provide important information for development of new nozzles or entire <b>water</b> <b>jetting</b> tools for disintegration of materials...|$|R
40|$|Although bidets {{are widely}} used in Korea, its effects on {{anorectal}} pressures have not been studied in detail {{in terms of the}} water settings used. Twenty healthy volunteers were placed on a toilet equipped with a bidet, and anorectal pressures were measured with a manometry catheter inserted into the rectum and anal canal before and after using the bidet at different water forces (40, 80, 160, 200 mN), temperatures (24 ℃ vs 38 ℃), and <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> widths (narrow vs wide). The pressure at anal high pressure zone decreased from 96. 1 ± 22. 5 to 81. 9 ± 23. 3 mmHg at <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> pressure of 40 mN and 38 ℃ wide <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> (P < 0. 001), from 94. 3 ± 22. 4 to 80. 0 ± 24. 1 mmHg at <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> pressure of 80 mN and 38 ℃ narrow <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> (P < 0. 001), and from 92. 3 ± 22. 4 to 79. 6 ± 24. 7 mmHg at a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> pressure of 80 mN and 38 ℃ wide <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> (P < 0. 001). At other settings, no significant changes were observed. Our results indicate that, in addition to cleansing effect, bidet could be used to reduce anal resting pressure {{in the same manner as}} the traditional warm sitz bath under the conditions of low or medium <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> pressure, a warm water temperature, and a wide type <b>water</b> <b>jet...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Photographs of {{abrasive}} blasted and <b>water</b> <b>jetted</b> surfaces {{taken at}} microscopic levels {{have shown that}} the <b>water</b> <b>jetted</b> surface appears rougher as magnification increases, whereas the abrasive blasted surface appears moother as magnification i creases. The subject paper is a status report of an ongoing Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) study. The study investigates coating performance over <b>water</b> <b>jetted</b> surfaces with several different secondary surface preparation methods. BACKGROUND In recent years, advances in equipment have made <b>water</b> <b>jetting</b> an effective form of surface preparation for use in industry as well a...|$|R
