40|$|In a {{fluidized}} bed {{in which the}} particles vary in size or density segregation can occur. Including horizontal sieve-like baffles in the bed can greatly increase the tendency of powders to segregate. This can make a {{fluidized bed}} particle classification process possible. In this article a feasibility study of such a process is presented. Experiments were performed with a model system. It {{was found that the}} baffles increase the purity of both the ‘flotsam ’ and the ‘jetsam ’ fractions. The capacity of a fluidized bed particle classifier can be estimated using a mechanistic model, based on literature models. With such a model we found that the baffles are most effective in systems that tend to segregate but do actually hardly segregate without baffles. The use of fluidization gas by a fluid bed particle classifier is much smaller than that of a <b>windsifter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Washing {{plants are}} {{commonly}} used by sand and gravel operations to produce clean aggregate; they are effective in removing fines (silt and clay) but use a large volume of water. New regulations controlling the abstraction of water require quarry operators to demonstrate ‘water efficient’ practice {{as part of the}} abstraction license renewal process. The use of waterless technologies for removing fines {{would go a long way}} to satisfying this requirement; air classification is one such technology. This report details the findings of air classification trials carried out to determine the technical feasibility of using a waterless method for producing clean aggregate. This work forms part of the ‘Waterless Fines Removal’ project funded by the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF). Four samples of sand were collected from sand and gravel operations (these will remain anonymous) for laboratory and pilot-scale air classification trials. The laboratory-scale trials were carried out using a Hosokawa Alpine zig-zag air classifier and the pilot-scale trials using a Bradley Pulverizer <b>Windsifter.</b> The proportion of fines removed by air classification from two of the sites was poor, ranging from 12...|$|E
