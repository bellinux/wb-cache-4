40|$|<b>Written</b> <b>corrective</b> {{feedback}} {{has proven}} to be a key tool to improve students writing. Many previous researchers have proven so. Teacher gets to decide their very own <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback. There are many types of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback that can be used in the classroom. They are direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback, indirect, and metalinguistic. The paper presents the effect of using indirect <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback to improve students’ writing accuracy. The paper is intended to find the best <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback strategy in the classroom. The study is conducted to 35 low-proficiency ESL students. The writing pretest and posttest are used to measure students’ writing accuracy. The researcher uses a t-test to analyze the data. The result is satisfying. 35 students have shown statistically significant progress in their writing accuracy. The posttest result has outscored the pretest score. Furthermore, it is also shown that indirect <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback also elicits students’ autonomous learning.

40|$|In the English {{language}} classroom, {{writing is}} a necessary skill for the English {{as a second language}} (ESL) learners but {{it appears to be a}} very difficult skill to master. However, the writing skills could be mastered if teachers give good <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback to the students. This study investigated a teacher’s <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback in responding to students’ English written compositions in a private school in Subang Jaya, Selangor. It examines a teacher’s beliefs and practices towards <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback. The theoretical framework that underlined this study is the ‘noticing hypothesis’ where teacher’s feedback is intended to trigger noticing and it is important in language learning. A teacher participated in this study and 58 Year Four students contributed in this study through their written compositions. This study is primarily a qualitative research involving frequency counts of the types of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback used by the teacher in the students’ compositions and qualitative analysis which is based on the questionnaire on the teacher’s beliefs and practices in giving <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback. The study found that the teacher used direct, metalinguistic and unfocused <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback in her student’s compositions. Based on the teacher’s questionnaire and students’ compositions, it was found that most of the teacher’s beliefs and practices aligned. The mismatches on the teacher’s beliefs and her practices in giving <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback were marginal. The implications of the findings suggested the teacher to take note of her <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback because it is crucial to be noted by language teachers in order to give good <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback in students’ compositions. Thus, effective <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback from the language teachers would help the students’ to master the writing skill...|$|E

Thirty five advanced learners in three groups participated in this study. Structures of written texts were taught in all three classes during fourteen sessions of treatment; and each session, a related topic was given and the learners were asked to write about it. In class A, the learners had to deliver their assignments to the teacher in classroom; then the teacher <b>wrote</b> the <b>corrective</b> notes on their papers and gave their papers back the next session. In class B, students had to write their assignments on their electronic instruments, and after that send written tasks via email to the teacher, and he also sent the corrective comments on their errors through email. In class C, as control group, no corrective feedback was given to learners’ errors in their written tasks. Moreover, in class C, learners were free to deliver their writings whether in class or by email. The obtained results showed both methods to be effective since the scores of both experimental groups were significantly higher than the scores of control group, but electronic feedback was more effective and profitable than traditional type; because scores of the learners in group B (Electronic feedback) were significantly higher than class C (Traditional feedback).

50|$|Despite {{the success}} of the treaty of Ayton, early in 1498, Henry VII was perturbed by Pedro de Ayala's actions in Scottish affairs, so Ferdinand and Isabella sent Fernán Pérez de Ayala to remedy the situation. Fernán was drowned before he reached England. But Ferdinand and Isabella were pleased to hear that the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, who had been {{sponsored}} by James IV, was captured and Pedro de Ayala had managed to negotiate peace between Scotland and England. At the same time, Ayala's colleague, Dr Rodrigo Gonzalez de Puebla, resident ambassador in London, contracted the marriage between Catherine of Aragon and Prince Arthur. Dr Puebla, however, resented Ayala's presence in London and sought his recall. He wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella that Ayala showed no inclination to return to Scotland, and said he had to remind him of their diplomatic purpose;""I declared, and often said to Don Pedro that the embassies which your Highnesses send to {{all parts of the world}} are not only for the purpose which is apparent, but also for your renown, and in order to know what happens there, and to delude France, and bring her into bad reputation, and for other objects, unknown to us."According to Puebla, Ayala's servants fought on the streets of London, and an Englishman was killed. Ayala's Scottish chaplain was arrested for murder and returned to Scotland. Puebla and Ayala were joined in London by the Knight-Commander Sanchez Londoño and the Sub-Prior of Santa Cruz, Fray Johannes de Matienzo, on 18 July 1498. They understood that Ayala stayed in England to recruit his health rather than return to Scotland. They recognised his popularity at the English court and expertise in Scottish matters and asked him to brief Ferdinand and Isabella on the state of Scotland. They also relayed several stories to the discredit of Puebla. The historian Garrett Mattingly, writing in 1940, pointed out that Ferdinand and Isabella were probably sceptical in response to what appears to have been Ayala's effort to tarnish Puebla's reputation. Mattingly <b>wrote</b> as a <b>corrective</b> to a bias to Ayala he found in Gustav Adolf Bergenroth's introduction to the Calendar of State Papers Spain.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of teacher written feedback and students' revision {{on the use of}} cohesive devices in expository compositions written by thirty Thai postgraduate students enrolled in a 16 -week writing course at a Thai university. The teacher <b>written</b> comments, including <b>corrective,</b> advisory and indicative comments, were provided to the students' cause-effect, comparison/contrast and classification essays. The feedback on cohesion in this study dealt with form, content and, most importantly, essay organisation. Each of the essays from this experimental group was provided with a combination of teacher written comments focusing on the improvement of cohesion. The students revised their initial drafts in response to the teacher written feedback provided. Sixty pre-test and post-test essays were written by the students from both the experimental group and the control/intact group, and 180 expository essays and revised drafts were written by the students from the experimental group. All the essays were analysed by Halliday and Hasan's (1976) cohesion analysis model and Hoey's (1991) lexical analysis model. Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the differences in the use of cohesive devices between the pre- and post-test essays and between the initial and revised drafts. The results revealed a significant improvement of cohesion in the writing of the experimental group, particularly referential, conjunctive and lexical cohesive ties. The pedagogical implications regarding the teachability and the positive effects of teacher written feedback and essays revision were derived {{on the basis of the}} research results. The students' revised drafts were examined in terms of the student moves in response to the teacher written comments provided to their initial drafts. The investigation revealed the students' revision patterns: complete, partial and no correspondence to the teacher comments. The findings showed that most of the students who had received the teacher written feedback successfully revised their initial drafts in response to the feedback and their cohesion skills were improved. The student questionnaire and interviews, used as triangulated studies, revealed the participants' positive attitudes towards teacher written feedback, the revision process and the use of cohesion in writing. Based on the findings in this section, the students found teacher feedback helpful for the improvement of their writing skills especially the use of cohesion, although they also expected to receive teacher feedback on grammatical accuracy. The findings also indicated that revision motivated the students to write more confidently in English and contributed to students' awareness and development of cohesion in their writing. Insights gained from the present study are (1) that even though cohesion is a useful linguistic element that contributes to well-connected writing, it may not be adequate as a means of measuring overall writing quality, (2) that teacher feedback should be personalised to cater for each individual student's needs and each problematic writing situation, and (3) that both feedback and revision play a crucial role in raising awareness regarding the use of cohesion in L 2 writing.

However, research on video-based <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback (VWCF) in EFL/ESL writing instructions so far has only revealed its qualitative strengths (Stannard, 2008; Mathisen, 2012) —that is, in terms of students’ responses towards its application, a gap that the current paper intends to address. The present study reported in this paper is a classroom action research (CAR) aiming at increasing the writing accuracy of a group of students of a state university in Bali, Indonesia through the integration of video in the corrective feedback practice. The writing instruction in the study is carried out in a blended learning fashion combining the traditional learning mode with an email-based correspondence between the tutor and the students. The findings seem to indicate that video-taped orally-delivered direct corrective feedback has a relatively small impact on student accuracy improvement percentage. However, the integration of video in the feedback provision appears to have a potential in terms of increasing students’ motivation in their learning of writing. The research results can provide some interesting insight to teachers who want to implement video-based feedback and future research on this type of feedback.

Then, sixty learners in each proficiency level formed two experimental groups and one control group, 20 learners in each group. One experimental group received focused <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback and the other experimental group received unfocused <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback. The statistical analysis indicated that focused group did better than both unfocused and control groups in terms of accurate use of English articles in both proficiency levels. Therefore, these results suggested that unfocused corrective feedback is of limited pedagogical value, whereas focused corrective feedback promoted learners ' grammatical accuracy in L 2 writing more effectively.

40|$|Abstract With {{the higher}} demand of {{accuracy}} on students’ writing in university level, {{the present study}} examines the effect of direct and indirect <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback (WCF) on students’ L 2 writing accuracy. The {{study was conducted in}} a six-week period with 43 Indonesian university student participants majoring IT. The results of the pre- and post-writing tests showed that 1) the writing accuracy improvement of the students receiving direct WCF was statistically significant while the writing accuracy improvement of the students given the indirect WCF treatment was not; 2) the accuracy improvement in the untreatable error rate of the direct WCF group was the most significant compared to all types of error in both WFC student groups. The study concludes that considering the students’ current English proficiency level and learning setting with limited English exposure, <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> feedback, especially the direct one, helps the university students improve their writing accuracy.
