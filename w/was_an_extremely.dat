5|$|Hersh's U.S. and Pakistani {{intelligence}} sources {{stated that the}} U.S. had learned of bin Laden's location through a Pakistani walk-in seeking the $25 million reward, and not through tracking a courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk-in <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> valuable asset, though the sources disputed that the walk-in knew the location of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family. The White House denied Hersh's report.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katrina <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> {{destructive}} Category 5 hurricane {{that affected}} {{the majority of}} the Gulf Coast. Its damaging trek began on August 23, 2005 when it originated as Tropical Depression Twelve near the Bahamas. The next day, the tropical depression strengthened to a tropical storm, and was named Katrina; it proceeded to make landfall on the southern tip of the U.S. state of Florida as a minimal hurricane.|$|E

5|$|By the 1950s, {{with the}} area around Woking by this time heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a hostile takeover bid {{with the aim of}} using the cemetery's land for property development. The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, William Parker Foulke {{discovered}} {{the first known}} American dinosaur, in marl pits {{in the small town}} of Haddonfield, New Jersey. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The creature was named Hadrosaurus foulkii. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> important find: Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found (the first was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer and {{in the autumn of}} 1296, between the death of Bishop William Fraser and the arrival of the new Bishop of St Andrews William de Lamberton, Nicholas was placed in charge of the diocese of St Andrews as Official. Nicholas {{thereafter}} can be found exercising a senior role in Scottish affairs, and by early 1301 he was Chancellor of Scotland. In his late 60s or (more probably) his 70s by this stage, Nicholas <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> old man, yet in 1307 he became Bishop of Dunblane. He held this position until his death in either 1319 or 1320.|$|E

5|$|Nostradamus was {{not only}} a diviner, but a {{professional}} healer. It is known that he wrote at least two books on medical science. One <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> free translation (or rather a paraphrase) of The Protreptic of Galen (Paraphrase de C. GALIEN, sus l'Exhortation de Menodote aux estudes des bonnes Artz, mesmement Medicine), and in his so-called Traité des fardemens (basically a medical cookbook containing, once again, materials borrowed mainly from others), he included a description of the methods he used to treat the plague, including bloodletting, none of which apparently worked. The same book also describes the preparation of cosmetics.|$|E
5|$|Phrynion learnt that Neaira {{was back}} in Athens, and {{attempted}} to take her back from Stephanus. Stephanus resisted, claiming that as Neaira was a free woman he had no right; a claim which Phrynion proceeded to challenge in court, though he was persuaded to settle the case by arbitration instead. The arbitrators decided that Neaira was indeed free, and {{that in addition to}} this she was her own kyria (mistress); this <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> unusual decision in a society where all citizen women, at least, had a kyrios (master). Despite this unusual level of freedom, however, Neaira was compelled to split her time between the two men as they agreed, without any input herself.|$|E
5|$|Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's reign <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> short one; {{only weeks}} after his accession, he was slain on Mann. His killer is {{identified}} by a contemporary source as a knight named Ívarr {{who may have been}} an ally of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's second cousin once removed, Haraldr Guðrøðarson (fl. 1249), who seized the kingship immediately following the killing. Although at first Haraldr was recognised as a legitimate ruler of the kingdom by Henry III, King of England (died 1272), Haraldr was later regarded as a usurper by his Norwegian overlord, Hákon. In 1250, Hákon summoned Haraldr to Norway to answer for his seizure of the kingship, and Haraldr was kept from returning to the Isles.|$|E

5|$|The {{period from}} 1520 to around 1560, {{encompassing}} Garamond's career, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> busy period for typeface creation. Many fonts were cut, {{some such as}} Robert Estienne’s for a single printer’s exclusive use, others sold or traded between them. Confusion about which engravers created which typefaces is natural since many were active over this time, creating typefaces {{not just in the}} Latin alphabet in roman and italic, but also in Greek and Hebrew for scholarly use. These included Garamond himself, Granjon, Guillaume Le Bé, particularly respected for his Hebrew fonts, Pierre Hautin, Antoine Augereau (who may have been Garamond's mentor), Estienne's stepfather Simon de Colines and others. This period saw the creation of a pool of high-quality punches and matrices that would supply the French and European printing industry, to a large extent, for the next two centuries.|$|E
5|$|Andrić was {{appointed}} Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany in late March or early April 1939. This appointment, Hawkesworth writes, shows he was highly regarded by his country's leadership. In 1934, Yugoslavia's King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Peter, and a regency council led by Peter's uncle Paul {{was established to}} rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, pledging support for Germany and Italy. Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andrić's back, {{in his capacity as}} ambassador he was obliged to attend the document's signing in Berlin. Andrić had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers' demands for as long as possible. He was highly critical of the move, and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, pro-Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia's invasion. Given these circumstances, Andrić's position <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult one. Nevertheless, he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45 on 25 November an Ottoman cavalry patrol near Khurbet Hadrah was chased {{off by a}} {{troop of}} 3rd Squadron Auckland Mounted Rifles Regiment. Within an hour, the Ottoman 3rd and 7th Divisions {{launched}} a heavy attack on the squadron, which withdrew to a prearranged line. Just 30minutes later another withdrawal was forced. At about 08:00 infantry units of the 54th (East Anglian) Division at Khurbet Hadrah were ordered back across the river. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> difficult operation as the bridge was now being swept by enemy fire and continuously shelled by artillery. Some individuals succeeded in crossing the bridge; some swam the river and some drowned. Once the infantry were clear, the 3rd Squadron, Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment followed them across the bridge. The 11th (North Auckland) Squadron (Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment) covered them with two Vickers guns at great cost, continuing to hold the bridge until 11:00, when they withdrew.|$|E

5|$|During {{the design}} process, {{it was decided}} that the utmost concern was that the ships could be built quickly and placed into service. The ships were to discard the use of {{broadside}} belt armor below the waterline, the attachment of which <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> long process. It was believed that the higher speed of the class——would make up for the vulnerability to torpedo attack and make the armor unnecessary.The initial designs called for three main battery turrets, each mounting a pair of new 42cm guns, though this was later increased to four twin turrets. However, the work that would have been necessary to design and test the new turret clashed with U-boat construction, which had become the priority of the Navy. Krupp, the firm that had been awarded the contract to conduct the testing, informed the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—the Imperial Navy Office) that design work on the new turret would have to wait. Capelle accepted the news without much objection. Nevertheless, the ships were never built. The RMA filed a report dated 1 February 1918, which stated that capital ship construction had ground to a halt, primarily due to the shifting priorities to the U-boat war.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane David <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> deadly {{hurricane}} {{which caused}} massive devastation {{and loss of}} life in the Dominican Republic in August 1979. A Cape Verde-type hurricane that reached Category5 hurricane status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, David was the fourth named tropical cyclone, second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, traversing through the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and East Coast of the United States during late August and early September. David was the first hurricane to affect the Lesser Antilles since Hurricane Inez in 1966. With winds of 175mph (280km/h), David was the only storm of Category5 intensity to make landfall on the Dominican Republic in the 20th century and the deadliest since the 1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane, San Zenon, killing over 2,000people in its path. The hurricane was the deadliest Dominican tropical cyclone since a hurricane killed over 200 in September of the 1834 season.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Greta <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> large late-season Atlantic {{hurricane}} in the 1956 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from {{a tropical}} depression near Jamaica on October30, the system initially featured non-tropical characteristics as it tracked northward. By November2, the system began producing gale-force winds around the low pressure area; however, winds {{near the center}} of circulation were calm. By November3, the system intensified into a tropical storm and was named Greta. Steadily strengthening, Greta attained hurricane intensity on November4, eventually reaching a peak intensity with 100mph (155km/h) winds. Shortly after, Greta began to gradually weaken as it tracked over cooler waters. The storm eventually became extratropical on November7 over the central Atlantic. Although Greta did not directly impact land as a tropical storm or hurricane, it generated large swells that impacted numerous areas. One person was killed in Puerto Rico and coastal damages from the waves amounted to roughly $3.6million (1956 USD).|$|E

5|$|On September 15, 1955, the Bureau of Public Roads {{approved}} the Interstate Highway System spurs and connections in urban areas. Among these was a loop around the San Francisco Bay, soon numbered I-280 and I-680. The east half (I-680) incorporated {{a number of}} existing legislative routes, including Routes 69, 108, 107, 75, and 74, crossing the Carquinez Strait on the proposed Benicia-Martinez Bridge and ending at I-80 near downtown Vallejo. The first piece of this freeway north of the Carquinez Strait was at the I-80 cloverleaf interchange, built in the late 1950s when I-80 was upgraded through Vallejo. This <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> short roadway, beginning at Lemon Street, crossing under I-80 and Laurel Street, and ending at Reis Avenue and Cedar Street. In about 1960, it was extended east to the old highway (Columbus Parkway) between the cities, and was completed to the new bridge in about 1962, the year the bridge opened.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Kujira, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Amang, <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> {{long-lived}} tropical cyclone that lasted for 16days affected the island nations of Micronesia, Taiwan, and Japan in April2003, {{as well as the}} earliest typhoon in a calendar year to ever make landfall on the latter. Forming from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April9 well removed form any landmasses, Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages, and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis. Strengthening slowed afterwards, though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April14. Intensification continued and late on April15, Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Following peak intensity, Kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength, cresting an additional two times in intensity. On April21, the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan. However, on April24, Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken, and on April24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu. Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April2003.|$|E
5|$|Static Shock <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>extremely</b> popular show, {{granting}} its new renewal for {{a second}} season just a month after its debut. As of December 2000, it was the highest-rated pre-teen—from 2 to 11 years—show among all networks on its timeslot, and the third best on the Kids' WB! lineup. From its debut to July 2003, the show secured the second post among boys aged 6 to 11 years. Ratings increased after Richie's character obtained superhero powers; McDuffie affirmed {{that this is what}} secured the renewal for a new season. Indeed, the show's third season was its most popular and was the second best-rated Saturday morning program among boys aged 6 to 11 years, and tweens and male tweens aged 9 to 14. From February to April 2003, ratings regularly performed over the 4.0 stake among the public aged 9 to 14 years; it even reached the 6.4 mark in May. Static Shocks last season was only surpassed by the children's anime Pokémon, and the show's reruns on Cartoon Network were only surpassed by the adult animated sitcom Family Guy. Static Shock was the only program on Cartoon Network to be among the top 30 most watched kids shows in a week of October 2004. It was also the best rated program of the channel among kids on a week of January 2005, and the best rated show on Cartoon Network's Miguzi block as of March 2005. For the 2004–05 season, it was the 18th most watched Saturday morning children's show of all networks. Static Shock was ultimately cancelled due to the low production of associated merchandising products.|$|E
