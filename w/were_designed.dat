5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> with a reduced draught, which might be {{important}} in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships <b>were</b> <b>designed,</b> but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> by Toshiyuki Itahana. In {{common with}} his typical drawing style for characters, Itahana created Wol to be a heroic fantasy character that both fitted within {{and did not}} conform to earlier Final Fantasy titles. He and other designers created the multiple job outfits to further convey the fantasy setting. After its reveal, some changes {{were made to the}} character's initial costume: due to negative player feedback about the amount of skin shown, the Onion Swordsman outfit was adjusted to be more covering. The game's environments <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> by Takako Miyake, who had previously worked on console Final Fantasy titles. She did not change her working style for Mobius Final Fantasy: all the assets <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> in high definition, and only adjusted slightly when they were brought into the mobile environment. The visual effects were handled by company veteran Shintaro Takai, whose main preoccupation was to make sure the game did not slow down during the flashier visual combat effects due to hardware constraints. The cutscenes were not affected by these issues.|$|E

5|$|The sensors <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> for air {{deployment}} {{by either}} of two means. The first was by parachute, which would hang the devices in trees, where {{they appeared to}} be part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which would drive the spike-shaped device into the ground like a lawn dart, burying all but their antennae, which <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> by Paul Due (1835–1919) and his son, Paul Armin Due (1870–1926). Original stations between Stjørdal and Levanger <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> by Paul Due, {{while those}} from Rinnan to Byafossen, {{as well as}} Hell Station, <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> by Paul Armin Due. The designs are characterized by the transition period between Dragestil and Art Nouveau, with early stations dominated more by the former and later stations more by the latter. Norway went through a nationalistic period during the construction, and Paul Due chose to replace his older buildings' foreign elements with traditional Norwegian elements. Røra and Byafossen were the only stations not custom designed, while Sunnan was designed by Peter Andreas Blix—as it was originally built at Hell in 1881.|$|E

5|$|The two Brummer class cruisers <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> in 1914, {{when the}} {{turbines}} being built by AG Vulcan for the Russian battlecruiser Navarin became available {{owing to the}} state of war between Germany and Russia. The German navy instructed AG Vulcan to divide the turbines in half and design a pair of cruiser-minelayers around the propulsion system. As a result of their need for high speed, they were lightly armed, with only four 15cm guns. And to further aid them in their offensive minelaying role, they <b>were</b> <b>designed</b> to resemble British cruisers to help conceal their identity.|$|E
