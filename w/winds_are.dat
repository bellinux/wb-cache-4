5|$|Directly {{under the}} {{subtropical}} ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> lighter. Many of the Earth's deserts lie near the average latitude of the subtropical ridge, where descent reduces the relative humidity {{of the air}} mass. The strongest <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> in the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warm air from the tropics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Winds</b> <b>are</b> northerly in the {{dry season}} and southerly in the rainy season.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} earlier, prevailing {{and local}} <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> not spread evenly across the earth, {{which means that}} wind speeds also differ by region. In addition, the wind speed also increases with the altitude.|$|E

30|$|Horizontal <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> {{estimated}} from radial winds {{measured from}} the six beam directions. The <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> calculated at the range resolution of 150  m {{and at the}} height sampling of the vertical beam. The vertical shear of horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> then estimated using a two-point symmetric quotient scheme.|$|R

5|$|Air quality {{advisories}} {{were put}} into effect on June 17 as haze and falling ash were visible in Los Angeles County. The Santa Barbara County AIr Pollution Control District released a statement that said, in part, that while <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> dispersing some of the smoke, there are still pockets of poor air quality {{as a result of}} smoky conditions.|$|E
5|$|An {{automatic}} {{traffic monitoring}} and guidance {{system is in}} place along the motorway. It consists of measuring, control and signaling devices, located in zones where driving conditions may vary—at interchanges, near viaducts, bridges, tunnels and in zones where fog and strong <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> known to occur. The system consists of variable traffic signs used to communicate changing driving conditions, possible restrictions and other information to motorway users.|$|E
5|$|Downburst winds {{can produce}} {{numerous}} hazards to landscapes experiencing thunderstorms. Downburst <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> generally very powerful, {{and are often}} mistaken for wind speeds produced by tornadoes, due to the concentrated amount of force exerted by their straight-horizontal characteristic. Downburst winds can be hazardous to unstable, incomplete, or weakly constructed infrastructures and buildings. Agricultural crops, and other plants in nearby environments can be uprooted and damaged. Aircraft engaged in takeoff or landing can crash. Automobiles can be displaced by the force exerted by downburst winds. Downburst <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> usually formed in areas when high pressure air systems of downdrafts begin to sink and displace the air masses below it, due to their higher density. When these downdrafts reach the surface, they spread out and turn into the destructive straight-horizontal winds.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all <b>wind</b> {{turbines}} <b>are</b> of an upwind design, {{meaning the}} rotor {{is in front}} of the nacelle when the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing. Some turbines are of a downwind design, meaning the rotor is behind the nacelle when the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the palace}} are open, unkeyed portals leading to {{all four of}} the first four layers of the plane as well as the Elemental Plane of Air and the Astral Plane. There are four gates nearby leading to each of the four winds, each guarded by a warden archon. The {{guardian}} of the gate to the North <b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> Yonel, the guardian of the gate to the South <b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> Kerkhoutha, the guardian of the gate to the West <b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> Moriel, and the guardian of the gate to the East <b>Wind</b> <b>is</b> Ruhiel.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the strongest}} <b>winds</b> {{reported}} <b>were</b> at Lamap (Malakula Island), where hurricane-force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> recorded between 3 and 5 p.m. that day. Gale force <b>winds</b> <b>were</b> also reported {{for a time}} from Aneityum. It is estimated from the meteorological information available, sustained winds during between 75 and 80 knots.|$|R
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is divided into}} a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> slow, but {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E
5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} {{is also a}} hazard, {{particularly}} when the <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills. The {{average annual}} sunshine totals around 1,600hours. Rainfall {{tends to be}} associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds, and a large proportion of rain falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 35–60inch (900–1500mm). About 10–20days of snowfall is typical. From November to March, mean wind speeds are highest; <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> lightest from June to August. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.|$|E
5000|$|In sailing, the {{apparent}} <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> the actual flow of air acting upon a sail. It <b>is</b> the <b>wind</b> {{as it appears}} to the sailor on a moving vessel. It differs in speed and direction from the true <b>wind</b> that <b>is</b> experienced by a stationary observer.In nautical terminology, these properties of {{the apparent}} <b>wind</b> <b>are</b> normally expressed in knots and degrees.On boats, apparent <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> measured (see [...] "Instruments" [...] below) or [...] "felt on face / skin" [...] if on a dinghy or looking at any telltales or wind indicators on board. True <b>wind</b> needs to <b>be</b> calculated or stop the boat.|$|R
5000|$|Robert Wyatt's song [...] "Blues in Bob Minor" [...] {{from his}} 1997 album Shleep {{includes}} the line, [...] "Genuflecting, bowing deeply/It don't take a weathergirl to see/Where the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> blowing/What the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> bending." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> {{from the}} southwest, and the vessel was off Sheerness before the tide turned. There was, however, no {{occasion}} to anchor, for the <b>wind</b> <b>was</b> {{strong enough to}} take them against the flood.|$|R
5|$|El Hatillo, at {{a higher}} {{altitude}} than the neighboring municipalities of Caracas, has slightly cooler weather than nearby downtown Caracas. The average temperature is between 21 and 24 degrees Celsius (70–75°F). At the highest elevations, the temperature can decrease to 18°C (64°F) and the atmosphere may have constant fog. The mean precipitation is 997.3millimeters a year (39inches); annual values can range from 800 to 1,500millimeters (32in to 59in). The average humidity index is 75%; similar {{to the rest of}} Venezuela, the rainy season is May through November, while all other months are considered the dry season. The <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> north alizé trade winds.|$|E
5|$|In {{general the}} summers are warm-hot with {{rainfall}} erratic but occasionally heavy while in winter {{it is very}} mild with rainfall more or less uniform. There is a gradual transition from summer to winter conditions and vice versa. <b>Winds</b> <b>are</b> frequent and salt-laden being moderate easterlies {{in the summer and}} fresh to strong westerlies in the winter. July is the windiest month, and the winter months are subject to frequent gales and strong winds. The island has 67.8 clear days, annually.|$|E
5|$|In general, <b>winds</b> <b>are</b> strongest {{immediately}} {{under the}} tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>wind</b> {{assistance}} <b>is</b> allowed and, indeed, encouraged. Waiting for {{a suitable}} gust, however, {{is limited to}} one minute. No artificial or man-made <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> to be used.|$|R
50|$|In the winter, the <b>wind</b> {{direction}} <b>is</b> mainly east, {{while in}} the summer, the <b>wind</b> <b>is</b> from the north.|$|R
