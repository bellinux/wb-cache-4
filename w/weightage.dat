5|$|Admission to {{the post}} {{graduate}} programs and fellowship program is done through the Common Admission Test (CAT), which is jointly conducted by the IIMs {{in the month of}} November every year. Applications are shortlisted based on CAT scores, scholastic achievement and work experience. The <b>weightage</b> given for each of these components varies each year. The candidates are called for group discussions and personal interviews, conducted in cities in India in the months of February and March. The final selection is based upon the performance in CAT, scholastic achievement, work experience, performance in group discussion, and personal interview. Admissions to the IPMX program are done based on GMAT score, work profile and personal interview. Admission to the PGPM-WE(WMP) program are done based on GMAT score or a competitive written examination conducted by IIM Lucknow. The short listed candidates based on GMAT or the written examination go through Writing Ability Test and Personal Interview (WAT & PI) to get final selection.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{relatively}} low passenger demand, headways of suburban bus route are usually longer {{than those of}} urban bus route. Actually it is also difficult to balance the benefits between passengers and operators, subject to the service standards from the government. Hence the headway of a suburban bus route is usually determined on the empirical experience of transport planners. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes an optimization model for designing the headways of suburban bus routes by minimizing the operating and user costs. The user costs take into account both the waiting time cost and the crowding cost. The feasibility {{and validity of the}} proposed model are shown by applying it to the Route 206 in Jiangning district, Nanjing city of China. <b>Weightages</b> of passengers’ cost and operating cost are further discussed, considering different passenger flows.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{information}} theoretic approach to obtain compact and discriminative dictionary of visual data. This approach squeezes discriminative information from dictionary for efficient representation using information bottleneck. The dictionary is optimized {{from the initial}} sparse dictionary which is learned from action data. In this, a constraint information optimization problem is formulated in which mutual information between initial and optimized dictionary is minimized while maximizing mutual information between optimized dictionary and class labels. We use an effective similarity measure, Jensen-Shannon divergence with adaptive <b>weightages,</b> for class distributions of each dictionary atom. These adaptive <b>weightages</b> are obtained based on the usage of dictionary atom among different classes. The resultant dictionary becomes discriminative and compact, while retaining maximum information with fewer atoms. Using simple reconstruction error, we test computational efficiency of the proposed method without compromising classification accuracy on popular benchmark datasets. It is further demonstrated how efficiently discriminative information is retained by comparing the classification performance of the dictionary {{before and after the}} removal of redundant dictionary atoms...|$|R
