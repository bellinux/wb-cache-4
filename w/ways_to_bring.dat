Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature, finding <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> chemistry to the world, and publishing works.|$|E

25|$|J.T. and Colleen meet in 2001 {{but they}} do not become {{involved}} until 2002 as he catches her doing drugs. He plans to use this information to hurt his nemesis and her uncle Billy Abbott (then played by David Tom), but changes his mind when she cries. They start up a friendship and Colleen develops a crush on him. She romantically pursues him by finding <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> them closer such as helping him study and getting tickets to see a concert. At first, J.T. only likes her as a kid sister. That slowly changes as he develops feelings for her. Colleen's family disapproves of their relationship despite J.T.'s insistence that they are only friends. John Abbott (Jerry Douglas) and Billy warn him to stay away from her. Her mother, Traci (Beth Maitland), decides to take her home to New York as a way of separating them. To keep from being separated from J.T., Colleen runs away and stays with J.T.'s friends, Raul Guittierez (David Lago) and Brittany Hodges (Lauren Woodland). This results in her being placed in juvenile detention while J.T. is brought up on charges. Traci offered to drop the charges against him if he convinced her daughter to come back to New York with her. He complies but stops her from leaving. Colleen's father, Brad Carlton (Don Diamont), convinces Traci to allow their daughter to stay with him and his wife and her sister Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). Despite staying in Genoa City, she is not allowed to see J.T. They begin secretly spending time with each other in the Abbott family playhouse.|$|E

Upon hearing the writers' pitch of the episode, series creator Loren Bouchard found its plot to be [...] "such an immediately appealing story" [...] and [...] "a great way to have Louise peek over {{the other side of}} adolescence and look into the abyss." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bouchard cited [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as one of his favorite episodes of the series and revealed his liking of [...] "episodes where Louise is a little vulnerable...you don't want her to be as invulnerable as she pretends to be. If you try to keep the show grounded, then you periodically have to say, she's a nine-year-old girl." [...] He added that while the character has [...] "an adult sensibility about a lot of stuff," [...] he and the writing staff try to [...] "look for <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her back down to earth," [...] citing the episode's depiction of Louise [...] "fighting against growing up," [...] with Tina acting as [...] "her strange ambassador into that world...in some ways, you couldn't ask for a better guide." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ron & Tammy: Part Two", {{sometimes}} informally {{referred to}} as [...] "Ron and Tammy II", was written by Parks consulting producer Emily Kapnek and directed by Tucker Gates, who has previously directed episodes of The Office, another comedy series created by Parks co-creator Greg Daniels. Like all of the first six third season episodes, it was written and filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule needed to accommodate Amy Poehler's pregnancy. However, although finished early in anticipation of a September 2010 release date, Parks was ultimately placed on hiatus until early 2011, many months after production on [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two" [...] was finished. The episode is considered a sequel to the second season episode [...] "Ron and Tammy", which introduced the character of Ron Swanson's ex-wife, Tammy, and their unhealthy relationship with each other. Megan Mullally, the real-life wife of actor Nick Offerman, reprises her role as Tammy.

500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin {{comes across as a}} typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal of}} range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that he reminds me of Brother Justin".|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} Craig and Stanislavski began in 1908 when the {{eccentric}} American dancer Isadora Duncan, {{who had a}} daughter with Craig, introduced the two to each other. Craig, an English theatre practitioner, had garnered interest for the symbolist and simplistic designs he brought to plays like Henrik Ibsen’s The Vikings at Helgeland. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum Constantin Stanislavski was creating a world of theatre based upon realism, the internal complexities of the mind, and the rise of psychology. As Benedetti stated, “Stanislavski hoped to use the production to prove that his recently developed 'system' for creating internally justified, realistic acting could meet the formal demands of a classic play”. After their meeting Stanislavski decided to invite Craig to help produce Hamlet for the 1910 season at the Moscow Art Theatre. One early setback of their attempt was that Stanislavski contracted a serious case of typhoid fever. This caused him take a leave of absence and delay the opening night.

Despite hostile reviews from the Russian press, the production attracted enthusiastic and unprecedented worldwide attention for the theatre, with reviews in Britain's The Times and in the French press that praised its unqualified success. The production placed the Moscow Art Theatre [...] "on the cultural map for Western Europe", and it came to be regarded as a seminal event that influenced the subsequent history of production style in the theatre and revolutionised the staging of Shakespeare's plays in the 20th century.
