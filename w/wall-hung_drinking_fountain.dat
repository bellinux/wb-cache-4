40|$|<b>Drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> have a {{rich history}} as pieces of urban {{infrastructure}} in the United States. Installed in prominent public squares to reduce disease, help the poor, and promote a temperance agenda, early American <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> often fulfilled dual roles as public art and functional public good. But today's <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains,</b> when installed at all, are purely utilitarian: undesigned {{in terms of}} both form and urban placement. Shoved between bathrooms and trashcans and usually broken, <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> have fallen on hard times in the public realm. Many Americans express skepticism of public water sources, reflecting underlying attitudes about distrust of government and public infrastructure. There are compelling reasons to rethink our relationship with <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains.</b> Today, the United States confronts a new set of challenges: neglected urban spaces, lifestyle-related disease, privatization of public goods, socio-economic inequality, and plastic pollution. <b>Drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> may be uniquely suited to help confront these problems by cutting down on bottle waste, providing accessible water for homeless populations, reducing sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, facilitating exercise, and adding interest and beauty to public spaces - but they will only be able to achieve these goals through thoughtful design and maintenance. In surveys, people were more likely to drinking from outdoor <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> if they believed that they were clean, safe, and beautiful; the importance of appeal in decision-making has been understood by corporations like Coca-Cola for decades, but has been little-considered in promoting public water. Further, <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains,</b> seemingly insignificant urban elements, are key indicators of cultural attitudes about the public good: do we care only for ourselves and our families, or do we pool our resources and work together to bring benefits to the entire community? Addressing the problems in current American <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> and <b>drinking</b> <b>fountain</b> perceptions could elevate them to address some of today's most pressing problems. by Josselyn Ivanov.

50|$|A <b>drinking</b> <b>{{fountain}},</b> {{also called}} a water fountain or bubbler, is a fountain {{designed to provide}} drinking water. It consists of a basin with either continuously running water or a tap. The drinker bends down to the stream of water and swallows water directly from the stream. Modern indoor <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> may incorporate filters to remove impurities from the water and chillers to lower its temperature. <b>Drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> are usually found in public places, like schools, rest areas, libraries, and grocery stores. Many jurisdictions require <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> to be wheelchair accessible (by sticking out horizontally from the wall), and to include an additional unit of a lower height for children and short adults. The design that this replaced often had one spout atop a refrigeration unit.|$|R

50|$|In 1859, The Metropolitan <b>Drinking</b> <b>Fountain</b> and Cattle Trough Association was {{established}} to promote the provision of drinking water for people and animals in the United Kingdom and overseas. More recently, in 2010, the FindaFountain campaign was launched in the UK {{to encourage people to}} use <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> instead of environmentally damaging bottled water.

50|$|In recent studies, it {{has been}} found that some <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> have been {{contaminated}} with pathogens such as bacteria. In one study, a virus commonly known to cause diarrhea in young children known as the rotavirus has been found on <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> in child day care facilities. Due to cases in the past where children have fallen ill due to coliform bacteria poisoning, many governments have placed strict regulations on <b>drinking</b> <b>fountain</b> designs. The vertical spout design is now illegal in most US jurisdictions. Some governments even require water spouts to be as long as four inches to meet health standards. It is also recommended for young children to allow <b>drinking</b> <b>fountains</b> to run before drinking, as the water may also be contaminated with lead. This is especially common in older buildings with obsolete plumbing.|$|R
