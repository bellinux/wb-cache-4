Police entry on to property outside of statutory powers may be lawful and reasonable where an implied license exists.

2500|$|Actor Leonardo DiCaprio is {{planning}} {{to make a new}} movie with Warner Bros., citing The Twilight Zone as his favorite TV series. Unlike the first film, which was an anthology feature, it will be a big-budget, SFX-laden continuous story possibly based on classic episodes of the series such as [...] "The Eye of the Beholder", [...] "To Serve Man", or any of the 92 scripts written by Rod Serling, to which Warner Bros. owns the rights. One plot leaked from the script tells about a pilot who time-travels 96 years into the future. Cloverfield director Matt Reeves was signed in 2011 to direct the movie, but left in 2012 to direct Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. On August 16, 2013, Joseph Kosinski was announced to direct. The studio hired Aron Eli Coleite to pen the screenplay for the film and <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> anthology but use various elements from the Twilight Zone universe.

Instead of filming in Pasadena, California (the original filming location {{and stand in}} for Haddonfield) due to high-rising costs, filming took place in Salt Lake City, Utah. As filming was taking place in March, during springtime, the producers were forced to import leaves and big squash, which they would use to create pumpkins by painting them orange, which was also done during the filming of the original Halloween. [...] "One of the obvious challenges in making a part four of anything is to interest a contemporary audience in old characters and themes," [...] said director Dwight H. Little. [...] "What I'm {{trying to do is}} capture the mood of the original Halloween and yet take a lot of new chances. What we're attempting to do is walk a fine line between horror and mystery. Halloween 4 <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ax-in-the-forehead kind of movie." [...] Paul Freeman agreed. [...] "This film does contain some humorous moments, but it's not of the spoof or send-up variety. It's humor that rises out of the film's situations and quickly turns back into terror." ...|$|E

In his eight minute speech, Sandoval Díaz stated that the attack would not go unpunished. [...] "They <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> extra number in our statistics," [...] he said. He also stated that the assassins were going to [...] "pay" [...] for what they did, and clarified {{that it was not}} a cry for war, but rather a cry for peace and justice. He also asked all police corporations to continue fighting organized crime. Solorio Aréchiga read the names of all the officers killed, but had to stop momentarily to sob. For each of the names, the policemen repeated the same process as before, yelling [...] "present" [...] for each of them. After that, the police band did a taps call. Once it concluded, the audience clapped for one minute. The coffins were wrapped in the Flags of Jalisco. In front of each coffin was a flower arrangement, the banner of the Fuerza Única branch, and a framed photograph of the victim. Each of the victims' family members were given an official banner of the state of Jalisco. A year later, on April 6, 2016, the Government of Jalisco hosted another ceremony near the ambush site with the victims' families. Fuerza Única banners were placed across the mountainous road where the attack occurred.|$|E
