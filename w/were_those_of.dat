5|$|A Miss Williams {{from nearby}} Borley Lodge said {{she saw the}} figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, {{according}} to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a pig.|$|E
5|$|After a {{full day}} of pursuit, the leading French ships made an attempt to cut off , {{trailing}} in the British rear. Cornwallis dropped back to support Mars, while Captain Robert Stopford of HMS Phaeton began making signals implying a British fleet was in sight. When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a British fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a convoy of British merchantmen.|$|E
5|$|Bigger {{guns were}} developed, {{and in the}} 15thcentury became an {{alternative}} to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets– the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages {{before the advent of}} gunpowder– <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> a greater range and power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made ever bigger, although this hampered their ability to reach remote castles. By the 1450s guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mehmed II at the Fall of Constantinople.|$|E

But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E
5|$|Fielding first {{produced}} a play in February 1728. Although his first production, Love in Several Masques, {{lasted only a}} few nights, it {{was the start of}} his career in theatre. On 16 March 1728, Fielding enrolled at the University of Leyden, but he did not abandon the theatre. His early plays <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> an amateur hobby, but he later returned to London to earn a living. Arthur Murphy, in his 1762 biographical introduction to Fielding's works, believed that Fielding returned to London and treated the theatre as a career because his father stopped an allowance of 200 pounds a year.|$|E

The {{army of the}} Lower Rhine was {{stationed}} in summer quarters {{on the border of}} the Ubii.

5|$|The {{campaign}} was not uniform in approach; British and French forces were {{limited by the}} dictates of the wider Mediterranean and global conflict, and consequently ship numbers fluctuated.

The campaign between the two officers reached a climax at the Battle of Lissa in March 1811, when Dubourdieu was killed and his squadron defeated by Hoste in a celebrated action.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} role {{of copper}} has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually {{the shape and}} look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until {{the time of the}} Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined <b>were</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.|$|E
