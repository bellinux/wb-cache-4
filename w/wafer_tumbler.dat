50|$|Emil Christoph {{developed}} a <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock in 1913 which used a double-bitted key. His patent {{was assigned to}} King Lock of Chicago, a new lock manufacturer. By 1915 Briggs & Stratton Corporation was using King <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks in their ignition switches. In 1919, Briggs & Stratton applied for a switch patent using a <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock of their own design, which used a double-bitted key. Five years later, Edward N. Jacobi of Briggs & Stratton filed for a patent for a five-wafer, single-bitted <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock. The first recorded use of this lock was for an automobile, the 1924 Hupp Eight.|$|E
50|$|By 1878, Yale Lock had {{purchased}} Shepardson's company, The United States Lock Company, {{as well as}} Felter's American Lock Manufacturing Company. For the next 35 years, production of <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks languished in the U. S. And while Felter and Shepardson had designed their <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks {{for a variety of}} applications such as drawer and desk locks as well as padlocks and door locks, the <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks made during this era were mainly used for doors in mortise locks and night-latches.|$|E
50|$|Majority of <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks can {{be opened}} {{with a set of}} jigglers or try-out keys.|$|E
5000|$|The {{more modern}} modular locking mechanisms, however, do not {{directly}} employ the tumblers {{to lock the}} shackle. Instead, they have a plug within the [...] "cylinder" [...] that, with the correct key, turns and allows a mechanism, {{referred to as a}} [...] "locking dog" [...] (such as the ball bearings found in American Lock Company padlocks) to retract from notches cut into the shackle. Padlocks with modular locking mechanisms can often be taken apart to change the tumblers or to service the lock. Modular locking mechanism cylinders frequently employ pin, <b>wafer,</b> and disc <b>tumblers.</b> Padlocks with modular mechanisms are usually automatic, or self-locking (that is, the key is not required to lock the padlock) ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock {{is similar}} to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin {{consists}} of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock {{is a type}} of lock {{that uses}} a set of flat wafers to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. This type of lock is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin tumbler lock, where each pin {{consists}} of two or more pieces, each wafer in the lock is a single piece. The <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock {{configurations}} {{vary with}} manufacturer. The most common is the single-bitted, five-wafer configuration most commonly found on desk drawers, cabinets, key switches, lockers, cash boxes and electrical panels.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks use a {{stack of}} closely spaced wafers {{designed}} to fit a specific contour of a double-sided key {{and work on the}} principle of a carpenter's contour gauge.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks can use single-bitted or double-bitted keys. Though wafer {{arrangements}} {{within the}} plug may vary, such as automotive locks, where the wafers {{are arranged in}} opposed sets, requiring a double-bitted key, the operating principle remains the same.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock in the United States is the patent in 1868 by Philo Felter. Manufactured in Cazenovia, New York, it used a flat double-bitted key. Felter's lock was patented only three years after Linus Yale, Jr. received a patent for his revolutionary pin tumbler mortise lock, {{considered to be the}} first pin tumbler lock of the modern era. That lock featured a flat steel key, referred to as a [...] "feather key" [...] because of the marked contrast with the heavy bit keys of the day. Just two years later, Hiram S. Shepardson produced a different type of <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock, which used a single-bitted flat steel key, similar to Yale's feather key.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> locks {{with low}} {{tolerances}} can be {{opened with a}} set of jigglers or try-out keys (see picture on right). These sets of keys are designed with the most common patterns of key available. The key is inserted into the lock like a normal key, and a turning force is applied whilst the key is rocked back and forth until the lock opens.|$|E
50|$|Disc tumbler locks are {{composed}} of slotted rotating detainer discs. A specially cut key rotates these discs like the tumblers of a safe to align the slots, allowing the sidebar to drop into the slots, thus opening the lock. Unlike a <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock or a pin tumbler lock, this mechanism does not use springs. Because they do not contain springs, they are better suited for areas with harsh conditions and are often used at outdoor locations like railroad and public utility installations.|$|E
50|$|In a {{cylindrical}} <b>wafer</b> <b>tumbler</b> lock, {{a series}} of flat wafers holds a cylindrical plug in place. The wafers are fitted into vertical slots in the plug, and are spring-loaded, causing them to protrude into diametrically opposed wide grooves in the outer casing of the lock. As long {{as any of the}} wafers protrude into one of the wide grooves, rotation of the plug is blocked, as would be the case if there was no key, or if an improperly bitted key were inserted.|$|E
