25|$|Dual zone {{climate control}} was a {{standard}} feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer {{integrated into the}} instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on <b>without</b> <b>driver</b> input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.|$|E
2500|$|The 1948 Citroen 2CV was {{launched}} in France with a manual headlamp leveling system, controlled by the driver with a knob through a mechanical rod linkage. This allowed the driver to adjust the vertical aim of the headlamps {{to compensate for the}} passenger and cargo load in the vehicle. In 1954, Cibié introduced an automatic headlamp leveling system linked to the vehicle's suspension system to keep the headlamps correctly aimed regardless of vehicle load, <b>without</b> <b>driver</b> intervention. The first vehicle to be so equipped was the Panhard Dyna Z. Beginning in the 1970s, Germany and some other European countries began requiring remote-control headlamp leveling systems that permit the driver to lower the lamps' aim by means of a dashboard control lever or knob if the rear of the vehicle is weighted down with passengers or cargo, which would tend to raise the lamps' aim angle and create glare. Such systems typically use stepper motors at the headlamp and a rotary switch on the dash marked [...] "0", [...] "1", [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] for different beam heights, [...] "0" [...] being the [...] "normal" [...] (and highest) position for when the car is lightly loaded.|$|E

Traffic is estimated at 30,000 trucks per year, or 4% of long-distance traffic in France.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle's 220-kW {{electric}} motor {{is powered by}} a Lithium-titanate battery that can recharged in 5-10 minutes at a bus stop via overhead terminals connected to a charging station while stopped at a bus stop, <b>without</b> <b>driver</b> involvement. Charging, which would normally take place during a brief layover typically provides charge for a further 26 mile km of operation. , Proterra will grant royalty-free access to the patents covering their overhead charging system.|$|E
50|$|In 1933, Grand Prix racing was {{dominated}} by French and Italian marques Bugatti, Alfa Romeo and Maserati.

50|$|Units do {{not fight}} to the end. Critical damage causes humans and apemen to collapse, and {{vehicles}} and buildings to eject their occupants and catch fire. They can be saved if they are healed or repaired before they bleed out or explode, respectively. Units give lower priority to incapacitated targets, and the player's units will not attack them unless ordered to. Vehicles <b>without</b> <b>drivers</b> belong to no one, so hijacking is easy and even desirable.|$|R
50|$|The movie General {{not only}} flies and makes {{controlled}} landings, but also drifts {{with the aid}} of professional drifter Rhys Millen. During jump scenes, some stunt cars were propelled under their own power by stunt drivers; others had their engines and transmissions removed. The engineless Chargers were then launched <b>without</b> <b>drivers</b> by a gas-driven catapult similar in principle to those used on aircraft carriers. Approximately 24 1968 to 1970 Chargers were used in the film.|$|R
