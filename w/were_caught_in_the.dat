5|$|In the Southern Hemisphere, Japan permits annual takes of 10 fin whales {{under its}} Antarctic Special Permit whaling {{program for the}} 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons. The {{proposal}} for 2007–2008 and the subsequent 12 seasons allows taking 50 per year. While 10 fin whales <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2005–06 season and three in the 2006–07 season, none {{was caught in the}} 2007–2008 season. A single fin whale was caught in both the 2008–09 and 2009–10 seasons, two were taken in the 2010–11 season, and one was taken in the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1779 Spain {{signed the}} Treaty of Aranjuez with France, setting terms for a joint {{military}} alliance against Britain. Despite the Treaty Spain delayed the formal {{declaration of war}} until June, to give time for better co-ordination of its battle fleet. In the interim Levant engaged and defeated a Spanish privateer whose crew <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act of boarding a British merchant ship. A brief exchange of cannon fire holed the Spanish vessel below the waterline, sinking her; Levant rescued the majority of her crew and transported them to prison in Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans were {{apparently}} {{unaware of the}} 1st Battalion withdrawal, because the next morning, July 25, two North Korean battalions in a double envelopment came in behind the positions 1st Battalion held the night before, but in front of Major Gordon E. Murch's 2nd Battalion. There the North Koreans <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open by the combined fire of American tanks, artillery, and mortar, and the 2nd Battalion's automatic and small arms fire. The North Koreans suffered large numbers of casualties in this attack. Surviving remnants of the two North Koreans battalions withdrew in confusion. The 2nd Battalion took about 30 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|The {{strongest and}} most notorious {{tropical}} {{system of the}} season was the second tropical cyclone, which peaked as a Category3 hurricane. The storm devastated southwestern Louisiana in early August, especially Cameron Parish, leaving 34fatalities and approximately $5million (1918USD) in damage. In late August, the season's third tropical storm damaged portions of coastal North Carolina, causing up to $15,000 in damage. Although the fifth tropical storm or its extratropical remnants caused only minor impacts on land in Bermuda and Atlantic Canada, 21people drowned after two ships <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the bed to grow cotton.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the warring}} parties were {{responsible}} for widespread violations {{of the laws of}} war, as civilians <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing crossfire. Insurgents reportedly deployed militants and established strongholds in heavily populated neighborhoods, launched mortar rounds from residential areas, and targeted public and private individuals for assassination and violence. TFG forces alleged to have failed to efficaciously warn civilians in combat zones, impeded relief efforts, plundered property, in some instances engaged in murder and violence, and mistreated detainees during mass arrests. According to HRW, the implicated TFG forces included military, police and intelligence personnel, as well as the private guards of senior TFG officials. Victims were often unable to identify TFG personnel, and confused militiamen aligned with TFG officials with TFG police officers and other state security personnel.|$|E
5|$|Both ships <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harbour {{during the}} Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} seaworthy. They {{were unable to}} prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by the Japanese, and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen {{was hit by a}} torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled into the mud, and continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved across to Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, while Tchaikovsky {{was still}} at the School of Jurisprudence and Anton Rubinstein lobbied aristocrats to form the RMS, critic Vladimir Stasov and an 18-year-old pianist, Mily Balakirev, met and agreed upon a {{nationalist}} agenda for Russian music, one that would take the operas of Mikhail Glinka as a model and incorporate elements from folk music, reject traditional Western practices and use exotic harmonic devices such as the whole tone and octatonic scales. They saw Western-style conservatories as unnecessary and antipathetic to fostering native talent. Eventually, Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin {{became known as the}} moguchaya kuchka, translated into English as the Mighty Handful or The Five. Rubinstein criticized their emphasis on amateur efforts in musical composition; Balakirev and later Mussorgsky attacked Rubinstein for his musical conservatism and his belief in professional music training. Tchaikovsky and his fellow conservatory students <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle.|$|E

5|$|Non-human {{primates}} (NHPs) {{are used}} in toxicology tests, studies of AIDS and hepatitis, studies of neurology, behavior and cognition, reproduction, genetics, and xenotransplantation. They {{are caught in the}} wild or purpose-bred. In the United States and China, most primates are domestically purpose-bred, whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose-bred. The European Commission reported that in 2011, 6,012 monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 71,188 monkeys in U.S. laboratories in 2016. 23,465 monkeys were imported into the U.S. in 2014 including 929 who <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild. Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques; but marmosets, spider monkeys, and squirrel monkeys are also used, and baboons and chimpanzees {{are used in}} the US. As of 2015, there are approximately 730 chimpanzees in U.S. laboratories.|$|E
5|$|The Danish sloop Jordenxiold {{was intercepted}} off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she {{completed}} a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers. The incident {{attracted the attention}} of the Danish government, which commissioned the Santa Cruz (a 16-gun brigantine commanded by Michael Klariman) to monitor the areas off Vieques and Culebra. On September 8–9 a hurricane, Nuestra Señora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. Cofresí and his crew <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola. According to historian Enrique Ramírez Brau, an expedition weeks later by Fajardo commander Ramón Aboy to search Vieques, Culebra and the Windward Islands for pirates was actually after Cofresí. The operation used the schooner Aurora (owned by Nicolás Márquez) and Flor de Mayo, owned by José María Marujo. After weeks of searching, the team failed to locate anything of interest.|$|E
5|$|The work {{performed}} by breaker boys was hazardous. Breaker boys {{were forced to}} work without gloves {{so that they could}} better handle the slick coal. The slate, however, was sharp, and breaker boys would often leave work with their fingers cut and bleeding. Breaker boys sometimes also had their fingers amputated by the rapidly moving conveyor belts. Others lost feet, hands, arms, and legs as they moved among the machinery and became caught under conveyor belts or in gears. Many were crushed to death, their bodies retrieved from the gears of the machinery by supervisors only {{at the end of the}} working day. Others <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rush of coal, and crushed to death or smothered. Dry coal would kick up so much dust that breaker boys sometimes wore lamps on their heads to see, and asthma and black lung disease were common. Coal was often washed to remove impurities, which created sulfuric acid. The acid burned the hands of the breaker boys.|$|E

5|$|While a {{tropical}} system, Helene never approached land. Three ships <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer bands of Helene; the strongest of which reported 56mph (91km/h) sustained winds early on September 23 {{in the north}} Atlantic. Though it remained {{far away from the}} island, the hurricane produced rough waves in Bermuda. As a weakened extratropical system, strong wind gusts were reported in Ireland and northern Scotland. The strongest reported wind gust in Ireland was at the Valentia Observatory, where 56mph (91km/h) gusts were reported. In Scotland, the strongest gust was on South Uist Island in the Outer Hebrides, where 74mph (118km/h) gusts were reported. No damage or fatalities were reported as a result of Helene.|$|E
5|$|The city of Constance and its bishop <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle {{between these}} two blocks: they held {{possessions}} in Swabia, but the city also still exercised the high justice over the Thurgau, where the Swiss had assumed the low justice since the annexation in 1460. The foundation of the Swabian League prompted the Swiss city states of Zürich and Bern to propose accepting Constance into the Swiss Confederacy. The negotiations failed, though, due to the opposition of the founding cantons of the Confederacy and Uri in particular. The split jurisdiction over the Thurgau {{was the cause of}} many quarrels between the city and the Confederacy. In 1495, one such disagreement was answered by a punitive expedition of soldiers of Uri and the city had to pay the sum of 3,000 guilders to make them retreat and cease their plundering. (The Thurgau was a condominium of the Swiss Confederacy, and Uri was one of the cantons involved in its administration.) Finally, Constance joined the Swabian League as a full member on November 3, 1498. Although this did not yet definitively define the position of the cityduring the Reformation, it would be allied again with Zürich and Bern, and only after the defeat of the Schmalkaldic League in 1548 its close connections to the Eidgenossenschaft would be finally severedit was another factor contributing to the growing estrangement between the Swiss and the Swabians.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight for}} Lang Vei, though short in duration, was a costly {{endeavor}} for both sides. In {{their efforts to}} hold the camp, the combined Montagnard and South Vietnamese CIDG soldiers suffered 309 killed, 64 wounded, and 122 captured. Of the original 24 Americans {{who took part in}} the battle, seven were killed in action, 11 sustained injuries, and three were captured. Nearly all of the camp’s weaponry and equipment were either destroyed or captured by enemy forces. In contrast, for North Vietnam, the battle for Lang Vei marked the first successful use of armor in the war. In terms of human casualties, the North Vietnamese claimed to have lost 90 soldiers killed in action, and 220 wounded. On the evening of February 7, though the fight was over for the military forces, the ordeal continued for the civilians who <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fighting. An estimated 6,000 survivors from the old Lang Vei Camp that included South Vietnamese soldiers and their families, Montagnard tribesmen and the Laotians, followed the Americans and descended on the Khe Sanh Combat Base.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of factory ships with stern slipways in 1925 substantially {{increased the number}} of whales taken per year. In 1937–38 alone, over 29,000 fin whales were taken. From 1953–54 to 1961–62, the catch averaged over 30,000 per year. By 1962–63, sei whale catches began to increase as fin whales became scarce. By 1975–76, fewer than 1,000 fin whales were being caught each year. In the North Pacific, over 74,000 fin whales were caught between 1910 and 1975. Between 1910 and 1989, over 55,000 <b>were</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Atlantic. Coastal groups in northeast Asian waters, along with many other baleen species, were likely driven into serious perils or functional extinctions by industrial catches by Japan covering wide ranges of China and Korean EEZ within very short period in 20th century. Migrations of the species into Japanese EEZ and in East China Sea were likely to be exterminated relatively earlier, as the last catch records on Amami Oshima was between the 1910s and 1930s. After the cease of exploiting Asian stocks, Japan kept mass commercial and illegal hunts until 1975. Several thousand individuals were hunted from various stations mainly along coasts of Hokkaido, Sanriku, and the Gotō Islands.|$|E
