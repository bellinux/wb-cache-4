Barley meal gruel is known as sawiq in the Arab world.

Barley soup is traditionally eaten during Ramadan in Saudi Arabia. Cholent or hamin (in Hebrew) is a traditional Jewish stew often eaten on Sabbath, in a variety of recipes by both Mizrachi and Ashkenazi Jews, with barley cited throughout the Hebrew Bible in multiple references. In Eastern and Central Europe, barley is also used in soups and stews such as ričet. In Africa, where it is a traditional food plant, it has the potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{appropriate}} level of replacement of fish meal (FM) with alternative plant sources in the feed fed to Oreochromis niloticus to evaluate the growth performance. Three isoproteinious (40 % crude protein) diets were prepared from different ingredients viz., fish meal, corn gluten <b>meal,</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>meal,</b> and bagasse kenna meal. O. niloticus showed a maximum increase in weight as 9. 70, 11. 09, 8. 53 and 8. 32 g during the 2 nd, 2 nd, 3 rd and 2 nd fortnight with feeding treatment A, B, C and D, respectively. The growth performance of the fish in terms of weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio {{were found to be}} significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in the fish fed with 20 % replacement of fishmeal in diet B. The worst growth performance was observed in fish fed with commercial diet, designated as diet D. It was concluded that the fish meal can be replaced up to 20 percent with other plant protein sources without any negative impact on fish health. The replacement of fish meal with local plant sources (corn gluten <b>meal,</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>meal,</b> soybean meal and bagasse kenna mix) will not only be beneficial to achieve better growth performance in O. niloticus, it will be a value addition as well...|$|R

40|$|The {{degradation}} of endogenous wheat grain fructans, oligosaccharides with possible health-promoting potential, during <b>wheat</b> whole <b>meal</b> bread making was investigated, and several strategies {{to prevent their}} degradation were evaluated. Up to 78. 4 ± 5. 2 % of the fructans initially present in <b>wheat</b> whole <b>meal</b> were degraded during bread making {{by the action of}} yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) invertase. The addition of sucrose to dough delayed fructan degradation but had no effect on final fructan concentrations. However, yeast growth conditions and yeast genotype did have a clear impact. A 3 -fold reduction of fructan degradation could be achieved when the commercial bread yeast strain was replaced by yeast strains with lower sucrose degradation activity. Finally, fructan degradation during bread making could be prevented completely by the use of a yeast strain lacking invertase. These results show that the nutritional profile of bread can be enhanced through appropriate yeast technology. status: publishe...|$|R

The epatosomatic, viscerosomatic and mesenteric fat indices, and the body chemical composition were determined: fatty levels of the muscles, liver and the mesenteric fat. The hepatic activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate deidrogenase, malic enzyme, and ATP citrate lyase were detected. The zootechnical performances and the body composition of sea bass were not affected by a diet in which <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>meal</b> alone, {{or a combination of}} this and soybean meal, was used as partial replacement of protein usually derived from fish meal.

Sampling interval did not affect protein and energy digestibility. The physical characteristics of juvenile oscar feces likely make them less susceptible to nutrient loss by leaching and can therefore be collected at longer intervals.
