50|$|Frentzen {{took his}} first career pole at the Monaco Grand Prix, but Villeneuve was back in third with Michael Schumacher {{splitting}} them. The Ferrari man jumped Frentzen at the very <b>wet</b> <b>start</b> and the Jordans of Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher also got through. Villeneuve had an awful start and was down to 9th, behind Coulthard, Herbert, Barrichello and Olivier Panis's Prost as well. Frentzen had a spin and Villeneuve had technical problems, and they were soon running 16th and 17th. As the rain continued to fall, they picked up places due to the accidents of Herbert and Jarno Trulli in the Minardi, Berger having to stop for a new front wing and actually passing Shinji Nakano's Prost on the racetrack. This left them in 11th and 12th with Frentzen still leading his teammate, but on lap 17 Villeneuve pulled into the pits with a problem, later identified as accident damage after a brush with the barrier, and retired. Frentzen picked up {{a place on the}} same lap due to Jean Alesi spinning his Benetton out of the race. The German passed Ukyo Katayama in the other Minardi a lap later, and was in 9th. He was still in 9th on lap 40 when he ran wide at the seafront chicane and bounced across the kerbs, damaging his right front suspension. He then hit the wall {{on the other side of}} the track, which caused almost identical damage to the left front suspension. He was out of the race, and the Williams Monaco challenge was over. Michael Schumacher's victory left him top of the championship by four points from Villeneuve. Frentzen had been demoted to fourth due to Eddie Irvine's 3rd place, and Williams had been bumped down to 2nd by the Ferrari performance.|$|E
5000|$|Walter Leslie Handley {{was born}} on 5 April 1902. He had a hard childhood. His father died of cancer {{when he was only}} nine and he soon had to help by working. He was just over 12 years old when he left school early and tried a variety of jobs before joining the OK {{motorcycle}} firm. He became a Junior Tester and general helper. His motorcycle career began with reliability trials, hill climbs and speed trials. [...] In 1922 he took his opportunity to ride an OK in the first Lightweight TT race in the Isle of Man. The story of his setting off in the wrong direction of the course in practice is well known but the ridicule in the Press stung him into action and on race day he gained a fastest lap from a standing start but his lead ended on the second lap with a broken inlet valve. His ill luck continued into 1923 but in the Lightweight Race after leading for the first three laps he managed to finish in eighth place with an average speed of 47.8 mph. He was awarded the Nisbet Shield by the ACU Stewards for pluck and endurance after suffering a ‘packet of troubles’. [...] By 1924 he had joined the Rex Acme Company but with his ill luck continuing he was beginning to earn the unwelcome tag of ‘Unlucky Handley’. This was after suffering mechanical failures in all his TT races when in the lead. Then in 1925 his luck changed dramatically, he became the first rider to win two TT races in one week and three fastest laps. His first TT victory was the Junior TT. [...] He won at the record speed of 65.02 mph with a fastest lap of 65.89 mph. After nearly {{three and a half hours}} in the saddle; it was over 35 minutes faster than the previous year’s winner. Of the 50 starters, only 14 managed to finish and only four gained replicas because of the high speed set by the winner. The following year he finished second in his first Senior TT. He had been delayed by over seven minutes with plug trouble. He piloted his 60 degree Rex Acme V-twin through the field from 22nd to finish runner up to Stanley Woods who had won the first seven lap Senior TT by 4 mins 21 secs. In the following year in the Lightweight TT he beat the Italian challengers by over eight minutes. In 1929 he gained a second place with his AJS in the Junior TT; then later in the week the Senior TT got off to a <b>wet</b> <b>start</b> and several riders slid off their bikes in the opening lap at Greeba Bridge including Wal. He was unhurt and quickly moved fallen riders and their machines off the road preventing further calamities before going to get help. On 21 June 1929 the ACU Secretary, Tom Loughborough sent Wal a letter thanking him for thinking of others by giving up his own chances.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} wetted-wall cyclone {{using different}} methods of water injection techniques upstream of the inlet {{was designed as}} an improvement to a wetted-wall cyclone developed by White, which uses liquid injection through a port {{on the wall of}} the cyclone inlet. The new cyclone has a high aerosol sampling flow rate (1250 L/min) and maintains constant cut-point with the modified White-type cyclone along with greater collection efficiency, lower time response, and reduced pressure drop. The final air-blast atomizer cyclone (AAC 2. 1 a) design considered has an aerosol-tohydrosol collection efficiency cut-point of 1. 3 mm with collection efficiencies at 1 and 2 mm of 39. 9 % and 86 %, respectively. The efficiency reported for the modified White-type cyclone for particle sizes of 1 and 2 mm was 40. 5 % and 76. 3 %, respectively, under no water bypass conditions. The aerosol-to-aerosol transmission efficiency for the AAC 2. 1 a configuration was found to be approximately 53. 7 % for 1 mm diameter particles as compared with 67. 2 % for the modified White-type cyclone. Dry and wet time response tests were performed in which the modified White-type cyclone had an initial response of 2. 5 minutes for a <b>wet</b> <b>start</b> and 1 minute for a dry start for a condition where there was no liquid carryover through the cyclone outlet. The rise time for AAC 2. 1 a cyclone under dry and <b>wet</b> <b>start</b> conditions was 0. 5 minutes and 1. 3 minutes, respectively. The decay response of the modified White-type cyclone was 1. 1 minutes for a <b>wet</b> <b>start</b> and 1. 2 minutes for a dry start. The corresponding numbers for AAC 2. 1 a cyclone were 1. 4 minutes for a dry start and 1 minute for a <b>wet</b> <b>start</b> condition. Off design tests were run at approximately ???? 10 % air flow rates to see the effect on cyclone performance. It was seen that at a 10 % higher flow rate (1350 L/min) the efficiency was 54. 3 %. At a 10 % lower flow rate (1125 L/min) the efficiency was 33. 7 % as compared with an efficiency of 39. 9 % at 1250 L/min for 1. 0 mm PSL particles. It was found that at a water input of 0. 8 mL/min the efficiency reduced to 79. 3 % as compared to 86 % at an input flow rate of 1. 6 mL/min for 2 mm size PSL...|$|E

40|$|The {{possible}} {{impact of}} climate change on frequency and severity of weather extremes is hotly debated among climate scientists. Weather extremes can {{have a significant impact}} on agricultural production, but their effect is often unclear; this due to interaction with other factors that affect yield and due to lack of precise definitions of relevant weather extremes. We show that an empirical analysis of historical yields can help to identifying such rare, high impact climate events. A reconstructed time series of ware potato production in Flevoland (The Netherlands) over the last 60 years (1951 – 2010) enabled us to identify the two main yield affecting weather extremes.

By using urodynamics to expose the pathophysiology behind the patterns of bladder/sphincter dysfunction, these questions were formulated and validated in a series of 156 children, referred with persistent daytime wetting to a programme for cognitive bladder training. With history-taking organized into a simple questionnaire, complemented by urodynamics, four patterns of bladder/sphincter dysfunction emerged: urge syndrome, staccato voiding, fractionated and incomplete voiding, and lazy bladder syndrome. A strong correlation was found between recurrent urinary tract infections and non-neuropathic bladder/sphincter dysfunction, implying that detection and treatment of bladder/sphincter dysfunction is essential in every child with recurrent urinary tract infections, especially in the presence of vesico-ureteral reflu...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{of the collapse of}} the superhydrophobic state is elucidated for submerged nanoscale textures forming a three-dimensional interconnected vapor domain. This key issue for the design of nanotextures poses significant simulation challenges as it is characterized by diverse time and length scales. State-of-the-art atomistic rare events simulations are applied for overcoming the long time scales connected with the large free energy barriers. In such interconnected surface cavities <b>wetting</b> <b>starts</b> with the formation of a liquid finger between two pillars.

This collective mechanism, involving the wetting of several pillars at the same time, could not be captured by previous atomistic simulations using surface models comprising a small number of pillars (often just one).
