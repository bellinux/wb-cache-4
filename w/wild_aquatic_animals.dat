40|$|The {{increased}} {{occurrence of}} pollutants in ecosystems {{is a continuing}} area of concern. It is known that numerous diseases of <b>wild</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals</b> can occur with decreased or increased prevalences in areas associated with high or chronic levels of pollution. This may have serious implications for environmental health. There has consequently been {{an increasing number of}} laboratory and field studies on disease transmission under polluted conditions, especially focusing on digeneans of medical or economic importance. The effect of pollutants to the transmission of larval digeneans (miracidia, cercariae, metacercariae) and snail-digenean interactions is therefore considered. An overview and interpretation of the published literature on laboratory and field studies is provided. It is apparent from these studies that the influence of pollutants on digenean transmission is highly complex with much of the observed effects in the laboratory often masked by a complexity of other factors in the field. Future studies would benefit from a standardisation of experimental procedures, increasing the number of combined laboratory and field studies, and increasing the complexity of the experiments undertaken...|$|E

Based on deficiencies in the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidelines identified in a prior finfish study (Gardner et al. 2014), we adapted the Standards for Reporting of Animal Diagnostic Accuracy Studies—paratuberculosis (STRADAS-paraTB) checklist of 25 reporting items to increase their relevance to finfish, amphibians, molluscs, and crustaceans and provided examples and explanations for each item. The checklist, known as STRADAS-aquatic, was developed and refined by an expert group of 14 transdisciplinary scientists with experience in test evaluation studies using field and experimental samples, in operation of reference laboratories for aquatic animal pathogens, and in development of international aquatic animal health policy. The main changes to the STRADAS-paraTB checklist were to nomenclature related to the species, the addition of guidelines for experimental challenge studies, and the designation of some items as relevant only to experimental studies and ante-mortem tests. We believe that adoption of these guidelines will improve reporting of primary studies of test accuracy for aquatic animal diseases and facilitate assessment of their fitness-for-purpose. Given the importance of diagnostic tests to underpin the Sanitary and Phytosanitary agreement of the World Trade Organization, the principles outlined in this paper should be applied to other World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) -relevant species...|$|E

Furthermore, some kinds of them are become extinct {{in the future if}} no conservation. Approach: A qualitative research was used for the study of conservation, renewability and development of cultural landscapes of Pabung Patham Flood Plains in the Chi river basin by community participation. The sample was three groups consisted of 30 key informants, 159 casual informants and 42 general informants. Three research areas were Khon Kaen, Mahasarakham and Yasothon. Results: The result of the study were as follows: (1) at present Pabung Patham have been fading away from new generation memories because they have known only community forest or Pa Chum Chon many kinds of plants, herbs, <b>aquatic</b> <b>animals,</b> <b>wild</b> animals and Insects are reduced. Furthermore some kinds of them are become extent in the future if no conservation. (2) Conservation by community participation according to AIC process was operated as follows: A: Appreciation, it was a process of constructing an appreciation. I: Influence, it was a process of constructing an influence on the ways to develop. C: Control, it was a process of constructing the ways to control the project. For this research the controlled factor was planting three kinds of tree and gaining four uses according to the feature of cultural landscapes of flood plains that consisted of planting trees for construction, trees for fruit and trees for fuel. Forest enhanced ecological balance in these ways: (1) enhancing oxygen for human beings (2) enhancing water for human beings (3) enhancing the fertility of soil land (4) enhancing the diversities of culture in case of the forest that Located in different ecology.
