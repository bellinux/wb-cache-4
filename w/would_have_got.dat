25|$|The {{converse}} is not true, as {{not every}} provably total function is primitive recursive. Indeed, one can enumerate all the primitive recursive functions and define a function en such {{that for all}} n, m: en(n,m) = f'n(m), where f'n is the n-th primitive recursive function (for k-ary functions, this will be set to f'n(m,m...m)). Now, g(n) = en(n,n)+1 is provably total but not primitive recursive, by a diagonalization argument: had there been a j such that g = f'j, we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> g(j) = en(j,j)+1 = f'j (j)+1= g(j)+1, a contradiction. (It {{should be noted that}} the Gödel numbers of all primitive recursive functions can be enumerated by a primitive recursive function, though the primitive recursive functions' values cannot).|$|E

25|$|Roebuck {{was born}} in the village of Oddington, outside Oxford, on 6 March 1956, the son of two schoolteachers and one of six children; he {{attended}} Millfield School where his mother was a mathematics teacher and his father an economics teacher. The headmaster, Jack Meyer, a former Somerset CCC Captain, had offered his parents employment at the school so that they could afford the fees. Meyer was an unconventional headmaster who wanted to encourage cricket talent. On entering Meyer's office for the interview for admission, Roebuck found an orange flying through the air towards him; he caught it, and in his book It Never Rains speculated whether he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> into Millfield if he had dropped it. He later studied law at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge, graduating with first class honours in 1977. However he never practised law, finding it too confining.|$|E
25|$|Columbushaus was {{completed}} and opened in January 1933, {{the same month}} that the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) came to power. Hitler had big plans for Berlin, to transform it into the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania, to be realised by his architect friend Albert Speer (1905–81). Under these plans the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> off fairly lightly, although the Potsdamer Bahnhof (and the Anhalter Bahnhof a short distance away) would have lost their function. The new North-South Axis, the linchpin of the scheme, would have severed their approach tracks, leaving both termini stranded {{on the wrong side}} of it. All trains arriving in Berlin would have run into either of two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn to the north and south of the centre respectively, to be known as Nordbahnhof (North Station) and Südbahnhof (South Station), located at Wedding and Südkreuz. In Speer's plan the former Anhalter Bahnhof was earmarked to become a public swimming pool; the intended fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof has not been documented.|$|E

Paul Kelly and the Messengers gave their last {{performance}} in August 1991, with Kelly set to pursue a solo career. He justified his decision: [...] "We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> formulaic and that's why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up". Paul Kelly and the Messengers' final album, Hidden Things, was a collection of previously released B-sides, stray non-LP tracks, radio sessions, and other rarities. It was released in May 1992, and reached No.29. One track, [...] "Rally Around the Drum", written with Archie Roach, was about an indigenous tent boxing man.|$|E
500|$|Sykes {{stated that}} Thin Lizzy was now [...] "more of a tribute thing" [...] {{and that it}} would be wrong to record new {{material}} under that name. He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Bardon has {{revealed}} that both he and Brown were sceptical about their characters marrying. In an interview with American fan-based newspaper, Walford Gazette, he commented, [...] "No way did the pair {{of us want to}} get married because we thought if we got married, we'd sit indoors and watch the telly every night. As it happened, we've had some nice things to do. And we are married, and it's worked out all right." [...] Brown has reiterated that she feared Dot would become boring if she married Jim, but that producers persuaded her that the marriage might be a good thing. On-screen, Dot had suffered the death of her grandson Ashley, and Brown felt that a traumatic event like that would have changed her character. In her opinion, the only way Dot <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> over Ashley's death [...] "would be to have someone else to care for and when it happened there was nobody [...] with marrying Jim she gets a family– that's what persuaded me. That house will become a house again– it will have a central point, {{they will be able to}} use the house as a central point, as Dot will be there." ...|$|E

She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
