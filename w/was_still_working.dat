5|$|Chapman <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> at the coke {{works in}} Selby when his ban was imposed, but by Christmas 1920 {{the company was}} sold up and he was laid off. Soon after, however, he was {{approached}} by Huddersfield Town to become assistant to Ambrose Langley, {{who had been a}} former team-mate of Herbert Chapman's brother Harry at The Wednesday. Huddersfield Town backed Chapman in an appeal against his ban, arguing that as he had been working at the factory in Barnbow during the war, he had not been in charge of Leeds City during the time illegal payments were paid. The ban was overturned, and Chapman was formally installed as Langley's assistant on 1 February 1921.|$|E

5|$|His {{loyalty to}} the Ottomans eroded, however, due {{to the impact of}} the new governments's Turkification {{policies}} which he viewed as repressive against his ideals. Because of his dissatisfaction with the Young Turks, Darwaza was driven to support Arab independence from the empire. In 1908, he joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), but withdrew soon after because of its Turkish nationalist political agenda. He played an active role in establishing a branch for the Party of Harmony and Freedom in Nablus in 1911. The party was founded in Istanbul and joined by Arab members to counter the policies of the CUP. In 1913, he joined a anti-Zionist group based in Nablus that sought to prevent the sale of Arab-owned land to Jews by submitting petitions to the Ottoman sultan, or by buying land for sale to preempt its purchase by Jews. In June 1913, he helped to prepare and became secretary of the First Palestinian Congress (also known as the Arab Congress of 1913) in Paris. In congress, he was also the delegate for the Jamma'in subdistrict of the District of Nablus. Meanwhile, Darwaza <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> in the DTPS.|$|E
5|$|Pandora's Tower {{was first}} {{announced}} in January 2011 during Nintendo's three-quarterly financial report, which was followed shortly by {{the opening of}} the official website. At the time, the game was very close to completion, and Nintendo <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> out the marketing. The game's cover art generated controversy in Japan due to the physical similarity of protagonist Aeron to early promotional images of Noctis Lucis Caelum, the protagonist of Final Fantasy Versus XIII. Pandora's Tower released in Japan on May 26, 2011, published by Nintendo. Pandora's Tower was confirmed for a European release in mid 2011 alongside fellow Wii RPG The Last Story.

5|$|Rare then {{developed}} Diddy Kong Racing, {{their first}} self-published game. Originally {{intended as a}} real-time strategy game involving cavemen, the game was re-imagined into a racing game prior to its release in 1997. It {{was one of the}} fastest selling games at the time, as recorded by The Guinness Book of Records. Diddy Kong Racing also features protagonists from some future Rare games, including Banjo and Conker. At the time, Rare <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>working</b> on the large-scale platform game. Originally codenamed , it was a game featuring a young boy named Edison and pirates. The protagonist was then replaced by a bear known as Banjo, and Rare expanded the role of Kazooie the bird. The two characters were inspired by characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios films and Rare hoped that they could appeal to a younger audience. Banjo-Kazooie was released in June 1998 to critical acclaim. A sequel, Banjo Tooie, was released in 2000. It was a critical success and it outsold the first game, selling 3 million copies.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>working.</b> The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E
