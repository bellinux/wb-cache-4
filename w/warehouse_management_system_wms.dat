5000|$|Wave picking is a {{term for}} a process used in a <b>warehouse</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> (<b>WMS)</b> to support {{organizing}} of the daily flow of work of a warehouse or distribution center. Wave picking is an application of short-interval-scheduling. Managers, using the WMS, assign groups of orders into short intervals called [...] "waves", to initially simulate the flow for the day, consistent with the order departure plan and available labor. When the plan is satisfactory, it is accepted. The WMS then releases the waves to the warehouse sequentially throughout the day, to allow managers to coordinate the several parallel and sequential activities required to complete the daily work. One of the objectives of wave picking is to minimize the variation of workload in each work function by wave. The wave data includes the workload (order lines, cases, value added services, etc.) by order or function (case picking, repack picking, pallet movement, pick position replenishment, packing, etc.), providing management the information to calculate staff requirements (Reasonable Expectancies or Productivity Standards) to guide the assignment of staff by function, with the reasonable expectation that the work in each function, within each wave. Waves are often constructed (based on each day's order characteristics and available staffing) to last between 1 and 4 hours, with resulting 8 to 2 waves in a shift. There are three basic management tasks accomplished and benefits of wave picking.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the reality}} of mass {{mechanized}} production became more fully accepted by the Western public. Elves had been portrayed as using assembly lines to produce toys early in the 20th century. That shift was reflected in the modern depiction of Santa's residence—now often humorously portrayed as a fully mechanized production and distribution facility, equipped with the latest manufacturing technology, and overseen by the elves with Santa and Mrs. Claus as executives and/or managers. An excerpt from a 2004 article, from a supply chain managers' trade magazine, aptly illustrates this depiction: Santa's main distribution center is a sight to behold. At , it's one of the world's largest facilities. A real-time <b>warehouse</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> (<b>WMS)</b> is of course required to run such a complex. The facility makes extensive use of task interleaving, literally combining dozens of DC activities (putaway, replenishing, order picking, sleigh loading, cycle counting) in a dynamic queue...the DC elves have been on engineered standards and incentives for three years, leading to a 12% gain in productivity...The WMS and transportation system are fully integrated, allowing (the elves) to make optimal decisions that balance transportation and order picking and other DC costs. Unbeknownst to many, Santa actually has to use many sleighs and fake Santa drivers {{to get the job done}} Christmas Eve, and the [...] transportation management system (TMS) optimally builds thousands of consolidated sacks that maximize cube utilization and minimize total air miles.|$|E
