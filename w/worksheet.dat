40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a tool for engineers and researchers to understand the underlying logic of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) procedures. The HCM offers a collection of methodologies and techniques for estimating the capacity and evaluation of the level of service for highway, street and transit facilities (HCM 2000). Mathcad <b>worksheets</b> were developed to replicate the computational procedures of five chapters of the HCM. The principal topics addressed are advantages of the Mathcad <b>worksheets</b> over existing implementations of the HCM, challenges associated with the implementation, and changes and additions made to the format of the HCM <b>worksheets</b> reflecting capabilities and limitations of Mathcad. These dynamic documents allow the user to easily explore the sensitivity of the procedures to varying equations, relationships and input parameters.

The development of <b>worksheets</b> is intended to give effective teaching and learning in the classroom. The school-based curriculum or Kurikulum Tingkat Satuan Pendidikan (KTSP) is the guideline in developing the <b>worksheets.</b> This study is a Research and Development study. The study was done at SMP N 3 Mlati Sleman. The steps in developing the <b>worksheets</b> were conducting needs analysis, writing syllabus, developing <b>worksheets,</b> evaluating <b>worksheets,</b> conducting tryouts, and writing the final draft of the <b>worksheets.</b> The instruments in this study were questionnaire, observation sheet and interview guide. There were two questionnaires used in this study. The first questionnaire was used to obtain the students’ needs. The second questionnaire was used to get the information about {{the development and implementation of}} the <b>worksheets.</b> The data were analyzed by computing the mean and standard deviation. The validity of the research is obtained through content validity and construct validity. The reliability of the research is obtained through the Alpha Cronbach formula by using the computer program. The result shows that the reliability of the research is 0. 836 - 0. 938. The result between 0. 8 - 1 means that the reliability of the research is very high. The needs analysis is obtained by the use of questionnaire, observation sheet and interview guide. The findings of the needs analysis are identified into seven components. The components are students’ profile, learning activities, learning resources, learning aids, learning materials, preference learning activities and students’ lack. The product is designed by writing the syllabus and designing the <b>worksheets.</b> The topics in the syllabus are Embarrassing Experience, Animal Stories and Lessons Learned. The design of the <b>worksheets</b> consists of ‘Opening’, ‘Lead in’, ‘Grammar Focus’, ‘Reading and Writing’, ‘Summary’ and ‘Review’.
