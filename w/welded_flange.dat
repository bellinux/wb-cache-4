40|$|Seismic {{performance}} of steel frames with "post-Northridge" bolted web, <b>welded</b> <b>flange,</b> beam-column connection with adequate ductility (BWWF-AD) and "pre-Northridge" bolted web, <b>welded</b> <b>flange,</b> beam-column connection (BWWF) is comprehensively evaluated using a nonlinear {{finite element method}} (FEM). The material and geometric nonlinearities, major sources of energy dissipation, and {{the flexibility of the}} connections are considered. The Richard Model is employed to analytically describe the moment-relative rotation (M-theta) curves of BWWF-AD connections using limited available data of full-scale, ATC- 24 laboratory experiments. From the limited experimental data, an analytical method is developed to predict and to extrapolate the M-theta curves of BWWF-AD connection with any sizes of beams and columns. This method is used to extend the test results of an individual BWWF-AD connection to a frame with several or more BWWF-AD connections. The inelastic seismic response of two SAC Steel Project benchmark steel moment-resisting frames (SMRF) with BWWF and BWWF-AD connections modeled as partially restrained (PR) and as fully restrained (FR) are calculated and compared. Furthermore, the effects of BWWF and BWWF-AD connections on the frames' maximum top lateral and interstory displacement, maximum connection rotation, drift, and the frames' base shear forces are evaluated and compared. Moreover, the calculated drift and base shear forces of the frames are compared with the 2000 Edition of International Building Code (IBC 2000). This study suggests that the Richard Model captures the experimental M-theta curves of BWWF-AD connections accurately. BWWF-AD connections have significantly larger elastic stiffness than other types of PR connections. Their elastic stiffness {{is similar to that of}} bolted, double web angle with top and seat connection, but their ductility is much larger. In most cases, the presence of BWWF-AD connections improved the seismic {{performance of}} the steel frames.

40|$|The {{multiaxial fatigue}} {{behaviour}} of materials with different ductility under constant and changing principal stress directions is also applicable to welded joints of different materials. For this, <b>welded</b> <b>flange</b> tube connections {{of the fine}} grained steel StE 460 and the artificially aged aluminium alloy AlSilMgMn T 6 were investigated under constant amplitude combined bending and torsion. Out-of-phase loading, i. e. changing principal stress directions, of the steel joints led to a decrease of fatigue life, which is observed at ductile material states. However, for the aluminium joints out-of-phase loading resulted same behaviour as in-phase loading, which indicates a semi-ductile material behaviour. The results for the welded steel joints were evaluated on basis of local stresses by the integral hypothesis of the Effective Equivalent Stress EES (WVS). This hypothesis for ductile material states {{takes into account the}} life decreasing influence of out-of-phase loading by considering the interaction of the shear stresses on different planes. The fatigue behaviour of the aluminium welds is described by the critical plane based combination of shear and normal stresses (KoNoS), which is valid for semi-ductile material states...|$|E
40|$|A {{manufacturing}} process plan {{was developed for}} a welded condenser utilizing a sintered wick.

Coupling the effects of high surface area of multiple condensers, the low thermal resistance of loop heat pipes, and the increased dissipation rates with an integrated fan system, a high efficiency heat exchanger has been previously designed. The multiplecondenser loop heat pipe required reliably manufactured condensers, with specified internal features composed of sinter wick material in order to prevent flooding and flash vaporization; key challenges faced by having multiple condensers in a loop heat pipe.

40|$|Corrugated {{steel web}} with {{inherent}} high out-of-plane stiffness has a promising application in configuring large span highway bridge girders. Due to the irregularity of the configuration details, the local stress concentration poses a major fatigue {{problem for the}} <b>welded</b> <b>flange</b> plates of {{high strength low alloy}} structural steels. In this work, the methods of applying CFRP laminate and shot peening onto the surfaces of the tension flanges were employed with the purpose of improving the fatigue strength of such configuration details. The effectiveness of this method in the improvement of fatigue strength has been examined experimentally. Test results show that the shot peening significantly increases hardness and roughness in contrast to these without treatment. Also, it has beneficial effects on the fatigue strength enhancement when compared against the test data of the joints with CFRP strengthening. The stiffness degradation during the loading progress is compared with each treatment. Incorporating the stress acting on the constituent parts of the CFRP laminates, a discussion is made regarding the mechanism of the retrofit and related influencing factors such as corrosion and economic cost.

40|$|At Forsmark, {{several cases}} of {{suspected}} galvanic corrosion {{have been detected}} and believed {{to be caused by}} an inappropriate use of graphite gaskets in brackish water. This report studies the likelihood of galvanic corrosion between the graphite gasket and stainless steels and aims to be a reference when investigating galvanic corrosion in the future. To evaluate galvanic corrosion, several electrochemical experiments were studied, such as galvanic series, polarization curves, and galvanic current measurements with a ZRA. The electrochemical results showed that when immersing the stainless steel (254 SMO) and the graphite gasket (Novatec) into brackish water, there was a current flowing between the electrodes. However, the current was very small, which could be explained by the protection from a passive film on the stainless steel. The difference in corrosion potential between the two materials was measured and compared to results from polarization curves. It appeared that 254 SMO would be protected by a passive film at the measured potential. Galvanic current measurements also indicated the presence of a passive film under the investigated conditions. The results indicate that galvanic corrosion itself should not have caused the corrosion attacks at Forsmark. The found corrosion is more likely due to crevice corrosion that was accelerated by the combination of a crevice, a <b>welded</b> <b>flange</b> surface, chlorides in water and possibly a graphite gasket...|$|E

The foam filled structure is composed of three steel tubes with a <b>welded</b> <b>flange</b> at both ends bolted {{together to form a}} portal grounded by its free ends. Structure, internal and ground constraints have been designed and manufactured in order to minimize nonlinear effects and to guarantee optimal constraint conditions.

Selected modes have been identified with suitable modal parameters extraction techniques. Each structure has been tested before and after filling, in order to compute the percentage variation of modal parameters. Two different densities of hybrid aluminum polymer foam have been tested and compared with structures filled with aluminum foams produced using the powder compact melting technique. All the foam fillings were able to suppress high frequency membrane modes which results in a reduction of environmental noise and an increase in performance of the components.

40|$|Seismic design {{criteria}} have been heavily improved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after the Northridge CA earthquake in 1994. Most {{of the damage}} observed was caused by brittle failure of moment frame connections. This failure was induced by {{the formation of the}} plastic hinge at undesirable locations in the beam and the column near the connection. Using <b>welded</b> <b>flange</b> plate (WFP) connections will force the formation of the plastic hinge away {{from the face of the}} column while preventing the brittle failure of the moment connection. FEMA- 350 {{design criteria}} recommendations for WFP connections suggest that the plastic hinge will form away from the face of the column directly under the cover plate. The purpose of this research is to prove that the plastic hinge will form away from the face of the column, at a distance of approximately half the depth of the beam away from the cover plate. The further away the plastic hinge is from the face of the column the higher the connection demands. Therefore, underestimating the location of the plastic hinge could lead to under designed connections. 	The modeling and analysis of WFP connections was performed using finite element analysis software. A total of eight models with half beam half column configuration were considered in this study. Each selected section of beam and column was first designed, modeled and analyzed using WFP connections design recommendations from FEMA- 350, with calculations modifications to account for the proposed plastic hinge location. Results were computed and comparisons were made in terms of plastic hinge location from the cover plates. Strength obtained for each model using finite element analysis software was also compared with hand calculations.

40|$|The {{earthquake}} of Northridge, CA in 1994 caused {{damages in}} steel moment frame buildings {{due to the}} brittle fractures in beam to column connections. This led to the modifications and improvements in the connection detailing used prior to the Northbridge earthquake. These improvements included use of better welding material and process, use of cover plates (such as <b>Welded</b> <b>Flange</b> Plate connections (WFP)), Reduced Beam Section (RBS) etc. RBS and WFP connections {{are the two most}} widely used connection configuration today. Both RBS and WFP connections allow the steel moment frame systems to extensively yield and deform plastically thus avoiding brittle fracturing occurring at the connections. Steel moment frames are comprised of beams and column, in which beams are rigidly connected with columns by welding or bolting. Members and joints resist flexural and shear forces and lateral stability is achieved through bending of the frame elements. WFP connection uses the cover plates of certain thickness and length. This addition of cover plate increases the depth of the beam at the face of the column and thus forces the plastic hinge to form away from face of the column at a certain distance. The RBS connection also protects the beam column connection by forcing the plastic hinge in a beam to form away {{from the face of the}} column at a certain distance within the reduced section. This research aims to compare the two types of steel moment connections, WFP and RBS connections, in terms of ductility, strength and stiffness. The connections were designed using the guidelines provided by Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA- 350 (2000) and AISC Seismic Design Manual. The modeling and analysis of the WFP and RBS connection was performed using finite element analysis software. A two story and two bay special moment resisting frame was considered for this study and the first story exterior beam column connection was designed using two different sections of beam and column. Total of four models were used in a half beam and half column configuration. Each selected section of beam and columns was first designed, modeled and analyzed using WFP criteria and then by RBS design guidelines. The span, height, boundary conditions and loads are kept typical for all four models. Results were computed and comparison is made in terms of ductility, strength and stiffness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to evaluate the fatigue strength of welded diaphragm-to-beam connections. Experimental tests were performed {{in order to determine}} the fatigue resistance of the detail, examine failure modes, and to evaluate repair methods. Two diaphragm configurations were studied: one with diaphragms positioned back-to-back and one with staggered diaphragms. The experimental results indicate that the back-to-back diaphragms distribute load laterally more than the staggered diaphragms. The back-to-back configuration provides stiffness to the beam web and acts as a continuous transverse member. Because of the stiffness, many of the web and <b>flange</b> <b>welds</b> connecting the diaphragm to the beam fractured for the non-staggered diaphragms that resulted in decreased load transfer. Horizontal cracking also developed in the beam webs but did not affect the fatigue strength of the beam. The staggered diaphragms do not stiffen the beam web, but pull the beam web out-of-plane causing high out-of-plane bending stresses to develop. In the staggered diaphragm tests, cracks perpendicular to the stress field developed in the beam webs at the toe of a bottom <b>flange</b> <b>weld.</b> However, the beams did not fracture immediately. The repair methods investigated were removing the diaphragm and drilling holes at the beam crack tips, removing the diaphragm and peening the bottom <b>flange</b> <b>weld</b> toes, and leaving the diaphragm in place and peening the bottom <b>flange</b> <b>weld</b> toes. Peening the bottom <b>flange</b> <b>weld</b> toes before fatigue cracks developed did prevent cracks from forming for both diaphragm configurations. When a crack was present in the beam web, drilling holes at the crack tips arrested the crack growth. Finite element models of the welded diaphragm-to-beam connection were developed {{in order to determine the}} stresses near the welds. The stresses were then used in a crack propagation model that predicts the fatigue life of cracked beam members that have the welded diaphragm connection. Based upon the experimental and analytical results, it has been shown that beam members that develop cracks have a long fatigue life. Also, repair methods are effective in extending the fatigue life of a beam member once cracks develop and before the onset of cracks. ...|$|R
