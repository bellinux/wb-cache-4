500|$|The low <b>wooden</b> <b>pile</b> {{lighthouse}} or [...] "Lighthouse on legs", {{was built}} two years later, also by Joseph Nelson, {{to complement the}} High Lighthouse. It is a total of [...] high, with the light being at [...] above the sand. It stands on nine wooden piers, some with plate metal reinforcement. The structure is whitewashed with a vertical red stripe on the sea side. The lights were inactive between 1969 and 1993, but were recommissioned when the High Lighthouse lights were permanently deactivated. They have a focal plane of [...] and provide a white flash every 7.5seconds, plus a directional light (white, red, or green depending on direction) at a focal plane of [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} of the town {{on the edge of}} the Somerset Levels [...] and moors where they meet the Bristol Channel, has resulted in a history dominated by land reclamation and sea defences since Roman times. Burnham was seriously affected by the Bristol Channel floods of 1607, with the present curved concrete wall being completed in 1988. There have been many shipwrecks on the Gore Sands, which lie just offshore and can be exposed at low tides. Lighthouses are hence prominent landmarks in the town, with the original lighthouse known as the Round Tower built to replace the light on the top of the 14th century tower of St Andrews Church. The [...] pillar or High Lighthouse and the low <b>wooden</b> <b>pile</b> lighthouse or Lighthouse on legs on the beach were built to replace it. The town's first lifeboat was provided in 1836 by the Corporation of Bridgwater.|$|E
500|$|The {{main pier}} was {{originally}} [...] long, {{and it is}} [...] wide with a cantilever construction. However the low water jetty was damaged in a storm in 1903, rebuilt in 1909 and finally dismantled in 1923 meaning that the pier is now [...] long, Due to architectural features such as abutments {{at either end of}} the pier, the pier resembles a bridge more than other pleasure piers. Fifteen groups of piles support a continuous lattice girder, each set comprising four piles screwed into the river bed at an angle with an X-brace between each adjacent pair. The fitting of screw blades to iron piles, as opposed to the then accepted <b>wooden</b> <b>pile,</b> created a deeper and far more resilient base support. This was one of the innovations brought by Eugenius Birch which have enabled many of the piers he designed to survive. There were problems with oscillations in the structure when bands marched on the pier, both on the opening day and again in 1886. As a result, further horizontal cross braces were added to the piles, and a law was passed banning marching on the pier. The gothic toll house and pierhead buildings were designed by local architect Hans Price.|$|E

25|$|In 1896 it was {{discovered}} that the pier needed urgent remedial works, marine worms having infested the <b>wooden</b> <b>piles.</b> Extensive works were undertaken only for the pier to be damaged again, this time by a heavy storm on 28 November 1896. Further repairs were necessary and the service to Victoria Port became intermittent, closing in the winter months with trains terminating at Sharnal Halt. In 1901 the <b>wooden</b> <b>piles</b> of the pier were encased in concrete in an attempt to prevent further infestation, but problems continued after the area around the pier was dredged, thereby exposing the uncased parts of the piers to investigation.|$|R

2500|$|According to The Illustrated London News of 1850, Herne Bay {{had fewer}} than a dozen {{inhabitants}} {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century, until a military encampment prompted expansion of population. [...] This small development in turn attracted visitors who disembarked via hoys from passing London-Margate steamers. After a few bumpy rides in hoys the visitors decided they needed a pier and family accommodation at Herne Bay, and so the first Herne Bay Pier began. At the behest of a group of investors led by Surrey building contractor George Burge who had worked for Thomas Telford in St Katharine's Dock, a [...] long and [...] wide pier was designed and built by Telford's assistant Thomas Rhodes. Telford was building Whitstable harbour at the time. The first <b>wooden</b> <b>pile</b> was driven on 4 July 1831, and the structure was completed on 12 May 1832 at a cost of £50,000 when the steamer Venus brought the first passengers, in the same decade as Telford Terrace, the Pier Hotel and the promenade.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of a PT-boat base on Puruata Island was {{undertaken}} by the 75th Naval Construction Battalion, {{with help from the}} 71st and 77th Naval Construction Battalions. A <b>wooden</b> <b>pile</b> pier was built, along with crash boat and fueling piers, and 18 small-boat moorings. Base facilities included accommodation, mess halls, five steel-framed warehouses and an emergency hospital. The main medical facility was on Bougainville, and built by the 36th Naval Construction Battalion. It consisted of 70 Quonset hut and a [...] mess hall, with accommodation for 500 patients. The inland road network was the responsibility of the US Army engineers, particularly the 117th Combat Engineer Battalion. The cut supply roads through the jungle. it was found that underneath the [...] deep top soil was volcanic sand, which was suitable for road surfacing. A three-span bridge was built over the Koromokina River. Base development work was completed by July 1944, and the last naval construction battalion, the 36th, departed in August. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units 582 and 586 arrived in May 1944, and took over maintenance of the base facilities.|$|E
