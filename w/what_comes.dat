5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. I try to improvise. <b>What</b> <b>comes</b> out is what I feel.|$|E

25|$|Although 1993's Sonatine did {{poorly in}} Japan, it {{received}} rave reviews in Europe {{when it was}} shown at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. Kitano plays a Tokyo yakuza who is sent by his boss to Okinawa to help end a gang war there.

All four of his films were screened at the 1994 London Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|This {{question}} about <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> first (the functions or the constellation) {{is not an}} inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (dependency and constituency grammars) is not narrowly limited to the traditional views. Dependency and constituency are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they dependency- or constituency-based, will likely reject {{the notion that the}} functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.|$|E

25|$|MEG {{has access}} to {{virtually}} no sources of brain activity below a few centimetres under the cortex.

Combining the two makes it easier to determine what in the EEG signal comes from the surface (since MEG is very accurate in examining signals from the surface of the brain), and <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> from deeper in the brain, thus allowing for analysis of deeper brain signals than either EEG or MEG on its own.|$|E

Al-Oraidi has also used social media to attack ISIL, particularly after the group declared its caliphate in June 2014. Al-Oraydi said ISIL spokesman Abu Mohammad al-Adnani “does not know <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> out of his head.” He also referred to ISIL’s leaders as “Muslim killers.” He declared war on ISIL in a December 2014 sermon.|$|E

It also aims to empower citizens with information about their country, and urge them to take action. While the primary language of the show is Hindi, it is simulcast in eight languages such as Bengali, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu, and subtitled in English, to ensure maximum reach.|$|E

25|$|As a {{primitive}} of the theory, {{the status of}} these functions is much different than in some constituency grammars. Traditionally, constituency grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject {{the existence of a}} finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue is a question of <b>what</b> <b>comes</b> first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas constituency grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.|$|E
