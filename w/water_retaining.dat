In its most basic form, an espresso is served alone as a shot or short black, or with hot water added, when it is known as Caffè Americano.

25|$|The depth, {{texture and}} {{composition}} of soils can influence its <b>water</b> <b>retaining</b> and draining ability. Soils containing large amounts of organic material tend to have the highest water retention abilities. These types of soils include deep loams, silty soils like what is typically found on the fertile valley floors {{such as in the}} California's Napa Valley. Clay particles have the potential to remain in colloidal suspension {{for long periods of time}} when it is dissolved in water. This gives clay-based soils the potential to retain significant amount of water such as the clay soils of the Right bank Bordeaux region of Pomerol. Many regions with these types of <b>water</b> <b>retaining</b> soils have little need for irrigation, or if they do it is usually supplemental during periods of drought. Soils with poor water retention include sand and alluvial gravel based soils such as those found in the Barolo and Barbaresco zones of Italy or in many areas of South Australia. Depending on the climate and amount of natural rainfall, areas with poor water retention may need irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Continental climates {{are usually}} seen in areas further inland from the coastal {{influences}} of oceans and large bodies of water. The {{difference from the}} average mean temperature of its coldest and hottest months can be quite significant with moderate precipitation that usually occurs {{in the winter and}} early spring. Depending on the <b>water</b> <b>retaining</b> ability of the soil the grapevine may receive enough water during this period to last throughout the growing season with little if any irrigation needed. For soils with poor water retention, the dry summer months may require some supplemental irrigation. Examples of continental climates that use supplemental irrigation include the Columbia Valley of Washington State and the Mendoza wine region of Argentina.|$|E
25|$|With {{abundant}} water, a grapevine {{will produce}} shallow root systems and vigorous growths of new plant shoots. This {{can contribute to}} a large, leafy canopy and high yields of large grape berry clusters {{that may not be}} sufficiently or physiologically ripe. With insufficient water, many of the vine's important physiological structures, including photosynthesis that contributes to the development of sugars and phenolic compounds in the grape, can shut down. The key to irrigation is to provide just enough water for the plant to continuing function without encouraging vigorous growth of new shoots and shallow roots. The exact amount of water will depend on a variety of factors including how much natural rainfall can be expected as well as the <b>water</b> <b>retaining</b> and drainage properties of the soil.|$|E

60|$|The boats {{pulled away}} {{together}} towards the invisible shore, piloted by Captain Bunker, the first officer, and Senor Perkins in the foremost boat.

Miss Keene, {{wrapped up in}} the stern sheets of the boat, gave way to the dreamy influence of this weird procession through the <b>water,</b> <b>retaining</b> only perception enough to be conscious of the singular illusions of the mist that alternately thickened and lightened before their bow. At times it seemed as if they were driving full upon a vast pier or breakwater of cold gray granite, that, opening to let the foremost boat pass, closed again before them; at times it seemed as if they had diverged from their course, and were once more upon the open sea, the horizon a far-off line of vanishing color; at times, faint lights seemed to pierce the gathering darkness, or to move like will-o'-wisps across the smooth surface, when suddenly the keel grated on the sand. A narrow but perfectly well defined strip of palpable strand appeared before them; they could faintly discern the moving lower limbs of figures whose bodies were still hidden in the mist; then they were lifted from the boats; the first few steps on dry land carried them out of the fog that seemed to rise like a sloping roof from the water's edge, leaving them under its canopy in the full light of actual torches held by a group of picturesquely dressed people before the vista of a faintly lit, narrow, ascending street. The dim twilight of the closing day lingered under this roof of fog, which seemed to hang scarcely a hundred feet above them, and showed a wall or rampart of brown adobe on their right that extended nearly to the water; to the left, at the distance of a few hundred yards, another low brown wall appeared; above it rose a fringe of foliage, and, more distant and indistinct, two white towers, that were lost in the nebulous gray.|$|E

40|$|Abst ract~he {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of layer charge on the hydration of Mg-saturated expandable 2 : 1 phyllosilicates. <b>Water</b> <b>retained</b> by 12 Mg-saturated clays at 54 % relative humidity was quantified gravimetrically. X-ray diffraction and total chemical analysis were used to de-termine the hydratable surface area (447 - 759 m z g 1) and layer charge [0. 327 - 0. 754 electrons per formula unit (e f. u. ~) ] of each sample. <b>Water</b> <b>retained</b> by the clays increased with both hydratable surface area and layer charge of the clays. However, the increase in H 20 content with layer charge occurred only on external surfaces of the clays. This result suggests that the H 20 on external surfaces is localized around the cation/charge sites rather than forming multi-layers as was suggested previously. A model is proposed for the hydration of expandable 2 : 1 phyllosilicates. The model assumes that interlayer volume controls interlayer hydration and that the number of cation/charge sites on external surfaces controls hydration of external surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Samples of A and B horizons of arable loessial soil, {{with and}} without the {{addition}} of c. a. 9 % of peat and subjected to six freezing/thawing cycles, were studied. Surface free energies and water contact angles were determined using a thin layer wick- ing technique. The water retention curving relating soil moisture to the pressure head was measured by combining the suction plate and pressure chamber methods. The addition of the fresh (non-dried) peat increased soil wettability in both horizons, which increased further after cyclic temperature changes. The amount of <b>water</b> <b>retained</b> at high pressure head values (in the low moisture region) decreased with the decrease in soil wettability, i. e., with the de- crease {{in the work of}} spreading of water and the increase of the contact angle. However, the amount of <b>water</b> <b>retained</b> at low pressure head values (in the high moisture region) depended on the pore volume of the soils.
