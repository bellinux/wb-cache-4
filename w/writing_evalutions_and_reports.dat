40|$|In {{the areas}} of safety and risk {{analysis}} the precise modeling of complex technical systems during development and for evaluation purposes is of great importance. Traditionally, fault tree models {{have been used to}} accomplish this, and, more recently, stochastic Petri-net models have begun to be employed. Fault tree models are clearly structured and thus easily understood, but unable to model some aspects of system behaviour, such as multi-state components or dependencies between different parts of the system. It seems natural to remove these drawbacks of the fault tree modeling paradigm by pairing it with stochastic Petri-nets, which are especially well suited for modeling complex stochastic dependencies. To exploit the advantages of both of these methods and provide engineers with an intuitive high-level modeling interface for reliability analysis, this approach combines extended fault trees for the description of the system and stochastic Petri-nets for the <b>evalution</b> <b>and</b> analysis of the model...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{efficient}} algorithm for exploiting the Facial Animation Parameter interpolation modality specified by the MPEG- 4 standard {{in order to allow}} very low bitrate trasmission of the animation parameters. The proposed algorithm is based on a comprehensive analysis of the cross-correlation properties that characterize FAPs, which is here <b>reported</b> <b>and</b> discussed extensively. Based on this analysis, a subset of 10 almost independent FAPs selected from the full set of low-level 66 FAPs has been transmitted and used at the decoder to interpolate the remaining ones. The performances achievable through the proposed algorithm are evaluated objectively by means of conventional PSNR measures and compared to an alternative solution based on the increase of the quantization scale factor use for FAP encoding. The subjective <b>evalution</b> <b>and</b> comparison of the results has been made also possible by uploading mpg movies on a freely accessable web site referenced in the bibliography. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FAP interpolation algorithm allows efficient parameter encoding at around 70 bit/frame or, in other words, at less than 2 kbit/sec for smooth synthetic video at 25 frame/sec. 1...|$|R

Hyperglycemia does not suddenly incapacitate drivers, however its occurrence often leads to tiredness, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity and adjustment of treatment which may precipitate hypoglycaemia. The side effects of acute hypoglycemia are of particular concern, as they include slowing of both cognitive and motor functions. Hypoglycemia while driving ist the most important complication in persons treated with insulin, sulfonylureas or glinides. They can be prevented, however, by frequent measuring blood glucose before and every 60 to 90 minutes during driving, by keeping sugary snacks (carbohydrates) in the vehicle, and by taking carbohydrates in case of glucose levels below 5 mmol/l. For patients, who are treated with insulin and sulfonylureas/glinides, it is of utmost importance fort the treating physician to frequently talk about successful strategies for preventing hypoglycemias, and thus accidents, while driving. People with diabetes treated with insulin, sulfonylureas or glinides are nor allowed to drive a bus, taxi, or truck (commercial driving).

40|$|Background: The {{measurement}} of corneal thickness {{is important in}} the fields of refrective surgery, the diagnosis of glaucoma and the adjustment of contact lenses. It was to determine, if a new technology - the optical coherence tomography (OCT) - is capable to generate precise measurements of the central and paracentral (4 mm) corneal thickness. Methods: The slitlamp-adapted OCT (Heidelberg Engineering) is an interferometric device of a wavelength of 1310 nm, which generates two-dimensional scans with axial resolution of 11 µm. The Pocket-pachymeter (Quantel-Medical), an ultrasound-pachymeter (US) with a frequency of 20 MHz and resolution of 82 µm was used as comparision method. Various aspects were analysed in a total of 156 eyes of 120 patients. Results: The central corneal thickness was 533 ± 52 µm (OCT) and 546 ± 55 µm (US) (P< 0, 001), respectively. The paracentral region showed corneal thickness measurements of 553 – 577 µm (OCT) and 561 – 578 µm (US). An automatic analysis of OCT-pachymetry generated an improvement of the reliability of 61 %. There was no influence of the corneal curvature in central readings, but a small influence in the mid periphery. In more peripheral measurements and very steep corneas a correction factor should be considered. Conclusion: The OCT is due to the high resolution and its non-contact device a innovative and useful instrument for precise measurements of corneal thickness. It allows postoperative <b>evalutions</b> <b>and</b> delivers several addicional information in challenging clinical settings. For follow-up examinations always the same technique should be used due to methodical differences...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe GENSCALE {{scaffolding}} methodology {{basis is}} the computing and pre-processing of unitig coverage. Different modeling strategies are tested and evaluated {{to solve the}} scaffolding problem. An evaluation strategy {{was set up to}} understand why some data sets are especially challenging. The repeat content impacting on the unitig number rather than the size of the genome is the cause of complex input data. Some explanations are provided for problematic data sets (disconnected graph or missing link) however the main source of difficulties is the size of the modeled graph. A new two step scaffolding modeling strategy is in development. It tries to break the graph complexity by first solving a graph containing only large unitigs - building something that can be compared to a trustworthy genomic frame. The benchmarking workflow brings together several sequence comparing tools: a tool for assessing assembly quality (Quast), a sequence aligner (MUMmer) and homemade visualization and comparison scripts (graph generator. py and graph comparato. py). Although compared to a single published scaffolder (SSPACE), this methodology can be applied for any scaffolding solution obtained with other tools. Comparing our methodology to recent publications such as the ScaffMatch 27 scaffolder or the Integer Linear Programming approach 28 developed at the Montpellier Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics (LIRMM) which explicitly discusses its repeated sequence processing will be insightful. Their article was the motivation behind the study on Wolbachia Endosymbiont, one of their tested organism. The benchmarking of our methodology highlights the major advantage of processing unitig coverage but also the limitation of the models which have difficulties with bigger graphs with high degree nodes. Overall the project succeeded more in the standardisation of <b>evalution</b> <b>and</b> benchmarking strategies than on providing precise explanations for unsuccessful scaffoldings...|$|R

The purpose of this research was to study quantitative land suitability of northern Baraan area located in eastern Isfahan. The study was a continuation of the previously accomplished qualitative land suitability evaluation of the area. The economic studies include economic data collection, matching inputs and outputs and gross margins analysis. Radiation-thermal production potential of the crops was calculated based on plant physiology and temperature (FAO model), which was 10. 45, 10. 11, 13. 64 and 11. 93 ton/ha for wheat, barley, maize and rice, respectively. Radiation-thermal production potential, observed and marginal yields and the results of the qualitative land evaluation were used to perform quantitative land <b>evalution</b> <b>and</b> to determine the corresponding suitability classes. The predicted yield in different land units varies between 1. 64 and 9. 17 ton/ha for wheat, 1. 81 and 9 ton/ha for barley, 2. 06 and 9. 42 ton/ha for maize and 2. 35 and 7. 14 ton/ha for rice. Presence of significant statistical correlation between the observed and the predicted yield values reveals the validity of the evaluation methods used. The results from quantitative land evaluation show that most of the land units are slightly to moderately suitable for wheat, barley, maize and rice, while a few are not. The best land utilization type in each land unit can be selected through a combined consideration of quantitative land evaluation results, benefitability of each land unit and impact of the land use on the soil. Rice cultivation is not recommended in the study area, because of its adverse effect on soil physical properties and soil drainage...|$|R
