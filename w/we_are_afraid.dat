500|$|The {{first public}} {{performance}} {{of one of}} Frederik Magle's compositions took place on Easter morning 7 April 1985, in Stubbekøbing church, where a children's choir performed an Easter hymn he had composed. Two years later, in 1987, six of his hymns with texts by his mother Mimi Heinrich were performed by actress and singer Annie Birgit Garde at a concert in Lyngby church, and the same year he played on television for the first time. In 1988, two of his larger works, the cantata <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid,</b> and the [...] "mini-musical" [...] A Christmas Child, were premiered in Grundtvig's Church in Copenhagen before an audience of 2,000 people. He began a collaboration with the violinist Nikolaj Znaider in 1990, and they performed a series of concerts together. Later, Znaider gave the first performance of Magle's variations for violin and piano in the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, with the pianist Daniel Gortler: Journey in time describes a [...] "kind of scenes or musical images" [...] {{with the use of}} sharp dissonances, complicated rhythms and dramatic transitions and thematic formations.|$|E

500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] One couple interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> because we really don't know what's going to happen next in the country. ... You just don't know if they can incarcerate you tomorrow for something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to 11 January protests police used riot gear to disperse protesters ransacking buildings, burning tires, {{setting fire to}} a bus and burning two cars in the working class suburb of Ettadhamen-Mnihla in Tunis. The protesters {{were said to have}} chanted [...] "We are not afraid, we are not afraid, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> only of God." [...] Military personnel were also deployed in many cities around the country.|$|E

2500|$|Google {{does not}} use HTML keyword or meta tag {{elements}} for indexing. The Director of Research at Google, Monika Henzinger, was quoted (in 2002) as saying, [...] "Currently we don't trust metadata because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of being manipulated." [...] Other search engines developed techniques to penalize Web sites considered to be [...] "cheating the system". For example, a Web site repeating the same meta keyword several times may have its ranking decreased by a search engine trying to eliminate this practice, though that is unlikely. It {{is more likely that}} a search engine will ignore the meta keyword element completely, and most do regardless of how many words are used in the element.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{has stated}} in an {{interview}} that he believed [...] "the strength of America is not in its towers or in its battleships, it's in its faith. Of course, I said that, but I wasn't sure it was really true anymore. [...] This isn't the same country we were in the previous decades." [...] Johnson said the U.S. was [...] "cringing in fear" [...] of Muslim terrorists after September 11 attacks and that professors were afraid to discuss it [...] "because they're afraid of what the Muslim students will do. They're afraid it won't keep the peace on campus. I never thought our country would descend to this level. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> to search the truth and to proclaim it. [...] We once knew who the true God was and were able to proclaim it frankly. [...] But since about 1960 we've been hiding from that. We've been trying to pretend that all religions are the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 236, Sun Quan {{launched}} a campaign against Wei and he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead an army to attack the Wei-controlled Xiangyang Commandery. Lu Xun sent a close aide, Han Bian (韓扁), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian encountered the enemy at Mianzhong (沔中) and was captured. When Zhuge Jin received news of Han Bian's capture, he became fearful and wrote to Lu Xun: [...] "His Majesty has withdrawn his forces. The enemy has captured Han Bian and they know our situation. The rivers have dried up so we should make a hasty retreat." [...] Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas, while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin said, [...] "Boyan possesses intelligence and strategy, he knows what he's doing." [...] He came to see Lu Xun, who told him, [...] "The enemy knows that His Majesty has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us. Besides, they have already stationed troops at critical positions and are poised to strike. Hence, we should remain composed and calm our men, after which {{we will have a}} change of plans and prepare to withdraw. If we display signs of retreat now, the enemy will think that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> and will definitely attack us, resulting in defeat for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Ishmael cited [...] {{as one of}} ten a fortiori (kal va-chomer) {{arguments}} {{recorded in}} the Hebrew Bible: (1) In [...] Joseph's brothers told Joseph, [...] "Behold, {{the money that we}} found in our sacks' mouths we brought back to you," [...] and they thus reasoned, [...] "how then should we steal?" [...] (2) In [...] Moses told God, [...] "Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me," [...] and reasoned that surely all the more, [...] "How then shall Pharaoh hear me?" [...] (3) In [...] Moses said to the Israelites, [...] "Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the Lord," [...] and reasoned that it would follow, [...] "And how much more after my death?" [...] (4) In [...] "the Lord said to Moses: ‘If her (Miriam's) father had but spit in her face,'" [...] surely it would stand to reason, [...] "‘Should she not hide in shame seven days?'" [...] (5) In [...] the prophet asked, [...] "If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you," [...] is it not logical to conclude, [...] "Then how can you contend with horses?" [...] (6) In 1 Samuel [...] David's men said to him, [...] "Behold, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> here in Judah," [...] and thus surely it stands to reason, [...] "How much more then if we go to Keilah?" [...] (7) Also in [...] the prophet asked, [...] "And if in a land of Peace where you are secure" [...] you are overcome, is it not logical to ask, [...] "How will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?" [...] (8) [...] reasoned, [...] "Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth," [...] and does it not follow, [...] "How much more the wicked and the sinner?" [...] (9) In [...] "The king said to Esther the queen: ‘The Jews have slain and destroyed 500 men in Shushan the castle,'" [...] and it thus stands to reason, [...] "‘What then have they done {{in the rest of the}} king's provinces?'" [...] (10) In [...] God came to the prophet saying, [...] "Behold, when it was whole, it was usable for no work," [...] and thus surely it is logical to argue, [...] "How much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is singed?" ...|$|E
