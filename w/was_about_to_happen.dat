5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

On 15 June Rosin and Mordowicz were interviewed by Oscar Krasniansky, the {{engineer}} who had translated the Vrba–Wetzler report into German. They told him that, between 15 and 27 May 1944, 100,000 Hungarian Jews had arrived at Birkenau, and that most were killed on arrival, apparently with no knowledge of what <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to them.

500|$|The {{wives of}} those {{involved}} and Anne Vaux (a friend of Garnet who often shielded priests at her home) became increasingly concerned by what they suspected <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Several of the conspirators expressed worries {{about the safety of}} fellow Catholics who would be present in Parliament {{on the day of the}} planned explosion. [...] Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and the young Earl of Arundel's name was brought up; Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day. [...] The Lords Vaux, Montague, Monteagle, and Stourton were also mentioned. [...] Keyes suggested warning Lord Mordaunt, his wife's employer, to derision from Catesby.|$|E
500|$|That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway {{gave some}} {{comments}} on the phenomenon to Wired reporter Adam Rogers.

Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate the full extent of what <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E
500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score for the 1980 film, the {{decision}} was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be. Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls [...] is setting up the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.|$|E

500|$|In 2002 Schapira interviewed three {{anonymous}} Israeli soldiers, [...] "Ariel, Alexej and Idan," [...] {{who said}} they had been on duty at the IDF post that day. They knew something <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> one said, because of the camera crews that had gathered. One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as [...] "the twins"; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres {{to the left of the}} al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Dance" [...] {{was written}} with Hilson {{alongside}} American recording artist Justin Timberlake, {{as well as}} Johnkenum D. Spivery and Timbaland protégés The Royal Court and Jim Beanz. According to Hilson, the songs were first in the works with fellow Timbaland collaborator Justin Timberlake in 2006, during FutureSex/LoveSounds era, but she commented, [...] "it was still unofficial then. The budgets hadn't been opened up for me at that stage." [...] Hilson premiered the song at her producer and mentor Jamal [...] "Polow da Don" [...] Jones's launch party his newly created, Interscope-distributed record label, Zone 4, in Atlanta in July 2007. On choosing singles for In A Perfect World..., {{in an interview with}} Digital Spy, Hilson stated, [...] " [...] liked it a lot at first and said it should be a single, but just as that <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> he called it 'bubble bath music'.

500|$|Upon its release, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 {{received}} critical acclaim. Despite the game's praise, journalists {{heavily criticized}} {{the content of}} [...] "No Russian". Marc Cieslak of BBC News was saddened by the level, as he felt it disproved his theory that the video game industry had [...] "grown up". Rock, Paper, Shotgun Kieron Gillen chastised the level for failing {{to live up to}} expectations. He found the plot to be illogical, criticized the skip feature for rendering an artistic statement as [...] "laughably pathetic", and ultimately summarized the level as [...] "dumb shock". Writing for PC World, Matt Peckham questioned why the gunmen would not care if the player did not shoot, and felt that not informing the player of what <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> until the last possible moment was [...] "creating a kind of plausible emotional deniability by removing all the dramatic impetus that ought to surround it". Several prominent British religious leaders condemned [...] "No Russian": Alexander Goldberg of the London Jewish Forum was worried that children would play the level; Fazan Mohammed of the British Muslim Forum described the level as an intimate experience of enacting terrorism; and Stephen Lowe, the retired Bishop of Hulme, felt that the level was [...] "sickening".|$|E

2500|$|Back in Iraq, deposed {{dictator}} Saddam Hussein {{made what}} an American photographer present called [...] "the ultimate perp walk", in restraints, escorted by two Iraqi security personnel, with a media presence, {{to the start}} of his trial in 2004. [...] "I felt his anger at my camera, at me," [...] Karen Ballard recalled, [...] "and actually thought he might spit on me. He didn't know exactly what <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> and, suddenly, the formerly fierce dictator seemed small and disheveled."

2500|$|Five years later, on {{the night}} of November 27, 1989, and {{a few weeks before the}} Romanian Revolution, which she had no idea <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> Comăneci {{defected}} with a group of other Romanians. They were all guided by Constantin Panait, a Romanian who was now an American citizen after defecting, and whom Comăneci had met at a party given by one of her friends. In the years since Béla Károlyi's defection to the United States, she had changed her mind on the subject and met a number of Romanians at the party who talked about it. Comăneci notes in her memoir that her first impression of Panait was a positive one as [...] "he seemed nice, and he was believable because he was now an American." [...] Later after meeting Panait, her brother Adrian told her, [...] "Constantin was the real deal. He wasn't bluffing. There were six other Romanians who planned to trust him with their lives." [...] Comăneci then began a long period of planning for her escape. [...] Once it began, their dangerous overland journey (mostly on foot and at night) took her through Hungary, Austria, and finally to the United States.|$|E

2500|$|According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony {{heard a voice}} {{telling him}} [...] "Go out and see." [...] He went out and saw an angel who wore a girdle with a cross, one {{resembling}} the holy Eskiem (Tonsure or Schema), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, [...] "Anthony, do this and you will rest." [...] Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution that <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> {{to the church and}} the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, {{and the end of the}} age. When Saint Macarius visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew near of the departure of Saint Paul the First Hermit in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from St Athanasius the Apostolic, the 20th Patriarch of Alexandria.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after the pageant, Williams {{discussed}} the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.” Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Williams said {{that one of the most}} important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who [...] "endured a lot" [...] during that period.|$|E

We were his side men." [...] Bassist Peter Tork said, [...] "Adios to the Manchester Cowboy", and speaking to CNN, drummer/singer Micky Dolenz said, [...] "He was the brother I never had and this leaves a gigantic hole in my heart".

2500|$|After Navarro's {{departure}} {{in early}} 1998, Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were on the}} verge of breaking up. Flea told Kiedis, [...] "the only way I could imagine carrying on [...] is if we got John back in the band." [...] Kiedis was surprised and thought there was no way Frusciante would ever want to work with him as the two still had unresolved personal problems from when Frusciante quit in 1992. With Frusciante free of his addictions and ailments, Kiedis and Flea thought it was an appropriate time to invite him back. In April 1998, when Flea visited him at his home and asked him to rejoin the band, Frusciante began sobbing and said [...] "nothing would make me happier in the world." [...] Flea decided to contact Anthony and have him meet with John to try and resolve any personal problems that the two might have had. Flea was relieved to find out that both had no bad blood towards each other and were once again excited to make music together. Within the week and, for the first time in six years, the reunited foursome jump-started the newly reunited Red Hot Chili Peppers. Anthony Kiedis said of the situation: [...] "For me, that was the defining moment of what would become the next six years of our lives together. That was when I knew that this was the real deal, that the magic <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> again.
