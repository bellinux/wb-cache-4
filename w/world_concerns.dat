50|$|Long-term antibiotics, {{specifically}} {{those from}} the macrolide class such as erythromycin, reduce the frequency of exacerbations in those who have two or more a year.

Methylxanthines such as theophylline generally cause more harm than benefit and thus are usually not recommended, but may be used as a second-line agent in those not controlled by other measures.

The second <b>world</b> <b>concerns</b> Qoudsi himself, as he visually appears and in his manner of showing his feelings through the use of his toys and his interactions with them. The third world is one of space, where we come from, which is depicted through walls, and multilayered backgrounds, as symbolic traces of the complex life that does not enable Qoudsi and me to meet.

5000|$|The Curriculum Infusion of Real Life Issues Model {{is about}} taking issues that {{students}} face {{in their everyday}} lives and addressing them. There are many issues that students can face as they grow into adults. Ignoring them {{in the classroom is}} not the right way to go about producing responsible adults. The authors include issues such as bullying, drugs and alcohol, smoking, violence, and sexually transmitted diseases. It would be productive if teachers can acknowledge and support students when they face problems like these. Students and teachers can develop more of an interpersonal bond and even help their communities grow. The authors describe the curriculum infusion, “It makes classes more relevant to students by addressing their real <b>world</b> <b>concerns</b> and connects teachers more closely to the students and communities where they work." [...] Included in the authors' research are topics such as diversity, environment, and prevention. This is another example of self and social understanding being used in conjunction with subject matter. It shows that there is more to students’ lives than simply subject matter.|$|E

50|$|Wilfred Beckerman, {{posits that}} the absolutist concept of {{sustainable}} development given above is morally repugnant. The largest part of the worlds population live in acute poverty. Taking {{that as well as}} the acute degradation into account, one could justify using up vast resources in an attempt to preserve certain species from extinction. These species providing no real benefit for society other than a possible value for the knowledge of their continued existence. He argues that such a task would involve using resources that could have instead been devoted to more pressing <b>world</b> <b>concerns.</b> Examples include - increasing access to clean drinking water or sanitation in the Third World.mhf shifted their attention to the idea of ‘weak’ sustainability. This allows for some natural resources to decrease as long as sufficient compensation is provided by increases in other resources. The result usually was an increase in human capital. This compensation {{is in the form of}} sustained human welfare. This is illustrated in a well-regarded definition provided by David Pearce, who is the author of numerous works on sustainability. He defines sustainability as implying something about maintaining the level of human welfare (or well-being) so that it may improve, but never declines (or, not more than temporarily). This implies sustainable development will not decrease over time.|$|E
5000|$|During his {{break from}} making feature films, Maddin began {{teaching}} film {{classes at the}} University of Manitoba, where he met and encouraged the younger film-maker Deco Dawson. After being impressed with Dawson's short films, Maddin hired Dawson {{to work on a}} short film for the Toronto International Film Festival — Maddin was {{one of a number of}} directors (including Atom Egoyan and David Cronenberg) commissioned to make four-minute short films that would screen prior to the various feature films at the 2000 festival. After hearing rumours that other directors were planning films with a small number of shots, Maddin decided that his film would instead contain over a hundred shots per minute, and enough plot for a feature-length film. Maddin then wrote and shot The Heart of the World (2000) in the style of Russian constructivism, taking the commission at its literal face value, as a call to produce a propaganda film. The plot of The Heart of the <b>World</b> <b>concerns</b> two brothers, Osip and Nikolai, who compete for the love of the same woman: Anna, a state scientist studying Earth's core. Anna discovers that the heart of the world is in danger of a fatal heart attack (which would mean the end of the world), and the brothers compete amongst the public panic.
