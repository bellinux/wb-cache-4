5|$|The 1947 Sydney hailstorm <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{disaster}} which struck Sydney, Australia, on 1 January 1947.

At the time, it was the most severe storm to strike the city since recorded observations began in 1792.|$|E

5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether there ever <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus had {{relied on}} the support of some major figures of the court in his bid for power. However, he quickly lost most of them. First, Basiliscus alienated his own sister Verina's support, {{executing}} the Magister Officiorum Patricius. Patricius was the lover of Verina, and the empress had planned to raise him to the imperial rank and to marry him: the very revolt against Zeno was organised to make Patricius emperor. Basiliscus, however, had out-witted his sister, and, after the flight of Zeno, had the ministers and the Senate choose him, and not Patricius, as Emperor. Basiliscus ordered the death of Patricius, as the officer <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> candidate to overthrow the new Emperor; as a consequence, Verina later intrigued against Basiliscus, because of her lover's execution.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the en passant rule <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for {{different versions of the}} rule).|$|E

5|$|Even though peasant {{households}} {{were significantly}} smaller than aristocratic ones, the wealthiest of these would also employ servants. Service <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> {{part of the}} cycle of life, and it was common {{for young people to}} spend some years away from home in the service of another household. This way they would learn the skills needed later in life, {{and at the same time}} earn a wage. This was particularly useful for girls, who could put the earnings towards their dowry.|$|E
5|$|In Rome the portico of the Palazzo dei Conservatori {{sheltered}} {{offices of}} various guilds. Here disputes arising in the transaction of business were adjudicated, {{unless they were}} of sufficient importance to go before a communal tribunal, {{such as that of}} the conservatori. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> place for such activity. Until the 1470s the main market of the city was held on and around the campidoglio, while cattle continued to be taxed and sold in the ancient forum located just to the south.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these offices {{there was a need}} for servants {{to take care of the}} hunting animals. The master huntsman, or the veneur, held a central position in greater noble households. Likewise, the master falconer was a high-ranking officer, often of noble birth himself. There were spiritual needs to be cared for, and a chapel <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> part of every large household. These household chapels would be staffed by varying numbers of clerics. The chaplains, confessors and almoners could serve in administrative capacities as well as the religious ones.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that hopefully the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{government}} officials {{denied that the}} dam was poorly built; many politicians and an engineer for the nation's water company blamed the dam's poor construction {{as the source of}} the extreme death toll. Prior to the arrival of the storm, many residents had repeatedly requested that a stone wall be built to protect their homes. After the storm, they said that the deaths could have been prevented. According to one account, two master planned communities were situated {{in the middle of the}} drainage and were thus deluged by the storm. The water department head took the blame for the construction, but also said that the disaster <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> phenomenon.|$|E

During the deliberations, few raised serious objections to the planned bicameral congress, nor the separate executive function, nor the separate judicial function.

5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Innherred was largely without much debate, as the line {{naturally}} {{went through all}} the towns {{and most of the}} important villages. Sunnan <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> place to halt construction, as it is located {{at the foot of the}} lake of Snåsavatnet, allowing connection with steam ships. Scheduled services on Snåsavatnet started in 1871 with SS Dina, which was replaced with SS Bonden in 1885. From 1904 to 1921, Bonden was supplemented with MS St. Olaf, although SS Bonden remained in corresponding service with the train until 1926.|$|E

A standoff between police and the URA radicals took place, lasting ten days. The lodge <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> fortress, solidly constructed of thick concrete on a steep hillside with only one entrance, which, along with their guns, enabled the hostage-takers to keep police at a distance.|$|E

Dredging kept the inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937, and in 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built jetties that hold it in place. With the inlet in a fixed place, it became possible after 1928 to build a bridge to span it, and the completion of the Ocean Highway in 1933 prompted Delaware to build a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway.|$|E
5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Maryland had a {{new head}} coach, Ron Vanderlinden, and he {{immediately}} saw that Navy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>natural</b> rival for his team, but {{was unaware of the}} past history. Vanderlinden attempted to renew the game, {{but it was not until}} after his relief that the idea materialized. In 2001, Ralph Friedgen was hired as his successor and spearheaded efforts to reinvigorate the team's old rivalries, including that against Navy. Friedgen, who played for Maryland as an offensive guard, was at the 1964 game as a recruit. He had also coached for nine years as Georgia Tech's offensive coordinator, and he harbored nostalgic feelings for a rivalry with the passion of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Friedgen stated that, in addition to the rivalries with West Virginia and Virginia, a renewed in-state series would be even more meaningful. In 2002, the two schools agreed to meet for the first Crab Bowl Classic in forty years, scheduled for 2005.|$|E
