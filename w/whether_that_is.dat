5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of viewpoints. A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 the Wrights {{built the}} Flyer II. They decided {{to avoid the}} expense of travel and {{bringing}} supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles (13km) northeast of Dayton. They received {{permission to use the}} field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. <b>Whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually ignored them for the next year and a half.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} the schizoid character developed by Ernst Kretschmer comprised an amalgamation of avoidant, schizotypal and schizoid traits. It was not until 1980 and the influential work of Theodore Millon {{which led to the}} split of the schizoid character into three distinct personality disorders (now schizoid, schizotypal and avoidant). Since then however, there has been much debate about <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> accurate or if these traits are just different expressions of one overarching personality disorder and belong together.|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks {{received}} generally positive reviews. Much of {{the initial}} critical reception to Slay Tracks was from zines to whom Kannberg had sent the EP. A review in the San Francisco-based zine Maximum RocknRoll said [...] "Most of the tunes work {{by virtue of their}} eclecticism, freshness, and originality—this is a good one." [...] The zine Conflict called the EP [...] "absolutely perfect." [...] Slay Tracks also received attention from mainstream publications. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice rated Slay Tracks an A-, and selected it as his fourth favorite EP of 1990. Spins review said: [...] "a long stream of noise water is omitted by Pavement. ... What a party!" [...] A reviewer for Option praised the band's lo-fi characteristics and attitude, calling the EP [...] "loose and intentionally lo-fi," [...] and saying [...] "let's hope this Pavement stays cracked." [...] College Music Journals review was also favorable, noting [...] "You're Killing Me" [...] and [...] "She Believes" [...] as highlights, and calling the EP a [...] "deep, intoxicating breath of homemade music from people with tongues in their cheeks and hearts on their sleeves ... the twin engine feedback and fuzz hits dead center with naive [...] melodic balance, and <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> in spite of or because of the sloppy, one-take feel is inconsequential." ...|$|E

2500|$|The general {{reputation}} of John Hulley {{in the latter}} years of the 1860s appears to have lessened, but the reasons why are unclear. An article in the Cheshire Observer and Chester, Birkenhead, Crewe and North Wales Times of 1 May 1869, may give {{an indication of the}} view of the local press towards him, although his work regarding the health and welfare of the lower classes would have still been positive. The unknown author had attended a Bicycle Tournament at the Liverpool Gymnasium and had scornfully compared it with the performances of Music Hall acrobats. He went on to criticise Hulley as [...] "one of the most, it not the most unpopular man in the town, though <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> his fault or his misfortune is not for me to determine". He acknowledged that John Hulley was undoubtedly a public benefactor, but went on to suggest that everyone in Liverpool was familiar [...] "with his grotesque figure" [...] and his hair reminded him of the waves in The Tempest.|$|E
2500|$|Congress also {{attempted}} to reduce payments to public Part C Medicare health plans by aligning {{the rules that}} establish Part C plans' capitated fees more closely with the FFS paid for comparable care to [...] "similar beneficiaries" [...] under Parts A and B of Medicare. Primarily these reductions involved much discretion {{on the part of}} CMS and examples of what CMS did included effectively ending a Part C program Congress had previously initiated to increase the use of Part C in rural areas (the so-called Part C PFFS plan) and reducing over time a program that encouraged employers and unions to create their own Part C plans not available to the general Medicare beneficiary base (so-called Part C EGWP plans) by providing higher reimbursement. These two types of Part C plans had been identified by MedPAC as the programs that most negatively affected parity between the cost of Medicare beneficiaries on Parts A/B/C and the costs of beneficiaries not on Parts A/B/C. These efforts to reach parity have been more than successful. As of 2015, all beneficiaries on A/B/C cost 4% less per person than all beneficiaries not on A/B/C. But <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because the cost of the former decreased or the cost of the latter increased is not known.|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] {{derives from}} the triconsonantal Semitic root د-ر-س D-R-S 'to learn, study', through the wazn (form/stem) , meaning [...] "a place where {{something}} is done". Therefore, [...] literally means [...] "a place where learning and studying take place". The word is also present as a loanword with the same innocuous meaning in many Arabic-influenced languages, such as: Urdu, Bengali, Pashto, Baluchi, Persian, Turkish, Azeri, Kurdish, Indonesian, Malay and Bosnian. In the Arabic language, the word [...] simply means the same as school does in the English language, <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> private, public or parochial school, {{as well as for}} any primary or secondary school whether Muslim, non-Muslim, or secular. Unlike {{the use of the word}} school in British English, the word [...] more closely resembles the term school in American English, in that it can refer to a university-level or post-graduate school as well as to a primary or secondary school. For example, in the Ottoman Empire during the Early Modern Period, madaris had lower schools and specialised schools where the students became known as danişmends. The usual Arabic word for a university, however, is [...] (...) [...] The Hebrew cognate midrasha also connotes the meaning of a place of learning; the related term midrash literally refers to study or learning, but has acquired mystical and religious connotations.|$|E

2500|$|Whelan theorizes {{that when}} Stieglitz first {{looked at the}} {{negative}} {{he did not see}} the stylistic qualities he was then championing, and he set the negative aside while dealing with more pressing issues. In the period directly before and after taking The Steerage Stieglitz was still producing photos that were primarily pictorialist in style, and it would be several more years before he began to break with this tradition. The Steerage represents a [...] "fundamental shift in Stieglitz's thinking", and, critics have said that while his mind had visualized the image when he took it {{he was not able to}} articulate his reasons for taking it until later. Also, painter Max Weber claims to have discovered the image while looking through Stieglitz's photos in 1910, and he took credit for first pointing out the aesthetic importance of the image. <b>Whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> true or not, it was only after Stieglitz began to seriously consider the works of modern American artists like John Marin, Arthur Dove and Weber that he finally published the image. Perhaps Stieglitz had seen the 1900 painting with the same title by George Luks (now in NC Museum of Art). Like the works of those artists,The Steerage is [...] "divided, fragmented and flattened into an abstract, nearly cubistic design" [...] and it has been cited as one of the first proto-Cubist works of art.|$|E
2500|$|Justice Alito wrote a {{concurrence}} {{joined by}} Justice Thomas, {{in which he}} agrees with the Court's primary reasoning, but separately emphasizes that, he believes, the Court's holding [...] "does {{not and should not}} extend beyond employees who testify in internal investigations or engage in analogous purposive conduct." [...] Alito disagrees with the Sixth Circuit that [...] "opposition" [...] must be consistent and initiated by the employee, but writes that the opposition must be [...] "active and purposive." [...] Alito finds the majority's definition of oppose could also [...] "embrace silent opposition," [...] and it is questionable <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> protected. He worries that an [...] "interpretation of the opposition clause that protects conduct that is not active and purposive" [...] would [...] "open the door to retaliation claims by employees who never expressed a word of opposition to their employers." [...] As a hypothetical, he asks if an employee would be protected in a case where the opposition was expressed in an informal [...] "water cooler" [...] chat. A fired employee could claim that the termination was retaliatory if the employers became aware of the views the employee had expressed. He notes that EEOC retaliation charges doubled between 1992 and 2007 and fears that an [...] "expansive interpretation of protected opposition conduct would likely cause this trend to accelerate." ...|$|E

[...] The can is held in the left hand, and the right hand is rotated slightly clockwise, causing the can lid to be punctured. [...] The can is then rotated counter clockwise in the left hand, while the right hand rotates alternatively slightly counterclockwise and slightly clockwise, until the can has been rotated nearly 360 degrees and the lid is nearly free. [...] The lid of the now opened can is lifted, most often with the P-38 cutting edge, and the P-38 is wiped clean, and the cutting point is rotated back to its stowed, folded position; then, the P-38 is returned to its stored location, <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> dangling on a dog tag chain around one's neck, or in one's pocket if the P-38 is attached to a key ring.
