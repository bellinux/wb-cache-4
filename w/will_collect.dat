5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of the beds of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which fits over the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} select any two-member {{permutation}} of its five playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, and Cream the Rabbit, provided the two desired characters have been unlocked; only Sonic and Tails {{are available at}} the beginning, while the other three must be rescued from Eggman {{over the course of the}} game. Each character has a unique ability: Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid-air, Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller, Amy can smash enemies with her hammer, Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls, and Cream can fly using her ears as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend, Cheese. The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button; for example, pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air. In addition, the second character <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> rings and destroy enemies the first has not. Outside the main game, there are two battle modes for two to four players, in which any of the characters can be selected: racing and Chao collecting.|$|E
50|$|Soft {{references}} behave almost identically to weak references. Soft {{and weak}} references provide two quasi-priorities for non-strongly referenced objects: the garbage collector <b>will</b> always <b>collect</b> weakly referenced objects, but <b>will</b> only <b>collect</b> softly referenced objects when its algorithms decide that memory is {{low enough to}} warrant it.|$|R

25|$|The now-reduced {{mediator}} {{exits the}} cell laden with electrons that it transfers to an electrode; this electrode becomes the anode. The {{release of the}} electrons recycles the mediator to its original oxidised state, ready to repeat the process. This can happen only under anaerobic conditions; if oxygen is present, it <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> the electrons, as it has greater electronegativity.|$|E

25|$|Honey bees require {{water to}} {{maintain}} osmotic homeostasis, prepare liquid brood food, and {{to cool the}} hive through evaporation. A colony’s water needs can generally be met by nectar foraging as it has high water content. Occasionally on hot days or when nectar is limited, foragers <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> water from streams or ponds {{to meet the needs}} of the hive.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that in a liquid mixture at a given pressure, each component boils at the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure and the vapors of each component <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> separately and purely. This, however, does not occur even in an idealized system. Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by Raoult's law and Dalton's law, and assume that vapor–liquid equilibria are attained.|$|E

25|$|During the nesting season, {{burrowing}} owls <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> a {{wide variety}} of materials to line their nest, some of which are left around the entrance to the burrow. The most common material is mammal dung, usually from cattle. At one time it was thought that the dung helped to mask the scent of the juvenile owls, but researchers now believe the dung helps to control the microclimate inside the burrow and to attract insects, which the owls may eat.|$|E

ODA leader Pavel Sehnal said that Kulhánek is a right-wing candidate, that was missing in the election. Miloš Zeman stated {{that he does not}} know Kulhánek well but remembers him as a successful manager of Škoda Auto, adding that he does not have a problem with Kulhánek's candidacy because he believes that it is better to have more candidates.|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{value added}} tax (EU VAT) is a {{value-added}} tax encompassing member {{states in the}} European Union VAT area. Joining in this is compulsory for member states of the European Union. As a consumption tax, the EU VAT taxes the consumption {{of goods and services}} in the EU VAT area. The EU VAT's key issue asks where the supply and consumption occurs thereby determining which member state <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> the VAT and which VAT rate will be charged.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, {{avalanches}} follow drainages down-slope, frequently sharing drainage features with summertime watersheds. At {{and below}} tree line, avalanche paths through drainages are well defined by vegetation boundaries called trim lines, which occur where avalanches have removed trees and prevented regrowth of large vegetation. Engineered drainages, {{such as the}} avalanche dam on Mount Stephen in Kicking Horse Pass, have been constructed to protect people and property by redirecting the flow of avalanches. Deep debris deposits from avalanches <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> in catchments at the terminus of a run out, such as gullies and river beds.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} only one boy found, the High Lamas will invite Living Buddhas of the three great monasteries, {{together}} with secular clergy and monk officials, to 'confirm their findings' and then report to the Central Government through the Minister of Tibet. Later, a group consisting of the three major servants of Dalai Lama, eminent officials, and troops <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> the boy and his family and travel to Lhasa, where the boy would be taken, usually to Drepung Monastery, to study the Buddhist sutra in preparation for assuming the role of spiritual leader of Tibet.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} {{goals of}} both surveys {{range from the}} nature of dark energy to assessing near-Earth objects. Teams of European astronomers will conduct the surveys; some will cover most of the southern sky, while others will focus on smaller areas. VISTA and the VST are expected to produce large amounts of data; a single picture taken by VISTA has 67megapixels, and images from OmegaCam (on the VST) will have 268megapixels. The two survey telescopes <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> more data every night {{than all the other}} instruments on the VLT combined. The VST and VISTA will produce more than 100 terabytes of data per year.|$|E

25|$|International flights {{arrive and}} {{depart from the}} {{international}} terminal, either concourse E or F, located {{on the eastern side}} of the airport. Concourse F and the new international terminal opened May 16, 2012, while concourse E opened in September 1994, in anticipation of the 1996 Summer Olympics. International pre-cleared flights can arrive at concourses T & A–D. International flights can also depart from concourses T & A–D, such as when space is unavailable at concourses E or F, or when an aircraft arrives as a domestic flight and continues as an international flight. Furthermore, all international pre-cleared flights, regardless of origin, <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> their baggage at the international terminal.|$|E
25|$|The Tanpopo {{mission is}} an orbital {{astrobiology}} experiment by Japan {{that is currently}} investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, organic compounds, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of Kibo module of the International Space Station. The mission <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> cosmic dusts and other particles for three years by using an ultra-low density silica gel called aerogel. The purpose is to assess the panspermia hypothesis {{and the possibility of}} natural interplanetary transport of life and its precursors. Some of these aerogels will be replaced every one or two years through 2018. Sample collection began in May 2015, and the first samples will be returned to Earth in mid-2016.|$|E
25|$|Queens {{and males}} are {{unlikely}} to forage since female workers <b>will</b> <b>collect</b> and capture resources for the colony. P. exigua females have been observed carrying orange-colored crops with some solid material that is most likely chitin filled. These chunks seem to be larvae structures of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera (Dias 2006). There are butterfly and moth fragments of thoracic legs with spines and claws, parts of abdominal legs, pieces of the head cuticle with sensory setae, and apparently parts made of trachea and muscle tissue. P. exigua were observed to transfer complete batches of nest material more often after {{the appearance of a}} new generation of workers. In this post-emergence phase, colonies grow a lot, thus foraging activity amplifies. Colonies in the post-swarming stage exhibit a decrease in activity.|$|E
