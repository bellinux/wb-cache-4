25|$|Agreeing {{with the}} Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal {{held that the}} {{mandatory}} death penalty satisfied the reasonable classification test {{used to assess the}} constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in Ong Ah Chuan, the Court found that the 15-gram differentia used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could not be said to be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a <b>wholesale</b> <b>dealer</b> operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely harm suffered by society {{as a result of the}} offender's crime.|$|E

2500|$|The Weinhaus Huth, {{with its}} {{distinctive}} corner cupola, was a wedge-shaped structure {{located in the}} angle between Potsdamer Straße and Linkstraße (literally [...] "Left Street"), and with entrances in both streets. Wine merchant Friedrich Karl Christian Huth, whose great-grandfather had been kellermeister (cellar-master) to King Friedrich II back in 1769, had founded the firm in 1871 and taken over the former building in Potsdamer Straße on 23 March 1877. His son, the wine <b>wholesale</b> <b>dealer</b> William (“Willy”) Huth (1877–1967), took over the business in 1904 and, a few years later, commissioned {{the replacement of the}} building by a new one on the same site. Running right through the block into Linkstraße, this new Weinhaus Huth was designed by the architects Conrad Heidenreich (1873–1937) and Paul Michel (1877–1938), and opened on 2 October 1912, and contained a wine restaurant on the ground floor, and wine storage space above, so it had {{to take a lot of}} weight. It was thus given a strong steel skeleton, which would stand the building in very good stead some three decades after its completion. Famous for its fine claret, numerous members of European society were made welcome there as guests. A total of 15 chefs were employed there, and Alois Hitler, the stepbrother of the future Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, was a waiter there in the 1920s, before he opened his own restaurant and hotel at Wittenbergplatz, in the western part of the city.|$|E
60|$|Now {{that always}} maddens me. Why should I be {{expected}} to know the price of gloves? I'm not a commercial traveller nor a <b>wholesale</b> <b>dealer,</b> and I don't look like one. Neither am I constitutionally parsimonious nor petty. I am a literary man, unworldly, and I wear long hair and a soft hat and a peculiar overcoat to indicate the same to ordinary people. Why, I say, should I know the price of gloves? I know they are some ordinary price--elevenpence-halfpenny, or three-and-six, or seven-and-six, or something--one of those prices that everything is sold at--but further I don't go. Perhaps I say elevenpence-halfpenny at a venture.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Kelly had, {{after her}} husband's death, added a small grocer's {{establishment}} to her inn.

Others remarked {{how easy it was}} to get credit in these days, and expressed a hope that the <b>wholesale</b> <b>dealer</b> in Pill Lane might be none the worse. However this might be, the widow Kelly kept her station firmly and constantly behind her counter, wore her weeds and her warm, black, stuff dress decently and becomingly, and never asked anything of anybody.|$|E

6000|$|So ended {{my first}} canvass: from causes that I shall {{presently}} mention, I made but one other application in person. This {{took place at}} Manchester to a stately and opulent <b>wholesale</b> <b>dealer</b> in cottons. He took my letter of introduction, and, having perused it, measured me {{from head to foot}} and again from foot to head, and then asked if I had any bill or invoice of the thing. I presented my prospectus to him. He rapidly skimmed and hummed over the first side, and still more rapidly the second and concluding page; crushed it within his fingers and the palm of his hand; then most deliberately and significantly rubbed and smoothed one part against the other; and lastly putting it into his pocket turned his back on me with an [...] "over-run with these articles!" [...] and so without another syllable retired into his counting house. And, I can truly say, to my unspeakable amusement.|$|E
60|$|Now you {{see that}} whole row of books which takes you at one sweep nearly across the shelf? I am rather proud of those, for they are my {{collection}} of Napoleonic military memoirs. There is a story told of an illiterate millionaire who gave a <b>wholesale</b> <b>dealer</b> an order {{for a copy of}} all books in any language treating of any aspect of Napoleon's career. He thought it would fill a case in his library. He was somewhat taken aback, however, when in a few weeks he received a message from the dealer that he had got 40,000 volumes, and awaited instructions as to whether he should send them on as an instalment, or wait for a complete set. The figures may not be exact, but at least they bring home the impossibility of exhausting the subject, and the danger of losing one's self for years in a huge labyrinth of reading, which may end by leaving no very definite impression upon your mind. But one might, perhaps, take a corner of it, as I have done here in the military memoirs, and there one might hope to get some finality.|$|E

60|$|But at last Mrs. Osgood's table-linen was finished, and Silas {{was paid}} in gold. His {{earnings}} {{in his native}} town, where {{he worked for a}} <b>wholesale</b> <b>dealer,</b> had been after a lower rate; he had been paid weekly, and of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of piety and charity. Now, {{for the first time in}} his life, he had five bright guineas put into his hand; no man expected a share of them, and he loved no man that he should offer him a share. But what were the guineas to him who saw no vista beyond countless days of weaving? It was needless for him to ask that, for it was pleasant to him to feel them in his palm, and look at their bright faces, which were all his own: it was another element of life, like the weaving and the satisfaction of hunger, subsisting quite aloof from the life of belief and love from which he had been cut off. The weaver's hand had known the touch of hard-won money even before the palm had grown to its full breadth; for twenty years, mysterious money had stood to him as the symbol of earthly good, and the immediate object of toil. He had seemed to love it little in the years when every penny had its purpose for him; for he loved the purpose then. But now, when all purpose was gone, that habit of looking towards the money and grasping it with a sense of fulfilled effort made a loam that was deep enough for the seeds of desire; and as Silas walked homeward across the fields in the twilight, he drew out the money and thought it was brighter in the gathering gloom.|$|E
