5|$|Christian baptismal {{theology}} {{prior to}} the Reformation taught that sacraments, including baptism, are means or instruments through which God communicates grace to people. The sacrament was considered valid regardless of who administered it. Not everyone who received a sacrament, however, received the grace signified by the sacrament. Some medieval theologians spoke of an obstacle of mortal sin which blocks the grace of the sacrament, while others insisted that the recipient be positively open and responding in faith to the sacrament {{in order to receive}} any benefit. Baptism <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by the Holy Spirit to transform the believer, and offered the benefits of remission of sins, regeneration, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The sacrament of penance <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> necessary for forgiveness for sins committed after baptism.|$|E

5|$|Once a vital ritual {{among the}} world's monarchies, coronations {{have changed over}} time {{for a variety of}} socio-political and {{religious}} factors; most modern monarchies have dispensed with them altogether, preferring simpler ceremonies to mark a monarch's accession to the throne. In the past, concepts of royalty, coronation and deity were often inexorably linked. In some ancient cultures, rulers were considered to be divine or partially divine: the Egyptian pharaoh <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the son of Ra, the sun god, while in Japan, the emperor <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a descendant of Amaterasu, the sun goddess. Rome promulgated the practice of emperor worship; in Medieval Europe, monarchs claimed to have a divine right to rule (analogous to the Mandate of Heaven in dynastic China). Coronations were once a direct visual expression of these alleged connections, but recent centuries have seen the lessening of such beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Originally, plantar {{fasciitis}} <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} plantar fascia.

As expected, there was no opposition to the landing on 4 November and work soon began on logistics facilities.|$|E
5|$|As {{the leader}} of the NCP, the largest party in parliament, Jyrki Katainen was tasked with forming a new {{coalition}} government.

Formal negotiations on government formation started after 24 April and the Kiviniemi government submitted its resignation on 29 April, starting to serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of limited}} data {{concerning}} gong music prior to European exploration, theories abound {{as to when}} the prototypes {{of what is now}} the kulintang came to be. One theory suggest that the bronze gong had an ancient history in Southeast Asia, arriving in the Malay archipelago two or even three thousand years ago, making its way to the Philippines from China in the 3rd century AD. Another theory lays doubt to the former claim, suggesting the kulintang could not have existed prior to the 15th century due to the belief that Javanese gong tradition, which is what the kulintang <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> derived from, developed only by the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the summer}} of 2009 and March 2010, the use of {{mephedrone}} grew rapidly in the UK, with it becoming readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, found {{it was the fourth}} most popular street drug in the United Kingdom, behind cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy. The drug was used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to both its availability and legality.|$|E
