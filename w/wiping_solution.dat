First part addresses current situation of surface <b>wiping</b> <b>solution.</b> Second part contains proposal of several solution options. Third part deals with construction solution of chosen variant. In the following part are figured out load parameters. Last part of thesis is dedicated to visualization and description of kinematics discharge arrangement...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectro-metric (HPLC-MS/MS) {{method was}} developed for the determination of mitomycin C, an anticancer drug, from contamination on various surfaces. Mitomycin C is often used in various forms of intraperitone-al chemotherapy, and operating room healthcare worker exposure to this drug is possible. The surface testing method consisted of a wip-ing procedure utilizing a solution of 20 / 45 / 35 (v/v/v) of acetonitrile– isopropanol–water made 0. 01 M in ammonium citrate (apparent pH 7. 0). The <b>wipe</b> <b>solutions</b> were analyzed by means of HPLC-MS/ MS using a reversed-phase gradient system and electrospray ioniza-tion in positive ion mode with a triple-quadrupole MS detector. Accuracy and precision of this method were demonstrated {{by a series of}} recovery studies of both spiked <b>solutions</b> and extracted <b>wipes</b> from various surfaces (stainless steel, vinyl and Formicaw) spiked with known levels of mitomycin C. Recoveries of spiked solutions contain-ing the analyte demonstrate mean recoveries (accuracy) ranged from 93 to 105 %. Precision as measured by the relative standard deviation (% RSD) of multiple samples (n 5 10) at each concentration level demonstrated values of 7. 5 % or less. The recoveries from spiked sur-faces varied from 30 to 99 %. The limit of detection for this method-ology is ∼ 2 ng/ 100 cm 2 equivalent surface area, and the limit of quantitation is ∼ 6 ng/ 100 cm 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Forest Products Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] are an increasingly important issue for all building materials, including wood. While washing with bleach is a commonly recommended method for removing molds, and the associated discolorations, there is surprisingly little information on the effectiveness of this treatment. The ability of mold removal treatments to brighten wood and eliminate fungi was assessed on Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) sapwood lumber heavily colonized with mold and sapstain fungi. The boards were subjected to different washing treatments: <b>wiping</b> with bleach <b>solution,</b> <b>wiping</b> with water, and a no-wash control. Samples were evaluated visually for changes in mold appearance and then fungi were isolated {{from the surface of the}} wood. Replicates from the various wash treatments were further treated with three biocide formulations. The effect of the mold control treatments on visual appearance and fungal diversity was assessed 1 month after treatment. Increasing bleach concentrations from 2. 5 up to 20 percent solution had no effect on the appearance of the wood following the wash treatment, nor did such treatments completely eliminate fungi from the wood surface. The chemical mold prevention treatments tested were not effective in sterilizing the wood, nor did they improve the visual appearance...|$|R

With simple reglazing, the furniture retains its good condition. The amount and frequency of reglazing required depends on location, usage and exposure to sun and rain. Clean: Wipe clean with a mild soapy <b>solution.</b> <b>Wipe</b> dry with a clean and dry cloth. Maintenance: Try to keep the furniture clean and dry. Tilt your furniture so that any water can drain away. Be aware of colour changing, small cracks and dry feelin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years we have {{witnessed}} an exponential growth in terms of networked computers and internet usage. This has led to the seamless fabric of interconnected computing and storage systems, mobile devices, software, wired and wireless networks, and related technologies. This pervasive, cost effective communication has enabled vast, constant flow of information that has transformed work environments and processes in nearly all walks of life, from government to business to research. While this trend is a welcome addition with new applications and services proliferating daily, it has spawn numerous security problems which, are threatening to wipe out all the growth achieved. These security threats have had major cost impact such as lower employee productivity, drain network resources, create financial losses and increase legal liability risks. In this paper we discuss existing and emerging security threats. We then show that unless purposeful measures are taken such as encouraging businesses to invest more in security, educate users and come up with new paradigms of solving these and emerging security problems all gains of interconnectivity will be <b>wiped</b> out. <b>Solutions</b> for mitigating current security threats are discussed and we extend the threat modelling process to address security challenges posed by internal users...|$|R
40|$|A no-risk {{approach}} for developing an Improved Waste Collection Subsystem (WCS) for the shuttle orbiter is described. The GE Improved WCS Concept {{builds on the}} experience of 14 Shuttle missions with over 400 man-days of service. This concept employs the methods of the existing flight-proven mature design, augmenting them to eliminate foreseen difficulties and to fully comply with the design requirements. The GE Improved WCS Concept includes separate storage for used wipes. Compaction of the <b>wipes</b> provides a <b>solution</b> to the capacity problem, fully satisfying the 210 man-day storage requirement. The added feature of in-flight serviceable storage space for the wipes creates a variable capacity feature which affords redundancy in the event of wipes compaction system failure. Addition of features permitting in-flight servicing of the feces storage tank creates a variable capacity WCS with easier post-flight servicing to support rapid turnaround of the Shuttle orbiter. When these features are combined with a vacuum pump to evacuate wipes and fecal storage tanks through replaceable odor/bacteria filters to the cabin, the GE Improved WCS satisfies the known requirements for Space Station use, including no venting to space...|$|R
