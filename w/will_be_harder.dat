25|$|Some criteria, such as {{economic}} benefit, {{will be more}} easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals, and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards {{a subset of the}} policy goals.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{also depends}} on the relative strengths of the team's batting and bowling. For instance in Test Cricket, a side with only fast bowlers may choose to bowl first {{to try to take}} advantage of any early moisture in the pitch, knowing that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to take wickets later in the match. Similarly a side with a weak opening batting pair may choose to bowl first in order to protect their batsmen.|$|E
25|$|Speaking at {{a conference}} {{organised}} by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library he added: The book {{is second only to}} the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented. A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind; it's the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity. Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at. And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E

2500|$|The lower realm (which {{the book}} later {{refers to as}} [...] "Hell") is cold, dark, and barren. Albert and Chris are able to use their minds to make their {{surroundings}} slightly more bearable, but Albert warns Chris that this <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to do the further they travel. They eventually reach a place occupied by people who were violent criminals while alive. Chris witnesses a series of dreadful sights and is gruesomely attacked by a mob, though he soon discovers that the attack occurred only in his mind.|$|E
2500|$|The Dutch {{now made}} a second attempt on Fontenoy, {{reinforced}} with Austrian cavalry and two battalions of British infantry, including the Highland Regiment. The Brigade of Dauphin {{were surprised by}} the irruption of these [...] "Highland furies, who rushed upon us with more violence than ever sea did when driven by a tempest." [...] However, concerted French fire drove the allied forces off again. This dispirited the Dutch who retired out of range and {{did not participate in}} the main attack. Along the French right flank the allies had been routed; but the battle was not yet over. On being congratulated by Monsieur de Bauffremont, Saxe simply replied, [...] "all is not said; let us go to the English, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to digest", and, at about 10:15, he abandoned his wicker carriage and mounted his famous white palfrey.|$|E
2500|$|The Wu generals said, [...] "When {{the enemy}} learns that the Grand Tutor (Zhuge Ke) is coming here personally, they will surely retreat {{when we reach}} the shore." [...] However, only Ding Feng had a {{different}} view, [...] "No. They are making large movements in their territory. They are prepared, as they have mobilised large numbers of troops from Xuchang and Luoyang, so why would they go back empty-handed? Don't think that the enemy won't come. We should ready ourselves for battle." [...] When Zhuge Ke reached Dongxing, he placed Ding Feng, Liu Zan (留贊), Lü Ju and Tang Zi {{in charge of the}} vanguard and they moved west along mountainous terrain. Ding Feng warned, [...] "We are moving too slow. If the enemy seizes favourable ground, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> to deal with them." [...] He then led 3,000 soldiers with him, travelling on a different route from the main bulk of Wu forces.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{opponents have}} been {{reluctant}} to seize upon Dean's privileged early life. UPI quoted one of Dean's friends in his youth as saying, [...] "By Hamptons standards, the Deans were not rich. No safaris in Africa or chalets in Switzerland. Howard's father went to work every day. He didn't own a company, or have a father or grandfather who founded one, as mine did." [...] Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal that [...] "he doesn't seem like a WASP. I know it's not nice to deal in stereotypes, but there seems very little Thurston Howell, III, or George Bush, the elder, for that matter, in Mr. Dean.... He seems unpolished, doesn't hide his aggression, is proudly pugnacious. He doesn't look or act the part of the WASP...It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> for Republicans to tag Mr. Dean as Son of the Maidstone Club than it was for Democrats to tag Bush One as Heir to Greenwich Country Day. He just doesn't act the part." ...|$|E
2500|$|By saying Double, the {{competition}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> because the round scores will be {{twice as much}} as the normal [...] round. The Three means 3 times as much as the normal [...] round and Four means four. The main purposes of saying [...] "Double or Four" [...] is to change the way of playing and increase points, since when the game is doubled (or more) points aren't divided, the team with most points takes all. If you were playing in [...] "locked" [...] "Double or Four", the one who says [...] "Double" [...] or [...] "Four" [...] has the option of locking or opening the Hokom. In case it's locked you can't use the Judged suit as a first card in any trick, you can only use them when you don't have the suit that the other player has played, or don't have any other suit to play as a first card in the trick. Otherwise, [...] "if its Three or Gahwa" [...] you can use any suit you want, even if it was the Judged suit.|$|E
