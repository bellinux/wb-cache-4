5|$|Most border units <b>were</b> <b>based</b> in forts as {{were their}} predecessors, the legions and {{auxiliary}} {{units of the}} Principate; {{in many cases they}} <b>were</b> <b>based</b> in the same forts. Some of the larger limitanei units (legiones and vexillationes) <b>were</b> <b>based</b> in cities, probably in permanent barracks. Because units of limitanei operated in one area, had their own camps, and often recruited from the same area, they tended to maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.|$|E
