40|$|Since plant mating {{choices are}} {{flexible}} and {{responsive to the}} environment, rates of spontaneous hybridization may vary across ecological clines. Developing a robust and predictive framework for rates of plant gene flow requires assessing the role of environmental sensitivity on plant reproductive traits, relative abundance, and pollen vectors. Therefore, across a soil moisture gradient, we quantified pollinator movement, life-history trait variation, and unidirectional hybridization rates from crop (Raphanus sativus) to wild (Raphanus raphanistrum) radish populations. Both radish species were grown together in relatively dry (no rain), relatively <b>wet</b> (<b>double</b> rain), or control soil moisture conditions in Ohio, USA. We measured wild and crop radish life-history, phenology and pollinator visitation patterns. To quantify hybridization rates from crop-to-wild species, we used a simply inherited morphological marker to detect F 1 hybrid progeny. Although crop-to-wild hybridization {{did not respond to}} watering treatments, the abundance of hybrid offspring was higher in fruits produced late in the period of phenological overlap, when both species had roughly equal numbers of open flowers. Therefore, the timing of fruit production and its relationship to flowering overlap may be more important to hybrid zone formation in Raphanus spp. than soil moisture or pollen vector movements...|$|R

60|$|Moving rapidly, and {{covering}} himself by {{a succession of}} rearguard skirmishes, De Wet danced like a will-o'the-wisp in front of and round the British columns. De Lisle, Fanshawe, Byng, Rimington, Dawkins, and Rawlinson were all snatching at him and finding him just beyond their finger-tips. The master-mind at Pretoria had, however, thought out a scheme which was worthy of De Wet himself in its ingenuity. A glance at the map will show that the little branch from Heilbron to Wolvehoek forms an acute angle with the main line. Both these railways were strongly blockhoused and barbed-wired, so that any force which was driven into the angle, and held in it by a force behind it, {{would be in a}} perilous position. To attempt to round De Wet's mobile burghers into this obvious pen would have been to show one's hand too clearly. In vain is the net laid in sight of the bird. The drive was therefore made away from this point, with the confident expectation that the guerilla chief would break back through the columns, and that they might then pivot round upon him and hustle him so rapidly into the desired position that he would not realise his danger until it was too late. Byng's column was left behind the driving line to be ready for the expected backward break. All came off exactly as expected. De <b>Wet</b> <b>doubled</b> back through the columns, and one of his commandos stumbled upon Byng's men, who were waiting on the Vlei River to the west of Reitz. The Boers seem to have taken it for granted that, having passed the British driving line, they were out of danger, and for once it was they who were surprised. The South African Light Horse, the New Zealanders, and the Queensland Bushmen all rode in upon them. A fifteen-pounder, the one taken at Tweefontein, and two pom-poms were captured, with thirty prisoners and a considerable quantity of stores.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that ants can acquire {{behavioral}} reactions by conditioning and by imitation. The aim of the present work was to examine if they could, through such learning processes, acquire never previously exhibited behavior or learn to use new methods. Myrmica ruginodis workers were successively confronted with solid sugar and water set apart, a double door shutting their sugar water tube entrance, or a thin cotton barrier plugging their nest entrance. Each time, they could not find an appropriate method to solve the problem. They were then presented with the ‘solution’, i. e. the sugar <b>wetted,</b> the <b>double</b> door slightly opened, and the cotton barrier partly removed. Thereafter, when again confronted with the initial situation, old ants could act appropriately to solve the problem. Ants can thus learn by conditioning and by imitation and can acquire through these processes novel methods or behavioral acts even if they are unable to innovate spontaneously by themselves, to improvise, or to behave correctly in an unknown situation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{automated}} wet and {{dry deposition}} collector utilising a wet-surface surrogate for dry deposition sampling is described. This has been used at two sites in NW England to attempt to establish {{wet and dry}} deposition fluxes {{of a range of}} polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) to natural water surfaces in the UK. The sample collection and analytical procedures are described. The wet flux of ΣPAH (n = 13) for the winter period is more than double that for summer/autumn at both sites. The pattern of PAH in the seasonally-averaged wet deposition data set stayed constant between seasons at the Castleshaw site, but not at Esthwaite Water. Both wet and dry deposition are found to be important to the overall atmospheric input at each site. The total (wet plus dry) input rises from summer/autumn to winter: from 74 to 258 ng (ΣPAH) · m− 2 · h− 1 at Esthwaite; from 128 to 164 ng (ΣPAH) · m− 2 · h− 1 at Castleshaw. The proportion of the total flux of ΣPAH due to <b>wet</b> deposition <b>doubles</b> at Castleshaw from summer/autumn to winter but decreases at Esthwaite from 65 to 40 %. Trends at the two sites may be explained by differences in the proximity of local point sources of PAH...|$|R

In an attempt to verify the role of oxides in nucleating iron-rich intermetallics, experiments have been conducted under conditions where in-situ entrained oxide films and deliberately added oxide particles were present.

The physical association of the Fe-rich intermetallic phases with these solid oxides, either formed in situ or added, is in accordance with the mechanism suggesting that iron-rich intermetallics nucleate upon the <b>wetted</b> sides of <b>double</b> oxide films...|$|R

40|$|Administration of {{estrogen}} (E) to immature chicks triggers the cytodifferentiation of tubular gland {{cells in the}} magnum portion of the oviduct epithelium; these cells synthesize the major egg-white protein, ovalbumin. Electron microscopy and immunoprecipitation of ovalbumin from oviduct explants labeled with radioactive amino acids in tissue culture were used to follow and measure the degree of tubular gland cell cytodifferentiation. Ovalbumin is undetectable in the unstimulated chick oviduct and in oviducts of chicks treated with progesterone (P) for up to 5 days. Ovalbumin synthesis is first detected 24 hr after E administration, and by 5 days it accounts for 35 % of the soluble protein being synthesized. Tubular gland cells begin to synthesize ovalbumin before gland formation which commences after 36 hr of E treatment. When E + P are administered together there is initially a synergistic effect on ovalbumin synthesis, however, after 2 days ovalbumin synthesis slows and by 5 days there is only 1 / 20 th as much ovalbumin per magnum as in the E-treated controls. Whereas the magnum <b>wet</b> weight <b>doubles</b> about every 21 hr with E alone, growth stops after 3 days of E + P treatment. Histological and ultrastructural observations show that the partially differentiated tubular gland cells resulting from E + P treatment never invade the stroma and form definitive glands, as they would with E alone. Instead, these cells appear to transform into other cell types-some with cilia and some with unusual flocculent granules. We present a model of tubular gland cell cytodifferentiation and suggest that a distinct protodifferentiated stage exists.

40|$|The {{configuration}} of CF 4 films condensed on a graphite single crystal (0001) surface {{has been observed}} by reflection high energy electrons diffraction (RHEED) and by {{low energy electron diffraction}} (LEED). The films exhibit a first order incomplete to complete wetting transition at 37 K, a temperature far below the CF 4 bulk triple point (89. 5 K). The structure of the film has been studied around the <b>wetting</b> temperature. The <b>double</b> layer structure is unstable against deposition of a third layer and loses its long range order. Upon further condensation the structure of the film is reorganized and gives well defined RHEED diffraction patterns featuring layer by layer condensation above 37 K and clustering below. LEED adsorption isotherms measured on graphite spots are used to characterize the second- and third-layer condensation between 51 and 58 K. The equilibrium vapour pressure vs. inverse temperature phase diagram is constructed from data obtained in this work and in the literature for 50 < T < 110 K and 5 × 10 - 8 < p < 50 torr.

40|$|The {{first step}} in the DNA {{profiling}} process is the recovery of DNA from the crime scene or item. Such surfaces can be varying with absorbent and non-absorbent surfaces. Ridged surfaces, such as those encountered on bottle-tops or firearms, are also common. Although low trace DNA or “touch DNA” is problematic in forensic casework, ridged surfaces should be a more effective surface for the recovery of such DNA due their abrasive nature. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate six recovery techniques; single <b>wet</b> swab, dry-wet <b>double</b> swab, wet-dry double swab, flocked swab, PCR square, and tape lifts. 36 falcon tubes with screw top lids were sterilised before DNA was deposited on the screw-top lids. Each of the recovery techniques were then utilised on 6 screw-top lids. All recovery media then underwent standard DNA extraction prior to DNA quantification by UV/Vis spectroscopy and quantitative PCR. The data indicated that the tape lifts recovered significantly more DNA from the ridged surface than the other techniques. There was no significant difference between the remaining 5 techniques, although on average, flocked swabs recovered the least amount. This suggested that the success in recovery of DNA is not down to the particular technique used, but down to the competence of the individual examiner and the amount of DNA deposited onto the surface...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{if there is an}} association of vitreous attachment and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema, and retinal vein occlusion. METHODS:: Systematic review and metaanalysis. RESULTS:: Sixteen of 1, 025 articles were eligible. In wet AMD, the prevalence of vitreomacular adhesion and posterior vitreous detachment was 23 % (654 eyes) and 41 % (251), respectively. Vitreomacular adhesion prevalence was 2. 15 times that of controls (95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 - 3. 48; p = 0. 002) and 2. 54 times that of dry AMD (confidence interval, 0. 88 - 7. 36; p 0. 09); posterior vitreous detachment prevalence was lower than controls (relative risk 0. 77; confidence interval, 0. 64 - 0. 93; p = 0. 007) and dry AMD (0. 56; confidence interval, 0. 27 - 1. 14; p = 0. 11). It was not possible to determine the prevalence of vitreous attachment in diabetic macular edema, but vitreomacular traction was present in 29 % of 188 surgical cases. The prevalence of posterior vitreous detachment in eyes with central and branch retinal vein occlusion was 30 % (56 eyes) and 31 % (71 eyes), respectively, versus 25 % (64 eyes) in controls. CONCLUSION:: Observational studies of sufficient quality indicate that eyes with <b>wet</b> AMD have <b>double</b> the expected prevalence of vitreomacular adhesion and are less likely to have a posterior vitreous detachment.

40|$|Questions: What are the {{long-term}} effects of climate change on the plant species composition and carbon sequestration in peat bogs? Methods: We developed a bog ecosystem model that includes vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics. Two groups of vascular plant species and three groups of Sphagnum species compete with each other for light and nitrogen. The model was tested by comparing the outcome with long-term historic vegetation changes in peat cores from Denmark and England. A climate scenario was used to analyse the future effects of atmospheric CO 2, temperature and precipitation. Results: The main changes in the species composition since 1766 were simulated by the model. Simulations for a future warmer, and slightly <b>wetter,</b> climate with <b>doubling</b> CO 2 concentration suggest that little will change in species composition, due to the contrasting effects of increasing temperatures (favouring vascular plants) and CO 2 (favouring Sphagnum). Further analysis of the effects of temperature showed that simulated carbon sequestration is negatively related to vascular plant expansion. Model results show that increasing temperatures may still increase carbon accumulation at cool, low N deposition sites, but decrease carbon accumulation at high N deposition sites. Conclusions: Our results show that the effects of temperature, precipitation, N-deposition and atmospheric CO 2 are not straightforward, but interactions between these components of global change exist. These interactions are the result of changes in vegetation composition. When analysing long-term effects of global change, vegetation changes should be taken into account and predictions should not be based on temperature increase alone...|$|R
30|$|Long-period fiber {{gratings}} (LPGs) {{have attracted}} much attention in optical communication systems and optical sensors because of their many advantages, such as low cost, ease of fabrication, and electromagnetic immunity [1 – 3]. Since the cladding modes coupled from the guided core mode in the LPGs are directly interfaced with external environments, the LPGs have high sensitivity to ambient perturbation change such as temperature, strain, and ambient index [1 – 3]. In general, UV excimer lasers and frequency-doubled argon lasers are conventionally exploited to fabricate the LPGs based on the variation of the photoinduced refractive index [1 – 3]. For specialty fibers without photosensitivity, such as photonic crystal fibers, however, {{it is not easy}} to induce the refractive index change with UV excimer lasers and frequency-doubled argon lasers. Recently, the LPGs inscribed on a dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF) by etching its silica-based cladding with the hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution after taking the metal coating process was proposed [4]. However, it is difficult to symmetrically deposit the metal layer on the silica-based cylindrical cladding of the DSF. In this paper, we propose a new fabrication technique of the micro-ridge long-period gratings (MRLPGs) using both <b>wet</b> etching and <b>double</b> polymer coating methods. In addition, a polarization-maintaining fiber (PMF), for the first time to our knowledge, is implemented to make the MRLPGs. The birefringence of the PMF generates two resonant peaks in the transmission spectrum of the PMF-based MRLPGs. The applied strain changes the extinction ratio of two resonant peaks but not their wavelengths because of the photoelastic effect. It means that the proposed PMF-based MRLPGs have the great potential for the application to strain sensors.|$|R
40|$|Semiarid karst landscapes {{represent}} an important ecosystem surrounding the Mediterranean Basin for which {{little is known}} on runoff generation. Knowledge of the sources and patterns of variation in infiltration-runoff processes and their controls is important for understanding and modelling the hydrological functions of such ecosystems. The objectives of this paper are to determine the infiltration rates and their controls in a representative mountain karst area (Sierra de Gádor, SE Spain) at micro-plots and to investigate the integrated response of rainfall on a typical hillslope. Rainfall simulations in micro-plots and natural rainfall-runoff monitoring on a hillslope were carried out complementarily. We investigated the role of soil surface components (vegetation, rock outcrop, fracture, and soil crust), topographic position, antecedent soil moisture, and rainfall characteristics in regulating infiltration-runoff processes. Results of rainfall simulation revealed the importance of vegetation cover {{and the presence of}} rock fractures in promoting the infiltration in the limestone karst landscape, while bare patches and rock outcrops acted as sources for runoff. All plots with > 50 % vegetation cover had no runoff with up to 55 mmh- 1 of simulated rain. In contrast, nearly all bare plots had runoff under the same simulated rain, with runoff coefficients ranging from 3. 1 to 20. 6 % on dry soil surface conditions, and from 2. 0 to 65. 4 % on wet soil surfaces. Runoff coefficients amounted to 59. 0 - 79. 5 % for rock outcrops without cracks, but were drastically reduced by the presence of cracks. The surfaces with rock fragments resting on the soil (generally located {{in the middle of the}} slopes) prevented more effectively the runoff generation than those surfaces where rock fragments were embedded in the top soil. Antecedent soil moisture had significant impact on runoff generation, with <b>wet</b> soil having <b>doubled</b> runoff coefficient, shortened time to runoff, and increased runoff rate compared to the same but dry soil. Linear regressions indicated that the main controls for constant infiltration rate were the cover percentages of vegetation and litter, plus rainfall intensity; while the major controls for runoff coefficient were the bare soil and vegetation coverage, plus rainfall intensity. High infiltration rates measured at the micro-plots agreed with low intra-event runoff coefficients (mostly below 1 %) observed under natural rainfalls at the hillslope. Runoff depth and coefficient at the hillslope was significantly correlated with rainfall depth, maximum hourly rainfall intensity and antecedent precipitation over 20 days (AP 20). During the 1. 5 -year monitoring period from Sep- 2003 to Mar- 2005, the overall infiltration was 41 % of the total rainfall amount and the maximum infiltration rate was almost 94 % of the largest single rainfall event. The results from this study contribute to improved understanding of the magnitude and controls of the surface runoff in semiarid karst mountain areas. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
