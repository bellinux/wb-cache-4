5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} canals and trajineras, {{the best known}} {{attraction}} in Xochimilco is the Dolores Olmedo Museum. This museum was once the home of socialite Dolores Olmedo. Before this, it was the main house of the La Noria Hacienda, established in the 17th century. Before she died, Ms. Olmedo decided to donate her house, much of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> and her art collection {{to the public as}} a museum. The buildings are surrounded by gardens planted with native Mexican species, around which wander peacocks. Another area houses a number of xoloitzcuintle dog. The museum’s collection includes about 600 pre Hispanic pieces, the largest collection of works by Diego Rivera at 140 pieces, {{as well as a number}} of works by Frida Kahlo and Angelina Beloff. It also contains rooms filled with furniture, items from many parts of the world and everyday items used by Olmedo and her family. In November, the museum set up a monumental altar to the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographer}} Pausanias {{records that}} Athena placed the infant Erichthonius {{into a small}} chest (cista), which she entrusted {{to the care of}} the three daughters of Cecrops: Herse, Pandrosos, and Aglauros of Athens. She warned the three sisters not to open the chest, but did not explain to them why or <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Aglauros, and possibly one of the other sisters, opened the chest. Differing reports say that they either found that the child itself was a serpent, that it was guarded by a serpent, that it was guarded by two serpents, or that it had the legs of a serpent. In Pausanias's story, the two sisters were driven mad by the sight of the chest's contents and hurled themselves off the Acropolis, dying instantly, but an Attic vase painting shows them being chased by the serpent {{off the edge of the}} cliff instead. Erichthonius was one of the most important founding heroes of Athens and the legend of the daughters of Cecrops was a cult myth linked to the rituals of the Arrhephoria festival.|$|E

Each of them carried a loose narrative thread that Dean did not continue for Tales from Topographic Oceans. The album's design was discussed during an in-depth conversation Dean and Anderson had in 1973 during the band's flight from London to Tokyo via Anchorage, Alaska, during the Close to the Edge tour. Prior to the flight, Dean had completed the front cover to The View Over Atlantis (1969) by John Mitchell, and [...] "the wives and girlfriends made a cake ... and we all had some.

Most importantly, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> for the learners, {{the community and the}} world? Teaching is a double-binded affair with yourself and with others (learners, colleagues and others). With every aspect of what you do the introspective and reflexive questioning and responses to why you teach how and what you teach has a historical and almost umbilical cord to your first days of teaching or even learning how to teach or becoming a teacher. Reflecting on these days may reveal much about the decision to teach or was it just an act of putting pen to the teacher degree application form because there was nothing else? Or was it – “My daughter has been working for an insurance company for five years and she is now unemployed.

This new kind of wardrobe has awareness of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Since it’s connected directly to online stores, one can use <b>it</b> to engage <b>in</b> “interactive shopping ” by selecting any physical item(s) from the wardrobe. For example, if you pick up a jacket and a pair of pants, it would look for matching shirts from the online marketplace. While you are not actively interacting with the wardrobe, the built-in screen becomes a window for personalized fashion show, which leisurely displays clothing products from various merchants that are potentially of interest to yo...|$|R

40|$|Why should {{developing}} nations provide stronger patent protection? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> for them? The {{purpose of this}} paper is to gauge some of the economic benefits of increased patent protection. Does increased patent protection, for instance, stimulate international diffusion of technology and productivity growth? This paper provides empirical evi-dence that suggests that it does. Until now, most studies investigating the economic effects of patent protection have <b>been</b> largely theoretical <b>in</b> nature or have assumed channels by which patent protection affects economic performance (See, for example, Diwan and Rodrik 1991; Helpman 1993; Taylor 1994). The empirical analysis of this chapter determines the extent to which patent protection matters to research and development (R&D) and to international patenting and, thus, to productivity growth. In-ternational patenting activity is an important source of the interna-tional diffusion of technology: it involves not only the diffusion o...|$|R

25|$|It {{is common}} to assume that {{buildings}} are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time.
