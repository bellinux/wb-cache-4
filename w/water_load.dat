25|$|A barrage dam is {{a special}} kind of dam which {{consists}} of a line of large gates that can be opened or closed to control the amount of water passing the dam. The gates are set between flanking piers which are responsible for supporting the <b>water</b> <b>load,</b> and are often used to control and stabilize water flow for irrigation systems.

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies in rats have suggested {{a role for}} renomedullary hyaluronan (HA) in water homeostasis. The gerbil {{is known for its}} unique ability to conserve water. In the present study renal papillary and intestinal HA were compared between groups of anaesthetized gerbils and rats before and after up to 6 h of i. v. <b>water</b> <b>loading.</b> Baseline papillary HA in gerbils was only 37 % of that in the rat. <b>Water</b> <b>loading</b> in rats increased the papillary HA content. Elevation was maximal (+ 27 %, P < 0. 05) after 2 h of <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> and then declined to control levels after 6 h of <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> (+ 3 %, n. s.). In contrast, the gerbil responded with a decreased papillary HA content during <b>water</b> <b>loading.</b> The depression was maximal after 2 h (- 49 %, P < 0. 05) and was still 41 % below the control values after 6 h (P < 0. 05). The urine flow rate increased rapidly in the rat and its maximum, 21 times above the control level (P < 0. 05), occurred at the HA peak, i. e. after 2 h of <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> while in the gerbil, the urine flow rate increased slowly and slightly and was only six times above control values after 6 h of <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> (P < 0. 05). The HA content along the intestine was similar in the two species: lowest in the duodenum and jejunum and highest in the distal colon. To conclude, in the rat, the elevation of papillary interstitial HA during acute <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> would counteract <b>water</b> reabsorption by changing the physico-chemical characteristics of the interstitial matrix favouring rapid water diuresis. This would work as a complement to the powerful regulation by ADH. The gerbil has a diametrically different regulation of papillary HA turnover during <b>water</b> <b>loading.</b> The decreased papillary HA level during <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> and the slow and small diuretic response may represent a genetic difference in adaptation to enhance the ability to conserve water in an arid environment...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) leads to kidney failure in half of those affected. Increased levels of adenosine 3 : 5 -cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) {{play a critical role}} in disease progression in animal models. <b>Water</b> <b>loading,</b> by suppressing arginine vasopressin (AVP) -stimulated cAMP production, is a proposed therapy for ADPKD. Design, setting, participants, &measurements: The effects of acute and sustained <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> on levels of urine osmolality (Uosm) and cAMP in 13 subjects with ADPKD and 10 healthy controls were studied. Uosm and cAMP concentrations were measured before and after <b>water</b> <b>loading.</b> Results: Urine [cAMP] indexed to Uosm significantly decreased with acute <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> in both groups (58 % in controls and 35 % in ADPKD). Chronic <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> resulted in a nonsignificant 13 % decrease in 24 -hour urine cAMP excretion in ADPKD participants, despite an increase in 24 -hour urine volume by 64 % to 3. 14 0. 32 L and decrease in mean Uosm by 46 %, to below that of plasma (270 21 mOsm/L). Conclusions: Increased water intake of 3 L per day decreased Uosm in most ADPKD subjects. While urine [cAMP] accurately reflects changes in Uosm during acute <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> in ADPKD subjects, chronic <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> did not lower 24 -hour urine cAMP excretion, although subjects with higher baseline [cAMP] (> 2 nmol/mg Cr) responded best. Decreases in urine [cAMP] and osmolality are consistent with decreased AVP activity. These results support the need for a larger study to evaluate the effect of chronic <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> on ADPKD progression...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the influence of <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> upon intraocular pressure (IOP), ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) and axial length. Twenty one young adult subjects who were classified based on their spherical equivalent refraction as either myopes (n= 11), or emmetropes (n= 10) participated. Measures of IOP, OPA and ocular biometrics were collected before, and then 10, 15, 25 and 30 minutes following the ingestion of 1000 ml of water. Significant increases in both IOP and OPA were found to occur following <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> (p< 0. 0001), with peaks in both parameters occurring at 10 minutes after <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> (mean ± SEM increase of 2. 24 ± 0. 31 mmHg in IOP and 0. 46 ± 0. 06 mmHg in OPA). Axial length was found to reduce significantly following <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> (p= 0. 0005), with the largest reduction in axial length evident 10 minutes after water drinking (mean decrease 12 ± 3 µm). A significant time by refractive error group interaction (p= 0. 048) was found in axial length, indicative of a different pattern of change in eye length following <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> between the myopic and emmetropic populations. The largest difference in axial length change was evident at 10 minutes after <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> with a 17 ± 5 µm reduction in axial length evident in the myopes and only a 6 ± 2 µm reduction in the emmetropes. These findings illustrate significant changes in ocular parameters in young adult subjects following <b>water</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The Contra Dam, {{commonly}} known as the Verzasca Dam and the Locarno Dam, is an arch dam on the Verzasca River in the Val Verzasca of Ticino, Switzerland. [...] The dam creates Lago di Vogorno [...] upstream of Lake Maggiore and supports the 105 MW Verzasca Hydroelectric Power Station hydroelectric power station. It was constructed between 1961 and 1965 and starting shortly after its reservoir was filled, a series of earthquakes related to its <b>water</b> <b>load</b> occurred until 1971. The dam is owned and operated by Verzasca SA and is the fourth tallest in Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|During what Dr. Giovanni Lombardi, the dam's designer, {{described}} as an [...] "exceptionally rapid rise of water during the first filling" [...] of the reservoir, beginning in August 1964, there were seismic shocks. The earthquakes began in May 1965 and the biggest shocks had occurred later in October and November after the reservoir was full. The epicenters were located at two faults near the dam. As many as 25 shocks occurred a day. The shocks stopped once the reservoir was emptied and no damage was found. After refilling, the shocks decreased and an [...] "equilibrium" [...] was {{believed to have been}} reached, one that did not respond to variations in <b>water</b> <b>load.</b> Another large shock occurred several years after filling. By 1971, there were no more seismic shocks around the dam or reservoir. No known detailed geological studies were conducted prior to construction of the dam and several faults are known to exist in the area.|$|E

50|$|The {{last term}} {{is the effect}} of <b>water</b> <b>loading.</b> Whereas {{evaporation}} is promoted by large numbers of small droplets, it only requires a few large drops to contribute substantially to the downward acceleration of air parcels. This term is associated with storms having high precipitation rates. Comparing the effects of <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> to those associated with buoyancy, if a parcel has a liquid water mixing ratio of 1.0 g kg−1, this is roughly equivalent to about 0.3 K of negative buoyancy; the latter is a large (but not extreme) value. Therefore, in general terms, negative buoyancy is typically the major contributor to downdrafts.|$|R
40|$|Anesthetized dogs {{receiving}} {{an infusion of}} chlorothiazide and ethacrynic acid were given 600 -ml infusions of distilled water or dilute dextrose solutions. The absolute rate of tubular sodium reabsorption was depressed, and the glomerular filtration rate was increased during the <b>water</b> <b>loading,</b> despite the associated decreases in plasma sodium concentration and decreases in the filtered load of sodium. The extent to which fractional sodium reabsorption decreased and the excretion of sodium increased was inversely related to {{the degree to which}} the filtered load of sodium was depressed as a result of the decreased plasma sodium concentration. We conclude that, in the presence of the diuretic blockade of distal tubular sodium reabsorption, infusion of water depresses proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium and that these changes are qualitatively similar to those previously observed during infusions of saline. Similar depression of tubular reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of sodium occurred during <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> in the absence of diuretics in dogs undergoing saline diuresis, which presumably provided a high rate of distal sodium reabsorption before <b>water</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dehydration {{heat and}} ionic {{conductivity}} {{of a series}} of homoionic alkali (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) and alkali rare-earth (Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +) exchanged montmorillonite (ref. CMS: SWy- 2) are investigated at low <b>water</b> <b>loading.</b> Dehydration heat is obtained via Van't Hoff's law applied to weight losses measured at several constant temperatures, i. e. treatment temperature (TT), as a function of time by thermo-gravimetric analysis. Dc conductivity is measured at various temperature using Complex Impedance Spectroscopy on samples whose the <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> is fixed by TT. Comparison with the dissociation enthalpy of alkali and alkali rare-earth cation/water complexes shows that dehydration heat montmorillonites results from the competition between opposite energy contributions due to: i) cation solvation, ii) hydration of the silicate interlayer surface and iii) structural swelling. So, depending on the balance between these various energy contributions, different behaviors are observed accordingly {{to the nature of the}} extraframework cation (EFC) with a perculiar behavior for K+. Independently on EFC, dc conductivity follows an Arrhenius behavior when the <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> is closed to zero. In contrast, this behavior is no longer observed as long as water molecules are adsorbed and, hence, in interaction with EFC. In that case, the results are well described by the empirical Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) form, i. e., suggesting order/disorder transition in the water/cation sub-network even at low hydration state. This outcome depends on EFC in accordance with dehydration heat. It is then shown that dc conductivity evolution with both temperature and <b>water</b> <b>loading</b> is a significant source of information regarding adsorption in connection with EFC...|$|R
