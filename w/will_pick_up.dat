25|$|Stock Rotation is the {{practice}} of changing the way inventory is displayed on a regular basis. This is most commonly used in hospitality and retail - particularity where food products are sold. For example, {{in the case of}} supermarkets that a customer frequents on a regular basis, the customer may know exactly what they want and where it is. This results in many customers going straight to the product they seek and do not look at other items on sale. To discourage this practice, stores will rotate the location of stock to encourage customers to look through the entire store. This is in hopes the customer <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> items they would not normally see.|$|E

For the 2011 season, Sun games were broadcast on Comcast Sports Net New England, with Mike Gorman as an announcer. In addition to Mike Gorman, broadcasters in the past have included Leah Secondo and Kara Wolters.|$|E
25|$|That night Saul is {{summoned to}} clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll (Uwe Lauer). Biedermann walks in and is ordered to write {{up a list of}} seventy names.

After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. Saul again looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun (Todd Charmont) approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun {{as a member of the}} Sonderkommando and sneaks him into the camp. When Saul arrives at the camp he is confronted by Abraham and realizes that during the turmoil in the woods he has lost the package. On further questioning, he says that the dead boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.|$|E

Strong winds <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> loose sand and topsoil and hurl it through the air at speeds ranging from [...] to [...] Such windblown sand causes {{extensive}} damage to plant seedlings because it ruptures plant cells, making them vulnerable to evaporation and drought. Using a mechanical sandblaster in a laboratory setting, scientists affiliated with the Agricultural Research Service studied the effects of windblown sand abrasion on cotton seedlings. The study showed that the seedlings responded to the damage created by the windblown sand abrasion by shifting energy from stem and root growth to the growth and repair of the damaged stems. After a period of four weeks {{the growth of the}} seedling once again became uniform throughout the plant, as it was before the windblown sand abrasion occurred.|$|E

500|$|The stages, {{based on}} various {{locations}} from the DC Universe, {{such as the}} Batcave, Metropolis, and Fortress of Solitude, feature interactive environments and multiple areas. If an opponent is hit with a heavy attack near {{a corner of the}} arena, it launches them, triggering a transition animation and taking the fight to a new section of the stage. Each section also contains objects that characters can interact with differently depending on their class. Characters fall into two classes: [...] "power characters", who rely on brute strength and innate abilities, and [...] "gadget characters", who use weapons, items, and other external mechanisms to win. For example, a gadget character like Batman can attach a bomb to a car to cause an explosion, while a power character like Superman <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the same car and smash his opponents with it.

In December 2015, OtherSide Entertainment, a studio founded by former Looking Glass Studios designer Paul Neurath, announced they were developing System Shock 3 with rights granted to them by Night Dive Studios. OtherSide had acquired rights to make sequels to System Shock some years before this point but did not have {{the rights to the}} series name, which Night Dive was able to provide. The sequel will feature Terri Brosius reprising her voice for SHODAN, and will include work from original System Shock concept artist Robb Waters. Warren Spector, the producer of the first System Shock, announced in February 2016 that he has joined OtherSide Entertainment and will be working on System Shock 3. According to Spector, the narrative <b>will</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> immediately from the end of System Shock 2, with SHODAN having taken over Rebecca's body. Starbreeze Studios is providing a $12 million [...] "publishing-only" [...] investment in System Shock 3, allowing Otherside to retain all rights while seeking a 120% return on investment followed by equal shares of revenue splitting. Starbreeze's investment will allow the game to be developed for consoles in addition to the planned personal computer versions.|$|E
