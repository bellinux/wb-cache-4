50|$|A {{number of}} exotic plants have become feral in the Park. The most visible impact {{is given by}} retamo, Spanish Broom Spartium junceum, syn. Genista juncea, also known as <b>Weaver's</b> <b>Broom,</b> a perennial, leguminous shrub native to the Mediterranean region, toxic to animals. It thrives on the sand fields around the Osorno, along the road from Ensenada to Petrohue and in Petrohue. Retamo is very pretty when in flower {{but it does not}} belong.|$|R
50|$|Shrubs in {{the park}} are goat willow (Salix caprea), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), Chinese photinia (Photinia serratifolia), laurestine (Viburnum tinus), {{strawberry}} tree (Arbutus unedo), English dogwood (Philadelphus coronarius), European holly (Ilex aquifolium), salt cedar (Tamarix), <b>weaver's</b> <b>broom</b> (Spartium junceum), scarlet firethorn (Pyracantha coccinea), blackberry (Rubus), Australian laurel (Pittosporum tobira), butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), tree heath (Erica arborea), Japanese privet (Ligustrum japonicum), green olive tree (Phillyrea latifolia), dog-rose (Rosa canina) and common medlar (Mespilus germanica).|$|R
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} from the 16th century that acolytes would place a dancing egg on the fountain of the Barcelona Cathedral's cloister. To accomplish this, the egg would have been emptied, with wax used to fill the hole and add some weight. When placed over a water jet from a fountain, the egg starts turning without falling, and thus [...] "dances." [...] Generally, fountains with a dancing egg are also decorated with seasonal flowers and fresh fruits, like cherries, which cover the bowl of the fountain, as well as <b>weaver's</b> <b>broom</b> and carnations.|$|R
2500|$|While {{other peoples}} and nations have a [...] "national bird" [...] or a [...] "national flower", Catalonia {{does not have}} {{much in the way}} of tongue-in-cheek popular {{established}} symbols, even though the yellow <b>weaver's</b> <b>broom</b> (Spartium junceum) has often been regarded as such in literature, specially in combination with red poppies. The [...] "ruc català" [...] or [...] "burro català" [...] (Catalan donkey) is a relatively recent creation when the need was felt to produce something Catalan to oppose to the Central Spanish Osborne bull, widely perceived by Catalans as a centralistic symbol, alien to their culture.|$|R

50|$|Apart from grain farming, {{the people}} of Kandel carried on {{extensive}} truck-farming and viniculture on 150 acres of garden land; the fruit orchards that covered over 275 acres produced excellent crops of apricots, plums, and cherries for home consumption and for the market. Kandel also had 77 artisans and craftsmen who produced a variety of agricultural implements in iron and wood; there were also many basket <b>weavers</b> and <b>broom</b> makers.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} {{lies on the}} Fulda in {{the triangle}} defined by the towns of Bad Hersfeld, Bebra and Rotenburg an der Fulda. The municipal area lies {{on the edge of}} the Seulingswald (range) and stretches along the Rohrbach and Endersbach (brooks) into the eastern Knüllgebirge (range). The Rohrbach empties into the Fulda near Reilos. The Rohrbach valley is also known as the Besengrund (“Broom Ground” or “Besom Ground”), a reference to basket <b>weavers</b> and <b>broom</b> makers. In centuries gone by, these were common occupations.|$|R
