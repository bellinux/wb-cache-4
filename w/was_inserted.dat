5|$|There is {{an ornate}} {{semi-circular}} wooden ceiling with smaller panels along the ridge, moulded ribs and carved bosses, and brattished cornice each side above {{a row of}} little fan-vaults separating seven half-round panels with shield-bearing angels. The ceiling is finely finished with bosses {{at the intersection of}} the moulded principals and purlins. It <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> in 1882–84.|$|E

5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a paper on several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E
5|$|By the 13th century, {{the church}} had a stone-built nave and chancel; the latter survives in the present building, as does a 12th-century font which was {{probably}} taken from the building in place at that time. A chancel arch <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> between the nave and chancel in about 1300. The dedication to Saint Margaret is later: it was first recorded in 1489.|$|E
5|$|For the WB's 2004–2005 {{prime time}} schedule, Carey co-produced {{and starred in}} Drew Carey's Green Screen Show, a {{spin-off}} of Whose Line Is It Anyway?. It was canceled by the WB, but picked up shortly afterward by Comedy Central. The show's premise relied {{on the use of}} a green screen for all of the actors' improv interactions. Animation on the screen <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> during post-production.|$|E

In all other {{cases in the}} present tense however, such as present or present, /Ø/ will <b>be</b> <b>inserted.</b> This <b>is</b> a use of underspecification, {{the idea that there is}} a ‘default’ morpheme that <b>is</b> <b>inserted</b> in the general case, and more specific morphemes that <b>are</b> <b>inserted</b> in more specific cases, when their featural specifications are met. In the above example, /Ø/ is underspecified in the sense that it is not specified for person. Underspecification relies on the ‘Maximal Subset Condition.’ ...|$|R

Schultz suffered congestive heart failure on November 14, 2011, which required hospital care. He died on November 26, 2011, aged 78.|$|E
5|$|Seiderman {{worked with}} Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a {{flexible}} skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread.

5|$|Substantial {{alterations}} {{appear to}} have taken place {{during the early years of}} Samuel Egerton's ownership in the mid-18th century. The canopy at the dais end of the Great Hall was destroyed– although part of it can still be seen in the north wall– when a floor <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> and new rooms were formed with lath and plaster partitions. The east wing of the hall was probably demolished at about the same time, but certainly before 1812, the date of the earliest estate map.|$|E

It depicts the Transfiguration of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was designed by Seddon and installed in 1884. There are other stained glass windows, including the three western lancets, filled with stained glass by the parishioners in 1894, {{in memory of the}} Reverend John Pugh, curate 1856–1861 and vicar 1861–1893.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pilot remained unaired, {{although some}} footage {{from the original}} pilot {{was used in the}} first aired episode. This includes Sansa's scenes with Catelyn (Michelle Fairley's footage as Catelyn <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> over Jennifer Ehle's performance), Will's ride through the woods (retained though also portrayed by a different actor), most of the feast at Winterfell, and Ned and Robert's scene in the crypt. That scene is one of a few to be filmed on 35 mm film, and consequently slight film grain {{can be seen in the}} HD version of the episode.|$|E
5|$|When the Cassini {{spacecraft}} flew by Jupiter in 2000, it conducted coordinated measurements with Galileo. New Horizons passed {{close to}} Jupiter in 2007, {{carrying out a}} unique investigation of the Jovian magnetotail, traveling as far as 2500RJ along its length. In July 2016 Juno <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> into Jupiter orbit, its scientific objectives include exploration of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere. The coverage of Jupiter's magnetosphere remains much poorer than for Earth's magnetic field. Further study is important to further understand the Jovian magnetosphere's dynamics.|$|E

5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E
5|$|Benzema {{began his}} {{football}} career at his hometown club Bron Terraillon SC {{at the age}} of eight. While at the club, he was nicknamed Coco by friends and, after scoring two goals in an under-10 match against the Lyon youth academy, began attracting attention from the biggest club in the city. According to Serge Santa Cruz, who was president of Bron Terraillon in the 1990s, Lyon officials had visited him directly in an attempt to sign the youngster; however, Santa Cruz refused. After talking with Benzema's father, the club allowed the player to undergo a trial with Lyon. Following the trial, Benzema officially joined Lyon and <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> into the club's academy.|$|E

5|$|Due to his red card {{suspension}} in the World Cup, Gourcuff missed two call-ups to {{the national}} team in August and September. In October 2010, he was called back into the team by his former manager at Bordeaux Laurent Blanc for UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Romania and Luxembourg. In the match against Romania, Gourcuff appeared as a substitute and scored the final goal in the team's 2–0 victory. He <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> into the starting lineup against Luxembourg and responded by assisting on the opening goal scored by Karim Benzema and scoring the second goal in another 2–0 win.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007–08 season, {{with the}} likes of Florent Malouda, John Carew and Sylvain Wiltord all departing from the club, Benzema {{switched}} to the number 10 shirt and <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> into the lead striker role. After forming a special relationship with new manager Alain Perrin, he responded with 31 goals in 51 games. He topped the league with 20 goals, scored four goals in the Champions League, one in the Coupe de la Ligue and totaled six goals in six Coupe de France matches, helping Lyon win their first ever double. Some of his more dazzling performances that season included a hat-trick against Metz on 15 September, an equalizing goal in the 90th minute from a free kick against Derby du Rhône rivals Saint-Étienne, and a goal against Lens that was nominated for goal of the season by fans.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Stafford {{stopped by}} Shepard's office {{and told him}} that an {{otologist}} in Los Angeles had developed a cure for Ménière's disease. Shepard flew to Los Angeles, where he met with Dr. William F. House. House proposed to open Shepard's mastoid bone and make a tiny hole in the endolymphatic sac. A small tube <b>was</b> <b>inserted</b> to drain excess fluid. The surgery was conducted in early 1969 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Los Angeles, where Shepard checked in under the pseudonym of Victor Poulos. The surgery was successful, and he was restored to full flight status on May 7, 1969.|$|E
