[...] "Something that 20 or 30 years from now, parents could play for their kids and say, 'This is what I was listening to when I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> Check it out, it’s still fucking cool.' We {{wanted to make a}} record you could pass down. There’s a lot of music out now that doesn’t feel like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, when I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I was fighting a war', but in the end he grinned and said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' {{returned}} John, 'one and sixpence. When I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I {{had never}} seen so much money, in a heap. A shilling of it is in case of accidents--the mare casting a shoe, or the like of that. The other sixpence is to spend in the diversions of London; and the diversion I recommend {{is going to the}} top of the Monument, and sitting there. There's no temptation there, sir--no drink--no young women--no bad characters of any sort--nothing but imagination. That's the way I enjoyed myself when I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cheer up! You {{will break}} your neck yet! When I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I {{remember}} feeling it deeply that I {{was not allowed}} to risk the lives of others." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't talk in that way, child, for heaven's sake! you do read such books--they {{give you}} such ideas of everything. I declare when your aunt and I <b>were</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> we {{knew nothing about}} wickedness. I think it was better so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I {{would make}} an effort to keep you." [...] And her {{companion}} looked at her gravely. [...] "When I say I should like to <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I mean with your qualities--frank, generous, sincere like you. In that case I should have made something better of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There it is, Littlepage," [...] exclaimed Guert, with {{a species}} of sigh; [...] "I shall have nothing but iced looks for the next week, and all for riding down hill {{four or five years}} later than is the rule. Everybody, hereabouts, uses the hand-sled until eighteen, or so; and I am only five-and-twenty. Pray, what may <b>be</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> my dear fellow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The proper time's no time, sir,' {{repeated}} John Willet; 'when I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I never talked, I {{never wanted}} to talk. I listened and improved myself that's what I did.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Bernardin is {{also noted}} for his {{interest}} in the concern of young adults, which was in part evidenced by his involvement in the nascent Theology on Tap lecture movement in the early 1980s.

[...] "If I could only begin again--if I could have my life before me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are young}} enough {{to respond to the}} appeals that {{sometimes}} find me silent. If I <b>were</b> of <b>your</b> <b>age</b> I should certainly investigate some of these interesting problems." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You're right," [...] said Val suddenly; [...] "but things aren't {{what they}} were when I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age.</b> There's a 'Tomorrow we die' feeling. That's what old George meant about my uncle Soames. HE doesn't mean to die tomorrow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I daresay you haven't {{had much}} practice,' said the Queen. 'When I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age,</b> I always {{did it for}} half-an-hour a day. Why, {{sometimes}} I've believed {{as many as six}} impossible things before breakfast. There goes the shawl again!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] she replied. [...] "All {{young people}} boast of their health. When I <b>was</b> <b>your</b> <b>age</b> every thought of illness was {{as black as}} a visitation of the devil. That's the door where we must lay all such evils, isn't it, Mr Pellew?" ...|$|E
