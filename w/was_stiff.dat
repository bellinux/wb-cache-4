5|$|Pope Pius II's {{crusade against}} the Ottoman Empire was {{declared}} in November 1463. Skanderbeg, {{the leader of}} the Albanians, was a vital ally to this effort and would have become one of its main leaders. The Venetians, who had also joined the crusade, could not persuade Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's lukewarm ally in northern Albania, to join until the pope intervened. Furthermore, the major European powers were reluctant to join the pope's crusade. Among those inquired were the city of Florence, Francisco Sforza of Milan, Louis XI of France, and Ferdinand I of Naples, all of whom declined for their own reasons. The Republic of Venice, however, decided to aid Skanderbeg by sending 500 cavalry and 500 infantry under the condottiero Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto. Once the campaign season began, Mathias Corvinus of Hungary recaptured many of the Bosnian strongpoints, including Jajce, which had been taken from the Kingdom of Bosnia by the Ottomans. Mehmed II marched into Bosnia, pillaging the countryside, hoping that his enemies would surrender. The Hungarian resistance, however, <b>was</b> <b>stiff.</b> The Ottomans still managed to make headway against the Hungarians who had been trying to lift Ottoman the siege on Jajce with a ruse. The Sultan continued his siege while Mathias escaped from the fortress with a force of men, but the retreating army was harried with two-hundred soldiers being captured and sent to Constantinople for execution. Despite the setback, Jajce held out and Mehmed retreated from Bosnia.|$|E

Once {{considered}} one of the best rivalries in women's tennis, the competition between Williams and Capriati <b>was</b> <b>stiff</b> with 12 out of their 17 meetings going to three sets. The rivalry, starting in 1999, started off one sided with Capriati winning four of their first five matches. Serena would then go on to win the next eight.

25|$|Consistent {{with her}} early career, Cox's style leaned more toward {{vaudeville}} than blues. She had a less powerful and less rugged voice than her better-known contemporaries Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, but {{she held her}} audiences spellbound with the fiery spirit of her delivery. At {{the height of the}} classic female blues era, competition <b>was</b> <b>stiff,</b> with numerous talented blueswomen performing, and Cox's singing was only part of her act. Nevertheless, as her career developed, she assumed and embodied the title bestowed on her, “The Uncrowned Queen of the Blues”. Onstage, she exuded a glamorous sophistication and confidence that captivated her fans. She also embellished her stage presence with a stylish wardrobe, which often included a tiara, cape and rhinestone wand.|$|E

500|$|Kimberella had a dorsal {{integument}} {{that has}} been described as a non-mineralized [...] "shell"; in the larger specimens this reached up to 15cm in length, 5to7cm in width, and was 3to4cm high; the smallest specimens are only about 2–3mm long. The shell <b>was</b> <b>stiff</b> but flexible, and appears to have been non-mineralized, becoming tougher as it grew larger (and presumably thicker) in more mature specimens. [...] The deformation observed in elongated and folded specimens illustrates that the shell was highly malleable; perhaps, rather than a single integument, it consisted of an aggregation of (mineralized?) sclerites. At its highest point was a hood-like structure, forming what is thought to be the front. In some specimens, the inner surface of the shell bears stripes spanning the width of the creature; these may represent the attachment sites of muscles. Similar stripes around the edge of the shell may have been connected to muscles involved in retracting the muscular foot into the shell.|$|E
500|$|This comment {{illustrates}} {{well the}} general nature of Szigeti's reception by both critics and fellow musicians: while his musical insights, intellect, {{and depth of}} interpretation were almost universally lauded, the purely technical aspect of his playing was awarded a more mixed reaction. His tone in particular {{seems to have been}} occasionally uneven from performance to performance. A 1926 recital review in The New York Times, for example, laments that ... his performance <b>was</b> <b>stiff</b> and dry in its observance of letter and its absence of spirit ... Mr. Szigeti was not only inclined to dryness of tone and angularity of phrase, but there were also passages of poor intonation. In contrast, a review from the previous year in the same journal remarked after a performance of the Beethoven concerto that Mr. Szigeti has a rather small but beautiful tone, elegance, finish. He played with a quiet sincerity which grew upon the audience, though not with the virility and sweep that other violinists find ... it is clear that Mr. Szigeti is a player to command esteem and respect for his musicianship, for the genuineness of his interpretations, and his artistic style.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the critics}} and film historians who have {{reviewed}} The Quatermass Xperiment {{in the years}} since it release have been John Baxter who said, in Science Fiction in the Cinema (1970), [...] "In its time, The Quatermass Experiment was a pioneering sf film... Brian Donlevy <b>was</b> <b>stiff</b> but convincing... Much of the film is saved, however, by Richard Wordsworth... one of the finest such performances since Karloff's triumphs of the Thirties.” This view was echoed by John Brosnan in The Primal Screen (1991): [...] "One of the best of all alien possession movies", he wrote, [...] "Not since Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster has an actor managed to create such a memorable, and sympathetic, monster out of mime alone". Bill Warren in Keep Watching The Skies! (1982) found that [...] "the buildup is slightly too long and too careful" [...] but also said, [...] "It's an intelligent, taut and well-directed thriller; it showcases Nigel Kneale's ideas well; it's scary and exciting. It was made by people who cared about what they were doing, who were making entertainment for adults. It {{is still one of the}} best alien invasion films". Steve Chibnall, writing for the British Film Institute's Screenonline, describes The Quatermass Xperiment as [...] "one of the high points of British SF/horror cinema." [...] The horror fiction writer Stephen King praised the film as one of his favourite horror movies from between 1950 and 1980 in his non-fiction book Danse Macabre (1991). The film director John Carpenter, who later collaborated with Nigel Kneale on the film [...] (1982), has claimed that The Quatermass Xperiment [...] "had an enormous, enormous impact on me – and it continues to be one of my all-time favourite science-fiction movies." ...|$|E

Wayne Nelson, the group's Californian, generated more heat in his two lead vocal turns. The three-part harmonies behind Shorrock were exemplary, although the CS parallels were unmistakable. Lead guitarist Stephen Housden reinforced the emphasis on melody with his clean, lyrical lines." ...|$|E

Accordingly, the Act was passed on 10 August 1882; as well as the main line, it authorised branches from Pontrhydyfen to Aberavon and Port Talbot. The Cwmavon Tramway was to be acquired by the new company.|$|E

2500|$|While {{people have}} been ice skating for centuries, figure skating {{in its current form}} {{originated}} in the mid-19th century. A Treatise on Skating (1772) by Englishman Robert Jones, is the first known account of figure skating. Competitions were then held in the [...] "English style" [...] of skating, which <b>was</b> <b>stiff</b> and formal and bears little resemblance to modern figure skating. American skater Jackson Haines, considered the [...] "father of modern figure skating", introduced a new style of skating in the mid-1860s. This style, which incorporated free and expressive techniques, became known as the [...] "international style." [...] Although popular in Europe, Haines' style of skating was not widely adopted in the United States until long after his death.|$|E

Same happened with [...] "What You Won't Do for Love": Jackson said Yamin was sharp, Abdul liked it and Cowell said he was pretty good because the style suit him although it was not the best song in the world.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape produced by the then-drummer of Fear and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI. Irons and Slovak, however, decided to leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers in order to pursue a [...] "more serious" [...] future with rock band What Is This? Flea ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. He and Kiedis hired drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Irons's and Slovak's places, respectively. Andy Gill, formerly of Gang of Four, agreed to produce their first album. Gill and Sherman clashed with Flea and Kiedis; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album's production. Flea himself felt that the album <b>was</b> <b>stiff</b> and [...] "a big mistake", but also admitted [...] "we [...] were just disrespectful and obnoxious". The band's eponymous debut album, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, was released on 10 August 1984 to largely poor critical and commercial review. After a relatively unfruitful tour, Sherman was fired in early 1985. Slovak, who had been contemplating a return to the Chili Peppers, rejoined the group after being encouraged by Flea.|$|E

2500|$|In her memoirs, {{she wrote}} {{of her time}} at the Odéon: [...] "It was the theater that I loved the most, and that I only left with regret. We all loved each other. Everyone was gay. The theater was a like a {{continuation}} of school. All the young came there... I remember my few months at the Comédie Française. That little world <b>was</b> <b>stiff,</b> gossipy, jealous. I remember my few months at the Gymnase. There they talked only about dresses and hats, and chattered about a hundred things {{that had nothing to}} do with art. At the Odéon, I was happy We thought only of putting on plays. We rehearsed mornings, afternoons, all the time. I adored that." [...] Bernhardt lived with her longtime friend and assistant Madame Guerard and her son in a small cottage in the suburb of Auteuil, and drove herself to the theater in a small carriage. She developed a close friendship with the writer George Sand, and performed in two plays that she authored. She received celebrities in her dressing room, including Gustave Flaubert and Leon Gambetta. In 1869, as she became more prosperous, she moved to a larger seven-room apartment at 16 rue Auber in the center of Paris. Her mother began to visit her for the first time in years, and her grandmother, a strict Orthodox Jew, moved into the apartment to take care of Maurice. Bernhardt added a maid and a cook to her household, as well as the beginning of a collection of animals; she had one or two dogs with her at all times, and two turtles moved freely around the apartment.|$|E
