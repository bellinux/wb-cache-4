The Corvette division approached Lotus {{with the idea}} of developing the world's fastest production car, {{to be based on the}} C4 generation Corvette. With input from GM, Lotus designed a new engine to fit in place of the L98 V8 that was powering the standard C4. The result was what GM dubbed the LT5, an aluminum-block V-8 with the same bore centers as the L98, but with four overhead camshafts, 32 valves. Lotus also designed a unique air management system for the engine to provide a wider power band by shutting off 8 of the 16 intake runners and fuel injectors when the engine was at part-throttle, while still giving the ZR-1 [...] when at <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>throttle.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} {{specifically}} {{to analyze the}} performance and emission level produced by small duty spark ignition gasoline engine by using different types of octane number fuel and brands. This analysis involves an engine dynamometer for engine performance and using automobile exhaust gas analyzer for emissions testing. For performance engine analysis, the engine first is tested by using dynamometer with different type of octane rating fuels and brands. By using the results several performance graph can be obtained such as the brake power, torque, {{brake mean effective pressure}} (bmep) and brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc). Then, the emission test was also being performed to analyze and compare the data of emission level produced by the engine by plotting the according graph. This performance and emission test was conducted with vehicle on <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>throttled</b> in various load and ambient temperature by using the engine dynamometer and gas analyzer. Three different type of octane rating fuel and brands has been used which is RON 95 and RON 97 from brand „X‟,„Y‟ and „Z‟. The result shows that RON 97 fuel seems to be more advanced in terms of performance than RON 95 fuel but produced slightly higher carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon. The introduction of various ambient temperatures did not give any significant impact to the performance and emissions of the engine respectively. Further experimental testing can be done for better output result such as using chassis dynamometer which can obtain more accurate result...|$|R

Methods: The engine has been operated at a single engine speeds of 3500 RPM with 50 % of <b>Wide</b> <b>Throttle</b> <b>Open</b> (WTO). The potential of energy recovery was measured by means of engine effective power, Water Heat Losses (WHL) and Exhaust Heat Losses (EHL).

2500|$|Though {{inspired}} by, {{and positioned}} directly against, the Corvette, Ford billed the Thunderbird {{as a personal}} car, putting {{a greater emphasis on}} the car's comfort and convenience features rather than its inherent sportiness. The Thunderbird sold exceptionally well in its first year. In fact, the Thunderbird outsold the Corvette by more than 23-to-one for 1955 with 16,155 Thunderbirds sold against 700 Corvettes. With the Thunderbird considered a success, few changes were made to the car for 1956. The most notable change was moving the spare tire to a continental-style rear bumper in order to make more storage room in the trunk and a new 12 volt electrical system. The addition of the weight at the rear caused steering issues. Among the few other changes were new paint colors, the addition of circular porthole windows as standard in the fiberglass roof to improve rearward visibility, and a [...] Y-block V8 making [...] when mated to a 3-speed manual transmission or [...] when mated to a Ford-O-Matic 2-speed automatic transmission; this transmission featured a [...] "low gear", which was accessible only via the gear selector.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{the effect of the}} {{ignition}} timing on the output parameters of a spark-ignition engine. The main assessed parameters include the output parameters of the engine (engine power and torque), cylinder pressure variation, heat generation and burn rate. However, the article also discusses the effect of the ignition timing on the temperature of exhaust gases, the indicated mean effective pressure, the combustion duration, combustion stability, etc. All measurements were performed in an engine test room in the Department of Technology and Automobile Transport at Mendel University in Brno, on a four-cylinder AUDI engine with a maximum power of 110 kW, as indicated by the manufacturer. To control and change the ignition timing of the engine, a fully programmable Magneti Marelli control unit was used. The experimental measurements were performed on 8 different ignition timings, from 18 °CA to 32 °CA BTDC at <b>wide</b> <b>throttle</b> <b>open</b> and a constant engine speed (2500 rpm), with a stoichiometric mixture fraction. The measurement results showed that as the ignition timing increases, the engine power and torque also increase. The increase in these parameters is a reflection of higher pressure in the cylinder, the maximum value of which is achieved at a higher ignition timing near top dead centre in thepower stroke. In these conditions we can expect higher engine efficiency. It was also found that the combustion is more stable with a higher value of ignition timing. No significant difference was found in the combustion duration...|$|R

50|$|Because of low vacuum at high RPM, {{reports of}} {{unintended}} acceleration are {{often accompanied by}} complaints of failed or weakened brakes, as the high-revving engine, having an <b>open</b> <b>throttle,</b> is unable to provide enough vacuum to power the brake booster. This problem is exacerbated in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions as the vehicle will automatically downshift upon application of the brakes, thereby increasing the torque delivered to the driven-wheels {{in contact with the}} road surface.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>throttle</b> is <b>opened</b> up {{slightly}} from the fully closed position, the throttle plate uncovers additional fuel delivery holes behind the throttle plate {{where there is a}} low pressure area created by the throttle plate/Valve blocking air flow; these allow more fuel to flow as well as compensating for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the <b>throttle</b> is <b>opened,</b> thus smoothing the transition to metering fuel flow through the regular <b>open</b> <b>throttle</b> circuit.|$|R
5000|$|For <b>open</b> <b>throttle</b> {{operation}} {{a richer}} mixture will produce more power, prevent pre-ignition detonation, {{and keep the}} engine cooler.

50|$|The {{accelerator}} pump {{is also used}} to prime the engine with fuel prior to a cold start. Excessive priming, like an improperly adjusted choke, can cause flooding. This is when too much fuel and not enough air are present to support combustion. For this reason, most carburetors are equipped with an unloader mechanism: The accelerator is held at <b>wide</b> <b>open</b> <b>throttle</b> while the engine is cranked, the unloader holds the choke open and admits extra air, and eventually the excess fuel is cleared out and the engine starts.|$|E
