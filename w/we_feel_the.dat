500|$|Plans for {{creating}} Tron: Legacy began to materialize in 2005, when Walt Disney Studios hired screenwriters Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal as writers for the film. The two had recently finished writing {{the script for}} Warrior. According to Variety columnist Michael Fleming, Klugman and Sternthal felt [...] "that the world has caught up to Lisberger's original concept". Klugman said of the precedent film: [...] "It was remembered not only for story, but a visual style that nobody had ever used before. We are contemporizing it, taking ideas that were {{ahead of the curve}} and applying them to the present, and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> film has a chance to resonate to a younger audience." ...|$|E
500|$|Shinoda {{was greatly}} {{inspired}} by both rock and hip-hop acts {{when he was}} a child. He grew up listening to Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, N.W.A, and Juice Crew, and later Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, The Roots and Aphex Twin. Other influences and favorites of Shinoda's include Led Zeppelin, Run–D.M.C., The Beatles, Rage Against the Machine, Purity Ring, Arctic Monkeys and Santigold. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shinoda explained, [...] "People just want junk food. They want throw-away junk food music that's going to make them lethargic and fat. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> same way about music. We want to hopefully move even more into being able to make more substantial music. We're definitely paying attention to the substance and the nuance, and we hope to make something that's really cutting edge and really different." ...|$|E
500|$|Achtung Baby was U2's {{first album}} {{in three years}} and their first {{comprising}} entirely new material in over four years. The group maintained a low profile after the record's release, avoiding interviews and allowing critics and the public {{to make their own}} assessments. Instead of participating in an article with Rolling Stone magazine, U2 asked Eno to write one for them. The marketing plan for the album focused on retail and press promotions. In addition to television and radio advertisements being produced, posters featuring the sleeve's 16images were distributed to record stores and through alternative newspapers in major cities. Compared to the large hype of other 1991 year-end releases, the marketing for Achtung Baby was relatively understated, as Island general manager Andy Allen explained: [...] "U2 will not come out with that kind of fanfare in terms of outside media. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> fan base itself creates that kind of excitement." ...|$|E

The ad prompted some negative comments but Kraft stood by their promotion stating [...] "Kraft Foods has a proud history of celebrating diversity and inclusiveness. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> Oreo ad is a fun reflection of our values." [...] The Gay Pride ad was followed during 2012 {{by a series of}} ads commemorating other holidays and events, including a red, white and blue cream Oreo for Bastille Day, a stream of cookie crumbs for the appearance of the Delta Aquarid meteor shower, and a cookie with a jagged bite taken out of it for Shark Week.|$|E
2500|$|Abkhazia said {{it would}} not take part in the [...] "Geneva Talks on Security and Stability in the Caucacus" [...] in June 2010 because of {{concerns}} over the objectivity of the co-chairmen who were representatives of the UN, the EU, and OSCE. A spokesman said [...] "Our proposals are being ignored, discussions on the non-renewal of war are being procrastinated, instead secondary questions are being discussed. Thereupon <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> co-chairmen have no real proposals, and we want to give them time till September to prepare a document, concerning security, and acceptable for all sides. The Geneva discussions are necessary, and it is normal that each party voices its position, but the mediators must be neutral and non-biased.

2500|$|In 2006 the Oklahoma Highway Patrol (OHP) {{converted}} a seized Hayabusa into a pursuit vehicle, {{setting up}} the bike with equipment including a radar unit, police lights and siren, and painting it in official colors and insignia. Impressed with the positive response from {{the public and the}} motorcycling community, the OHP purchased two more Hayabusas, to supplement their main fleet of Harley-Davidson police motorcycles. While they are used for patrol, the primary function of the Hayabusas is public relations and community outreach, due to the kind of attention the exotic bikes attract. According to the OHP, [...] "There are clear lines dividing sportbike and cruiser motorcycle riders. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> sportbike community has not been given the proper amount of attention and focus in the area of community involvement and rider safety education." ...|$|E

While speaking of the damage that could be caused, Lopez said: [...] "I think [...] if it's not a real thing. I've been in relationships where they were kind of unstable, and so the media messed with it a lot." [...] The overexposure from the media and public interest in their relationship resulted in less admiration for their work and negatively affected their careers.|$|E
