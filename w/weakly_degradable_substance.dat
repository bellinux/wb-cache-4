40|$|A {{suspension}} {{membrane reactor}} for selective biological elimination of badly <b>degradable</b> <b>substances</b> from mixed waste water is described {{and has been}} tested in the laboratory scale. By applying nanofiltration only the badly <b>degradable</b> <b>substances</b> are retained in the bioreactor for further biodegradation. The influence of concentration profiles and hold-up time on biodegradation was studied with 3 -chlorobenzoic acid as the model compound and sodium acetate as an additional carbon source. The advantages of the new reactor type are demonstrated by comparison with an air-lift loop-type bubble column. Characterization of the filtration step reveiled that the biofilm formation on the filtration membrane leads to a strong reduction of permeability. For industrial processes a decoupling of filtration and bioreactor is recommended.

Although more work {{has to be done}} to standardize the test and to get regulatory acceptance (e.g. a ring test involving different laboratories), we believe that the AnBUSDiC test has several advantages compared to the common screening tests: it is a simulation rather than a screening test (i.e. it determines the ultimate degradability under conditions that are relevant for detergent ingredients), it shows if the surfactant under consideration is degradable, non-degradable or inhibitory at the tested concentration, and it is readily available at many municipal waste water treatment plants.|$|R

In {{the case of}} DEET, 95 % of the substance is discharged via municipal wastewater treatment plants [45]. No information was found about the amounts reaching the environment through direct inputs from leisure activities. DEET was detected in all analyzed influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants in Germany {{as well as in}} surface waters used for human activities [25].

Correspondingly, it was assumed for other insect repellents that the discharge is highest in summer, between June and September. DEET removal rates in sewage treatment plants varied between 0 % and 90 % depending on the concentrations in the influents, probably due to the adaptation of the sludge organisms.

The quantum chemistry calculation and the canonical variational transition state theory are employed to investigate the mechanism and kinetic property. Besides addition and abstraction, oxidation pathways and further conversion pathways are also considered. The OH radicals could degrade triclosan to phenols, aldehydes, and other easily <b>degradable</b> <b>substances.</b> The conversion mechanisms of triclosan to the polychlorinated dibenzopdioxin and furan (PCDD/Fs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are clearly illustrated and the toxicity would be strengthened in such pathways. Single radical and diradical pathways are compared to study the conversion mechanism of dichlorodibenzo dioxin (DCDD). Furthermore, thermochemistry is discussed in detail. Kinetic property is calculated and the consequent ratio of kadd/ktotal and kabs/ktotal at 298. 15 K are 0. 955 and 0. 045, respectively. Thus, the OH radical addition reactions are predominant, the substitute position of OH radical on triclosan is very important to generate PCDD and furan, and biradical is also a vital intermediate to produce dioxin...|$|R
30|$|Ring {{testing of}} other {{anaerobic}} biodegradation {{methods such as}} the European Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) test [9] used a validity criterion of more than 40 % biodegradation to exclude anomalous results produced by poor test conditions (except where toxic/inhibitory effects were identified). Application of this criterion to this set of results identifies a number of anomalous results that might be eliminated {{as a result of}} substandard test conditions. In addition to the results discussed, applying this criterion would also remove the result for isoFA + 7 EO (of 23.9 %) from laboratory 6. Whilst this result was not identified as anomalous by the laboratory, it is over a factor of 2 lower than the mean result from the other laboratories. In the absence of any other scientific observations, this result could indicate poor test conditions, e.g. a sludge inoculum with a microbial community poorly suited to the degradation of this substance; however, this is an uncontrollable variable which contributes to the overall variation associated with this test method. It is also of note that the ECETOC validity criterion was used to exclude anomalous values for readily <b>degradable</b> <b>substances</b> only and therefore cannot be applied here regardless.|$|R

40|$|Knowledge of {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} distribution of pesticide concentrations is essential for pesticide registration. In field experiments performed during the registration procedure, suctions cups are widely used to monitor the evolution of pesticide leaching over time and to calculate the mean concentration for a given drainage period. Until now, {{there has been no}} detailed information regarding whether soil water sampling by suction cups is suitable for accurately predicting the field-scale leaching of pesticides in heterogeneous soils. To address this, we performed a numerical study to evaluate the uncertainties associated with suction cup sampling in heterogeneous soils under atmospheric boundary conditions using two pesticides with contrasting sorption and degradation properties. To address the two main operation modes of suction cup sampling, continuous and weekly sampling were analyzed. First, the variability of pesticide breakthrough concentrations was analyzed for a single pesticide application in a physically heterogeneous soil profile. Second, a 10 -yr time series was used to analyze repeated pesticide applications, and estimate variability in the leached mass fraction (LMF) and mean concentrations. In both cases, pesticide break-through was compared to the breakthrough of an inert tracer. The results indicate that for a single pesticide application, pore water velocities varied only slightly for all operation sampling modes and compounds. On the other hand, the total extracted mass and LMF varied greatly, suggesting that the acceleration of the breakthrough sampled by suction cups {{plays an important role in}} terms of LMF and the mean concentration, especially for <b>degradable</b> <b>substances.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

The resin begins to show some discoloration, possibly due to oxidation after 10 - 15 cycles but performance is not affected. There was no apparent accumulation of a thermally degrad-able residual after repeated determination of real well water and treated water samples with an XAD- 4 minicolumn. However, surface waters would probably require special care, probably including prefiltering, to avoid the accumulation of thermally <b>degradable</b> <b>substances</b> which might interfere with subsequent analyses (with the same XAD- 4 minicolumn). But, {{it should also be}} noted that the cost of producing the minicol-umns is quite low, making them potentially disposable if reconditioning is deemed impossible. Conclusions The thermal desorption method is simple and effective; it should be attractive for monitoring major gas-chromato-graphable impurities in water. The absolute detection levels of the method are limited mainly by impurities that come from the resin. The experimental XAD- 4 resin from Rohm and Haas was significantly better in this respect than their other XAD resins. Samples containing model organic compounds as low as 0. 1 ppb were analyzed successfully with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 or greater. The ability to resolve the components of a complex sample could of course be improved by using a capillary column instead of a packed GC column. The authors hope to adapt the procedure for use with a capillary column. Nevertheless, the existing procedure seems quite practical for getting a general idea of the level of organic impurities and for monitor-ing the concentration of major gas-chromatographable constituents...|$|R

30|$|Specifically, the {{combination}} of target analysis and in vitro bioassays uncovered (1) a reduction in cytotoxic potential between sampling site 4 and 6 mainly attributed to dilution by additional water inputs, (2) no substantial dilution and only little or no loss occurred between sampling sites 6 and 9, suggesting that (3) the consistent effect patterns and cytotoxic potential at the sampling sites 6, 7, 8 and 9 was primarily caused by the discharge of poorly <b>degradable</b> <b>substances</b> from the WWTP. This study showed {{the combination}} of these two complementary approaches to be a suitable way to identify input sources of organic micropollutants and to trace changes in the water quality along the Ammer River. Furthermore, the implementation of this combined approach into comprehensive, mass flux-based investigations of reactive transport may be promising to further elucidate and distinguish between different in-stream transformation and loss processes. The Ammer river is a 4 th order stream with an extraordinarily high base flow. Hence, the water quality situation is very much dependent on local and possibly highly fluctuating inputs. It is likely that seasonal changes will impact on the input of pesticides and the WWTP effluent may have a higher contribution to the overall flow under dry summer conditions. Such seasonal effects will be investigated in future studies. Benchmarking against other surface water studies and comparison with tentative EBTs already provides an indication that we need {{to pay more attention to}} lower order streams because unlike in large higher order streams like the Danube river, where even the release of untreated sewage hardly results in the exceedance of EBTs due to the high dilution factor [15]; in the Ammer, the impact of the WWTP was still noticeable at a few sampling sites below the inflow. Despite being situated in an active agricultural area, this study has not registered a major chemical impact from agriculture. This might be partially due to sampling in late summer after the end of the major spraying activities but also because the bioassays targeted more effluent-derived micropollutants. Herbicide- and insecticide-specific bioassays should complement the test battery for a better differentiation between urban and agricultural impact.|$|R

It is apparent that laboratory 3 appeared to suffer consistently lower results for the test substances {{compared to the other}} laboratories, which suggests that the sludge inoculum may have been less active. The AnBUSDiC test shows a greater degree of reproducibility than the DIN 38414 part 8 and ISO 11734 anaerobic methods [4, 5, 9]. Issues during the DIN 38414 part 8 test with unspecific sludge degradation leading to degradation values over 100 % were to a large extent solved with the two phase test design of the AnBUSDiC test. However, mean degradation values of over 100 % were still encountered in the second test phase with FA+ 7 EO and FAS, albeit to a lesser extent. The 1 st phase addition of test substance appears to have released most of the organic carbon ‘trapped’ in the sludge (via the solubilising action of the surfactant test item), the two phase design was implemented to reduce this unspecific degradation during the second phase addition (however, some still occurs) [5]. Using a two-phase addition of test substance (rather than three dosings) was deemed a compromise between the test length and the potential to overestimate test substance degradation. It was therefore expected that highly <b>degradable</b> test <b>substances</b> would display values close to or over 100 %; however, values in some tests did exceed 120 %.

40|$|Models {{describing}} {{transport of}} <b>degradable</b> organic <b>substances</b> in a porous medium require {{parameters of the}} biodegradation kinetics that {{can be obtained from}} batch degradation assays. It is rarely assessed if liquid batch biodegradation rates allow extrapolation to reactive transport in a porous medium, i. e. if the cell specific activity in a porous medium with flow-through is identical to that of pelagic cells in liquid cultures. Failure of model predictions can be used to identify the rate-limiting processes in the reactive transport. Column data of anaerobic trichloroethene (TCE) transport and degradation at three flow rates were predicted with a model using biodegradation kinetics derived from a liquid culture. The extent of dechlorination at the column outlet was very well predicted within a factor 1. 4 if the specific microbial biomass in the columns was used as an input parameter. This suggests that potential mass transfer limitations in biofilms or differences in microbial ecology between batch and column had minor effects on dechlorination. The model was subsequently extended with Monod kinetics to predict both biomass growth and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbon (CAH) degradation in the columns using liquid batch data. These models largely overestimated CAH dechlorination unless microbial transport with cell elution was included and unless a slight batch to column adjustment was made to better predict microbial biomass. With 4 adjustable parameters the model succeeded in predicting the microbial numbers within a factor 4. 3 and the extent of dechlorination within a factor 1. 2. Our analysis validates the batch to column extrapolation for this dedicated set-up provided that the microbial biomass in columns is well predicted.

40|$|The Three Gorges Dam {{is located}} in the upper stream of the Yangtze River (Yichang, China) and is the biggest dam in the world. Since 2008, the {{corresponding}} Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) covers an area of 58, 000 km 2 in total and a water surface area of more than 1, 080 km 2. Anti-seasonal water flood events create water-level differences of 30 m (with 145 m in summer and 175 m in winter, sea level). These events considerably influence the distribution patterns of biotic (e. g. vegetation) and abiotic (e. g. nutrients and pollutants) in the TGR area. Thus, growing concern has emerged regarding environmental contamination and ecology in the TGR region. In this area, overpopulation, intensive industrial activities, and agriculture contribute to a high pollutant load of the river and due to the yearly submersions also of the surrounding land. In order to better understand the current environmental conditions of the TGR region, a field survey on the vegetation pattern, plant biomass and the pesticide residues in soil was carried out in the summer of 2012. Field investigation demonstrated that the vegetation in the littoral zone of TGR mainly consists of annual and perennial herbaceous plants; eight species were considered as dominant species, which are Cynodon dactylon, Bidens pilosa, Polygonum hydropiper, Setaria viridis, Digitaria sanguinalis, Echinochloa crusgalli, Hemarthria altissima and Xanthium sibiricum. The water fluctuation resulted in the even distribution of the vegetation with the average plant biomass 1332 ± 896 g/m 2, which is somewhat higher than that of the non-flooded area (175 - 180 m; 979. 4 ± 1168. 8 g/m 2). Concerning the pesticide residues in soil of the littoral zone, 81 compounds in total were screened but all concentrations were below the limit of detection (LOD). From these plants, three species (C. dactylon, B. pilosa and Nelumbo nucifera) and two duckweeds (Lemna gibba and L. minor) were selected for investigating the fate of the widely used rice herbicide propanil in hydroponic plant systems, in cell suspension cultures {{as well as in the}} axenic plants. Studies were executed with 14 C-ring-labelled propanil. The main achieved results were:(1) In hydroponic plant systems, all tested plants were capable to degrade the herbicide propanil, with the uptake of 12. 46 ± 1. 63 % (C. dactylon), 52. 36 ± 6. 38 % (N. nucifera) and 76. 55 ± 6. 07 % (B. pilosa) of the applied radioactivity (AR) after 7 days exposure, among which the extractable fractions were 4. 73 ± 1. 10 %, 13. 84 ± 1. 50 % and 28. 60 ± 0. 93 % of AR, respectively, and the 14 C-compounds in the plant and the corresponding medium extractable fractions were confirmed by radio-TLC, radio-HPLC and GC-MS as propanil, 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (DCA) and N-(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) -β-D-glucopyranosylamine (Glu-DCA). The non-extractable residues (NER) fractions were 7. 73 ± 1. 50 % (C. dactylon), 38. 52 ± 4. 94 % (N. nucifera) and 47. 94 ± 5. 54 % (B. pilosa) of AR after 7 days, and the final mineralization product 14 CO 2 among these systems was formed in trace amounts (< 0. 05 %). (2) In aseptic plants (L. minor and L. gibba) treated with 14 C-propanil for 12 days, 8 % of AR were taken up by both (L. minor 7. 9 ± 0. 4 %, L. gibba 8. 4 ± 0. 9 %). The major portion of radioactivity in both plants was extractable (7 % of AR) and the radioactive compounds were identified also as propanil, DCA and Glu-DCA by the methods mentioned above. (3) The uptake of propanil by cell suspension cultures of C. dactylon and L. minor increased with time. 10. 59 ± 2. 19 % of AR was absorbed by C. dactylon in 48 h (cell extract 9. 5 %; NER fractions 1. 08 %), then the uptake increased to 39. 22 ± 9. 39 % of AR in 72 h with the corresponding cell extractable and non-extractable fractions amounting to 33. 03 % and 6. 19 %, respectively. With respect to the L. minor cell suspension culture, 65. 04 ± 1. 72 % of AR was taken up in 7 days (cell extract 53. 82 %; NER fractions 11. 21 %). The identified compounds in cell cultures are consistent with the tested plants; in addition, 6 ’-O-malonyl-N-(β-D-glucopyranosyl) - 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (Mal-Glu-DCA) was only detected in the L. minor cell suspension culture and was confirmed by analogy. According to the results presented above, propanil is taken up to a certain degree by these plants examined. Consequently, the fate of propanil residues in plants after their death and decomposition was examined. For that purpose, 14 C-propanil was pre-absorbed by seedlings (B. pilosa), and then the plants were either (treatment a, PT assays) directly submerged in TGR water for 90 days or (treatment b, EPT assays) pre-extracted with organic solvents and, subsequently only the insoluble materials containing the pesticide non-extractable residues (NER) fractions were incubated in TGR water for 90 days. Thereby the decomposition processes of the plant tissue as well as of the plant NER fractions were studied in parallel. Results indicated that after plant’s death, considerable amounts of the pesticide residues taken-up by plants including non-extractable residues were released into the TGR water (29. 36 ± 5. 58 % of AR after 90 days). Highest release rates of 14 C-pesticide residues including NER fractions were observed earlier than those of plant natural <b>degradable</b> <b>substances</b> (the latter determined by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the water phase). The radioactivity compounds released from the decaying plants were confirmed as propanil, DCA and Glu-DCA, which are in line with that in hydroponic plant systems. Most of the remaining portions in the plant tissue resembled still non-extractable residues (NER: 40. 36 ± 7. 30 % of AR after 90 days). As tested in the EPT assay, NER released from plant tissues amounted to 6. 00 ± 0. 37 % of AR after 90 days and the corresponding compounds were identified as the same as those in the extractable fractions. All tested plants were able to degrade the herbicide propanil to a certain degree; therefore I consider these dominant plants as potential species for phytoremediation of propanil in the TGR area. However, it has to be considered, that plants decaying in the water after death will release besides plant natural materials also absorbed xenobiotics incl. NER into the aquatic ecosystem. This fact, not reported before, should be taken into account in the environmental risk assessment of pesticides...|$|R
