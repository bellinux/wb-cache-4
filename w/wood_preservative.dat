Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps.

40|$|Effect of <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> (waterborne and organicborne) on the {{performance}} of surface finishing properties is investigated. Sapwood of scots pine, (Pinus sylvestris L.), oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky), and chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) specimens (300 × 100 × 15 [*]mm along the grain) were impregnated with aqueous solution of 2 % CCA, 2 % Tanalith E, 1 % boric acid, and Immersol aqua. Surface roughness, dry film thickness, adhesion strength, gloss measurement, scratch, and abrasion resistance were determined according to related standards for treated and untreated samples. The results indicated that surface roughness and adhesion strength depended on wood species and the chemical composition of <b>preservatives.</b> Generally, waterborne <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> increased the surface roughness of wood while the organic-based <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> decreased it.

30|$|As a {{substitute}} for high-cost copper azole (CuAz) and alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ) <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives,</b> alternative <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> were formulated with okara, which is an organic waste from the production of tofu, and copper chloride and/or borax. Each preservative was used in treatment of wood blocks in a reduced-pressure method to measure its treatability. The treated wood blocks were placed in hot water for 3 days to examine {{the stability of the}} preservatives against hot-water leaching. The preservatives successfully penetrated into wood blocks, probably due to the use of ammonium hydroxide as a dissociating agent. However, the stability of okara-based preservatives dropped as the concentration of acid in the solutions used for hydrolysis of okara increased. The treatability and leachability of the preservatives were not affected by hydrolysis temperature but were negatively affected by the addition of borax. Leached wood blocks treated with okara-based preservatives and exposed to decay fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum and Postia placenta over 12 weeks showed good decay resistance. Okara-based <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives</b> can protect <b>wood</b> against fungal attack as effectively as CuAz, and have potential for use as environmentally friendly <b>wood</b> <b>preservatives.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{market economy}} {{was based on}} extracting and {{processing}} natural resource and agricultural products for local consumption, such as mining, gristmills and sawmills, and the export of agricultural products. The most important agricultural exports were raw and processed feed grains (wheat, Indian corn, rice, bread and flour) and tobacco. Tobacco was a major crop in the Chesapeake Bay region and rice a major crop in South Carolina. Dried and salted fish was also a significant export. North Carolina was the leading producer of naval stores, which included turpentine (used for lamps), rosin (candles and soap), tar (rope and <b>wood</b> <b>preservative)</b> and pitch (ships' hulls).

25|$|Even though {{creosote}} is pressurized {{into the}} wood, {{the release of}} the chemical can be seen from many different events. During the lifetime of the marine piling, weathering occurs from tides and water flow which slowly opens the oily outer coating and exposes the smaller internal pores to more water flow. Frequent weathering occurs daily, but more severe weather, such as hurricanes, can cause damage or losening of the wooden pilings. Many pilings are either broken into pieces from debris, or are completely washed away during these storms. When the pilings are washed away, they come to settle {{on the bottom of the}} body of water where they reside, and then they secrete chemicals into the water slowly over a long period of time. This long term secretion is not normally noticed because the piling is submerged beneath the surface hidden from sight. The creosote is mostly insoluble in water, but the lower molecular weight compounds will become soluble the longer the broken wood is exposed to the water. In this case, some of the chemicals now become water-soluble and further leach into the aquatic sediment while the rest of the insoluble chemicals remain together in a tar-like substance. Another source of damage comes from insects such as Shipworms and Limnoria. Though creosote is used as a pesticide preservative, studies have shown that Limnoria is resistant to <b>wood</b> <b>preservative</b> pesticides and can cause small holes in the wood which creosote can then be secreted from.|$|E
