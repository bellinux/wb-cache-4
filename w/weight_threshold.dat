50|$|This gross <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> is a {{significant}} constraint {{on the design of}} wrapped cable systems as it effectively limits the length of optical cable that can be installed in one piece. Longer lengths of cable add weight in 3 ways - the drum of cable is heavier because it contains more cable; the counterweight is heavier to balance the heavier drum; the machine needs to be bigger and stronger to carry the increased loads and to resist the increased forces involved in wrapping a heavier drum. Small increases in cable length become significant because of this ‘triple-whammy’ effect.|$|E

5000|$|If a photon packet has {{experienced}} many interactions, for most applications the weight {{left in the}} packet is of little consequence. As a result, {{it is necessary to}} determine a means for terminating photon packets of sufficiently small weight. A simple method would use a threshold, and if the weight of the photon packet is below the threshold, the packet is considered dead. The aforementioned method is limited as it does not conserve energy. To keep total energy constant, a Russian roulette technique is often employed for photons below a certain <b>weight</b> <b>threshold.</b> This technique uses a roulette constant m {{to determine whether or not}} the photon will survive. The photon packet has one chance in m to survive, in which case it will be given a new weight of mW where W is the initial weight (this new weight, on average, conserves energy). All other times, the photon weight is set to 0 and the photon is terminated. This is expressed mathematically below: ...|$|E

Two fundamental aspects are studied: achieving faster convergence and nding higher quality clustering solutions. This work introduces several improvements to the EM clustering algorithm, being periodic M steps during initial iterations, reseeding of low weight clusters and splitting of high weight clusters the most important. These improvements lead to two important parameters. The rst parameter is the number of M steps per iteration and the second one, a <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> to reseed low-weight clusters. Experiments show how frequently the M step must be executed and what <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> values make EM reach higher quality solutions.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} initiation of reproductive diapause was explored {{in a population}} of the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina from the Australian wet/dry tropics.

The dormancy status of males was unresolved, with sperm present throughout the year, a strategy that may enable them {{to take advantage of}} unpredictable female activity. The diapause response in females was modified by the weight of developing larvae, with pupae below a critical <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> (0. 72 g) failing to enter diapause as adults, regardless of the photoperiod experienced during development. Even above the <b>weight</b> <b>threshold,</b> 100 % diapause did not occur, with a small number of females (18 %) developing directly, regardless of weight and photoperiod.

40|$|Mathematical {{analysis}} of a population model with an age–weight structured two-stage life history: asymptotic behavior of solutions Eva Sá nchez, Moulay L. Hbid and Rafael Bravo de la Parra Abstract. In this paper, we propose {{a model for the}} dynamics of a physiologically structured population of individuals whose life cycle is divided into two stages: the first stage is structured by the weight, while the second one is structured by the age, the exit from the first stage occurring when a threshold weight is attained. The model originates in a complex one dealing with a fish population and covers a large class of situations encompassing two-stage life histories with a different structuring variable for each state, one of its key features being that the maturation process is determined in terms of a <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> to be reached by individuals in the first stage. Mathematically, the model is based on the classical Lotka–MacKendrick linear model, which is reduced to a delayed renewal equation including a constant delay that can be viewed as the time spent by individuals in the first stage to reach the <b>weight</b> <b>threshold.</b> The influence of the growth rate and the maturation threshold on the long-term behavior of solutions is analyzed using Laplace transform methods. 1...|$|E

However, little is known on the capacity of extra-molting to evolve in natural populations, which limits {{our understanding of how}} selection acts on nymphal growth. We used a multi-generational pedigree, individual monitoring and quantitative genetics models to investigate the evolution of extra-molting and its impact on nymphal growth in a solitarious population of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria. Growth compensation via extra-molting was observed for 46 % of the females, whose adult weight exceeded by 4 % that of other females, at a cost of a 22 % longer development time. We found a null heritability for body <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> only, and the highest and a strongly female-biased heritability for extra molting. Our genetic estimates show that (1) directional selection can act on growth rate, development time and extra-molting to optimize body <b>weight</b> <b>threshold,</b> the target of stabilizing selection, (2) extra-molting can evolve in natural populations, and (3) a genetic conflict, due to sexually antagonistic selection on extra-molting, might prevent its fixation. Finally, we discuss how antagonistic selection between solitarious and gregarious environments and/or genetic correlations between growth and phase traits might also impact the evolution of extra-molting in locusts.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, states have {{utilized}} weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology to reduce delay and increase enforcement of overweight vehicles. Usually a threshold value {{is used to}} filter and sort the trucks by weight. If the WIM reading of a truck is over the threshold, the truck {{would be sent to}} a static scale for further inspection. To fully utilize the WIM technology and enhance the operational efficiency at WIM sites, the authors devised a dynamic <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> (DWT) algorithm. The threshold value is increased when the queue at the weigh station is long so as to avoid the closure of the weigh station while still catch the worst weight limit offenders. The threshold value is lowered when the queue at the station is short to maximize the number of trucks inspected. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the design and operations of the dynamic <b>weight</b> <b>threshold</b> algorithm. A microscopic simulation model based on a real-world ramp WIM weigh station site was first developed and calibrated. Subsequently the dynamic threshold adjustment strategy was modeled and tested. The results show that under a wide range of conditions DWT algorithm always outperforms the traditional static threshold operations. Under heavy demand conditions, DWT catches 16 times more overweight trucks than the static operations while keeping the average delay per truck at only 30 % of the delay under static operations. In other words, DWT is both more effective in weight enforcement and more efficient for traffic flow...|$|E
