5|$|Burrow Mump, {{an ancient}} {{earthwork}} {{owned by the}} National Trust, is a natural hill of Triassic sandstone capped by Keuper marl, standing at a strategic point <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett.

5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry.

5|$|Didsbury derives {{its name}} from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg, {{probably}} referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township it was on a low cliff overlooking a place <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine army marched from Constantinople through Komotini, Drama and Serres {{and reached}} the Rupel gorge on the Struma river.

There the army was stopped by a thick wooden wall, defended by Bulgarian soldiers. The Byzantines attacked the palisade immediately, but were repulsed with heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} festival held at Badrinath Temple is Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent {{of the river}} Ganges on mother earth.

5|$|There was {{initially}} no direct line from London to Wales as the tidal River Severn was too wide to cross. Trains instead {{had to follow}} a lengthy route via Gloucester, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> was narrow enough to be crossed by a bridge. Work on the Severn Tunnel had begun in 1873, but unexpected underwater springs delayed the work and prevented its opening until 1886.|$|E
5|$|Continuing south-southwest, {{the river}} {{along with the}} parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) {{to the south of}} <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook. Saw Mill River Road continues to parallel its namesake.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury {{was one of}} the {{few places}} between Stretford and Stockport <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Mersey could be forded, which made it {{significant}} for troop movements during the English Civil War, in which Manchester was on the Parliamentarian side. The Royalist commander, Prince Rupert, stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, to the south of Barlow Moor. It is also likely that Bonnie Prince Charlie crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in 1745, in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, and again in his subsequent retreat.|$|E

5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the site}} of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river Tyburn, which still flows below the {{courtyard}} and south wing of the palace. <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> was fordable (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included Edward the Confessor and his queen consort Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times, and, after the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror. William gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville, who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham {{is located}} <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing {{rights for the}} Millground and Chewton {{sections}} of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to Chub, Roach, European perch and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir {{side of the island}} is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Riparian {{vegetation}} {{is mostly}} found along the lower {{two-thirds of the}} Kootenay {{and many of the}} tributaries that join within the United States. The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by braiding, low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture.|$|E

5|$|The hill {{stands at}} a {{strategic}} location overlooking the point <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. Although {{there is some evidence}} of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there is no proof of use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on the hill in the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of the hill was built in 1793. The land and ruin were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial.|$|E
5|$|The modern name of {{the river}} is {{comparatively}} recent, probably dating from around the sixteenth century. It {{is derived from the}} village and hundred of Rotherfield, located <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> rises. Rotherfield means 'open land of the cattle', based on the Old English Hrydera-feld. Prior to being called the Rother, it was known as the Limen throughout its length. This is a Celtic word meaning 'river'. In several Anglo-Saxon charters, it is suffixed with -ea, appearing as Limenea, where the suffix also means 'river', but in Old English. During the thirteenth century, it was known as the River of Newenden.|$|E
