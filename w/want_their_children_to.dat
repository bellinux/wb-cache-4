2500|$|In 1894, a {{group of}} Hopi parents {{announced}} that they were against the ideas of Washington and did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> {{be exposed to the}} culture of white Americans. The government sent troops to arrest the 19 parents and sent them to Alcatraz Prison, where they stayed for a year. [...] Another Oraibi leader, Lomahongyoma, competed with Lololoma for village leadership. [...] In 1906 the village split after a conflict between hostiles and friendlies. The conservative hostiles left and formed a new village, known as Hotevilla.|$|E

50|$|As of 2007 most {{students}} are of Mexican and Salvadoran descent and around 80 {{percent of the}} students are economically disadvantaged. Most students begin attending the school in the Pre-Kindergarten classes, and the school sees little student turnover. Many parents enroll their children in SER-Niños because they <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> develop better English language skills quickly or because they do not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> lose their Spanish language skills. In 2009, Christopher Strane, a teacher at SER-Niños, said that when the school loses students before graduation, most of the students move to suburbs or out of Greater Houston.|$|E
50|$|Other {{reasons are}} that the parents of fushugaku {{children}} <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> go to a school where they would use their native language. However, such schools cost between 30,000 and 50,000 yen per month, so parents cannot afford to send their children.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{teaching}} about condoms {{in public schools}} is opposed by some religious organizations. Planned Parenthood, which advocates family planning and sex education, argues that no studies have shown abstinence-only programs to result in delayed intercourse, and cites surveys showing that 76% of American parents <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> receive comprehensive sexuality education including condom use.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, a {{group of}} parents who <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> receive an {{authentic}} Catholic education modeled after the classical liberal arts curriculum. After traveling on pilgrimage to St. Joseph's Oratory of Mount Royal, they resolved to found a private, independent school that was faithful to the Catholic church.|$|R
50|$|The kibbutzim evolved {{and since}} the mid-1950s and much more so since the 1970s {{education}} was very much influenced by the changes. People on the kibbutzim <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> live at home {{and not in the}} children's house so communal sleeping arrangements were brought to an end.|$|R
30|$|Quantitative studies {{subsequently}} {{sought to}} demonstrate that among working-class families, immigrant parents had much higher educational aspirations for <b>their</b> <b>children</b> than non-immigrant parents (Caille and O’Prey 2003, Brinbaum and Kieffer 2005). Caille and O’Prey’s study (2003) finds that more working-class immigrant parents, compared with working-class French-born parents, <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> obtain an academic rather than a vocational secondary leaving certificate and {{to continue their education}} until age 20, and believe in the employment benefits of higher education. They have also more frequently specified that they <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> enter the academic track in upper secondary school. Those results are stable “all other things being equal” 1 and are particularly true of families from the Maghreb, but also of families from sub-Saharan Africa and Turkey. These working-class immigrant families thus express more ambitious choices than working-class families where both parents are French-born.|$|R
50|$|Northern Ireland {{is viewed}} as a divided place, a country where adults and {{children}} can be separated on religious, social and political grounds.

50|$|Jordanian Americans <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> marry {{within the}} culture or, at least, {{within the larger}} Arab-American community. Sometimes a Jordanian American man will travel to Jordan to find a woman he {{considers}} a suitable wife. On the other hand, marriage to a non-Jordanian is tolerable, and husband and wife are welcomed into each other's families.|$|E

[...] In Monroe, white parents did not <b>want</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> swim or play with black children.|$|E
25|$|Despite their fame, the McCartneys <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> lead {{as normal}} {{a life as}} possible, so Stella and her {{siblings}} attended local state schools in East Sussex, one of them being Bexhill College.

5000|$|Citizens' {{task forces}} studied how to combat school violence, low {{academic}} achievement, and persistent racial segregation. In 1992, then-superintendent Shirl Gilbert initiated a [...] "Select Schools" [...] plan, allowing parents {{the option of}} selecting which school they <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> attend within the district. While theoretically promising, in practice the plan {{did not lead to}} general improvements.|$|R
50|$|Wirt {{set up an}} {{elaborate}} night school program, especially to Americanize new immigrants. The introduction of vocational educational programs, such as wood shop, machine shop, typing, and secretarial skills proved especially popular with parents who <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> become foremen and office workers. By the Great Depression, most cities found the Gary plan too expensive, and abandoned it.|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{qualitative}} study explored values, attitudes, and beliefs held by Mexican-origin mothers of preschool-aged <b>children</b> <b>to</b> enhance understanding of cultural influences on behaviors associated with childhood obesity risk. Methods: During face-to-face interviews, 39 Mexican-origin mothers of preschool-aged <b>children</b> discussed <b>their</b> hopes for <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>their</b> {{image of the}} perfect mother, Mexican and American foods, why they taught <b>their</b> <b>children</b> about these foods, and their opinions about television (TV) viewing language. Results: Participants <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> become successful, ?good? people, which necessitated doing well in school. Mothers also <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> know them, which required understanding the mothers' Mexican backgrounds. Mothers <b>wanted</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>to</b> maintain Mexican values and identities. Some mothers viewed American culture as harmful. Many participants prepared <b>their</b> <b>child</b> for going <b>to</b> Mexico by exposing them to Mexican culture and foods. Some mothers fed <b>their</b> <b>children</b> American foods <b>to</b> prepare them for school. Perceptions of American foods generally reflected stereotypical unhealthy foods. TV helped teach children Spanish and English. Being a good mother was core to participants' identities; thus, hearing about child overweight made some mothers feel like failures. Conclusions: Health promotion programs may be more salient to mothers if they: underscore how a healthy weight can help children in school; teach mothers to prepare healthy American foods that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> will encounter in kindergarten; assist mothers in teaching <b>their</b> <b>children</b> about Mexico; and present information about childhood obesity in ways that reinforce what mothers are doing well, enhance mothers' self-efficacy, and allay feelings of failure...|$|R
