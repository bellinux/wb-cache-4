5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> kill him, altered {{the course of the}} history of music.|$|E
5|$|The Mew Mews {{are led by}} {{the main}} character, Ichigo Momomiya, whose first task is to gather the other four Mew Mews: Minto Aizawa, Retasu Midorikawa, Bu-Ling Huang, and Zakuro Fujiwara. As the series progresses, Ichigo goes from having a crush on Masaya Aoyama to {{becoming}} his girlfriend while trying to hide her secret double life from him. The series antagonists include three aliens, Quiche, Pie, and Tart, and their leader, Deep Blue. Originally from Earth, the aliens were forced to leave long ago due to deadly environmental changes. They have returned to kill the humans, who they feel are destroying their planet, and reclaim the planet. In a la Mode, middle school student Berry Shirayuki is introduced as the sixth Mew Mew and, {{in the absence of}} Ichigo, the temporary leader of the Mew Mews. A la Mode also introduces new set of antagonists, the Saint Rose Crusaders, a group of human teenagers with various psychic abilities <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> create their own utopia. Led by Duke, they make several attempts to kill Berry, eventually turning the local populace against the Mew Mews.|$|E

25|$|Prevention is {{the best}} solution.

25|$|The party's {{original}} {{support base}} consisted of voters alienated by perceived unproductive adversarial {{conflict between the}} two mainstream parties and an emerging new constituency of people <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> participate more effectively in government and to promote concerns for environmental protection and social justice. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly neo-Keynesian economics and a progressive environmental platform.|$|E
25|$|Almost 20% of {{the people}} wanted to use {{whatever}} treatment that might postpone death. About the same number said that, given a terminal illness, they would choose assisted suicide. Roughly half chose doing nothing except live day by day until death comes naturally without medical or other intervention designed to prolong life. This choice was coupled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> receive palliative care if needed.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} {{everyone}} was suddenly [...] "seized." [...] Mr Sudberry and George were seized <b>with</b> <b>an</b> irresistible <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> fish; Fred was seized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> burning <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> sketch; Lucy was seized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> passionate <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> gather wild flowers; and Jacky was seized <b>with</b> <b>a</b> furious <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> wet himself and wade with his shoes on. He did it too, and, {{in the course}} of an hour, tumbled into so many peat-bogs, and besmeared himself with so much coffee-coloured mud, that his own mother would have failed to recognise him. He was supremely happy--so was his father. At the very first cast he, (the father), hooked a trout of half a pound weight, and lost it, too! but that was nothing. The next cast he caught one of nearly a pound. George was equally successful. Fortune smiled. Before evening began to close, both baskets were half full of splendid trout; Lucy's basket was quite full of botanical specimens; Fred's sketch was a success, and Jacky was as brown as a Hottentot from head to foot. They prepared to return home, rejoicing.|$|R

25|$|The Modern Age Lex Luthor is {{a product}} of child abuse and early poverty. Born in the Suicide Slum {{district}} of Metropolis, he is instilled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> become a self-made man. As a teenager, he takes out a large insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge, then sabotages their car's brakes, causing their deaths. Upon graduating from MIT, Luthor founds his own business, LexCorp, which grows to dominate much of Metropolis.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the disappearance there was an outpouring of sympathy, particularly in the local community, and thousands of people contacted authorities <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> help. Among the people who showed their support were a friend of the Giskegjerde Schjetne family who acted as a volunteer coordinator and spokesman for them, the crime author Gunnar Staalesen, players from the local football club Vålerenga who participated in the search, and Minister of Education Kristin Halvorsen who mobilised her department to support the family.|$|E
25|$|In 1936, William D. Campbell, {{a wealthy}} board member <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> see Africa, offered to fund several dioramas if allowed {{to obtain the}} {{specimens}} himself. Clark agreed to this arrangement and shortly after Campbell left to collect the okapi and black rhinoceros specimens accompanied by artist Robert Kane. Campbell would be involved, in one capacity or another, with several other subsequent expeditions. Despite setbacks including malaria, flooding, foreign government interference, and even a boat sinking, these expeditions would succeed in acquiring some of Akeley Hall’s most impressive specimens.|$|E

25|$|In 1770, {{five years}} before the American War of Independence and {{coincident}} with Captain James Cook's discovery of the eastern Australian coast, Fraser arrived in London {{as a young man}} to make his way in the city, at first following the trade of a hosier (a draper working with linen). He soon came to know the Chelsea Physic Garden, and it was through his visits there that he became inspired <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> advance horticulture in England. He married Frances Shaw on 21 June 1778 and settled down in a small shop in Paradise Bow, Chelsea.|$|E
25|$|Új Előre (New Forward) (1921–1937) — Új Előre was a Communist Party-sponsored {{publication}} {{from the}} outset and it gave great attention to the ongoing situation in Hungary {{in the aftermath of}} the failed 1919 Hungarian Revolution. The publication was nominally edited by an American citizen, but the key editorial work was done by an editorial board dominated by emigrants from Soviet Hungary, including Lajos Köves, János Lassen, and Lajos Bebrits. In 1931 the publication was moved from New York City to Cleveland, a decision which was reversed in 1937. Economic problems combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> remake the publication as a less partisan Popular Front newspaper led to its discontinuation in 1937 in favor of the weekly Amerikai Magyar Világ.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the {{two major}} ballet {{companies}} in Canada were the Royal Winnipeg Ballet headed by Gweneth Lloyd and the Volkoff Canadian Ballet founded by Boris Volkoff and based in Toronto. Although both of these companies were well renowned, they were biased in their selection of dancers and often held auditions in their founding cities. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> create an unbiased Canadian ballet troupe, and inspired by the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, a group of ballet enthusiasts set out to create the National Ballet of Canada. Both Lloyd and Volkoff were interested in being the first {{artistic director of the}} company, but the organisers agreed {{that the only way to}} create a truly unbiased ballet company was to hire an outsider named Celia Franca as artistic director.|$|E

25|$|The demand had {{increased}} so much after 1776, that many farmers {{were unable to}} meet the demands for exports, which increased the prices of tobacco even further. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> increase the amount of tobacco available, many American farmers took out credit loans from the British to increase the size of their landholdings as well as increase the number of slaves they owned. Much of this credit went to gentleman farmers, but the desire for tobacco was so strong that even middle class farmers found it easy to receive loans to increase their farm production. Many of these farmers opted not to pay back these loans however, and many in turn found themselves jailed {{toward the end of the}} century for not paying their debts. Many of these debtors were small farmers, causing a further consolidation of smaller farms into larger ones.|$|E
25|$|F64.2 Gender {{identity}} {{disorder of}} childhood: A disorder, usually first manifest during early childhood (and always well before puberty), {{characterized by a}} persistent and intense distress about assigned sex, together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be (or insistence that one is) of the other sex. There is a persistent preoccupation with the dress and activities {{of the opposite sex}} and repudiation of the individual's own sex. The diagnosis requires a profound disturbance of the normal gender identity; mere tomboyishness in girls or girlish behavior in boys is not sufficient. Gender identity disorders in individuals who have reached or are entering puberty should not be classified here but in F66.0.In the DSM of mental disorders used by psychologists in the United States, gender identity disorder is given two sets of criteria. Criterion A indicates that a child identifies {{as a member of the}} opposite sex. The child needs to demonstrate four of the five following symptoms: dressing as a member of the opposite sex, primarily befriending members of the opposite sex, demonstrating a desire to engage in play activities characteristic of the opposite sex, and actively stating that they wish to be the opposite sex. Criterion B, on the other hand, indicates that the child does not identify with the sex they were born. This could manifest itself as a dislike of styles of dress characteristic of the sex they were born, avoidance of association with members of their born sex, and distress towards the aspects of their physiology which indicate their born gender (Bradley, Zucker, 1997).|$|E
25|$|The 19th century Italian writer Arturo Graf {{gives this}} version of the legend in his 1889 book Il Diavolo : There was once a duchess of Normandy who was tormented <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> have {{children}} and yet could have none. Weary of recommending herself to God, who will not listen to her, she betakes herself to the Devil, and her wish is speedily satisfied. A son is born to her, a veritable firebrand. As an infant, he bites his nurse and tears out her hair; as a lad, he knifes his teachers; at the age of twenty, he becomes a bandit chief. He is dubbed knight, in the belief that thus the wicked instincts raging within him may be overcome; but thereafter he is worse than he was before. No one surpasses him in strength or in courage. In a tourney he overthrows and slays thirty opponents; then he goes roaming about the world; then he returns to his native land, and begins once more to play the bandit, robbing, burning, murdering, ravishing. One day, after cutting the throats of all the nuns of a certain abbey, he remembers his mother and goes in search of her. Soon as they spy him, the servants take to their heels, scattering in all directions; not one tarries to ask him whence he comes or what he desires. Then, {{for the first time in}} his life, Robert is astounded at the horror which he inspires in his fellow-beings; for the first time, he becomes conscious of his own monstrous wickedness, and he feels how his heart is pierced by the sharp tooth of remorse. But why is he wickeder than other men? Why was he born thus? Who made him what he is? An ardent longing seizes him to unravel this mystery. He hastens to his mother, and with drawn sword he adjures her to unveil to him the secret of his birth. Learning this, he becomes frantic with terror, shame, and grief. But his sturdy nature is not weakened; he does not yield to despair; instead, the hope of a laborious redemption, of a marvelous victory, urges and spurs on his proud spirit. He will learn to conquer Hell, to subdue himself, to thwart the designs of that accursed fiend who created him to serve his own ends, who has made of him a docile instrument of destruction and of sin. And he makes no delay. He goes to Rome, casts himself at the feet of the pope, makes confession to a holy hermit, submits himself to the harshest kind of penance, and swears that henceforth he will taste no food that he has not first wrested from the jaws of a dog. On two separate occasions, when Rome was besieged by the Saracens, he fights incognito for the Emperor and gains the victory for the Christians. Recognized at last, he refuses all rewards and honors, the imperial crown, even the monarch's own daughter, goes away to dwell with his hermit in the wilderness, and dies a saint, blessed by both God and men. In other accounts, he finally weds the beautiful princess who is deeply in love with him.|$|E

500|$|Super Mario Kart was {{produced}} by Shigeru Miyamoto and directed by Tadashi Sugiyama and Hideki Konno. In an interview Miyamoto {{has said that the}} development team originally set out to produce a game capable of displaying two players on the same game screen simultaneously. In the same interview Konno stated that development started <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> create a two player racing game in contrast to the single player gameplay of SNES launch title F-Zero. [...] The team found that due to limitations of the SNES hardware, the strong focus on multiplayer prevented the inclusions of tracks as elaborate as those found in F-Zero. Computer and Video Games suggest that this initial emphasis on creating a two player experience is the reason for the game's horizontal split-screen during single player modes.|$|E
500|$|These problems, {{together}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> {{enhance the}} deterrent {{effect of the}} death penalty, resulted in {{the passage of the}} Murder Act 1752. [...] It required that [...] "every murderer shall, after execution, either be dissected or hung in chains". [...] Dissection was generally viewed as [...] "a fate worse than death"; giving judges the ability to substitute gibbeting with dissection was an attempt to invoke that horror. [...] While the Act gave anatomists statutory access to many more cadavers than were previously available, it proved insufficient. [...] Attempting to bolster the supply, some surgeons offered money to pay the prison expenses and funeral clothing costs of condemned prisoners, while bribes were paid to officials present at the gallows, sometimes leading to an unfortunate situation in which corpses not legally given over for dissection were taken anyway.|$|E
