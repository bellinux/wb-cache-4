5|$|Although Elizabeth Johnson {{was mistaken}} about the Pike village site, her mistake is {{held to be}} a {{fortunate}} one. The <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting. The Republic County site was not entirely pristine, due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation; but it was far better preserved. Today, the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site, built in 1967 {{over one of the}} excavated earth lodges.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, Elizabeth Johnson {{discovered}} {{the remains of}} a Pawnee village in Republic County, Kansas. She thought that it might be the site of Pike's flag incident; but hearing of another village in <b>Webster</b> <b>County,</b> Nebraska, she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site. Because the surface had been altered by cultivation, they found little evidence of habitation, and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike's village. She prevented its being plowed on several occasions, and eventually purchased the land.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of September3, 2007, a malicious fire was set {{in the base of}} the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree's hollow bole. The Webster Springs Fire Department, <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> Sheriff's Department, and the West Virginia Division of Forestry provided a joint response to the fire, and remained on the scene for several hours until the flames were out. The tree survived the blaze but suffered irreparable damage.|$|E

It was the location of a village of the Kitkehahki band of the Pawnee people, in a region of the Republican River valley that they occupied intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, Hill {{learned of}} {{the remains of a}} Spanish saddle {{obtained}} from the George DeWitt farm in <b>Webster</b> <b>County.</b> He visited the farm, and learned from DeWitt, the son of the original homesteader, that when the land was first plowed, it was covered with Native American relics. Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish bridle bit and spur; across the river, on land that had never been plowed, he found traces of a camp, including rifle pits. The topography of the site closely matched Pike's description; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike's route from the site to the Arkansas River, he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike's account.|$|E
5|$|There is no firm {{documentary}} evidence of {{occupation of the}} <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> village after 1809. However, analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that the site was re-occupied during the second decade of the 19th century; and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that the Kitkehahki were living on the Republican. By 1833, however, the village had been abandoned and the band was living on the Loup River. In that year, the four Pawnee bands, treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government, signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of the Platte.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case {{was turned over to}} the <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E

500|$|By 1927, Hill and the NSHS were {{persuaded that}} the <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> site {{was the scene}} of the Pike flag incident. In that year, they {{challenged}} Kansas's claim.

500|$|Further work at both sites {{strengthened}} {{the case for}} Nebraska. Kansas supporters gave ground reluctantly: a major celebration {{was held at the}} Republic County site in 1933, and as late as 1947, an article in the Kansas Historical Quarterly spoke of the issue as [...] "debatable ground". Today, however, the <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> site is generally acknowledged as the true one: an exhibit at the Republic County site states as much, and a Kansas historical marker near the 1901 monument states that [...] "the village was long believed ... to be that visited by Zebulon M.

500|$|The land {{upon which}} the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company, which spared the tree during its lumber {{operations}} in the area during the 1950s.

The Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park, known as Big Sycamore Park. During the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> Nature Weekend in May, hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore.|$|E
500|$|There is {{much debate}} among historians and archaeologists {{concerning}} {{the dates of}} occupation of the <b>Webster</b> <b>County</b> village. Four Kitkehahki village sites on the Republican are known, two of them quite large: this one, and the Pawnee Indian Village Site near Republic, Kansas, [...] downstream. The band inhabited the Republican valley intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s. Unfortunately, there is little information on which villages were occupied at what times, {{although there is a}} strong consensus that this village is the one visited by Pike in 1806. The following account, therefore, can only describe what is known about Kitkehahki occupation and abandonment of the Republican valley, and not the history of this particular village.|$|E
