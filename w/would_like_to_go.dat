25|$|Following this {{invitation}} from the King {{and also the}} request made by his son Mahindra, Ashoka sent Sanghamitta with a retinue of 10 other learned bhikkunis (priestesses) to accompany her and to give ordination to the Sri Lanka's princess Anula and other women. Ashoka was initially distraught {{at the prospect of}} sending his daughter away but Sangamitta herself persisted that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Sri Lanka. She appealed to her father stating: The purpose was also to establish the Bhikkuni Order to spread Buddhism in that country with the devoted participation and assistance of women. Ashoka finally agreed to send her. She travelled to Sri Lanka by sea carrying a sapling of Bodhi-Tree in a golden vase. She landed at Jambukola in the North. King Tissa himself received Sangamitta and the sapling of the Bodhi-Tree with deep veneration. They were then ceremonially escorted by the king and his people to Anuradhapura. They entered at the northern gate of Anuradhapura along a road sprinkled with white sand. The Bodhi sapling was planted with great fanfare in the Mahāmeghavana Grove in Aunradhapura. It is still seen at the same location.|$|E

500|$|Conflicting reports {{came out}} of the FA as to whether the next manager would be English. [...] On 15 August 2010, the FA's Adrian Bevington stated to the BBC that [...] "we should have an English manager after (Euro 2012)", but on 22 September, the FA's Director of Football Development, Trevor Brooking, stated that [...] "We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> English (but) we've got to see what English people are available". Two weeks later, Capello's England {{qualified}} for Euro 2012 with a 2–2 draw away against Montenegro. In February 2012, Capello resigned following the FA's decision to remove the captaincy of the national side from John Terry, with Englishman Stuart Pearce taking over the role on a caretaker basis.|$|E

500|$|Fionna and Cake {{are helping}} Prince Gumball {{decorate}} for the Biennial Gumball Ball when Gumball asks Fionna if she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to it tonight with him. Their conversation is interrupted when the Ice Queen breaks into the castle {{and tries to}} kidnap Gumball. Fionna and Cake start to fight her before she mysteriously disappears. Gumball (who is apparently unharmed) arranges a date with Fionna. At the Tree Fort, Fionna and Cake argue {{over whether or not}} Gumball asked Fionna on a date. Cake decides to come along to help Fionna out. At the Castle Gardens, the two are met by Gumball and his steed Lord Monochromicorn. The group then flies through the air while Gumball serenades Fionna with the song [...] "Oh, Fionna" [...] and eventually asks her to be his girlfriend. When Fionna and Cake get to the ball, Prince Gumball takes Fionna to his room (decorated with candles and rose petals) and locks the door. She becomes flustered and backs away when he begins to take his shirt off. A drop of water lands on her shoulder, she looks up to see the real Prince Gumball trapped inside a giant icicle on the ceiling. The fake prince is revealed to be Ice Queen. Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue.|$|E
500|$|Torres {{made his}} return for Liverpool on 8 November 2008 after coming on as a 72nd-minute {{substitute}} in a 3–0 victory against West Bromwich Albion. He {{said he would}} be interested in returning to former club Atlético eventually, saying, [...] "I don't know if I will retire there, but I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and finish some things that are left to do." [...] He was ruled out of action for two to three weeks following Liverpool's 1–0 victory over Marseille in the Champions League in November, where he picked up a hamstring strain, which was later extended to at least four weeks by specialists. He was named on the shortlist for the FIFA World Player of the Year award in December, and eventually came in third place behind Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Torres returned to action on 3 January 2009 as a substitute with a goal in the 2–0 win over Preston North End, his first in the FA Cup. He scored two late goals for Liverpool to secure a 2–0 victory over Chelsea on 1 February 2009. Despite having spent {{a year and a half}} at the club, Torres was chosen as number 50 in The Timess list of [...] "The 50 greatest Liverpool players", reinforcing the impact he had made at Liverpool in such a short period of time.|$|E

500|$|Speculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan {{returned}} to the show {{for a second time}} in its fifth season. Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show, but he later retracted his comment. During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her. It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season. Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice. Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010. Heigl explained that she wanted {{to spend more time with}} her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again. Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, [...] " [...] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story.

Harvey now invited Bryant to live with her in the mansion and they began spending large amounts of money, which included the purchase of more than thirty new cars in less than three years. The couple began to spend most days shopping, usually after having lunch in a local restaurant.

When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the actual recording Lyttelton can be heard to say, [...] "Well I'm very sorry about that. Rather unfortunate. We <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on and ask you a few things about what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game."

2500|$|Regular {{admission}} {{is a good}} choice for students who are unsure where they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> One advantage is that it can help students who have improved their grades substantially in the fall of twelfth grade, since decisions are not made until March of that year. In addition, it offers students more time to make their decision about a college under somewhat less pressure than an early method. The fairly dominant view is that regular {{admission is}} more likely to result in higher offers of financial aid, particularly if students are admitted to several institutions that present different aid offers. Accordingly, one offer can be used as leverage {{to try to get a}} better offer at another institution, particularly if there are competing multiple acceptances. Several reports suggested that a [...] "growing number of colleges" [...] including Harvard, Cornell, and Carnegie-Mellon have stated publicly that they will consider matching offers from competing colleges.

2500|$|Transcortical {{sensory aphasia}} is {{characterized}} as a fluent aphasia. Fluency is determined by direct qualitative observation of the patient’s speech to determine the length of spoken phrases, and is usually characterized by a normal or rapid rate; normal phrase length, rhythm, melody, and articulatory agility; and normal or paragrammatic speech. Transcortical sensory aphasia is a disorder {{in which there is}} a discrepancy between phonological processing, which remains intact, and lexical-semantic processing, which is impaired. Therefore, patients can repeat complicated phrases, however they lack comprehension and propositional speech. This disconnect occurs since Wernicke’s area is not damaged in patients with TSA, therefore repetition is spared while comprehension is affected. Patients with intact repetition can repeat both simple and complex phrases spoken by others, e.g. when asked if the patient <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for a walk, he or she would respond [...] "go for walk." [...] Although patients can respond appropriately, due to the extent of their TSA, it is most likely that they do not comprehend what others ask them. In addition to problems in comprehension, transcortical sensory aphasia is further characterized based on deficits in naming and paraphasia.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Cardinal Ratzinger, {{later to}} become Pope Benedict XVI, {{wrote that the}} Shroud of Turin is [...] "a truly mysterious image, which no human artistry was capable of producing. In some inexplicable way, it {{appeared}} imprinted upon cloth and believed to show the true face of Christ, the crucified and risen Lord." [...] In June 2008, three years after he assumed the papacy, Pope Benedict announced that the Shroud would be publicly displayed {{in the spring of}} 2010, and stated that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Turin to see it along with other pilgrims. During his visit in Turin on Sunday 2 May 2010, Benedict described the Shroud of Turin as an [...] "extraordinary Icon", the [...] "Icon of Holy Saturday [...] corresponding in every way to what the Gospels tell us of Jesus", [...] "an Icon written in blood, the blood {{of a man who was}} scourged, crowned with thorns, crucified and whose right side was pierced". The pope said also that in the Turin Shroud [...] "we see, as in a mirror, our suffering in the suffering of Christ". On 30 May 2010, Benedict XVI beatified Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli who coined the Holy Face Medal, based on Secondo Pia's photograph of the Shroud.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{concerns}} to the contrary, Glasberg denied that Ziva [...] "friend zoned" [...] Tony in the finale.

I think there are gestures being made that have definitely advanced from where we were a year ago." [...] In response to complaints about {{the pace of the}} development, he said, [...] "There are a lot of fans {{who would like to see}} that story advance much faster than we're doing it, but I firmly believe a little goes a long way and there are ways to tease it and to flirt that are just as significant and just as meaningful." [...] He maintained, [...] "We made huge strides. Their relationship has evolved, has changed. They're a little more open with each other and a little more emotionally connected, certainly more than where we were at the beginning of the season. [...] may not be the big leap that a lot of people would like it to be, but I also feel like we're enjoying the pace at which this is happening. That's not to say we're not headed in the direction everyone <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> but I think we’re getting there. It's very complicated when two agents who are working together get into a relationship, and that's something that [...] would be very conscious of.
