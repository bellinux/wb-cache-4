Recently, many publications aim at optimizing <b>web</b> <b>forms.</b> In contrast to former research that focused at the evaluation of single guidelines, the present study shows in a controlled lab experiment with n= 23 participants the combined effectiveness of 20 guidelines on real company <b>web</b> <b>forms.</b> Results indicate that optimized <b>web</b> <b>forms</b> lead to faster completion times, less form submission trials, fewer eye fixations and higher user satisfaction {{in comparison to the}} original forms...|$|R

By default, the view engine in the MVC framework uses Razor [...] and , or <b>Web</b> <b>Forms</b> [...] pages to design the layout of the user interface pages onto which the data is composed. However, different view engines can be used. Additionally, rather than the default ASP.NET <b>Web</b> <b>Forms</b> postback model, any interactions are routed to the controllers using the ASP.NET Routing mechanism. Views can be mapped to different URLs.|$|R

The process of registration involves verification of one's age (typically over 12 is required so as to meet COPPA requirements of American forum software) followed by a declaration of the terms of service (other documents may also be present) and a request for agreement to said terms. Subsequently, if all goes well, the candidate is presented with a <b>web</b> <b>form</b> to fill requesting at the very least a username (an alias), password, email and validation of a CAPTCHA code.|$|E

In this work, we focus on modeling <b>web</b> <b>forms</b> which {{are an important part of}} current web applications.

We will then summarize existing approaches to conceptual modeling based on UML and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). We will present XForms. Finally, we will discuss how to model <b>web</b> <b>forms</b> at the conceptual level and how to translate conceptual schemas of <b>web</b> <b>forms</b> to XForms representation. Our approach is based on MDA principles. Firstly, a problem domain is modeled at the conceptual level. Secondly, each form representing a part of the domain is modeled independently of its representation in XForms. The last step is generating XForms representations of the modeled forms...|$|R
