500|$|Though {{the lyrics}} of the song like [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> down on my knees?" [...] portray female helplessness, the video {{performance}} acts as a counter-text to it. When this line is sung, Madonna is shown kneeling {{on the road in}} front of the advancing car, then turns her head back while exposing her throat back in a posture of submission. However, her voice tone and her look at the camera portray a hardness and defiance that contradict the submissiveness of her body posture and turn the question of the line into a challenge for her lover.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the major}} film studios {{approached}} Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play. She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, {{on the condition that}} she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, [...] "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot of people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> fall flat on my face." [...] Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences [...] "laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in [...] "recreating" [...] her public image. The Philadelphia Story {{was one of the biggest}} hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, [...] "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven." [...] Herb Golden of Variety stated, [...] "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture... The perfect conception of all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable." [...] Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|While {{calling into}} WVEE during their {{interview}} with Ciara and Polow da Don, Hilson said, [...] "I {{just want to}} tell Ciara it’s not about you. People are just reading way too far into it. People take things and make it what they want it to be. It wasn’t taking shots at nobody." [...] I just want to let Atlanta know and Ciara know that this is a true leak. I did, and I don't know if Polow said this on the radio, but I did fight this coming out. I didn't want this coming out because we played it for people when I did it and that's what people said it was about; they started throwing out names. We were like 'No, it's not about that' and we tried to let them know what it was really about. But the fact that people brought back names, it was like ok, that wasn't the reaction we need, so I told Polow, 'let's not do this and he agreed". Ciara happened to call in during the time period and said she was happy of where Hilson was at in her career, to which Hilson responded the same, saying how proud she was, and [...] "watching her from ground zero." [...] Hilson went on to state she was not jealous of anyone's career, noting how all female R artists are the same, pointing out that [...] "Keyshia’s on my album. I’ve worked with Ciara many times. I’m a fan of Beyoncé’s." [...] When asked exactly who the song is about, Hilson said the targets knew who they were, responding, [...] "It’s anybody that ever tried to take me down and didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> succeed. I’m not gonna call their names because I feel I’ve addressed it." [...] She further clarified, commenting [...] "I will say this, my journey has been 12 years long and there have been many people, specifically girls, and it really just isn't one person, it's been a lot of people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cushing is {{well known}} for playing Baron Victor Frankenstein and Professor Van Helsing in a long series of horror films {{produced}} by Hammer Film Productions in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. He was often cast alongside Christopher Lee, who became his best friend. His first appearances in his two most famous roles were in Terence Fisher's films The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) and Dracula (1958). He later said that his career decisions entailed selecting roles where he knew that he would be accepted by the audience. [...] "Who wants to see me as Hamlet? Very few. But millions <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> as Frankenstein, so that's the one I do." [...] The film critic Roger Ebert described Cushing's work in the Hammer films thusly: [...] " [...] the one in all those British horror films, standing between Vincent Price and Christopher Lee. His dialog usually runs along the lines of, 'But good heavens, man! The person you saw has been dead for more than two centuries!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, I said {{the two or three}} sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E
2500|$|Dominic Treadwell-Collins was {{appointed}} {{executive producer of}} EastEnders in August 2013, but in December 2013, he said that Mick and Linda [...] "were in my head {{about a year and}} a half ago", adding that they are influenced by his own parents. For Mick's announcement, Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "I'm so excited to have actors of Danny and Kellie's calibre joining what is an already strong and talented company of actors." [...] Dyer said at the time of the announcement, [...] "I am so excited about starting a new chapter in my career and cannot wait to become part of the East End family." [...] Later in the same month, Dyer said that becoming the new pub landlord was [...] "like the perfect marriage. To take over The Queen Vic on Christmas Day, to be on primetime TV on the BBC's flagship show... I want to show people what I can do." [...] Dyer said in the Daily Star that he was not nervous joining EastEnders, but that he was excited and [...] "can't wait for everyone to see me in the Vic", joking that he hoped his character would not have sex with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace). The programme had suffered falling ratings in 2013, and Dyer told Inside Soap that he wanted to [...] "help turn EastEnders around". When asked by Heat if he would be [...] "the saviour" [...] of EastEnders, he said that he would, and said, [...] "a lot of people were excited about me going to EastEnders [...] there's a lot of people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>me</b> fail", adding that it was a risk that [...] "could work or couldn't work". Controller of BBC One, Charlotte Moore, said in December 2013 that Dyer [...] "is an extraordinary presence on the set of EastEnders—it's very exciting. He's just a big, big character and bringing him into the Vic is going to change a lot of the dynamics of EastEnders". Shane Richie, who plays previous landlord Alfie Moon, said Mick and the rest of the Carters would [...] "change the dynamics of the Queen Vic", confirming that their arrival was [...] "the big Christmas storyline".|$|E
