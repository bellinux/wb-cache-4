Officials at the Pentagon strongly denied that possibility.

It’s something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know <b>where</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E

While talking to a police officer, Mars reportedly declared that {{what he did was}} [...] "foolish" [...] and that [...] "he has never used drugs before." [...] Mars pleaded guilty to felony drug possession and in return was told that the charges would be erased from his criminal record as long as he stayed out of trouble for a year. He paid a $2,000 fine, did 200 hours of community service, and completed a drug counseling course. Nevertheless, in a cover story for GQ magazine in 2013, Mars said [...] "I was young, man! I was in f---ing Vegas...I wasn't thinking", he added: [...] "I was given a number one record and I'm out doing dumb sh--." [...] Mars confessed that he lied to the authorities about having done cocaine before, saying [...] "I don't know <b>where</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> from", adding: [...] "I was really intoxicated. I was really drunk. So {{a lot of that is}} a big blur, and I try every day to forget and keep pushing." ...|$|E

500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I have no idea <b>where</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> from, but it certainly didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy {{he wanted to come}} back to the team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E
2500|$|Soon afterwards, Clarke {{joined up}} with blues singer Alison Moyet to form Yazoo (or Yaz in the United States). Initial talk of Clarke's {{continuing}} to write material for Depeche Mode ultimately amounted to nothing. According to third-party sources, Clarke offered the remaining members of Depeche Mode the track [...] "Only You", but they declined. Clarke, however, denied {{in an interview}} that such an offer ever took place saying, [...] "I don't know <b>where</b> <b>that</b> <b>came</b> from. That's not true." [...] The song {{went on to become a}} UK Top 3 hit for Yazoo. Gore, who had written [...] "Tora! Tora! Tora!" [...] and the instrumental [...] "Big Muff" [...] for Speak & Spell, was forced to become the band's new songwriter.|$|E

It might be a 'out-in-the-country' thing. Growing up I knew lots of sons who were referred to as 'Buck'. Sometimes even if they weren't juniors.

60|$|Mr Jonas {{considered}} this so particularly childish (perhaps with some reason), {{that he only}} laughed the more, and told his cousins that he was afraid one of these fine days, Chuffey would be the death of him.
