25|$|I don't {{know why}} {{people call me}} a jazz singer, though I guess people {{associate}} me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I'm not putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer...I've recorded all kinds of music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't sing a blues – just a right-out blues – but I can put the blues in whatever I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy part in it, or any song. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, music-wise, is all kinds of music that I like, and I like all kinds of music.|$|E
25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E

500|$|Initially unenthusiastic {{about his}} task of {{realising}} Alan Fennell's script, director David Elliott developed his inspiration {{after seeing the}} 1965 spy thriller film The Ipcress File, starring Michael Caine. He remembers that the film [...] "used all the old-fashioned shotslooking through a lampshade, etc. On Monday morning, Paddy [...] came in and said, 'I saw a film this weekend,' and I said, 'So did I.' 'Was it The Ipcress File?' 'Yep. Right, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do.'" [...] In homage to The Ipcress File, Elliott decided to incorporate [...] "quirky visuals" [...] into his direction of the Thunderbirds episode.|$|E

During a press conference following the semi-final, Mukuchyan responded to the incident by stating that [...] "You don't have to forget that I am representing my country in my heart, my thoughts, my feelings, and all my emotions. My thoughts are with my motherland, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> spread is peace on borders. I wrote 'LoveWave' because {{this was going on}} inside of me." ...|$|E

5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music.

[...] Al Kooper has said that of all the songs that Dylan had outlined to him in his hotel, this was his favorite, so Dylan delayed recording it to {{the very end of the}} Nashville sessions, [...] "just to bug him". Released as a single in June 1966, shortly before the album Blonde on Blonde, [...] "I Want You" [...] reached number 20 in the USA, and number 16 in the UK.|$|E
500|$|To {{cast the}} series, Jeremy Simmons and Thairin Smothers posted to LGBT Internet forums and {{electronic}} mailing lists, and visited college campuses. In August 2004 they {{traveled around the}} country to meet the shortlisted candidates. Smothers said that their main casting goal was diversity. Diverse representation was also important to T.J. Jourian, one of the four students cast for the show: [...] "What pushed me to do it was the idea of showing trans people of color, pushing beyond the American image of a gay white man." [...] "I didn’t want to be in anything where I was representing the whole community.… <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do is just give another example of a way to be." ...|$|E

In 2001, when Cyrus was eight, she and her family moved to Toronto, Canada while her father filmed the television series Doc. After Billy Ray took her to see a 2001 Mirvish production of Mamma Mia! at the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Cyrus grabbed his arm and told him, [...] "This is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, daddy.

500|$|On 1 November 2012, Novakovic {{confirmed}} {{that she would}} be leaving Neighbours to pursue acting opportunities in the United States.

I love acting and it's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, so why not be in the thick of it all? I certainly love to do more Aussie things but, being realistic, there is nowhere near as much opportunity here." [...] During her first interview since announcing her departure, Novakovic explained that her main reasons for leaving Neighbours were to try other things and explore different characters. The actress said that she had wanted to do two years with the show, but when the time came, she decided to stay for another year to prepare herself to leave.|$|E
500|$|Symbolically, {{the running}} plot of Claude's indecision, {{especially}} his resistance to burning his draft card, which ultimately causes his demise, {{has been seen}} as a parallel to Hamlet: [...] "the melancholy hippie". [...] The symbolism is carried into the last scene, where Claude appears as a ghostly spirit among his friends wearing an army uniform in an ironic echo of an earlier scene, where he says, [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be ... invisible". [...] According to Public Theater Artistic Director Oskar Eustis, [...] "Both [...] center on idealistic brilliant men as they struggle to find their place in a world marred by war, violence, and venal politics. [...] They see both the luminous possibilities and the harshest realities of being human. [...] In the end, unable to effectively combat the evil around them, they tragically succumb." ...|$|E

He drew inspiration from his time on American Idol, as well as his experience with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Kanye West and Queen Latifah. While at Berklee College of Music, he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. [...] "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> let people know is {{that there are so many}} jobs out there.

500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E

[...] However, nobody bought the manuscript. Forrest J Ackerman, later Hubbard's literary agent, recalled that Hubbard told him [...] "whoever read it either went insane or committed suicide. And he said that {{the last time he had}} shown it to a publisher in New York, he walked into the office to find out what the reaction was, the publisher called for the reader, the reader came in with the manuscript, threw it on the table and threw himself out of the skyscraper window." [...] Hubbard's failure to sell Excalibur depressed him; he told his wife in an October 1938 letter: [...] "Writing action pulp doesn't have much agreement with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do because it retards my progress by demanding incessant attention and, further, actually weakens my name. So you see I've got to do something about it and at the same time strengthen the old financial position." [...] He went on: ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Chabon (pronounced, in his words, [...] "Shea as in Shea Stadium, Bon as in Bon Jovi", i.e., [...] ) {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Robert Chabon, a {{physician}} and lawyer, and Sharon Chabon, a lawyer. Chabon said he {{knew he wanted to}} be a writer when, at the age of ten, he wrote his first short story for a class assignment. When the story received an A, Chabon recalls, [...] "I thought to myself, 'That's it. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do. I can do this.' And I never had any second thoughts or doubts." [...] Referring to popular culture, he wrote of being raised [...] "on a hearty diet of crap". His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland. Columbia, where Chabon lived nine months of the year with his mother, was [...] "a progressive planned living community in which racial, economic, and religious diversity were actively fostered." [...] He has written of his mother's marijuana use, recalling her [...] "sometime around 1977 or so, sitting in the front seat of her friend Kathy's car, passing a little metal pipe back and forth before we went in to see a movie.". He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E
500|$|Under his {{new stage}} name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James), Smith {{was signed by}} Def Jam, {{which led to the}} release of his first {{official}} record, the 12-inch single [...] "I Need a Beat" [...] (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E
