50|$|For example, Peatlands are {{wetlands}} {{that contain}} {{a large amount}} of peat, or partially decayed plant life. When peatlands are first developing, they often start out as fens, wetlands characterized by mineral rich soil. These flooded wetlands, with higher <b>water</b> <b>tables,</b> would naturally have higher emissions of methane. Eventually, the fens develop into bogs, acidic wetlands with accumulations of peat and lower <b>water</b> <b>tables.</b> With the lower <b>water</b> <b>tables,</b> methane emissions are more easily consumed by methanotrophic, or methane consuming, bacteria and never make it to the atmosphere. Over time, the peatlands develop and end up with accumulated pools of water, which once again increases emissions of methane.|$|R

5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper.

5|$|The cave {{was formed}} under phreatic {{conditions}} i.e. below the local <b>water</b> <b>table,</b> but lowering base levels {{to which the}} subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by the river, and {{there is evidence of}} a number of abandoned resurgences.

It is uncertain whether that was the original rising or whether it formed when the main rising at Wookey was blocked.|$|E
40|$|Although the {{potential}} impacts of rising <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> and secondary salinization on agricultural land in southern Australia {{have been recognized}} for some time, it is only recently that the impacts on native vegetation have been considered. Despite the likely extent and severity of the problem, no comprehensive approach to assessing the impact of salinity upon native vegetation has been attempted to date. In the present paper, we discuss the causes and impacts of rising <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> and dryland salinity, assess the levels of risk in different ecosystem types and consider the possibilities {{for the maintenance of}} biodiversity and ecosystem function in vegetation at risk. We examine the salinity risk to woodland vegetation in the We stern Australian (WA) wheatbelt, and consider both broad-scale context and finer-scale variation within individual patches of vegetation. From this information, we develop a set of conceptual models of {{the potential}} impacts of shallow saline <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> on ecosystem structure and processes in remnant vegetation in agricultural areas, particularly in the WA wheatbelt. First, we suggest that fine-scale variability in surface topography and soil characteristics may {{play an important role in}} limiting the impacts of rising saline <b>water</b> <b>tables.</b> The outcome will depend on the interaction of the heterogeneity of the impact, species distribution in relation to small-scale environmental heterogeneity and variation in species response to hydrological change. Second, we suggest that shallow saline <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> can be considered to cause an 'edge effect', which moves inwards from the edge of remnants of native vegetation. Finally, we consider how saline surface flows exacerbate the effects of shallow saline <b>water</b> <b>tables</b> and hasten vegetation decline in remnant areas. We put these models forward as hypotheses to be tested in different situations. We contrast the situation of secondary salinization in Australian vegetation with that of naturally saline systems in Australia and elsewhere, and suggest that these systems may provide important signposts toward developing management approaches for vegetation at risk. In conclusion, we consider the need to set priorities for the protection and restoration of natural vegetation at risk from altered hydrology, based on an assessment of relative threat and probability of persistence or recovery. We highlight the urgency for action that protects native vegetation from the increasing risks of rising <b>water</b> <b>tables...</b>|$|R

This not only helps ensure survival over summer, but allows plants to grow then. Though the supply of water is the taproot's primary function, the ground water obtained typically contains ionic concentrations of chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium and potassium that are adequate for the plant's nutritional needs.|$|E
