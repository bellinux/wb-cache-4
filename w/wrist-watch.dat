2500|$|In {{a family}} tree chart first {{published}} {{inside the front}} cover of Many Waters (1986, [...] ), L'Engle divided her major characters into categories she called [...] "chronos" [...] and [...] "kairos", two Greek terms for different concepts of time. The stories of the Austin family {{take place in a}} chronos environment, which L'Engle defined as [...] "ordinary, <b>wrist-watch,</b> alarm-clock time.". These are presented in a primarily realistic framework, though occasionally with elements that might be regarded as science fiction. Kairos, the framework in which the stories of the Murry and O'Keefe families take place, was defined as [...] "real time, pure numbers with no measurement", and often includes such elements as time travel, fantasy and religious content in a struggle between good and evil. A third category of characters, called by L'Engle [...] "those who cross and connect", link the chronos and kairos stories in a latticework of appearances in multiple series of books, ultimately placing nearly every L'Engle character in the same fictional universe.|$|E
60|$|Sam's own {{present to}} his bride was a gold <b>wrist-watch</b> set in {{diamonds}} and pearls--a beautiful affair {{over which the}} happy girl went wild with delight.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} the <b>wrist-watch</b> which, like every other little patriot, she possessed. Past seven! If she waited, Gratian or her father would seize on her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mr. Blake," [...] he greeted. [...] "Sorry I was delayed." [...] He {{glanced at}} his <b>wrist-watch.</b> [...] "Only four minutes, however. I just couldn't get away sooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Fike waited. She waited two minutes. She {{looked at}} a <b>wrist-watch</b> in a leather band while she tapped her sensibly clad foot. She tried again: [...] "We're waiting, deary!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a {{brand new}} five-dollar bill tucked away {{in one of my}} drawers," [...] said his brother. [...] "I can't find it anywhere. And, yes, my <b>wrist-watch</b> is missing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Olivia {{looked at}} her <b>wrist-watch.</b> [...] "My sister has some engagements for the {{afternoon}} and needs me. I ought to be at home. This is the shortest line to the town, but since you won't let me use it, perhaps you have another plan." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl went to {{the rail}} and gazed earnestly at the shore. There was an anxious {{expression}} on her face. She had the air of one who was {{waiting for someone to}} appear. Her demeanour was that of Mariana at the Moated Grange. [...] "He cometh not!" [...] she seemed to be saying. She glanced at her <b>wrist-watch,</b> then scanned the dock once more.|$|E
6000|$|Carol {{saw that}} the others were listening, {{waiting for her to}} be objectionable. She flinched before their dislike. She hastened to smile in {{agreement}} with Miss Villets, to glance publicly at her <b>wrist-watch,</b> to warble that it was [...] "so late--have to hurry home--husband--such nice party--maybe you were right about maids, prejudiced because Bea so nice--such perfectly divine angel's-food, Mrs. Haydock must give me the recipe--good-by, such happy party----" ...|$|E
60|$|Time went on, but Conrad did not appear. Night and {{day were}} the same in this prison room, but Tommy's <b>wrist-watch,</b> which enjoyed {{a certain degree of}} accuracy, {{informed}} him that it was nine o'clock in the evening. Tommy reflected gloomily that if supper did not arrive soon it would be a question of waiting for breakfast. At ten o'clock hope deserted him, and he flung himself on the bed to seek consolation in sleep. In five minutes his woes were forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|Agatha {{gave him}} a quiet, {{friendly}} look. [...] "It's lucky I have you to help, because I could not have gone far alone. I've studied Nature's laws in the laboratory, but in the bush she works on another scale. There's a difference between a blow-pipe flame and the subterranean fires. Now if I don't find the ore, it will be some comfort to know that I have properly tried." [...] She glanced at her <b>wrist-watch</b> and got up. [...] "It is later than I thought!" ...|$|E
60|$|At last all was ready. The motor was started, and {{we pushed}} the plane {{out into the}} surf. A moment later, and she was {{skimming}} seaward. Gently she rose {{from the surface of}} the water, executed a wide spiral as she mounted rapidly, circled once far above us and then disappeared over the crest of the cliffs. We all stood silent and expectant, our eyes glued upon the towering summit above us. Hollis, who was now in command, consulted his <b>wrist-watch</b> at frequent intervals.|$|E
60|$|By {{and by a}} girl {{came out}} of the shadow, and going to the small landing-stage, looked at her <b>wrist-watch.</b> Cartwright {{imagined}} she did not see him and studied her with some amusement. Barbara looked impatient. People did not often keep her waiting, and she had not inherited her mother's placidity. She had a touch of youthful beauty, and although she was impulsive and rather raw, Cartwright thought her charm would be marked when she met the proper people and, so to speak, got toned down.|$|E
60|$|Graham {{appreciated}} {{and enjoyed}} the ride, although more than once he found himself glancing at his <b>wrist-watch</b> to ascertain how far away five o'clock might yet be. Lambing time was at hand, and through home field after home field he rode with his host, now one and now the other dismounting to turn over onto its feet rotund and glorious Shropshire and Ramboullet-Merino ewes so hopelessly the product of man's selection as to be unable to get off, of themselves, from their own broad backs, once they were down with their four legs helplessly sky-aspiring.|$|E
6000|$|... “My dear, he’s {{done all}} {{that is to be}} done in that {{direction}} already. He’s got rid of his <b>wrist-watch</b> and his hunting flask and both his cigarette cases, and I shouldn’t be surprised if he’s wearing imitation-gold sleeve links instead of those his Aunt Rhoda gave him on his seventeenth birthday. He can’t sell his clothes, of course, except his winter overcoat, and I’ve locked that up in the camphor cupboard on the pretext of preserving it from moth. I really don’t see what else he can raise money on. I consider that I’ve been both firm and farseeing.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boys, I've got {{to admit}} it. I've never worn a <b>wrist-watch,</b> or parted my name in the middle, but I will confess to 'Follansbee.' My only {{justification}} is that my old dad--though otherwise he was perfectly sane, and packed an awful wallop {{when it came to}} trimming the City Fellers at checkers--named me after the family doc, old Dr. Ambrose Follansbee. I apologize, boys. In my next what-d'you-call-it I'll see to it that I get named something really practical--something that sounds swell and yet is good and virile--something, in fact, like that grand old name so familiar to every household--that bold and almost overpowering name, Willis Jimjams Ijams!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [CHLOE {{looks at}} her <b>wrist-watch,</b> goes to the writing-table, [...] which is old-fashioned, with a secret drawer, looks round her, [...] dives at the secret drawer, takes out a roll of notes and a [...] tissue paper parcel. She counts the notes: [...] "Three hundred." [...] Slips them into her breast and unwraps the little parcel. It [...] {{contains}} pears. She slips them, too, into her dress, looks [...] round startled, replaces the drawer, and regains her place on [...] the sofa, lying prostrate as the door opens, and HORNBLOWER [...] comes in. She does not open her ages, and he stands looking at [...] her a moment before speaking.] ...|$|E
60|$|Her hand {{suddenly}} gripped his. They {{sat there}} for a moment in a strange, disturbing silence. Then the orchestra ceased, the curtain was rung up, the performance, which was in the nature of a music-hall show, with frequent turns and changes, commenced. Popular favourites from every department of the theatrical world, each in turn claimed attention and applause. Katharine watched it all with an interest always strained, a gaiety somewhat hysterical; Jocelyn Thew with the measured pleasure of a critic; Richard with uproarious, if sometimes a little unreal merriment. The time slipped by apparently unnoticed. Suddenly Richard glanced at his <b>wrist-watch</b> and stood up.|$|E
60|$|Her {{wheel of}} Regent's Park was coming full circle, {{and the sun}} was up behind the houses, but still no sound of traffic stirred. She stopped before a flower-bed where was some heliotrope, and took a long, luxurious sniff: She could not resist {{plucking}} a sprig, too, and holding it to her nose. A sudden want of love had run through every nerve and fibre of her; she shivered, standing there with her eyes half closed, above the pale violet blossom. Then, noting by her <b>wrist-watch</b> that it was four o'clock, she hurried on, to get to her bed, for she would have to be on duty again at noon. Oh! the war! She was tired! If only it were over, and one could live!...|$|E
6000|$|Fleur whisked round, {{threw him}} {{a wave of}} her hand. [...] "Good-bye, Mr. M. M.!" [...] she called, and was gone among the rose-trees. She looked at her <b>wrist-watch</b> and {{the windows of the}} house. It struck her as curiously uninhabited. Past six! The pigeons were just {{gathering}} to roost, and sunlight slanted on the dove-cot, on their snowy feathers, and beyond in a shower on the top boughs of the woods. The click of billiard-balls came from the ingle-nook--Jack Cardigan, no doubt; a faint rustling, too, from an eucalyptus-tree, startling Southerner in this old English garden. She reached the verandah, and was passing in, but stopped at the sound of voices from the drawing-room to her left. Mother! Profond! From behind the verandah screen which fenced the ingle-nook she heard these words! ...|$|E
6000|$|Yet, after {{solving the}} Boutell office problem, Una was {{frequently}} requisitioned by [...] "Chas." [...] {{to talk to}} women about the advantages of sites {{for themselves and their}} children, while regular and intelligent (that is, male) salesmen worked their hypnotic arts on the equally regular and intelligent men of the families. Where formerly it had seemed an awesome miracle, like chemistry or poetry, to [...] "close a deal" [...] and bring thousands of dollars into the office, now Una found it quite normal. Responsibility gave her more poise and willingness to take initiative. Her salary was raised to thirty dollars a week. She banked two hundred dollars of commissions, and bought a Japanese-blue silk negligée, a <b>wrist-watch,</b> and the gown of black satin and net recommended by Miss Joline. Yet officially she was still Mr. Truax's secretary; she took his dictation and his moods.|$|E
6000|$|This time {{he moved}} more slowly still, over terrible going, all holes and hummocks. Half {{consciously}} he took cover all he could. The air was {{alive with the}} whistle from machine-gun fire storming across zigzag fashion-alive it was with bullets, dust, and smoke. 'How shall I tell her?' he thought. There would be nothing to tell but just a sort of jagged brown sensation. He kept his eyes steadily before him, not wanting to seethe men falling, not wanting anything to divert him from getting there. He felt the faint fanning of the passing bullets. The second line must be close now. Why didn't that barrage lift? Was this new dodge of firing till the last second going to do them in? Another hundred yards {{and he would be}} bang into it. He flung himself flat and waited; looking at his <b>wrist-watch</b> he noted that his arm was soaked with blood. He thought: 'A wound! Now I shall go home. Thank God! Oh, Noel!' The passing bullets whirled above him; he could hear them even through the screech and thunder of the shell-fire. 'The beastly things!' he thought: A voice beside him gasped out: ...|$|E
6000|$|Twelve o'clock {{dinner at}} the Tubbses' was a very respectable meal, with roasts and {{vegetables}} to which you could devote some skill and energy. But supper was more like an after-thought, a sort of afternoon tea without the <b>wrist-watch</b> conversation. It was soon over, the dishes soon washed, and by seven o'clock the Applebys and Tubbses gathered in the sacred parlor, where ordinary summerites were not welcome, where the family crayon-enlargements hung above the green plush settee from Boston, which was flanked by the teak table which Uncle Joe's Uncle Ira had brought from China, and the whale's vertebræ without which no high-caste Cape Cod household is virtuous. With joy and verbal fireworks, with highly insulting comments on one another's play, began the annual series of cribbage games--a world's series, a Davis cup tournament. Doffing his usual tobacco-chewing, collarless, jocose manner, Uncle Joe reverently took from the what-not the ancestral cribbage-board, carved from a solid walrus-tooth. They stood about exclaiming over it, then fell to. [...] "Fifteen-two, fifteen-four, and a pair is six!" [...] rang out, triumphantly. Finally (as happened every year {{on the occasion of}} their first game), when the men had magnificently won, Mrs. Tubbs surprised them with refreshments--they would have been jolly well surprised if she hadn't surprised them--and Father played recent New York musical comedy songs on his new mouth-organ, stopping to explain the point of each, whereupon Mother shook her head and said, warningly, [...] "Now, Father, you be careful what you say. Honestly, I don't know what the world is coming to, Mrs. Tubbs, the way men carry on nowadays." [...] But she wasn't very earnest about it because she was gigglingly aware that Uncle Joe was stealing Mrs. Tubbs's share of the doughnuts.|$|E
6000|$|The {{words came}} quite {{smoothly}} and naturally. They were Wynn's own words, and Wynn {{was a gentleman}} who for no consideration on earth would have torn little Edna into those vividly coloured strips and strings. But this thing hunched under the oak-tree had done that thing. It was no question of reading horrors out of newspapers to Miss Fowler. Mary had seen it with her own eyes on the 'Royal Oak' kitchen table. She must not allow her mind to dwell upon it. Now Wynn was dead, and everything connected with him was lumping and rustling and tinkling under her busy poker into red black dust and grey leaves of ash. The thing beneath the oak would die too. Mary had seen death more than once. She came of a family that had a knack of dying under, as she told Miss Fowler, 'most distressing circumstances.' She would stay where she was till she was entirely satisfied that It was dead--dead as dear papa in the late 'eighties; aunt Mary in eighty-nine; mamma in 'ninety-one; cousin Dick in ninety-five; Lady McCausland's housemaid in 'ninety-nine; Lady McCausland's sister in nineteen hundred and one; Wynn buried five days ago; and Edna Gerritt still waiting for decent earth to hide her. As she thought--her underlip caught up by one faded canine, brows knit and nostrils wide--she wielded the poker with lunges that jarred the grating at the bottom, and careful scrapes round the brick-work above. She looked at her <b>wrist-watch.</b> It was getting on to half-past four, and the rain was coming down in earnest. Tea would be at five. If It did not die before that time, she would be soaked {{and would have to}} change. Meantime, and this occupied her, Wynn's things were burning well in spite of the hissing wet, though now and again a book-back with a quite distinguishable title would be heaved up out of the mass. The exercise of stoking had given her a glow which seemed to reach to the marrow of her bones. She hummed--Mary never had a voice--to herself. She had never believed in all those advanced views--though Miss Fowler herself leaned a little that way--of woman's work in the world; but now she saw there was much to be said for them. This, for instance, was her work--work which no man, least of all Dr. Hennis, would ever have done. A man, at such a crisis, would be what Wynn called a 'sportsman'; would leave everything to fetch help, and would certainly bring It into the house. Now a woman's business was to make a happy home for--for a husband and children. Failing these--it was not a thing one should allow one's mind to dwell upon--but-- ...|$|E
6000|$|And at {{that hour}} Cyril Morland, under the parapet of his trench, {{tightening}} his belt, was looking at his <b>wrist-watch</b> for the hundredth time, calculating exactly where he meant to put foot and hand for the going over: 'I absolutely mustn't let those chaps {{get in front of}} me,' he thought. So many yards before the first line of trenches, so many yards to the second line, and there stop. So his rehearsals had gone; it was the performance now! Another minute before the terrific racket of the drum-fire should become the curtain-fire, which would advance before them. He ran his eye down the trench. The man next him was licking his two first fingers, as if he might be going to bowl at cricket. Further down, a man was feeling his puttees. A voice said: [...] "Wot price the orchestra nah!" [...] He saw teeth gleam in faces burnt almost black. Then he looked up; the sky was blue beyond the brownish film of dust raised by the striking shells. Noel! Noel! Noel!... He dug his fingers deep into {{the left side of his}} tunic till he could feel the outline of her photograph between his dispatch-case and his heart. His heart fluttered just as it used when he was stretched out with hand touching the ground, before the start of the [...] "hundred yards" [...] at school. Out of the corner of his eye he caught the flash of a man's [...] "briquet" [...] lighting a cigarette. All right for those chaps, but not for him; he wanted all his breath--this rifle, and kit were handicap enough! Two days ago he had been reading in some paper how men felt just before an attack. And now he knew. He just felt nervous. If only the moment would come, and get itself over! For all the thought he gave to the enemy there might have been none--nothing but shells and bullets, with lives of their own. He heard the whistle; his foot was on the spot he had marked down; his hand where he had seen it; he called out: [...] "Now, boys!" [...] His head was over the top, his body over; he was conscious of someone falling, and two men neck and neck beside him. Not to try and run, not to break out of a walk; to go steady, and yet keep ahead! D--n these holes! A bullet tore through his sleeve, grazing his arm--a red-hot sensation, like the touch of an iron. A British shell from close over his head burst sixty yards ahead; he stumbled, fell flat, picked himself up. Three ahead of him now! He walked faster, and drew alongside. Two of them fell. 'What luck!' he thought; and gripping his rifle harder, pitched headlong into a declivity. Dead bodies lay there! The first German trench line, and nothing alive in it, nothing to clean up, nothing of it left! He stopped, getting his wind; watching the men panting and stumbling in. The roar of the guns was louder than ever again, barraging the second line. So far, good! And here was his captain! ...|$|E

5000|$|The IBM Card Verifier was {{the first}} {{commercial}} device to use infrared LEDs. The LEDs replaced tungsten bulbs that controlled punched card readers. Infrared light was sent through the holes or blocked by the card, which not only significantly reduced the size and power required, but also improved the reliability. In November 1978, Tom M. Hyltin, a former engineering manager at Texas Instruments, published a book titled [...] "The Digital Electronic Watch", in which he cited Dr. Biard and Gary Pittman's 1961 discovery as being fundamentally important {{to the creation of}} the digital <b>wrist-watch.</b>|$|E

50|$|In retailiation for {{the public}} and private humiliations heaped on him, and in order to teach her a lesson, Maya Din went to the local cops and accused Phoolan of {{stealing}} small items belonging to him, including a gold ring and a <b>wrist-watch.</b> The cops, who belonged to nearby villages, knew Phoolan and her family well, and they did what the family wanted. They kept Phoolan in jail for three days, gave her a sound thrashing, and then let her off with a warning to behave better in future and live quietly without quarreling with her family or with others. Phoolan never forgave her cousin for this incident.|$|E
50|$|Rapidly {{changing}} fashions in clothing {{brought new}} styles of jewelry. Sleeveless dresses of the 1920s meant that arms needed decoration, and designers quickly created bracelets of gold, silver and platinum encrusted with lapis-lazuli, onyx, coral, and other colorful stones; Other bracelets were {{intended for the}} upper arms, and several bracelets were often worn at the same time. The short haircuts {{of women in the}} twenties called for elaborate deco earring designs. As women began to smoke in public, designers created very ornate cigarette cases and ivory cigarette holders. The invention of the <b>wrist-watch</b> before World War I inspired jewelers to create extraordinary decorated watches, encrusted with diamonds and plated with enamel, gold and silver. Pendant watches, hanging from a ribbon, also became fashionable.|$|E
5000|$|Coblentz {{was raised}} in a pacifistic and insular Amish Mennonite {{community}} in Hartville, Ohio. [...] Although {{the community as a whole}} was skeptical of higher education and advanced technology, Coblentz has described his father, Alvin S.

[...] A biography of Alvin describes his design of a mechanical device that enabled the operation of an automobile accelerator and brake with a single pedal, compensating for his physical disability and allowing him to get a driver’s license. Coblentz has also spoken of his father's creation, in the mid-1960s, of a functioning radio in a <b>wrist-watch</b> case, an invention that was never brought to market because of Alvin's lack of familiarity with the US patent process. The family of eight subsisted on the $200 per month Alvin earned from publishing a conservative Mennonite periodical, The Fellowship Messenger.|$|E
