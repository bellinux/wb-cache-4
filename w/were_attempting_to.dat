5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the war two days earlier, the US forces <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> evacuate US civilians and diplomats from the city of Seoul, where a battle was ongoing between North and South Korean forces. Transport aircraft and ships, escorted by US fighter planes, <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> bring civilians out of the country as fast as possible. During these missions on June 27, US forces were attacked by North Korean aircraft in two separate incidents in the Seoul area. Despite being outnumbered, the better-built American aircraft outmaneuvered the North Koreans, quickly shooting down half of the attacking force.|$|E

On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march overland towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E

They saw one rail station and released their bombs and returned home. They saw only one British fighter, No. 46 Squadron’s Pilot Officer Gunning who reported the make up of the formation. Park had decided to ignore their raid.|$|E
5|$|German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> clear British-laid minefields in the Heligoland Bight in late 1917.

5|$|In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway {{to protect}} {{shipments}} of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> {{cut off by}} unilaterally mining neutral Norwegian waters. Denmark capitulated after a few hours, and despite Allied support, during which the important harbour of Narvik temporarily was recaptured from the Germans, Norway was conquered within two months.

5|$|In July 1942, Harada was {{reassigned to}} the {{aircraft}} carrier Hiyō. In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan {{to take part in}} the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with his bare hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.|$|E

The battleship, along with her sister ships {{and the rest of the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, were mobilized to support the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau from 28 July to 10 August 1914. The two German battlecruisers were stationed in the Mediterranean Sea and <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> break out of the strait of Messina, which was surrounded by British troops and vessels, and make their way to Turkey.

5|$|McCoy led the Longhorns, {{who were}} ranked number {{four in the}} {{pre-season}} Associated Press Poll and Coaches Poll, to a 21–13 victory over unranked Arkansas State in the season opener.

He averaged thirty yards per kick and both kicks were downed inside the opponent's twenty yard-line. In the second game, McCoy led the Longhorns to a 34–13 victory over #19-ranked TCU.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the area}} where Bernetz Brook enters the La Chute, Captain Trépezet and his troop, who <b>were</b> <b>attempting</b> <b>to</b> return to the French lines, {{encountered}} Phineas Lyman's Connecticut regiment, sparking a skirmish in the woods. General Howe's column was near the action, so he led it in that direction. As they approached the battle scene, General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball. A column of Massachusetts provincials, also drawn to the battle, cut off the French patrol's rear. In desperate fighting, about 150 of Trepézet's men were killed, and another 150 were captured. Fifty men, including Trepézet, escaped by swimming across the La Chute. Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle.|$|E
