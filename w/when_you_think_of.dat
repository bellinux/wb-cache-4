500|$|Weiner {{said that}} the episode is [...] "about the {{children}}. It's about {{who is going to}} take care of the children. Youth is a big part of our lives in general. Now and then. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the sixties and the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you." [...] Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was [...] "of the next wave" [...] as a youthful employee who is [...] "unfamiliar with social rules", with Weiner also declaring that [...] "there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people".|$|E
500|$|On November 25, 2002, Smith was {{involved}} in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a concert where The Flaming Lips and Beck were performing. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. The officers allegedly beat and arrested him and Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith's back was injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith's, stated concern over Smith's appearance and actions, saying that he [...] "saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn't want in a person. It's not like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When you think of a visual style, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E

5000|$|Clarence Day, Jr: [...] "...outside {{green is}} the best color." [...] Mary Skinner: [...] "That's right. I {{never thought of it}} that way. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it - it's quite a thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{might get}} up the lakes," [...] the scout said; [...] "but the {{mischief}} {{would be in the}} woods. No, it never would do, captain. If we goes, it must be the three of us and no more. <b>When</b> do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> starting?" ...|$|R
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cognitive}} {{effects of}} anxiety may include thoughts about suspected dangers, such as fear of dying. [...] "You may... {{fear that the}} chest pains are a deadly heart attack or that the shooting pains in your head {{are the result of}} a tumor or an aneurysm. You feel an intense fear <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> dying, or you may think of it more often than normal, or can't get it out of your mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, Raines married Virginia Hilton, {{a classmate}} at Seminole High School. The couple had two children: Tim Jr. ("Little Rock"), and André ("Little Hawk"). In high school, {{he was a}} running back and has said he enjoyed {{football}} [...] more than baseball at the time. [...] On the matter between the two he reflects, [...] "...in football I was a running back, so in the NFL my career would have probably lasted {{six or seven years}} and in baseball I ended up playing 23 years. In baseball you can play a long time so I think it's better <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it in that way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back {{in those}} days [...] it was RCA, our record label then, went over the edge with Virgin Killer. Today <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> child {{pornography}} on the net, you would never do something like that. We never did this {{in the sense of}} pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, [...] "Look what we just released.." [...] There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved. All of that after so many years, can you believe that? ...|$|E
