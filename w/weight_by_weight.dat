50|$|Amylose and {{amylopectin}} {{are both}} components of starch and polysaccharides made from D-glucose units. The {{big difference between}} the two is that amylose is linear because it only has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Amylopectin on the other hand, is a branched polysaccharide because it has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds with occasional αlpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds approximately every 22 D-glucose units. Glutinous rice is nearly 100% composed of amylopectin (one of the two components that makes up starch) and almost completely lacks its counterpart, amylose, in its starch granules.

The Ag–TiO 2 thin films had the <b>weight</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> (w/w) ratio of Ag+/TiO 2 of 0. 1 % as Ag atom. The XRD results showed that the crystalline phase structure of TiO 2 on the Ag–TiO 2 thin films was anatase. The optical band gaps of the TiO 2 and 0. 1 % Ag–TiO 2 thin films were respectively 3. 27 and 2. 70 eV, while the surface of the prepared catalysts was hydrophobic with the respective average water contact angles of 94. 8 ° and 118. 5 ° for the TiO 2 and 0. 1 % Ag–TiO 2 thin films. The net efficiencies of photocatalytic nitrate reduction of TiO 2 and 0. 1 % Ag–TiO 2 were 41. 4 % and 70. 0 %, respectively. The loading of Ag only influenced the nitrate removal efficiency without affecting the stoichiometric ratio of formate to nitrate.

To investigate the effects of sucrose, trehalose, sucrose/ dextran mixtures, and sucrose/ trehalose mixtures on the preservation of the native structure of spray- dried lysozyme in the solid state. Methods. The intensity of the alpha-helical band and the melting enthalpies (DeltaH(m)) of spray-dried lysozyme in the dried form and in aqueous solution were obtained using second derivative FTIR and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) respectively. Results. The intensity of the alpha- helical band and the DeltaH(m) of spray-dried lysozyme obtained were linearly correlated and both suggest that the stabilization of lysozyme in the dried form was excipient concentration- dependent with a close to maximum stabilization being conferred by sucrose or trehalose at a mass ratio 1 - 2 (sugar: enzyme). Sucrose appeared to be more effective than trehalose on a <b>weight</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> basis whilst stabilizing effects of dextran/ sucrose or trehalose/ sucrose mixtures were found to be additive. Conclusion. Dehydration during spray drying was considered the main stress to the denaturation of lysozyme. A major effect of the sugars in protecting lysozyme against dehydration was attributable to hydrogen bonding between the sugar and protein molecules, which lead to an increase in the change in the negative value of the free energy between native and denatured states...|$|E

In this study enzymatic extracts of citronella were fractionated using supercritical carbon dioxide extraction to have different oil extracts in three different parameters, 10 megapascal (10 MPa), 20 megapascal (20 MPa) and 30 megapascal (30 MPa) at constant temperature at 40 ° Celsius. The highest oil yield is at 20 MPa with an average of 10. 21 for three trials of extraction, followed by 10 MPa and 30 MPa with 4. 89 and 2. 15. Oil extract at 10 MPa was subjected to gas chromatography- mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and found four components in which 2 -methyl- 5 -(1 -methylethyl) bicycle hexan 2 -ol or trans sabinene hydrate and 4 -methanol-o-Menth- 8 -ene or elemol was the major compounds.

The main result is that the elastic modulus, G, approximated by the yield stress, σ 0, of the paste is a key parameter in these relationships. Increasing the solid/liquid (<b>weight</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight)</b> ratio in the paste from 0. 05 to 0. 10 leads (i) to a dramatic rise of σ 0, from — 1. 5 Pa to ∼ 140 Pa; (ii) to a decrease of the average finger width, according to a σ- 0. 250 power law; (iii) to an abrupt change of the tips profile — from convex to concave — which can be rationalized either in terms of the cusp singularity predicted by Shraiman and Bensimon in the zero surface tension limit, or, more likely, in terms of the onset of fracture phenomena; (iv) to an opening of the average branching angle β up to β = π / 2 and to the development of asymmetric branching. When taken together, the results suggest that the highly branched structure of viscoelastic fingers is controlled to a large extent by the elastic properties of the pushed medium, the elastic response limiting the speed of the tips.

Methods We used fasting blood samples and longitudinal weight data for 5, 436 adults (5, 734 observations, aged 18 – 66 years) from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1991 – 2009). Using latent class trajectory analysis, we iden-tified different weight gain trajectories in six age and sex strata, and used multivariable general linear mixed effects models to assess elevated metabolic markers of diabetes (fasting glucose, HbA 1 c, HOMA-IR, insulin) across weight trajectory classes. Models were fitted within age and sex strata, and controlled for baseline weight (or baseline <b>weight</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> trajectory interaction terms), height, and smoking habit, with random intercepts to control for community-level correlations. Results Compared with weight gain, classes with weight maintenance, weight loss, or a switch from weight gain to loss had lower values for metabolic markers of diabetes. These associations were stronger among younger women (aged 18 – 29 and 30 – 39 years) and men (18 – 29 years) than in older (40 – 66 years) men and women. An exception was HOMA-IR, which showed class differences across all ages (at least p< 0. 004).

The addition of sub-micron filler particles in direct <b>weight</b> <b>by</b> <b>weight</b> replacement of aluminosilicate glass of a control material has increased the ultimate compressive strength of the new cement from 206 MPa (control) to 250 MPa after 365 days of aging. The strength of the new filler enhanced cements were comparable with the control material after 3 hours. The setting chemistry of the filler enhanced cements follows the same order as the control cement but at a decelerated rate. Theoretical modelling found that a large volume of sub-micron filler could fit into interstitial spacing in formed cement however the alteration of the aluminosilicate glass to polyelectrolyte ratio has been found to drastically alter the cement setting time. The use of cubic and polyhedral shaped filler particles as supposed to spherical particles may increase the cement strength further as greater packing densities are achieved.

The retention time of aliphatic organic acids measured under the conditions outlined in experiment 1. was pyruvic (6. 70),gluconic (7. 90), glyceric (9. 10),lactic (9. 70), formic (10. 50), glycolic (11. 20), acetic (13. 80), propionic (14. 30), and acrylic acid (16. 20). As the pKa of the aliphatic organic acid increases the retention times increases and {{it can also be}} seen in table 4. 1 that as the number of carbon numbers in the compounds increase the retention time increases. The identification of aliphatic acids formed during the alkali catalysed decomposition of cellulose in the experiments following at least six different acids are being produced in significant amounts and these are saccharinic acids, glycolic acid, lactic acid, formic acid and the final peak is that of the internal standard acrylic acid. It is very clear that at room temperature the lactic acid is the most abundant decomposition product followed by glycolic acid with formic acid being present in much smaller amount.

5000|$|Balanced ternary {{has other}} {{applications}} besides computing. For example, a classical two-pan balance, with one weight for each power of 3, can weigh relatively heavy objects accurately {{with a small}} number of <b>weights,</b> <b>by</b> moving <b>weights</b> between the two pans and the table. For example, with weights for each power of 3 through 81, a 60-gram object (60dec = 1T1T0bal3) will be balanced perfectly with an 81 gram weight in the other pan, the 27 gram weight in its own pan, the 9 gram weight in the other pan, the 3 gram weight in its own pan, and the 1 gram weight set aside.|$|R
