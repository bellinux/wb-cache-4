5|$|Life with My Sister Madonna, {{a book by}} Madonna's brother Christopher, debuted {{at number}} two on The New York Times bestseller list. The book caused some {{friction}} between Madonna and her brother, because of the unsolicited publication. Madonna eventually filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. On December 15, 2008, Madonna's spokeswoman announced that the singer had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of which grant him between £50 million and £60 million, a figure that includes {{the value of the}} couple's London pub and residence and Wiltshire estate in England.

25|$|Regardless of {{the playoff}} format, {{the top six}} teams had {{qualified}} for the following season's Heineken Cup in {{the final years of}} that competition, and since 2013–14 a minimum of six teams qualify for the European Rugby Champions Cup. Before the 2009–10 season, the seventh-place team also qualified if a French club advanced farther in that season's Heineken Cup than any team from England or Italy. While the European qualification system was changed for 2009–10, the normal contingent of six Top 14 teams in the Heineken Cup did not change. The default number of French teams in the Champions Cup has remained at six, but the method for a seventh French team to qualify has changed from performance in the previous European season to a post-season playoff. For the inaugural Champions Cup in 2014–15, this playoff involved the seventh-place teams from both England and the Top 14; in future years, the same two sides <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by one Pro12 side.|$|E
