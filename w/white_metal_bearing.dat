40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} demands in hydropower and other industries today stems from the emphasis on preserving the environment. Usage of mineral and synthetic oils in sliding bearings of hydropower plants raises concerns about the environmental impact of these lubricants in case of spillage into downstream water. These concerns have led to attempts in using water as lubricant and the concept of oil-free systems in hydropower generation. Realization of this concept however poses many challenges including the choice of bearing materials and this necessitated research pertaining to the tribological behaviour of polymers in lubricated conditions. In this work, several studies have been carried out in order to obtain an insight into polymers’ tribological performance and associated mechanisms in the presence of lubricants. Extensive tribological studies on several unfilled polymers in water lubricated contacts demonstrated the superior wear resistance of UHMWPE. It was also found that the frictional behaviour of the unfilled polymers was influenced by their water contact angle and relative energy difference with regard to water. Studies on the effect of counter surface roughness characteristics on tribological behaviour of polymeric materials revealed their significant influence on friction and wear behaviour of polymer-metal contacts. Using a small scale journal bearing configuration, it was found that dynamic friction of polymer bearings can be significantly reduced using a shaft of reduced surface roughness. However, depending on the bearing material, this can adversely affect the material’s breakaway frictional response and thereby increase the torque required for machine start-up; a critical issue in applications such as pumped storage hydropower plants. Further studies using a pin on plate configuration revealed that variations in surface roughness characteristics of the metallic counter surfaces can significantly alter the wear resistance of the polymeric materials which cannot modify the topography of the counter surfaces in a tribological contact. Investigations regarding the influence of incorporation of various micro/nano carbon based fillers/reinforcements in the polymer matrix revealed their great potential for enhancing the friction and wear behaviour of the polymer composites. However these effects {{have been found to be}} strongly influenced by presence/absence of other reinforcements in the polymer matrix and/or by alterations in the operating conditions. Application of polymers as bearing lining materials also exhibits the potential of enhancing the performance of oil lubricated bearings. Therefore a part of this work was aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics of several polytetrafluoroethylene based materials at the onset of sliding (breakaway) at various pressures and temperatures. The results of this study showed dramatic reduction in breakaway friction using PTFE based materials in comparison to the conventional Babbitt (<b>white</b> <b>metal)</b> <b>bearing</b> lining material utilized in oil-lubricated sliding bearings of hydropower plants.

40|$|Due to {{government}} regulations together with {{health and safety}} reasons, there are increasing demands on reducing hazardous polluting chemicals from fossil fuel power plants. Therefore, more efforts are imposed on using renewable resources such as water, wind, solar and tide to produce clean/green electricity. On top of that, there is another increasing demand from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to operate power plants with higher load while keep the power loss to the minimum. These requirements drive conventional fluid film bearings to its mechanical and temperature limits. This calls {{for the development of}} new bearing system designs. An outstanding tribological performance such as low start-up and break-away friction, excellent resistance to chemical attack and anti-seizure properties, can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bearings.</b> The research approach of this thesis is to implement compliant liner on bearing surface, impose synchronous shaft excitation and investigate the effect of bearing design parameters on bearing dynamic response. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a FEM approach. The numerical model was compared with an in-house developed code based on the finite difference method (FDM) for a bearing operated at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Dynamic behaviour of the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry was compared with published data. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, radial clearance, pivot offset, and pad inclination angles. Influence of the elastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. Misalignments in compliant tilting pad journal bearings were analysed for load between pivots and load on pivots with consideration of thermal effects. Significant improvements in bearing performance were obtained with compliant <b>bearings</b> compared to <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bearings.</b> Furthermore, different polymer materials (PTFE, UHMWPE, pure PEEK and PEEK composite) were characterized using Frequency Response Function (FRF). It was shown that as the excitation frequency increased the equivalent stiffness was more or less constant while equivalent damping decreased exponentially. PTFE had similar equivalent stiffness compared to PEEK. As for equivalent damping, PTFE had slightly higher damping compared to PEEK or UHMWPE. Oil film thickness, oil film temperature and loads on tilting pad journal bearing were measured on 10 MW Kaplan hydroelectric power machine. Test results were compared to FEM model. It was shown that stiffness of the supporting structure may be more important to machine performance than the stiffness of the bearing alone. QC 20150409 Swedish Hydropower Centr...|$|R

Also, due to the power grid regulations, hydroelectric power plants undergo more frequent start-ups and shut-downs. During such transient periods, a large amplitude shaft motion can occur, especially in the power plants with vertical shafts. Large shaft motion is not desirable because {{it can lead to}} a machine failure. Furthermore, performance limitations of conventional <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> or babbitted <b>bearings</b> call for the development of new bearing designs.

40|$|In general, {{the bearing}} alloys have {{two types of}} {{microstructure}} i. e., either a soft matrix with discrete hard particles or a continuous matrix of the harder metal with small amount of the softer metal finely dispersed in it. The aluminium and copper based bearing alloys which are widely studied fall in the second category. However, the bearing materials which have been studied have micron sized dispersoids. In recent times, {{it is possible to}} produce nanoscale dispersoids in a hard matrix by the novel processing route of rapid solidification. This offers an opportunity to study the small length scale effect on tribological processes. In this thesis, we deal with aluminium alloys where nanoscaled dispersions of lead, bismuth and indium are produced by rapid solidification processing. Chapter 1 of the thesis is an introduction, followed by Chapter 2, which reviews the literature on nanomaterials. Special attention is given to the monotectic system, followed by a brief description on friction and wear of materials which is necessary for our present investigation. The details of experimental and characterisation techniques are given in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, we present a brief study of <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> <b>bearings</b> (babbit). Tin-based babbit of composition, Sn- 6 wt% Cu-llwt% Sb was studied. The study of babbit was mainly carried out with the idea that it could serve as a benchmark for subsequent studies in aluminium alloys, in terms of tribological properties. In particular, we have carried out a detailed electron microscopic investigation on the phases present in the bearing alloy. The friction and wear behaviour of this material confirms the proper calibration of our setup for wear studies. This is followed by a detailed study on the synthesis, microstructure and tribological behaviour of nanodispersed aluminium alloys, Al- 6 wt% Pb and Al- 10 wt% Pb in Chapter 5. For comparison, we have also studied melt-spun aluminium without dispersoids. Detailed electron microscopic characterisation indicates that lead has a cube on cube orientation relationship with the aluminium matrix, and the particles exhibit a lognormal distribution with the mode of the particle size distribution being 15 nm. The pin on disc results suggest a distinct lowering of coefficient of friction corresponding to pure aluminium (μ= 0. 40) and as cast aluminium-lead alloys (μ= 0. 41). Detailed SEM studies indicate a tribolayer consisting primarily of Al, Pb and Fe. The later comes from the counterface material. Our results clearly indicate that at an early stage, little or no oxidation takes place at the sliding interface. TEM observations indicate significant deformation of lead particles in the sub-surface region. The observations suggest spreading of the lead, which acts as a lubricating layer. Wear behaviour is primarily adhesive and follows Archard's wear law. However, the rate of wear is less than that reported by other investigators on micronsized lead dispersions in aluminium. In Chapter 6, we present the results for alloys dispersed with nanosized indium and bismuth. We show that indium particles on melt-spinning exhibit both cubic and tetragonal crystal structure. The indium particles are coarser (with a mode of 25 nm) than the lead and bismuth particles (which have mode of 15 nm). The bismuth containing alloys have a lower wear rate and coefficient of friction compared to lead and indium alloys. However, both indium and bismuth particles do not follow Archard's wear law and the wear vs load graph shows a non-linear behaviour. The results are discussed in terms of known mechanisms of the coefficient of friction and wear. Chapter 7 gives the salient conclusions while in Chapter 8 we discuss some of the unanswered questions and the potential for future work in this field...|$|R

Two principal conclusions were drawn: (1) Growth was observed for all the strains examined suggesting that the strains can be acclimated to <b>metals</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters. (2) Solution pH increased from neutral to alkaline values during growth (pH(initial) = 7, pH(final) = 10). The later was observed systematically for all strains. Metal precipitation, due to the metabolically generated alkalinity is expected as a result. Supporting evidence for this hypothesis was provided during the operation of two pilot moving bed sand filters treating two different <b>metal</b> <b>bearing</b> wastewaters. Acetate was used as carbon source to support the growth and maintenance of microbial biomass on the sand grains of the filters. The characteristics of the sludge produced from the operation of the pilot plants were subsequently studied in the laboratory. Both sludges were significantly loaded with large amounts of metals. A mechanism of metal precipitation induced by the metabolically generated alkalinity, when acetate is used as carbon source, could be proposed as the main process responsible for the metals sequestering inside the moving bed sandfilter reactor.
