There are many problems in the existing wired fire alarm system, such as long construction period, large investment, maintenance problems, omissions, higher rate of false, etc. Cables {{are one of the}} weakest links. Once broken when the fire occurs, they will lead to signal failure in a large scope. Therefore, <b>wireless</b> <b>fire</b> alarm system is urgently demanded.

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} distributed, safety {{critical}} real-time systems is challenging {{due to their}} high complexity, the potentially large number of components, and complicated requirements and environment assump-tions. Our case study shows that despite those challenges, the automated formal verification of such systems is not only possible, but practicable even {{in the context of}} small to medium-sized enterprises. We considered a <b>wireless</b> <b>fire</b> alarm system and uncovered severe design flaws. For an improved design, we provided dependable verification results which in particular ensure that conformance tests for a relevant regulation stan-dard will be passed. In general we observe that if system tests are spec-ified by generalized test procedures, then verifying that a system will pass any test following these test procedures is a cost-efficient approach to improve product quality based on formal methods. ...|$|E

For safety important applications like <b>wireless</b> <b>fire</b> sensor networks, this characteristic assigns a hard task. This thesis implements a highly reliable monitoring system that uses low power, addressing the fact, that nodes in a wireless sensor network are mostly battery powered. We achieved reliability with redundant information flow and acknowledged messaging.

Besides their {{entertaining}} effects fireworks are essen-tially colored explosives which are sometimes directly used as weapons. Modern fireworks systems heavily rely on wire-less pyrotechnic firing systems. Those embedded cyber-physical systems (ECPS) are able to remotely control pyrotechnic composition ignition. The failure to properly secure these computer sub-systems may have disastrous, if not deadly, consequences.

5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s color had started {{replacing}} {{black and white}} for shooting weddings, and electronic flash guns replaced flash bulbs. A technical shortcoming of color was a much shorter range on the prints which could not reproduce {{the full range of}} detail in a photograph containing a bride in white dress standing with the groom in a black suit when a single flash on camera was used. Familiar with conventional studio lighting, thanks in part to training with New Jersey photographer Joe Zeltsman, Monte understood that the solution to the shorter range film was to control the range of the scene with two lights; one off camera for modeling (key light), over a foundation of even centered light (fill) to control the tone of the shadows. With the invention of the photo-cell trigger which allowed <b>wireless</b> <b>firing</b> of the off-camera [...] "key" [...] flash, Monte utilized the technology to create studio-like lighting [...] "on the fly" [...] at wedding receptions using two identical direct flash units, one mounted over the camera as fill to control the shadow tone and a second optically triggered key light for 3D modeling which he mounted on a rolling converted medical IV stand, a clever solution to the logistics of working with the off-camera light.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{behavior}} of timed automata consists of idleness and ac-tivity, i. e. delay and action transitions. We study {{a class of}} timed au-tomata with periodic phases of activity. We show that, if the phases of activity of timed automata in a network are disjoint, then location reachability for the network can be decided using a concatenation of timed automata. This reduces the complexity of verification in Uppaal-like tools from quadratic to linear time (in the number of components) while traversing the same reachable state space. We provide templates which imply, by construction, the applicability of sequential composition, a variant of concatenation, which reflects relevant reachability properties while removing an exponential number of states. Our approach covers the class of TDMA-based (Time Division Multiple Access) protocols, e. g. FlexRay and TTP. We have successfully applied our approach to an industrial TDMA-based protocol of a <b>wireless</b> <b>fire</b> alarm system with more than 100 sensors. ...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{wireless}} sensor networking {{has been}} becoming a disruptive technology in such fields as industrial control and monitoring, building automation and security, automotive sensing. The motivation {{for use of}} wireless technology includes the reduction of installation cost, the avoidance of the “last meter connectivity problem” and intelligent maintenance. Many types of wireless sensors, for example fire and intrusion detectors, are based on proprietary solutions, which are uncomfortable for the customer {{because of lack of}} product interoperability and vendor dependence. On the other hand, the lack of standardized technologies that can address the requirements both at the application level and from the communication point of view has become the hurdle of the widespread of wireless sensor systems. The above constraints suggest the necessity of an open global standard to enable the cost-effective, reliable wireless monitoring and control products. The recently finished IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard and the corresponding undergoing Zigbee standard represent the achievements of the efforts addressing these kinds of requirements. Zigbee/ 802. 15. 4 operates at 868 / 915 MHz, or 2. 4 GHz and belongs to classical narrowband transmission systems. An entire opposite transmission approach is based on extremely low power signals with ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB). UWB belongs to the few wireless key emerging technologies and is under intense discussion for various areas of applications, e. g. highest data rates in the order of several hundred MBit/s for indoor communications, ranging and positioning with accuracy in the sub-centimeter range, and recently also for low power and low data rate applications.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} ER-MAC, {{a hybrid}} MAC protocol for emergency response wireless sensor networks. ER-MAC is {{designed as a}} hybrid of the TDMA and CSMA approaches, giving it the flexibility to adapt to traffic and topology changes. It adopts a TDMA approach to schedule collision-free slots. Nodes wake up for their scheduled slots, but otherwise switch into power-saving sleep mode. When an emergency occurs, nodes that participate in the emergency monitoring change their MAC behaviour by allowing contention in TDMA slots to achieve high delivery ratio and low latency. ER-MAC offers a synchronised and loose slot structure to allow nodes to join or leave the network. Simulations in ns- 2 show that ER-MAC outperforms Z-MAC with higher delivery ratio, lower latency, and lower energy consumption.

The expected added value of enabling these integrated operations is NOK 250 billion just in the next few years. A portable display device connected to a video camera can increase both the efficiency and the safety during emergency situations. Based on a feasibility study, it has been demonstrated how such additional portable tools can increase the capabilities of the two existing StatoilHydro systems HazVac and Medical Unit. HazVac gives a better overview of emergency situations. RFID tracking of plant personnel and video surveillance cameras are activated in an intelligent environment when <b>wireless</b> sensors alarm <b>fires</b> or gas leaks. Medical Unit improves the collaboration between offshore nurses and onshore doctors by using video conferencing and data sharing. Stops in production at the processing plant at Tjeldbergodden cost StatoilHydro NOK 6 million a day. Deploying HazVac can possibly decrease the damages by earlier and more detailed warnings of fires and gas leaks. It will be a good investment if it can prevent or at least reduce standstill time. Most important however are health and life. Both HazVac and Medical Unit can improve the safety of the personnel. The wireless sensor networks can help preventing human injuries, while calculation of safe routes will optimise evacuations. Real-time video collaboration can moreover improve the medical treatment of the patients. Field operators can communicate with these two systems by their portable tools.
