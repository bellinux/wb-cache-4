5|$|After the war, H.D. and Bryher {{no longer}} lived together, but {{remained}} in contact. H.D. moved to Switzerland <b>where,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1946, she suffered a severe mental breakdown, {{which resulted in}} her staying in a clinic until the autumn of that year. Apart {{from a number of}} trips to the States, H.D. spent {{the rest of her life}} in Switzerland. In the late 1950s, she underwent more treatment, this time with the psychoanalyst Erich Heydt. At Heydt's prompting, she wrote End to Torment, a memoir of her relationship with Pound, who allowed the poems of Hilda's Book to be included when the book was published. Doolittle was one of the leading figures in the bohemian culture of London in the early decades of the century. Her later poetry explores traditional epic themes, such as violence and war, from a feminist perspective. H.D. was the first woman to be granted the American Academy of Arts and Letters medal.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{seemingly}} {{loved his}} young wife, lavishing gifts on her. On {{the occasion of}} their first New Year in 1386, {{he gave her a}} red velvet palfrey saddle, trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for Karol and Elisabeth), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, tableware and clothing. The uncles too, apparently, were pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and Michel Pintoin (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire and based on her beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles went on a military campaign against the English, and Isabeau went to Creil to live with his step great-grandmother Queen Dowager Blanche, who taught her courtly traditions. In September she took up residence at the Château de Vincennes, <b>where</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early years of their marriage Charles frequently joined her, and which became her favorite home.|$|E

The King's final remaining forces, by now besieged in Caerphilly Castle, surrendered after five months in April 1327.|$|E
