40|$|Abstract Background The {{bottom-up}} programming {{of living}} organisms to implement novel user-defined biological capabilities {{is one of}} the main goals of synthetic biology. Currently, a predominant problem connected with the construction of even simple synthetic biological systems is the unpredictability of the genetic circuitry when assembled and incorporated in living cells. Copy number, transcriptional/translational demand and toxicity of the DNA-encoded functions are some of the major factors which may lead to cell overburdening and thus to nonlinear effects on system output. It is important to disclose the linearity <b>working</b> <b>boundaries</b> of engineered biological systems when dealing with such phenomena. Results The output of an N- 3 -oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (HSL) -inducible RFP-expressing device was studied in Escherichia coli in different copy number contexts, ranging from 1 copy per cell (integrated in the genome) to hundreds (via multicopy plasmids). The system is composed by a luxR constitutive expression cassette and a RFP gene regulated by the luxI promoter, which is activated by the HSL-LuxR complex. System output, in terms of promoter activity as a function of HSL concentration, was assessed relative to the one of a reference promoter in identical conditions by using the Relative Promoter Units (RPU) approach. Nonlinear effects were observed in the maximum activity, which is identical in single and low copy conditions, while it decreases for higher copy number conditions. In order to properly compare the luxI promoter strength among all the conditions, a mathematical modeling approach was used to relate the promoter activity to the estimated HSL-LuxR complex concentration, which is the actual activator of transcription. During model fitting, a correlation between the copy number and the dissociation constant of HSL-LuxR complex and luxI promoter was observed. Conclusions Even in a simple inducible system, nonlinear effects are observed and non-trivial data processing is necessary to fully characterize its operation. The in-depth analysis of model systems like this can contribute to the advances in the synthetic biology field, since increasing the knowledge about linearity and <b>working</b> <b>boundaries</b> of biological phenomena could lead to a more rational design of artificial systems, also through mathematical models, which, for example, have been used here to study hard-to-predict interactions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Adversary {{disrupts}} victim's {{communication channels}} through jamming in wireless ad hoc network governed by reactive protocols. Though the attack models {{are classified as}} both external and internal with the later being more serious because the “always-on” strategy employed in external model has several disadvantages. First, the adversary has to expend {{a significant amount of}} energy to jam frequency bands of interest. Second, the continuous presence of unusually high interference levels makes this type of attacks easy to detect. In an internal threat model an adversary is assumed to be aware of network secrets and the implementation details of network protocols at any layer in the network stack. The adversary exploits his internal knowledge for launching selective jamming attacks in which specific messages of “high importance” are targeted. Although RREQ, RREP, RERR, RREP-ACK are primary Message Formats in reactive protocols, the adversary selectively targets RREQ and RREP packets in the network to launch jamming attacks. Prior approaches concentrated on using commitment schemes that are cryptographic primitives to hide the RREQ and RREP packets from the purview of the adversary. These approaches being successful, we propose to use them along with intrusion detection techniques for identifying compromised routers to increase overall network security significantly by marginalizing the <b>working</b> <b>boundaries</b> of an adversary, thus risking exposure.

40|$|Effective care in {{hospitals}} {{and in the community}} requires doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to work together to achieve the best possible outcomes for patients. In the UK, a shift in emphasis towards a primary care led service and recent changes {{to the ways in which}} healthcare is funded and organised, are profoundly affecting traditional patterns of <b>working.</b> <b>Boundaries</b> which define the roles and responsibilities of individual professions are becoming less clear and there is increasing overlap of knowledge and skills. The provision of effective patient care now depends much more on the individual practitioner's understanding of the need to collaborate within and between healthcare teams in community settings and the care provided {{in hospitals}}. This paper describes some of the ways in which those providing education and training for the professions are seeking to create opportunities for learners which will not only help them to understand the complexities of working in a multiprofessional healthcare environment, but also enable them to develop the skills and attitudes they need for interprofessional working. However, it is not yet established whether 'learning together' during basic training will result in better 'working together' in practice. Higher education institutions are understandably cautious about adopting new learning methods which make extra demands on decreasing resources. More studies are therefore needed to show whether interprofessional learning during basic education has an impact on future working practice...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyCounselling and coaching use specialised skills to help individuals address problems and make a positive change (Egan, 2010). Whilst sharing many commonalities with counselling, the coaching industry has endeavoured to define boundaries between the helping approaches to establish discrete areas of practice. However, rather than observe theoretical boundaries, many coaches rely on personal experience to idiosyncratically define boundaries in practice (Maxwell, 2009; Price 2009). The reliance on experience to inform practice judgements has significant implications for novice coaches. Without the advantage of contextual knowledge to assist with identifying boundaries, {{it is important that}} newly trained coaches are aware of working within their competency to ensure good practice. To investigate whether clear boundaries could be identified, a mixed-methods approach was used to explore novice coaches’ and experienced coaches’ and counsellors’ experiences of <b>working</b> with the <b>boundaries</b> between the helping approaches. Study one incorporated a survey and Interpretative phenomenological analysis of interview transcripts to investigate novice coaches’ perceptions of boundaries. Study two utilised a survey design to gain a broad understanding of experienced counsellors’ and coaches’ perspectives, while Study three involved an in-depth analysis of the experiences of 20 coaches and counsellors <b>working</b> with <b>boundaries</b> between coaching and counselling in practice. Findings from the first study indicated novices’ confusion and inconsistencies when identifying the differences between the approaches. The results suggested that newly trained coaches may work beyond their competencies when working with mental health problems in practice. Results from studies with experienced practitioners indicated that there is a large overlap between the helping approaches and identified different ways of <b>working</b> with <b>boundaries.</b> Some practitioners were adamant that boundaries should be preserved between coaching and counselling. However, a third of practitioners surveyed indicated that integrating approaches would be beneficial to meet the clients’ needs. The thesis illustrates practitioners’ concerns relating to the content and provision of coach training programmes and offers recommendations that aim to encourage a review of minimum standards in coach education. In addition, collaboration between coaching and counselling professional bodies is suggested to establish ethical guidelines for coaches and counsellors who wish to blend coaching and counselling practice...|$|R
