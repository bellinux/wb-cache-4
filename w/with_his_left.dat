5|$|In January 2002, Mustaine {{was hospitalized}} {{for the removal}} of a kidney stone and was {{administered}} pain medication that triggered a relapse of his drug addiction. Following his stay, Mustaine checked himself into a treatment center in Texas, where he suffered a peculiar injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> arm over the back of a chair, caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand.|$|E
5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand, it was probably easier for him to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko, who {{had scored}} the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. He hit his penalty {{straight}} {{down the middle of}} the goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him to a corner kick to score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} five, Burke's local youth {{basketball}} league had {{to change}} its rules {{so that he would}} not keep stealing the ball from the other team. As a result of his prowess, he was not allowed over half court when the other team had the ball. He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however. At the age of nine, Burke's father made him do everything <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> hand, including brushing his teeth and eating dinner, in order to develop his ambidexterity.|$|E
5|$|Hard times {{forced the}} family to {{relocate}} to San Francisco, California when Turner was six years old, and her parents soon separated. On December 14, 1930, her father won some money at a traveling craps game, stuffed his winnings in his left sock, and headed for home. He was later found murdered {{on the corner of}} Minnesota and Mariposa Streets, on the edge of San Francisco's Potrero Hill and the Dogpatch District <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> shoe and sock missing. The robbery and homicide were never solved.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} hours of November 7, 1825, the day the General Assembly was to open its session, a man knocked on the door of Sharp's residence.

Sharp died at approximately two o'clock in the morning. After lying in state in the House of Representatives Hall, he was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Milne was {{naturally}} right-footed, though trained hard <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> foot {{as a boy}} {{to become}} equally skilled with both feet. Former Dundee United teammate Paul Hegarty stated that Milne possessed great pace, as well as bravery, a good work ethic, {{and an ability to}} score important goals. Another former Dundee United teammate, Davie Dodds, said that Milne was as good a finisher as any player in Scottish football during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Tallon {{returned}} for the Fifth Test at The Oval, where England elected to bat first on a rain-affected pitch. Tallon caught Jack Crapp from an outside edge for a duck from the bowling of Miller, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch. England continued to {{struggle against the}} moving ball and were all out for 52 in the middle session.

5|$|When {{he first}} {{displayed}} this left-handed ability in the 1996 World Championship against Alain Robidoux, the Canadian {{accused him of}} disrespect.

He played three frames of snooker against former world championship runner-up Rex Williams, winning all three. The charge of bringing the game into disrepute was subsequently dropped.|$|E

5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} crossing ability <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E

5|$|Both armies {{appear to}} have been {{composed}} exclusively of cavalry, comprising a mix of lancers and horse-archers, possibly with a few cataphract units included. When Philippicus' scouts reported the Persians' approach, he positioned his men on elevated ground facing the direction from which the Persian army advanced, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>left</b> flank protected by the foothills of Mount Izalas. The Byzantines {{appear to have}} been arranged in a single battle line with three divisions. The left division was commanded by Eiliphredas, the dux of Phoenice Libanensis, and included a Hunnic contingent of horse-archers under Apsich. The centre was commanded by the general Heraclius the Elder, later Exarch of Africa and father of Emperor Heraclius (r. 610–641), while the right wing was commanded by the taxiarchos Vitalius. This arrangement was also adopted by the Persians as soon as they came into view of the Byzantine army. On the Persian side, the right division was under Mebodes, the centre under Kardarigan himself, and the left wing under Kardarigan's nephew, Aphraates. Unlike the Persian general, Philippicus remained with a small force at some distance behind the main battle line, directing the battle.|$|E
