5000|$|... "Mmm Yeah" [...] is a dance-pop song which {{contains}} a [...] "swirling" [...] production, funk-influenced trumpets, a percussion-heavy four {{on the floor}} electropop beat, and influences of Chicago house, hip hop, and Latin music. The track heavily samples Lidell Townsell's 1992 single [...] "Nu Nu". Lyrically, the song speaks of being rejected by an attractive woman walking down a street: [...] "We can do whatever/ Do whatever we want/ When she walked past me I said 'hey, hey, hey' So tell me <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> {{where you want to}} go/ She walked past me like I ain't say a word". [...] "All I Ever Need" [...] is a [...] "breezy" [...] downtempo R&B and pop slow jam.|$|E
5000|$|... "In The Zone" [...] {{was written}} by Ivy Queen, Wyclef Jean, Omar Navarro, known artistically as Gran Omar, Deborah Castillero and Aaron King. Gran Omar was Queen's then-husband at the time. The song was {{recorded}} at The Hit Factory in New York City. It is a hip hop song, which is {{a departure from the}} musical styles of reggaeton featured on her debut effort. Queen's verses are sung in Spanish, and Jean's verses are sung in English. However, Queen can be heard speaking English as well such as in the chorus where Jean says [...] "Ayo, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>from</b> Ivy Queen" [...] where she replies with [...] "Puerto Rico, one time". The official release features five tracks. The first is a dance remix of the song while the second is the Album version. The third track is a salsa version produced by DJ Nelson. A hip hop remix by King Saphreem is track number four while the a cappella is track five. According to Patricia Meschino of the Miami New Times the song was a solid collaboration with Jean which introduced her to a new audience.|$|E

Australia is beyond their affordability. Too far and expensive, they say. Malaysia, however, usually strikes a sense of cultural affinity and wonder.
