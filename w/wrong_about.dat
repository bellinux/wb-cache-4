5|$|At 09:00, Washington {{arrived from}} Manhattan. He {{realized}} that he had been <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> a feint on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan. His location on the battlefield is not known because accounts differ, but most likely he was at Brooklyn Heights where he could view the battle.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life"). They all decide {{to have a}} party that evening. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out of pity, leaving her free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq {{are meant to be}} together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to wear to the party, Elphaba begins to wonder if she was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> her roommate.|$|E
5|$|The second book, Thunder Rising, {{takes place}} {{a couple of}} months after The Sun Trail. Turtle Tail returns to Gray Wing's group {{pregnant}} by an aggressive kittypet tomcat named Tom, and becomes Gray Wing's mate. A fire breaks out in the forest, forcing Clear Sky's group to take shelter with Gray Wing. While taking shelter with Gray Wing, Clear Sky realizes that he was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Thunder and invites him to join his group. Thunder quickly accepts the offer, but soon realizes that his father is too power-hungry and concentrated on the needs of the group over the individual and leaves.|$|E

25|$|Like Pytheas, Posidonius {{believed}} {{the tide is}} caused by the moon. Posidonius was, however, <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the cause. Thinking that the moon was a mixture of air and fire, he attributed the cause of the tides to the heat of the moon, hot enough to cause the water to swell but not hot enough to evaporate it.|$|E
25|$|Melbourne {{rock band}} Telemachus Brown wrote {{a song about}} Justin Langer {{entitled}} (<b>Wrong</b> <b>about)</b> Justin Langer. It was released on their 2006 EP Medicine Songs and was a hit for the band on Melbourne university radio. The song could be a reference to Langer's transformation from being an average Test batsman in his early career to a world-class opener later in his career.|$|E
25|$|From early on, the Hurd was {{developed}} to use GNU Mach as the microkernel. This was a technical decision made by Richard Stallman, who thought it would speed up the work by saving {{a large part of}} it. He has admitted that he was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> that. Other Unix-like systems working on the Mach microkernel include OSF/1, Lites, and MkLinux. macOS and NeXTSTEP use hybrid kernels based on Mach.|$|E

25|$|Requiring the isotope tritium to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry {{to demand}} it. Harry agrees in {{exchange}} for Spider-Man's life. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but requests Octavius not harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers resurfacing. Just as Jameson admits he was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the Bugle and goes after Octavius.|$|E
25|$|Livingstone was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the Nile, but he {{identified}} numerous geographical features for Western science, such as Lake Ngami, Lake Malawi, and Lake Bangweulu, {{in addition to}} Victoria Falls mentioned above. He filled in details of Lake Tanganyika, Lake Mweru, and the course of many rivers, especially the upper Zambezi, and his observations enabled large regions to be mapped which previously had been blank. Even so, the farthest north he reached was {{the north end of}} Lake Tanganyika – still south of the Equator – and he did not penetrate the rainforest of the River Congo any further downstream than Ntangwe near Misisi.|$|E
25|$|One day he {{suddenly}} finds {{the energy to}} get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E

25|$|Pichegru {{and three}} other {{deportees}} escaped from French Guiana by boat on 3 June 1798, but Willot and François Aubry fell desperately ill with fever and were unable to join them. Aubry soon died but Willot recovered and got away that same month. In 1799, Pichegru and Willot actively plotted to stir up Royalist revolts in France. On 1 June 1799, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino wrote to the French army commander André Masséna that Pichegru, Willot and Carnot were traveling with Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, {{the commander of the}} Habsburg Austrian army. Ferino was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Carnot but correct about the others. Pichegru planned to lead the rebellion in Franche-Comté, Willot in Marseilles and Louis François Perrin de Précy in Lyon. Their efforts came to nothing because Masséna won his masterly victory at the Second Battle of Zurich on 25 September 1799.|$|E
25|$|Candidate Reviews: Despite {{her having}} the weakest {{track record of}} the final four and her unwillingness to admit ever being <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> anything, the interviewers {{unanimously}} considered Saira {{to be the most}} impressive of the candidates, giving her much praise for her prior accomplishments and salesmanship, and even feeling that her abrasiveness could be a strength in the right circumstances. The interviewers noted that while James was, on paper, the strongest of the four candidates, they found him unconvincing in the interviews and questioned whether his heart was in the process. Meanwhile, Tim was commended for his passion, determination and business knowledge, but the interviewers considered him to be naive and were concerned that stepping up to run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E
25|$|Most {{historians and}} medical experts {{now believe that}} Garfield {{probably}} would have survived his wound had the doctors attending him been more capable. Unfortunately for Garfield, most American doctors of the day {{did not believe in}} anti-sepsis measures or the need for cleanliness to prevent infection. Several inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet, and one doctor punctured Garfield's liver in doing so. Also, self-appointed chief physician D. Willard Bliss had supplanted Garfield's usual physician, Jedediah Hyde Baxter. Bliss and the other doctors who attended Garfield had guessed <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the path of the bullet in Garfield's body. They had erroneously probed rightward into Garfield's back instead of leftward, missing the location of the bullet but creating a new channel which filled with pus. The autopsy not only discovered this error but revealed pneumonia in both lungs and a body that was filled with pus due to uncontrolled septicemia.|$|E
40|$|Why is it {{not wrong}} to be doubly negative? How do you {{pronounce}} words such as 'dissect'? Where do the expressions 'wowser', 'craw thumper' and the 'f-word' come from? Do New Zealanders mangle the English language? Should we say different 'from' or 'to' or 'than'? We use it every day, but what is this thing called language and are there rights and <b>wrongs</b> <b>about</b> its use? Four leading linguists, with specific interest in New Zealand English, tackle the common-place and quirky questions that arise from what we say, read and write. Funny, accessible, informative, this is a fascinating book...|$|R

25|$|Despite {{or perhaps}} because of the Bitburg controversy, in 1985 a {{campaign}} had been started to build a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust in Berlin. It was felt by at least some Germans that there was something <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the Chancellor and the President of the United States honoring the memory of the SS men buried at Bitburg while there was no memorial to any of the people killed in the Holocaust. The campaign to build a Holocaust memorial, which Germany until then lacked, was given a major boost in November 1989 by the call by television journalist Lea Rosh to build the memorial at the site for the former Gestapo headquarters. In April 1992, the City of Berlin finally decided that a Holocaust memorial could be built. Along the same lines, in August 1987, protests put a stop to plans by the City of Frankfurt to raze the last remains of the Frankfurt Jewish Ghetto in order to redevelop the land, arguing that the remnants of the Frankfurt ghetto needed to be preserved.|$|E
500|$|Hawkins and Hester Thrale, in Boswell's mind, were rivals to [...] "what he {{considered}} his domain". That {{is not to}} say that he was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> Hawkins's Life because it does contain many digressions, such as a discussion of sixteenth century breakfast habits written in Latin and a discussion on the history of taverns among others. Hawkins also included long extracts from Johnson's works.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{had not yet}} {{given up}} on his parishioner. With the {{permission}} of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where the recently arrived Reverend John Davenport was also staying. [...] All week the two ministers worked with her and, under their supervision, she had written out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that had formerly brought objection. [...] Hutchinson stood at the next meeting, on Thursday, 22 March, and read her recantation in a subdued voice to the congregation. [...] She admitted to having been <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the soul and spirit, <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> the resurrection of the body, wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony, wrong in her demeanour toward the ministers, and, most remarkably, agreed that sanctification could be evidence of justification (a covenant of works) [...] "as it flowes from Christ and is witnessed to us by the Spirit". [...] Had the trial ended there, she would have likely remained in good standing with the Boston church, and had the possibility of returning some day.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} {{days leading up to}} House's court case, House realizes the {{severity}} of the situation and finally apologizes to Tritter (episode [...] "Words and Deeds"). When Tritter refuses to accept the apology, House goes into rehab, putting on a show for Tritter and the judge, but Tritter cites his experiences with addicts as evidence House has not changed. The judge tells Tritter that she does not believe House to be the drug dealer that Tritter tried to show him to be and orders Tritter to move on after House is exonerated due to Cuddy committing perjury. Just before the bailiff escorts House out of the courtroom, Tritter tells him: [...] "Good luck. I hope I'm <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> you." ...|$|E
500|$|Ricks, {{a native}} of the Ninth Ward, later told NBC Nightly News that he wrote the {{bulletin}} based on his previous experiences with Betsy and Camille. [...] He also said that he was looking for statements to take out, but decided to leave the bulletin more or less intact because it seemed valid for a storm that he was convinced would be [...] "the big one" [...] longtime New Orleans residents had been predicting for some time. [...] He admitted that he and his colleagues hoped to have been <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> just how powerful Katrina would become, [...] "but our local expertise said otherwise." [...] He added, [...] "We always prepare for the big one, we just didn't think it was going to come this soon." ...|$|E

[...] At the next meeting on Thursday, 22 March, she stood and read her recantation to the congregation, admitting {{that she had been}} <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> many of her beliefs. [...] The ministers, however, continued with her examination, during which she began to lie about her theological positions—and her entire defense unraveled. At this point, Cotton signaled that he had given up on her, and his fellow minister John Wilson read the order of excommunication.|$|E
60|$|It {{is always}} worth while {{to know what}} is true.

Always, therefore, try to find out and believe what is true concerning everything; and, above all, concerning God, on whom all depend, in whom you live, and move, and have your being. For all things in heaven and earth depend on God; and, therefore, if you have <b>wrong</b> notions <b>about</b> God, you will sooner or later have <b>wrong</b> notions <b>about</b> everything else.|$|R
