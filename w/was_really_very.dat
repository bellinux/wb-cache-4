I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Gary Cole's return was highly praised, {{as well as}} the scene in which Sarah imitates the face Chuck makes when the Intersect has a [...] "flash". HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Cole's return was as much fun as I hoped it would be - in some ways, even better than his first appearance in season two's 'Chuck vs. the Delorean,' where I liked Sarah and Jack's interaction but thought the actual con job was a bit thin. 'Chuck vs. the Wedding Planner' had its own flaw in the section where Sarah and Chuck are illegally using government resources to catch the con woman and wind up getting more government 'help' than they bargained for... But once Jack turned up in Burbank to help his daughter and her schnook of a fiance be heroes and get back in the good graces of General Beckman, 'Wedding Planner' <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> strong, both as a comedy piece (loved Yvonne Strahovski's accent as she impersonated Daphne) and another story about Sarah's colorful but ultimately sad past." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Cardinale portrayed a sultry nightclub {{singer and}} young mother in Valerio Zurlini's Girl with a Suitcase. As {{a result of}} her own {{experience}} of early motherhood, Cardinale naturally conveyed the concerns of a teenaged mother, identifying fully with the character of Aida. Such was her psychological involvement that she needed several months to overcome her apprehensions and prepare for the part. Zurlini chose her for such a difficult role against everyone's advice, as she was not yet considered a [...] "real" [...] actress, nor was she (yet) one of the most celebrated Italian beauties. However, he was very close and supportive of Cardinale during the production, and a true friendship developed between the two, based on a deep mutual understanding. Cardinale remarked: [...] "Zurlini {{was one of those who}} really love women: he had an almost feminine sensitivity. He could understand me at a glance. He taught me everything, without ever making demands on me. ... He <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> fond of me." [...] Cardinale was warmly praised by the critics for her performance in Girl with a Suitcase, Dennis Schwartz considering her to have been at her [...] "charming best". Later in 1961, Cardinale starred as a brothel owner opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo in Bolognini's La Viaccia. Both Girl with a Suitcase and La Viaccia were presented at the 1961 Cannes Film Festival. At the time, Cardinale was not considered comparable to the two divas of Italian cinema, Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, but several newspapers and magazines including Paris Match began to consider her to be a credible young rival to Brigitte Bardot. Cardinale's 1961 appearances also included Henri Verneuil's French comedy Les Lions sont lâchés, and Auguste in which she had a cameo role.|$|E

500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

Regular panelist Charles Nelson Reilly, a Broadway director, often responded with comments such as [...] "I like it when you act" [...] and [...] "That character <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> good.

After abstaining {{for a couple of}} days, it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>very</b> refreshing." [...] Only months earlier, the consumption of beer would have been illegal. [...] An amendment to the Volstead Act allowing the sale of beer went into effect in April 1933. [...] The availability of beer had a noticeable impact in Ann Arbor on football Saturdays. [...] On October 8, 1933, the day after the Michigan-Michigan State football game, Ford noted that his fraternity was planning a big party with a barrel of beer. [...] He added, [...] "You should have seen the campus this week-end, more drunks than ever and they all claim that the year is just beginning. I'm afraid to imagine what it will be by the Ohio State game." [...] Ford's concern proved prescient. [...] After the Ohio State game, the university attracted unwanted national publicity when its board in control of athletics mailed notices to ticket holders warning that they would be ejected if complaints were received about their drinking. [...] The notices stated that the board was not concerned with [...] "the personal habits and tastes" [...] of ticket-holders, but felt a deep concern [...] "when indulgence in such habits and tastes results in conduct disgusting or offensive to other patrons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stuart's career {{advanced}} when English director James Whale chose her for {{the glamour}} role as a sentimental wife who winds up stranded among strangers at a spooky mansion in his ensemble cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Raymond Massey) for The Old Dark House (1932). The film was critically praised, and The New York Times called Stuart's performance [...] "clever and charming," [...] with the movie later becoming a cult classic. Stuart's experience filming The Old Dark House also became integral {{to the formation of}} the Screen Actors Guild in 1933: [...] "James [...] joined all the English actors,” Stuart recalled. “So {{on one side of the}} set they had their ‘elevensies’ and `foursies,’ and Melvyn [...] and I would be sitting together, not invited. One day, Melvyn said to me, `Are you interested in forming a union together?’ I said, ‘What’s a union?’ He said, ‘Like in New York – Actor’s Equity. The actors get together and work for better working conditions.’ I said, ‘Oh wonderful,’ because I was getting up at five every morning; in makeup at seven, in hair at eight, wardrobe at quarter of nine, and then sometimes if production wanted you to, you worked until four or five the next morning. There was no overtime. They fed us when they felt like it, when it was convenient for production. It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>very,</b> very hard work." [...] After filming completed, Stuart began canvassing, and was one of the union's first founding members.|$|E
