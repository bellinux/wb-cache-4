30|$|The {{illuvial}} Btg 1 horizon at a {{depth of}} 50 (65)– 70 (80) cm is of non-uniform color (the basic background is 10 YR 4 / 4, with abundance of mottles 10 YR 7 / 6) with very strong grain aggregates covered by grayish black cutans. Compact manganese–ferrous concretions 2 – 3  mm in diameter can be found here. The lower part of the illuvial Btg 2 horizon has a compact nutty structure. Angular-nut aggregates (peds of the first order) are covered with a greyish cutan outside and are ferritized inside. The lower part of the profile [the (BC)g horizon, 120 – 140  cm], is characterized by nutty structure, multiple <b>whitish</b> <b>stains,</b> veins, and black manganese patches. A special morphological characteristic of Btg 2 and (BC)g horizons is the presence of a bleached fine-dispersed substance on the facets of structural units in the form of local clusters. WDC and AC subfractions of clay were extracted from the three main genetic horizons of the studied soil: the humic Ag, eluvial Elcg and illuvial Btg 1 horizons.|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, {{phenolic}} panels {{made from}} Bakelite-finished wood {{were given a}} 1 mm-thick finishing layer of natural wood, which was protected by a film of waterproof paper. The edges were protected with {{the same type of}} phenolic resins. In practice, a gradual deterioration of the protective layer occurred due to the combined action of UV rays and rainwater. When the wood lost its protective layer, it expanded, deformed and acquired <b>whitish</b> <b>stains</b> due to the action of microorganisms. The edges suffered similar deterioration processes. We present a sample of the damage at a museum. The deterioration of the panels was worsened by their incorrect positioning during construction. A type of sandwich was made, with phenolic panel on the exterior, then rock wool insulation and MDF wood panels. This was given rigidity using wooden frames. When thermal bridges occurred due to gaps in the insulation, this gave rise to differences in surface washing which worsened the outside appearance. Once a diagnosis of the damage had been arrived at, energy rehabilitation of the covering was carried out, which involved putting in new-generation phenolic panels with a non-degradable acrylic layers and edges protected using synthetic resins. These were fitted on top of the pre-existing panels using threaded rods and a 3 cm layer of polyurethane insulation was sprayed over the whole surface. Furthermore, air has been allowed to circulate, as in a ventilated façade. This avoids any possible continuous damp problems and at the same time, in summer, avoids heat building up due to the solar radiation. The building was monitored over a full, year-round cycle which allowed us to learn about its energy performance using Design Builder software, which had been calibrated using temperature adjustments and real energy consumption data. We present the results, which show the reduction in the building energy demand...|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Terminalia catappa and Terminalia chebula. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine has {{the form of a}} linear-blotch mine on the lower side of food plant. The linear part of the mine is made by the young larva and is {{epidermal}} and is usually running from the median area near the midvein to the leaf-edge with an irregularly curved trace. The blotchy part is elongaged along the leaf-edge, with parenchymal tissues within this part almost eaten by the larva. Finally, the leaf-edge at the blotchy part is narrowly folded down causing the lower epidermis to shrink over the mining part. The full-grown larva emerges from the mine to make a cocoon outside. The cocoon is usually placed on the lower side of the leaf, mostly {{at the side of the}} mid or lateral vein. It is boat-shaped, <b>whitish,</b> partly <b>stained</b> by grains of frass and covered by five to seven bars of silken threads, without bubbles or globules.|$|R
50|$|The cap is convex to flattened, {{sometimes}} {{with a small}} central depression, and measures 4.5 - 12.5 cm in diameter. The surface of the cap is dry, smooth, and has a velvety texture. It sometimes develops small wrinkles in the center, while the cap margin develops irregular grooves in maturity. Its colour is buff to grayish-brown to dark fawn, {{sometimes with}} darker spots and a lighter margin. The crowded gills have an adnate to slightly decurrent attachment to the stipe. They have an olive-buff to pinkish-buff colour, and stain pinkish. The cylindric stipe measures 4 - 8.5 cm long by 1 - 2 cm thick and tapers to the base. Its surface texture {{is similar to the}} cap, but is coloured paler, and is whitish near the top. The flesh is <b>whitish,</b> but <b>stains</b> pinkish where injured; it is thick and firm in the cap and stipe. It has no significant odor and a mild to slightly acrid taste. The mushroom's sparse latex is white but dries pinkish, imparting that colour when it stains the gills and flesh. Lactarius fuliginosus is not edible, and may be somewhat poisonous.|$|R

50|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Lepiota babruzalka have caps that start out roughly spherical, {{and as they}} expand become broadly convex, and {{eventually}} flat, with a blunt umbo. The cap attains a diameter of 1 - 1.3 cm. Its whitish surface is covered with small, reddish-brown, pressed-down scales that are more numerous in the center. The margin is initially curved inward, but straightens out in age, and retains hanging remnants of the partial veil. The gills are white, and free from attachment to the stem. They are crowded together, {{with two or three}} tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem). Viewed with a hand lens, the edges of the gills appear to be fringed. The stem is cylindrical with a bulbous base, initially solid before becoming hollow, and measures 2.6 - 4.5 cm long by 1-1.5 mm thick. The stem surface is <b>whitish,</b> but will <b>stain</b> a light brown color if handled. In young fruit bodies, the stems have a whitish, membranous ring on the upper half, but the ring does not last long before disintegrating. The flesh is thin (up to 1 mm), whitish, and lacks any appreciable odor.|$|R
40|$|O desempenho produtivo e a possível interferência do flúor sobre a saúde dos animais foram investigados em bovinos Nelore suplementados, por 866 dias, com distintas fontes alternativas de fósforo com diferentes relações fósforo:fluor (P:F). Os tratamentos experimentais foram: Controle negativo (CONTNEG, sem qualquer suplementação com P), fosfato bicálcico (FB 120 : 1, FB 30 : 1 e FB 10 : 1), fosfato monobicálcico (FMBC 60 : 1), superfosfato triplo (SFT 30 : 1) e fosfato de rocha de Cajati (FR 10 : 1). Foram utilizados 49 novilhos, desmamados aos oito meses de idade, castrados e com 230 kg de peso médio, distribuídos em sete piquetes com água e mistura mineral formulada sem P. A dieta padrão foi feita com bagaço de cana (0, 03 % de P) como volumoso e um concentrado contendo 0, 239 % de P oferecido na base de 1 % do peso dos animais para permitir um ganho de peso aproximado de 0, 50 kg/dia. Até o dia 134, não houve diferença estatística entre os diversos lotes, {{inclusive}} para o tratamento CONTNEG, que não recebeu fósforo suplementar na dieta e ganhou 71, 6 kg de peso ou 0, 633 kg/dia. Após 866 dias de confinamento (2, 37 anos), os animais suplementados com o fosfato bicálcico padrão (120 : 1) ganharam menos peso que os suplementados com as fontes FMCB 60 : 1, FB 30 : 1 e SFT 30 : 1. Até um ano de suplementação fosfórica com fosfato bicálcico padrão (120 : 1) artificialmente fluoretado com NaF ou com o fosfato de rocha não se detectou danos à saúde ou ao ganho de peso dos animais. As análises de fósforo nos ossos mostraram diferença estatística apenas entre o tratamento CONTNEG e os que tinham fosfato bicálcico. As concentrações de flúor nos ossos se mostraram intimamente associadas à quantidade de flúor disponível nas fontes utilizadas. Conforme a proporção P:F na dieta foi diminuindo, características relacionadas à fluorose dentária ficaram mais evidentes, sendo que os animais que receberam fontes com relação 10 : 1, apresentaram, ao final do experimento, dentes incisivos permanentes mal formados, quebradiços e com manchas esbranquiçadas. Weight {{gain and}} possible interference of fluoride on animal health {{was investigated in}} Nellore cattle supplemented during 866 days with alternative sources of phosphorus with different phosphorus:fluor (P:F) ratios. The five treatments were: (1) Negative control (NC, without any supplemental P), (2) dicalcium phosphate (DCP 120 : 1, DCP 30 : 1 and DCP 10 : 1), (3) monodicalcium phosphate (MDCP 60 : 1), (4) triple superphosphate (TSF 30 : 1), and (5) cajati rock phosphate (RP 10 : 1). We used 49 oxen weaned with 8 months of age and an average weight of 230 kg, distributed into seven paddocks with water and mineral mixture formulated without P. A standard diet consisting of sugar cane bagasse (0. 03 % P) as roughage and a concentrate containing 0. 239 % P was provided on 1 % of live weight to allow a weight gain of about 0. 50 kg/day. Until day 134, there was no statistical difference between the various groups, including the treatment NC which received no supplemental phosphorus in the diet and gained weight of 71. 6 kg or 0. 633 kg/day. After 866 days of confinement (2. 37 years), the oxen supplemented with dicalcium phosphate standard (120 : 1) gained less weight than those supplemented with sources MDCP 60 : 1, DCP 30 : 1 and TSF 30 : 1. Up to one year of supplementation with dicalcium phosphate artificially fluoridated with NaF or with rock phosphate {{did not result in}} damage to health or in weight gain of the animals. Analyses of phosphorus in bones showed statistical difference between treatments, and group NC that did not receive any supplemental P showed the lowest values. The concentration of fluoride in bones proved to be closely related to the amount of fluoride available in the sources used. As the ratio P:F in the diet decreased, characteristic signs related to dental fluorosis became more evident, and the animals that received P supplies with 10 : 1 ratio showed {{at the end of the}} experiment permanent malformed incisor teeth, brittle and <b>whitish</b> <b>stained...</b>|$|R
40|$|Field {{outbreaks}} of coccidiosis {{all over the}} world were commonly reported in chickens over 3 -weeks of age. Outbreak of coccidiosis in birds in the first few weeks of life is becoming increasing important but chickens less than 1 -week of age appeared not to be susceptible. This case report describes the clinical signs and gross lesions of coccidiosis as well as its microscopic appearance in a five-day old intensively managed broiler breeder chicks. The outbreak occurred in December, 2009 and was characterized by early onset of an acute disease with high mortality. Other clinical features of the disease were: progressive increase and sudden decline of high chick mortality of up to 50 %, ruffled feathers, blood <b>stained</b> <b>whitish</b> to brownish diarrhea, weakness and anorexia. Gross lesions seen were congested carcasses, distended caeca and intestinal segments with blood, mucus and tissue debris; retained yolk sac was also observed in some birds. Whole intestines were submitted to the Protozoology and retained yolk sac to Microbiology Laboratories for investigations. A farm visit revealed very poor housing ventilation and wet litter. Laboratory results confirmed coccidian schizonts and gametocytes from caeca and intestinal scrapings. Escherichia coli was isolated from the yolk sac. High hygienic standards must be maintained in hatcheries and poultry houses, damp and warm litter must be avoided and adequate ventilation should always be provided in poultry houses to prevent coccidiosis...|$|R
