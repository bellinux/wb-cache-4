50|$|The {{comparatively}} {{low molecular}} mass {{leads to a}} better permeability in tissues, and to a short plasma half-life since they are eliminated renally. Unlike <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies,</b> they do not show complement system triggered cytotoxicity because they lack an Fc region. Camelid and fish derived sdAbs are able to bind to hidden antigens that are not accessible to <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies,</b> for example to the active sites of enzymes.

40|$|Detection of tumor markers is {{important}} for cancer diagnosis. Field-effect transistors (FETs) are a promising method for the label-free detection of trace amounts of biomolecules. However, detection of electrically charged proteins using antibody-immobilized FETs is limited by ionic screening by the large probe molecules adsorbed to the transistor gate surface, reducing sensor responsiveness. Here, we investigated the effect of probe molecule size on the detection of a tumor marker, α-fetoprotein (AFP) using a FET biosensor. We demonstrated that the small receptor antigen binding fragment (Fab), immobilized on a sensing surface as small as 2 – 3 nm, offers {{a higher degree of}} sensitivity and a wider concentration range (100 pg/mL– 1 μg/mL) for the FET detection of AFP in buffer solution, compared to the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody.</b> Therefore, the use of a small Fab probe molecule instead of a <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> is shown to be effective for improving the sensitivity of AFP detection in FET biosensors. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that a Fab-immobilized FET subjected to a blocking treatment, to avoid non-specific interactions, could sensitively and selectively detect AFP in human serum...|$|R

30|$|To {{reduce the}} effects of c-MET {{activation}} induced by mAbs or native ligands on c-MET expression in vivo, Jiao et al. assessed the feasibility of using a monovalent anti-c-MET antigen-binding fragment (Fab, ~ 60  kDa) as a molecular probe for targeted imaging of c-MET [46]. hFab-Met- 1 was selected from a large human naive Fab phage-display library with high specificity to c-MET but without agonist activity to HGF/c-MET signaling, as confirmed by in vitro assays. In an in vivo study, activity started to accumulate in tumor regions at 1 – 2  h after injection of 125 I-hFab-Met- 1, it was highly accumulated at 5 – 8  h p.i. and persisted for at least 24  h in SK-LMS- 1 /HGF bearing mice models, with a mean tumor activity of about 6 % of the estimated activity administrated. Particularly high accumulation of activity was detected in the thyroid region. Although possessing smaller molecular weight and therefore faster metabolism as well as tumor uptake than the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody,</b> the Fab single fragment has a lower binding affinity than the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody,</b> {{as we have seen}} for 125 I-hFab-Met- 1, obtained highest tumor uptake of 6 %EIA which is lower than 125 I-Met 5 (~ 13 %EIA).|$|R

TBAT (effective against types A, B, and E) {{is derived from}} equine sources utilizing <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies</b> (Fab & Fc portions). But only HBAT is considered effective against all known strains of botulism (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G).

50|$|A single-domain {{antibody}} is a peptide {{chain of}} about 110 amino acids long, comprising one variable domain (VH) of a heavy-chain antibody, or {{of a common}} IgG. These peptides have similar affinity to antigens as <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies,</b> but are more heat-resistant and stable towards detergents and high concentrations of urea. Those derived from camelid and fish antibodies are less lipophilic and more soluble in water, owing to their complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), which forms an extended loop (coloured orange in the ribbon diagram above) covering the lipophilic site that normally binds to a light chain. In contrast to common antibodies, two out of six single-domain antibodies survived a temperature of 90 °C (194 °F) without losing their ability to bind antigens in a 1999 study. Stability towards gastric acid and proteases depends on the amino acid sequence. Some species {{have been shown to}} be active in the intestine after oral application, but their low absorption from the gut impedes the development of systemically active orally administered single-domain antibodies.|$|E
50|$|Nature has perfected {{glycosylation}} {{of proteins}} through a complex interaction of enzymes and carbohydrates {{over thousands of}} years. However, chemical glycosylation is still an obstacle due to the difficult synthesis of glycan in general. The synthesis of carbohydrate derivatives can be slow and tedious. Nonetheless, the interest in technologies to structurally mimic protein glycosylation is an appealing application as some protein functions solely depend on {{the pattern of the}} attached glycan. The Fc fragment of the IgG antibody, for example, is a homodimer with a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The attached sugar moieties modulate the binding to specific immunoreceptors, thereby modifying the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> function.|$|R
50|$|To {{function}} as an agonist, {{it has been suggested}} that TGN1412 needs to be a <b>whole</b> <b>antibody,</b> including the constant (Fc) region. According to a report by TeGenero, the F(ab)2 is not able to generate the required stimulation. Unlike the related clone TGN1112, an IgG1, TGN1412 is of the subclass IgG4. This choice was made as TGN1112 showed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity on CD28+ Jurkat cells. Thus the function of antibody binding via an Fcγ receptor seems to be a requirement for the immune regulation. However, cell opsonisation by antibody leads normally to phagocytosis of the labeled cells, as seen in the case of HIV.|$|R
40|$|An {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay {{was developed}} for the measurement of sheep digoxin-specific immunoglobulin G and Fab fragments. With the latter, two preparations were examined, one available commercially (Digibind, Wellcome) and one prepared by ourselves (DSFab). The assay exhibited a greater sensitivity towards immunoglobulin G compared with Digibind and DSFab, presumably because the Fab preparations lacked some of the sheep-specific antigens present on the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> molecule. The assay was used subsequently to examine the disposition of the antibody preparations after injection of 1 mg/kg i. v. into anaesthetised bile duct-cannulated rats. The plasma distribution half-lives (1. 8 - 3. 3 min) were similar for all three preparations, but while plasma elimination half-life values for Digibind and DSFab were much the same (110 - 115 min), that for immunoglobulin G was longer (425 min). The shorter half-life values for Fab fragments were linked to a rate of urinary elimination 10 - 20 fold faster. No antibody excretion in the bile was detected. The apparent volume of distribution of immunoglobulin G was 35 ml/kg, indicating that the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> was largely confined to the plasma space. The volume of distribution for Digibind or DSFab (about 46 ml/kg) was not significantly larger than that for immunoglobulin G and {{much smaller than the}} extracellular fluid volume, which was measured as 305 ml/kg. Thus the distribution of sheep Fab fragments in the rat markedly differs from that in the baboon (Smith et al., 1979) where the apparent volume of distribution approximates to the extracellular fluid volume...|$|R

40|$|The tumour-associated antigen {{epithelial}} glycoprotein- 2 (EGP- 2) is {{a promising}} target for detection {{and treatment of}} a variety of human carcinomas. Antibodies to this antigen have been successfully used in patients for imaging of small-cell lung cancer and for adjuvant treatment of minimal residual disease of colon cancer. We describe here the isolation and complete characterization of high-affinity single-chain variable fragments (scFv) to the EGP- 2 antigen. First, the binding kinetics of four murine <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed to EGP- 2 (17 - 1 A, 323 /A 3, MOC- 31 and MOC- 161) were determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The MOC- 31 antibody has the lowest apparent off-rate, followed by MOC- 161 and 323 /A 3. The V-genes of the two MOC hybridomas were cloned as scFv in a phage display vector and antigen-binding phage were selected by panning on recombinant antigen. The scFvs compete with the original hybridoma antibodies for binding to antigen and specifically bind to human carcinomas in immunohistochemistry. MOC- 31 scFv has an off-rate which is better than those of the bivalent 17 - 1 A and 323 /A 3 <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies,</b> providing it with an essential characteristic for tumour retention in vivo. The availability of these high-affinity anti-EGP- 2 antibody fragments and of their encoding V-genes creates a variety of possibilities for their future use as tumour-targeting vehicles...|$|E
3000|$|... 99 mTc is an {{attractive}} choice for labelling intermediate-sized recombinant proteins such as diabodies for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), for several reasons. First, the tricarbonyl chemistry allows direct chelation of 99 mTc by genetically encoded tags, such as the (His) 6 -tag, which simplifies the labelling process [27]. Second, its half-life of 6  h matches well with the average serum half-life of diabodies. Third, it provides excellent image quality at low radiation doses compared to isotopes with a longer half-life such as 111 In and 89 Zr that are needed for imaging with <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies.</b>|$|E
50|$|Compositions of the {{antivenom}} can {{be classified}} as whole IgG, or fragments of IgG. <b>Whole</b> <b>antibody</b> products consist of the entire antibody molecule, often immunoglobulin G (IgG), whereas antibody fragments are derived by digesting the whole IgG into Fab (monomeric binding) or F(ab')2 (dimeric binding). The fragment antigen binding, or Fab, is the selective antigen binding region. An antibody, such as IgG, can be digested by papain to produce three fragments: two Fab fragments and one Fc fragment. An antibody can also be digested by pepsin to produce two fragments: a F(ab')2 fragment and a pFc' fragment.The fragment antigen-binding (Fab fragment) is a region on an antibody that binds to antigens, such as venoms. The molecular size of Fab is approximately 50kDa, making it smaller than F(ab')2 which is approximately 110kDa. These size differences greatly affect the tissue distribution and rates of elimination.|$|R
40|$|Neocarzinostatin (NCS) {{was bound}} covalently to human/mouse {{chimeric}} Fab fragments of MAb A 7 (chA 7 Fab) directed against human pancreatic carcinoma. The anti-tumour effect of chA 7 Fab-NCS was {{tested in a}} nude mouse model on pancreatic carcinoma and compared with A 7 -NCS or NCS alone. The antitumour effect of chA 7 Fab-NCS increased in a dose-dependent manner and was significantly greater than either A 7 -NCS or NCS. Tumour growth was completely suppressed after the administration of chA 7 Fab-NCS. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin was performed to examine the antigenicity of chA 7 Fab. ChA 7 Fab had less reactivity with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin than either <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> A 7 or murine Fab fragments of A 7.

Yeast chimeric antibody exhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity but not complement-dependent cytotoxicity activity. For production of Fab fragments, a truncated heavy-chain (Fd) gene was created by introducing a stop codon near the codon for the amino acid at which papain digestion occurs.

Sixty-one scans were performed (40 IV, 21 SQ) in 59 patients who had injections of 0. 2 - 50 mg of 131 I coupled (0. 2 - 12 mCi) antibody. These included 48. 7, which identifies a high molecular weight antigen (HMW), or 96. 5, which identifies a transferrin like molecule, p 97. 125 I coupled nonspecific Fab 1. 4, reacting with murine leukemia virus, or the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> BL 3, reactive with a human B cell idiotypic determinant, was generally used {{in tandem with the}} patients injected SQ as a nonspecific control. All patients had immunohistochemical studies performed on biopsied lesions and demonstrated binding to the antibodies injected. Of the IV patients, 22 / 38 (58 %) had (+) scans, 13 at SQ or nodal sites, four at visceral sites, and five at visceral and SQ sites. Patients with clinical stage II disease had SQ injection of MoAb, including 11 additional patients injected with the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> 9. 2. 27 (anti-HMW) labeled with 111 In (6 patients) or 131 I (5 patients). Nodal dissection was performed 2 - 4 days later. All 111 In coupled antibodies demonstrated excellent nodal delineation without specific identification of tumor deposits. Of the 21 patients injected SQ with MoAb, 17 had confirmed tumor in nodes. Of patients injected with Fab fragments, 4 / 8 (50 %) had specific uptake of MoAb, although only two were successfully imaged. Increased uptake of antimelanoma antibodies was observed in some patients in lymph nodes not containing tumor and was possibly related to antigen shedding. Clearance of labeled antibody from the injection site occurred with a half life of 16 - 50 hours. Toxicity was limited to local discomfort at the site of SQ injection. Melanoma metastases can be identified with IV or SQ injection or radiolabeled antibodies. These reagents may be useful in the diagnosis or therapy of human melanoma.

40|$|Single-chain {{antibody}} fragment-based adsorbent for the extracorporeal {{removal of}} β 2 -microglobulin. BackgroundDialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA) {{is a frequent}} complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that {{has been associated with}} the accumulation of β 2 -microglobulin (β 2 -m). Removal of β 2 -m results in the loss of important proteins due to the nonspecific nature of current therapies. Although <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies</b> can potentially be used to confer specificity to β 2 -m removal from blood, single-chain variable region (scFv) antibody fragments could potentially offer several advantages as immunoadsorption ligands due to their size, genetic definition, ability to be expressed by microbes, and amenability for in vitro evolution. MethodsAn antihuman β 2 -m scFv was constructed from the BBM. 1 hybridoma and expressed by a yeast display vector. The binding affinity of the wild-type scFv fragment was quantified by flow cytometry analysis. Soluble scFv was expressed by a yeast secretion vector, purified, and immobilized onto agarose beads. The binding capacity of the immunoadsorbent was measured by equilibrating samples with saturating quantities of fluorescent β 2 -m in serum. ResultsThe displayed scFv possessed a nanomolar affinity (KD = 0. 008 ± 0. 004 mg-β 2 -m/L). The immunoadsorbent exhibited an adsorption site density of 0. 41 ± 0. 01 mg β 2 -m/mL settled gel. Under saturating conditions, the mass ratio of adsorbed β 2 -m to immobilized antibody is 70 % greater than any previous literature report for <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Preliminary specificity experiments suggest that the scFv-based immunoadsorbent is specific toward human β 2 -m. ConclusionRecombinant DNA technology was successfully used to engineer an scFv-based immunoadsorbent.

40|$|The HIV- 1 {{envelope}} glycoproteins gp 120 and gp 41 mediate binding and {{fusion of}} the virus to target cells. The envelope glycoproteins are exposed on the surface {{of the virus}} as trimeric spikes and are the major targets for neutralizing antibodies. The design of envelope glycoprotein-based subunit vaccines has been frustrated by many viral immune escape mechanisms. Trimeric envelope glycoprotein formulations hold promise to overcome limitations of monomeric envelope glycoproteins as immunogens. The generation of native, trimeric envelope glycoprotein complexes, however, remains a major challenge. Here, solid-phase proteoliposomes containing native, trimeric HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein complexes that mimic the trimeric complex as it is found on the viral surface have been designed. In a comparative immunogenicity study, these proteoliposomes were shown to better elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies than gp 120. A second trimeric envelope glycoprotein formulation, soluble YU 2 gp 140 -GCN 4 constructs, were also shown to better elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies in rabbits, extending a previous study in mice. These data support the hypothesis that trimeric envelope glycoprotein formulations are an advance over gp 120 -based immunogens. To date, only four broadly neutralizing antibodies against the HIV- 1 envelope glycoproteins have been identified. Here, three novel Fab antibody fragments binding to the CD 4 binding site of gp 120 have been identified from phage-displayed antibody libraries with proteoliposomes. These Fab antibodies display some breadth and potency in neutralizing HIV- 1. Comparison of the neutralizing activity of Fab antibodies and <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed to the CD 4 binding site suggests that these Fab antibodies may significantly gain neutralizing potency as <b>whole</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Many HIV- 1 immune escape mechanisms complicate the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Core gp 120 envelope glycoproteins derived from primary isolate viruses were found to be deficient in T-helper epitopes. This finding is suggestive of yet another HIV- 1 viral immune escape mechanism, the escape from recognition by CD 4 + T-helper cells...|$|E
40|$|A 35 -kDa polypeptide, Bp 35, {{expressed}} on {{the surface}} of all B cells, plays a role in B-cell activation. Monoclonal antibodies to Bp 35 stimulate human tonsillar B cells to proliferate. The activation induced by anti-Bp 35 is similar to anti-Ig-mediated in several ways: the activation does not require T cells but is augmented by T-cell-derived allogeneic factors; monovalent Fab fragments to Bp 35 do not trigger proliferation but instead block activation by <b>whole</b> <b>antibody,</b> indicating that cross-linking is required; and induction by anti-Bp 35, like the induction by anti-Ig, is inhibited by monoclonal anti-IgM via an Fc domain-dependent mechanism. However, several features of anti-Bp 35 -mediated proliferation are clearly different from activation by anti-Ig: anti-Bp 35 monoclonal antibodies do not require attachment to beads to function, the proliferation induced by anti-Bp 35 and anti-Ig is additive, and Fab fragments of anti-Bp 35 augment proliferation induced by anti-Ig.

We study human antibody response to breast cancer and mouse antibody response to Lyme disease by sequencing of the <b>whole</b> <b>antibody</b> repertoire profiles which are represented by RPPDL. Alternatively, instead of sequencing immune response NGS can be applied directly to a viral population within an infected host. Specifically, we analyze the following RNA viruses: the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Sequencing of RNA viruses is challenging {{because there are many}} variants inside population due to high mutation rate. Our results show that NGS helps to understand RNA viruses and explore their interaction with infected hosts. NGS also helps to analyze immune response to different diseases, trace changing of immune response at different disease stages...|$|R
