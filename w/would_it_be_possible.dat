5|$|The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to {{meet with}} representatives of Kellex, who were {{designing}} and building the American gaseous diffusion plant, Union Carbide and Carbon, who would operate it, and Harold Urey's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, the Manhattan Project's centre tasked with {{research and development of}} the process. The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes. Nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to build a second plant. Nonetheless, the Americans were still eager for British assistance, and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the gaseous diffusion project. In the meantime, Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex.|$|E
25|$|The Néstor Kirchner {{administration}} placed Brazil as {{a foreign}} policy priority and relations with Brazil were considered strategic. This was met with reciprocity in Brazil, as Lula da Silva placed Argentina as the main priority of his foreign policy. It should be emphasized, that the first foreign visit of Lula da Silva, as president-elect, was to Argentina in December 2002. From the Brazilian perspective, only with this strategic alliance <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to transform South America into a world power bloc, {{one of the goals}} of Lula da Silva's foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Moncayo in 1958 tangibly {{marked the end}} of the Mexican {{nationalist}} composition school. In the same way that his work without followers surpassed and abolished the innocent use of the Mexicanism theme, his death closed the predominance of a composition style whose imprint marked musical creation in Mexico during more than three decades; although only {{at the beginning of the}} sixties <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to talk about the definitive abandonment of the great Mexican fresco, the oblivion of the epic tone, and the search for new structural factors in composition.|$|E

25|$|During Japan's {{invasion}} and occupation of Manchuria Chiang Kai-shek, {{who saw the}} CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with them {{to fight against the}} Imperial Japanese Army. Chiang preferred to unite China by eliminating the warlords and CPC forces first. He believed that he was still too weak to launch an offensive to chase out Japan and that China needed time for a military build-up. Only after unification <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> for the KMT to mobilize a war against Japan. So he would rather ignore the discontent and anger among Chinese people at his policy of compromise with the Japanese, and ordered KMT generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to carry out suppression of the CPC; however, their provincial forces suffered significant casualties in battles with the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|Partly as {{a result}} of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first {{important}} figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France's greater resources of wealth and manpower. He began to advocate peace negotiations; indeed, as early as 1373, during his great raid through France, he made contact with , brother and political adviser of Pope Gregory XI, to let the pope know he would be interested in a diplomatic conference under papal auspices. This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374–77, which resulted in the short-lived Truce of Bruges between the two sides. John was himself a delegate to the various conferences that eventually resulted in the Truce of Leulinghem in 1389. The fact that he became identified with the attempts to make peace added to his unpopularity at a period when the majority of Englishmen believed victory would be in their grasp if only the French could be defeated decisively as they had been in the 1350s. Another motive was John's conviction that it was only by making peace with France <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to release sufficient manpower to enforce his claim to the throne of Castile.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think {{the state of our}} coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible,</b> without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E

500|$|According to Taliaferro, [...] "only {{after the}} deed was {{accomplished}} and Hay was installed as the {{ambassador to the}} Court of St. James's <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to detect just how subtly and completely he had finessed his ally and friend, Whitelaw Reid". A telegraph from Hay to McKinley in the latter's papers, dated December 26 (most likely 1896) reveals the former's suggestion that McKinley tell Reid that the editor's friends had insisted that Reid not endanger his health through office, especially in London's smoggy climes. The following month, in a letter, Hay set forth his own case for the ambassadorship, and urged McKinley to act quickly, as suitable accommodations in London {{would be difficult to}} secure. Hay gained his object (as did Hanna), and shifted his focus to appeasing Reid. Taliaferro states that Reid never blamed Hay, but Kushner and Sherrill recorded, [...] "Reid was certain that he had been wronged" [...] by Hay, and the announcement of Hay's appointment nearly ended their 26-year friendship.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Dallaire {{called for}} the reopening of Collège militaire royal de Saint-Jean, saying [...] "The {{possibility}} of starting a new program at the college – a military college that would allow all officer cadets to spend two years in Saint-Jean before going to Kingston, instead of studying only in Kingston – is being considered. In the spirit of progress, <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to support a principle as basic as the freedom of francophones in the Canadian Armed Forces by establishing a Cegep-style francophone bilingual military college." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{nothing else}} {{has changed from}} {{experimental}} configuration to experimental configuration, and since {{in the first case}} the photon is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a particle and in the second case it is said to [...] "decide" [...] to travel as a wave, Wheeler wanted to know whether, experimentally, a time could be determined at which the photon made its [...] "decision." [...] <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> to let a photon pass through the region of the first beam-splitter while there was no beam-splitter in the second position, thus causing it to [...] "decide" [...] to travel, and then quickly let the second beam-splitter pop up into its path? Having presumably traveled as a particle up to that moment, would the beam splitter let it pass through and manifest itself as would a particle were that second beam splitter not to be there? Or, would it behave as though the second beam-splitter had always been there? Would it manifest interference effects? And if it did manifest interference effects then to have done so it must have gone back in time and changed its decision about traveling as a particle to traveling as a wave. Note that Wheeler wanted to investigate several hypothetical statements by obtaining objective data.|$|E

50|$|Each digital {{oscillator}} {{could have}} one or two waveforms. Unlike other synthesizers, where having multiple waveforms caused those multiple waveforms to be mixed together (parallel), the CZ synthesizers would play one waveform and then play the other, and so on in alternation (series). This could cause the appearance of a sub-harmonic one octave below the nominal pitch of the sound, due to the period of the combined waveform taking twice as long as a single waveform <b>would.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to combine two non-resonant waveforms together, and to combine a resonant waveform with a non-resonant waveform, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not <b>possible</b> to combine two resonant waveforms.|$|R
