On {{the final day of}} commercial service, public interest <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that grandstands were erected at Heathrow Airport. Significant numbers of people attended the final landings; the event received widespread media coverage.|$|E

5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole {{to rise to}} the pinnacle of government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> {{a person}} by reason {{both of his}} {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Texas, {{ticket sales}} {{likewise}} were rapid. On {{the first day}} of sales, Texas' ticket office received 10,500 orders. The demand <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that some students camped overnight in front of the ticket office to ensure they would receive a ticket. Despite that initial surge in orders, as late as December 27, four days before the game, tickets were still readily available. In terms of chartered flights and the number of fans spending money at New Orleans businesses, Texas also trailed Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|Because the 1995 Sugar Bowl was Virginia Tech's {{first major}} bowl game in school history, tickets and travel {{packages}} {{were in high}} demand. Prior to {{the first day of}} ticket sales, the price of travel packages skyrocketed due to demand. In Virginia, travel agencies hired temporary workers to meet demand, and in New Orleans, the demand for hotel rooms <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that many hotels instituted a three-night minimum stay.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud {{is only a small}} part of the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|Most workers {{accepted}} {{the reduction in}} pay, but the firemen and those who ran the freight trains resolved to stop work in protest. However, the number of unemployed along the line <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great,</b> owing to the ongoing economic problems, {{that the company had}} no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of , a fire {{broke out in the}} Old Building. It caused {{widespread}} damage to {{a large part of the}} structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade's hoses. The damage to the building <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{after the}} victory the festival of the Agroteras Thysia ("sacrifice to the Agrotéra") {{was held at}} Agrae near Athens, in honor of Artemis Agrotera ("Artemis the Huntress"). This was in {{fulfillment}} of a vow made by the city before the battle, to offer in sacrifice a number of goats {{equal to that of}} the Persians slain in the conflict. The number <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great,</b> it was decided to offer 500 goats yearly until the number was filled. Xenophon notes that at his time, 90 years after the battle, goats were still offered yearly.|$|E

5|$|The Samian War {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{significant}} military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> as to make him the de facto ruler of the state. In 440 BC Samos went to war against Miletus over control of Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.|$|E
5|$|The disproportion <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> at parting, that it {{was almost}} impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a {{sufficient}} number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity be damned, that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E

The plant was officially opened in 1967 and is still making Plumbicon camera tubes today. Although the original use of Plumbicon camera tubes was in broadcast television, current demand is primarily in for use in medical imaging equipment.|$|E

5|$|Alfa Romeo {{dominated}} {{the rest of}} the Grand Prix season. Nuvolari and Campari drove the newly introduced Alfa Romeo P3 at the Italian Grand Prix, while Borzacchini and Caracciola drove much heavier 8Cs. Caracciola was forced to retired when his car broke down, but he took over Borzacchini's car when the Italian was hit by a stone, and came third, behind Nuvolari and Fagioli. In the French Grand Prix, Caracciola, now driving a P3, battled Nuvolari for the lead early on. Alfa Romeo's dominance <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> and their cars so far ahead the team could choose the top three finishing positions, thus Nuvolari won from Borzacchini and Caracciola, with the two Italians ahead of the German. The order was different at the 1932 German Grand Prix, where Caracciola won from Nuvolari and Borzacchini.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, {{and the office}} received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket distribution to fans who had contributed {{large amounts of money}} to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{employed}} trusted {{architects and}} engineers {{to run the}} projects, most prominently the Savoyard Master James of St George, but also Edward's close friend Otto de Grandson, the soldier Sir John de Bonvillars and the master mason John Francis. The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, ditch diggers and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>great</b> that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost £15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|E
