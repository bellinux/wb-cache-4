25|$|From Antiquity, {{depicting}} Helen {{would be}} a remarkable challenge. The story of Zeuxis deals with this exact question: how <b>would</b> <b>an</b> artist immortalize ideal beauty? He eventually selected the best features from five virgins. The ancient world starts to paint Helen's picture or inscribe her form on stone, clay and bronze by the 7th century BC. Helen is frequently depicted on Athenian vases as being threatened by Menelaus and fleeing from him. This is not the case, however, in Laconic art: on an Archaic stele depicting Helen's recovery {{after the fall of}} Troy, Menelaus is armed with a sword but Helen faces him boldly, looking directly into his eyes; and in other works of Peloponnesian art, Helen is shown carrying a wreath, while Menelaus holds his sword aloft vertically. In contrast, on Athenian vases of c.550–470, Menelaus threateningly points his sword at her.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of the position of deputy prime minister, a prime minister would routinely name a member of the cabinet to temporarily act on the prime minister's behalf while the prime minister was away from the regular duties of his job for a period of time, such as being out of the country on a working visit or a vacation. The delegate was thus a caretaker, whose role was to oversee the routine day-to-day functioning of the government and cabinet during the prime minister's absence; for example, in his capacity as acting prime minister, Mitchell Sharp ordered a precautionary one-day shutdown of government offices in Ottawa on August 20, 1970, as the storm that had spawned the Sudbury, Ontario, tornado headed toward Ottawa. An acting prime minister did not otherwise have the authority to act independently of the sitting prime minister in a legislative or political capacity, nor <b>would</b> <b>an</b> acting prime minister be considered to have actually served as prime minister. As well the acting prime minister was not given the title The Right Honourable, even during the acting period.|$|E

500|$|Heraclius {{spent the}} rest of winter to the north of Lake Van. In 625, his forces {{attempted}} to push back towards the Euphrates. In a mere seven days, he bypassed Mount Ararat and the 200 miles along the Arsanias River to capture Amida and Martyropolis, important fortresses on the upper Tigris. Heraclius then carried on towards the Euphrates, pursued by Shahrbaraz. According to Arab sources, he was stopped at the Satidama or Batman Su River and defeated; Byzantine sources, however, do not mention this incident. Another minor skirmish between Heraclius and Shahrbaraz took place at the Sarus river near Adana. Shahrbaraz stationed his forces across the river from the Byzantines. A bridge spanned the river, and the Byzantines immediately charged across. Shahrbaraz feigned retreat to lead the Byzantines into an ambush, and the vanguard of Heraclius' army was destroyed within minutes. The Sasanians, however, had neglected to cover the bridge, and Heraclius charged across with the rearguard, unafraid of the arrows that the Sasanians fired, turning the tide of battle against the Sasanians. Shahrbaraz expressed his admiration at Heraclius to a renegade Greek: [...] "See your Emperor! He fears these arrows and spears no more than <b>would</b> <b>an</b> anvil!" [...] The Battle of Sarus was a successful retreat for the Byzantines that panegyrists magnified. In the aftermath of the battle, the Byzantine army wintered at Trebizond.|$|E

Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named [...] "John Doe" [...] the best stand-alone episode of season nine {{and called it}} [...] "a refreshing change of pace". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two praised Gilligan's script and Patrick's performance, noting that the former [...] "writes the script with a dirtiness that gives it real power" [...] and the latter's acting was [...] "extraordinary". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'John Doe' shows that there's still a fresh take to be had on The X-Files after all". Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it [...] "a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season, both in its script and in its shooting." [...] She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done, and the script focused on [...] "strong character arcs", which worked towards its advantage. In the end, she concluded that the episode was [...] "part of the X-Files, more so than <b>would</b> <b>an</b> alien or a mutant" [...] because it focused {{on the idea that}} [...] "pain makes you, more pain makes you better, and living within that pain keeps you alive." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the central premise, the cinematography and Patrick's performance, calling [...] "John Doe" [...] a [...] "stylishly produced entry".|$|E
