You can either be a minicab driver or you can go into showbusiness" [...] and [...] "Prison is like mime or juggling – a tragic waste of time".|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Perkins {{told her}} agent, Debi Allen, {{about the idea}} and a meeting with a BBC comedy {{commissioner}} followed shortly after. Perkins was advised to work her idea into a six-part sitcom, which she initially resisted doing as she saw it more as a comedy drama instead. A sitcom required [...] "a 'sit' or precinct" [...] and Perkins eventually decided to locate the show in a veterinary surgery, as it features {{people from all walks}} of life. After the first episode was commissioned, a table-read was organised for December 2011. In April 2012, Perkins was filming World's Most Dangerous Roads in Laos, when she was told her sitcom had been commissioned for a full series. From April to July, Perkins wrote the remaining episodes. Perkins later called Heading Out [...] "a midlife crises sitcom", explaining [...] "It's more about how awkward it is to tell your parents anything, as opposed to just the gay issue. Essentially, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to your parents, you have to tell them, 'I'm having sex!'. And no one wants to say that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1943, Cappon {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} as coach at Princeton {{in order to}} accept a commission with the U.S. Navy. [...] He was assigned to St. Mary's Pre-Flight School in Moraga, California. [...] Cappon missed the 1943–1944 through 1945–1946 basketball seasons while serving in the Navy. [...] Cappon was a lieutenant in the Naval Aviation fitness program, where he wrote training texts and directed athletics for the fleet airwing on the West Coast. [...] After returning to Princeton, Cappon was outspoken {{on the value of}} athletics as an equalizer in American society. [...] In a 1952 speech, Cappon said: [...] "There are some basic principles that we're gradually losing sight of in America, but we still have them in athletics. [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> for an athletic team, your race, creed or color makes no difference. [...] Nobody asks you who you know or how much money you've got. [...] The athletic field is one place where the merit system still takes precedence over the seniority system." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And go to prison!" [...] she protested angrily. [...] "How {{much better}} off would you be there, I wonder, and what about <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out?</b> Pooh! Pay your bill and let's get out of this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It has its {{drawbacks}} now and then," [...] declared Kermode, smiling. [...] "Anyway, you needn't imagine you're {{shut off}} from everything of the kind. You {{took a big}} risk and faced a startling change <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> here." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You'll {{spend a day}} or two here," [...] he said, as {{he locked}} me in. [...] "Perhaps <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> you won't be so disrespectful to your superiors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did it on purpose? What; {{make up to}} Miss Madeline? Why, {{of course}} he did it on purpose. He's been a-thinking of it ever since Christmas night, <b>when</b> I saw <b>you,</b> Master Augustus, and a certain young lady <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> into the dark passage together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you should}} dive into this lake," [...] said Ephel the Messenger, [...] "your {{feathers}} would be dripping wet <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> again. It is here we Birds of Paradise bathe each morning, after which we visit the Gleaming Glade to perform our Beauty Dance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gregory's fiancée flushed. [...] "I couldn't {{have said}} that, but you don't quite {{understand}} yet. I said I knew {{all there was}} to know about him--and you never did. You made too much of him in England, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> here <b>you</b> only saw the things you didn't like in him. Still, they weren't the only ones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Too {{much they}} do--too long they've done. I'm {{sick and tired}} of it. Go and take a swim and larn to find your own vittles honest <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out,</b> Pussy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It would be, if I {{broke off}} the {{connection}} with my English friends, but I think that can't be done. We're {{to see more of}} each other; I'm to be your guide <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> next year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It won't hardly do, Charles William. You couldn't have growed {{this much}} in five year, and you {{was a baby}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the bar'l, you know, and dead at that. Come, now, tell a {{straight}} story, and nobody'll hurt you, if you ain't up to anything wrong. What IS your name?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I just {{drove over}} to Knoxbury {{to get some}} things for the seminary," [...] replied Royce; and then {{stepping}} closer he added in a lower tone: [...] "I saw you going into Meeker's restaurant a while ago and I stayed here to see <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b> I'd {{like to talk to}} you a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lance," [...] he said, {{a trifle}} hoarsely, [...] "it {{is not that}} which makes what has {{happened}} horrible to me, and I am only glad that you have righted this man. Your father had many claims on me, and things might have gone differently if, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> to Canada, I had done my duty by his son." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think that}} was a fantastic performance. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> I can see that look in your eyes, you are ready to perform, your {{features}} and gestures are so selective, you pick the right gestures, you know how to use the stage and how to excite the audience. You've nailed it. Congratulations"- Dato' Sheila Majid on Tomok's Aku Cinta Padamu rendition ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, come now, Tubbs-- you can't fool me. Most {{likely you}} have been {{practicing}} in private, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> on the diamond you will astonish everybody. Well, I am glad to know that Brill College is really to have a first-class pitcher at last. We need it {{if we are going}} to win any baseball games.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll try the bobby, then," [...] she said. [...] "There's {{a horrible}} murder {{this morning on}} the placards. How do I know that you're not the chap? It looks {{suspicious}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> in a new suit of clothes and throw the old ones into the river. Anyway, the bobby would {{want to ask you a}} few questions about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Castle {{assisted}} his pupil to dress, {{and when}} that was done to his entire satisfaction he said, in a stern voice, [...] "Now {{you can do this}} act all right, and if you slip up on it and don't do it as you ought to, I'll give you such a whipping <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the ring that you'll think Job was only fooling with you when he tried to whip you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{more you}} did," [...] cried Rokens, who {{had listened to}} the {{narrative}} with suppressed delight; [...] "no more you did.

6000|$|YOUNG MRS. BEMIS: 'Yes, indeed, I {{think so}} too, Mrs. Roberts. If Mr. Bemis--Alfred, I mean--and papa hadn't {{been with me}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> there to prepare us, I don't know what I should have done. I should {{certainly}} have died, or gone through the floor.' She looks fondly up {{into the face of}} her husband for approval, where he stands behind her chair, and furtively gives him her hand for pressure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't I do that well? I {{give you}} my word it was all done {{on the spur of}} the minute. I meant to speak soon, but had not decided how, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> so sweetly with that confounded old cloak, of which I'd no more need than an African has of a blanket. Then a scene I'd read in a novel came into my head, and I just {{repeated}} it con amore. Was I very pathetic and tragical. Amy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! yes, you {{are right}} enough, for it is here," [...] said the old man. [...] "When you get inside they will all want to buy your ham, for they don't get much meat to eat there; but you must not sell it unless {{you can get the}} hand-mill which stands behind the door for it. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> again I will teach you how to stop the hand-mill, which is useful for almost everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Every {{apartment}} has its bathroom," [...] Cuitcatl said. [...] "The water {{runs for}} an hour after sunrise only, {{but it can be}} turned on at any hour. It seems a waste, but we are far above the lower portion of the garden, and the water therefore runs into a tank and thence works the fountains there. Would you like your attendant to rub you in the bath, or <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of it? For both methods are in use with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Staniford. [...] "I didn't mean anything. It {{was merely}} the guilty {{consciousness}} of a generally disagreeable person." [...] They {{walked up and}} down many turns without saying anything. She could not have made any direct protest, and it pleased him that she could not frame any flourishing generalities. [...] "Yes," [...] Staniford resumed, [...] "I will try to see you as I pass through Venice. And I will come to hear you sing <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> at Milan." ...|$|E
6000|$|Seeing my surprise, he went on, [...] "I {{drove down}} in a gig that {{afternoon}} to look after that boy. You might have heard my wheels <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> to look after him yourself, for I was aware {{of you and your}} little maid going up when I was walking the horse down. Making an inquiry or two about him in the town, I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him <b>when</b> I observed <b>you</b> bringing him home here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> on us {{from among}} the sand hills, that morning, looking for Mr. Betteredge? You were like a prince in a fairy-story. You were like a lover in a dream. You were the most adorable human creature I had ever seen. Something that felt like the happy life I had never led yet, leapt up in me at the instant I set eyes on you. Don't laugh at this {{if you can help}} it. Oh, if I could only make you feel how serious it is to ME! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} it would," [...] said Eveline Annersly. [...] "Still, I don't {{think it would}} have troubled <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first <b>came</b> <b>out.</b> That is not so very long ago, is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was aghast. [...] "Don't say that, I beg of you! Good Heavens! don't let my preachment {{discourage}} you. You see, I {{have two}} or three hobbies, and when I am once mounted I'm sure to ride right over somebody's garden wall." [...] He rose and approached her. [...] "I shall never forgive myself if I have taken away the smallest degree of your enthusiasm. My aim--if I had an aim--was to help you to understand my people, so that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> next summer--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, of course, by and by, Eva, {{you will}} have other things to think of besides reading the Bible round to servants. Not but that is very proper; I've done it myself, when I had health. But {{when you come to}} be {{dressing}} and going into company, you won't have time. See here!" [...] she added, [...] "these jewels I'm going to give you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out.</b> I wore them to my first ball. I can tell you, Eva, I made a sensation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One summer's day Prue and Simon take Peter for a walk. In the country. And {{they meet}} a cow. And {{they think this}} a good opportunity. To test Peter's knowledge. Of languages. So they tell him {{to talk to the}} cow. And he talks to the cow. And the cow don't {{understand}} him. And he don't understand the cow. And they are mad with him. 'What is the use,' they say. 'Of our paying expensive fees. To have you taught the language. By a first-class cow. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> into the country. You can't talk it.' And he says he did talk it. But they will not listen to him. But go on raving. And in the end it turns out. IT WAS A JERSEY COW! What talked a dialect. So of course he couldn't understand it. But did they apologise? Oh dear no.|$|E

6000|$|... "We didn't {{want you}} to know till the evening was over. I knew <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> for the drill that you had heard. Little sister, I had to do it. I couldn't live any longer on such terms with myself as I have been since the Lusitania was sunk. When I pictured those dead women and {{children}} floating about in that pitiless, ice-cold water--well, at first I just felt a sort of nausea with life. I {{wanted to get out of}} the world where such a thing could happen--shake its accursed dust from my feet for ever. Then I knew I had to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Afterwards, then," [...] she answered. [...] "We {{are going}} first {{out of the}} place. We shall turn seawards and wait for <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have <b>come</b> <b>out,</b> <b>you</b> will hand us your {{electric}} torches and go on in front." ...|$|R
