5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs. This route was slightly longer than the Sublette, but {{had the advantage of}} only 10 <b>waterless</b> miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Budge was {{approached}} by a resident of Gebelein {{who claimed to have}} found more mummies. Budge was taken to the bodies, and he immediately recognized them as from the predynastic period and the first complete pre-dynastic bodies identified. He began excavations and a total of six mummified bodies were removed from shallow sand graves at Baḥr Bila Mâ (<b>Waterless</b> River) located at the eastern slopes of the north-most hill at Gebelein.|$|E
5|$|In the Battle of Beersheba in October 1917, it {{was again}} Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the {{critical}} role. Chetwode believed that the EEF {{did not have the}} resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at Beersheba, in a <b>waterless</b> area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over <b>waterless</b> desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a mounted infantry bayonet charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade– the last of history's great cavalry charges– to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours List.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} Khalid's {{strategic}} maneuverability was his advance into Roman Syria. Emperor Heraclius had sent all his available garrisoned troops into Syria, towards Ajnadayn, {{to hold the}} Muslim troops at the Syria-Arabia border region. The possible route of any Muslim reinforcement {{was expected to be}} the conventional Syria-Arabia road in the south, but Khalid, who was then in Iraq, took the most unexpected route: marching through the <b>waterless</b> Syrian desert, to the surprise of the Byzantines, he appeared in northern Syria. Catching the Byzantines off guard, he quickly captured several towns, virtually cutting off the communications of the Byzantine army at Ajnadayn with its high command at Emesa, where emperor Heraclius himself resided.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are {{abundant}} in valleys and beside rivers and their tributaries, canals, lakes, and seashores. They are rare in foothills and low mountains, and they avoid <b>waterless</b> deserts and snow areas. The golden jackal {{is a social}} species, the basic social unit of which consists of a breeding pair and any young offspring. It is very adaptable, {{with the ability to}} exploit food ranging from fruit and insects to small ungulates. They will attack domestic fowl and domestic mammals up to the size of domestic water buffalo calves. The jackal's competitors are the red fox, wolf, jungle cat, forest wildcat, and the raccoon in the Caucasus, and the steppe wildcat in Central Asia. In Europe, jackals will not occupy the same areas as wolves, with the jackal's expansion being attributed to their occupying those areas where wolves are few or non-existent.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, RTI's {{staff of}} 430 was reorganized into four {{research}} groups: {{social and economic}} systems, statistical sciences, environmental sciences and engineering, and chemistry and life sciences. It also created a division for education called the Center for Education Research and Evaluation. Four years later, RTI created the Office for International Programs to manage international projects. RTI provided funding assistance to help found the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in 1980, {{and two years later}} was part of a joint venture to create Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC), a non-profit whose computer network connected local K-12 schools. A Health Solutions division formed in 2000 serves the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. In 2015, it formed a subsidiary in New Delhi, India. Among other projects, it was funded to develop a <b>waterless</b> toilet for use in third-world countries.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{upstream}} from Casper, the North Platte bends to the south. The original trail proceeded several {{miles along the}} river to Red Buttes, where {{a bend in the}} river formed a natural amphitheater dominated by red cliffs on the hill above. The river was easier to ford here for those who were unwilling or unable to pay to cross at one of the ferries downstream. This was the last good camp spot before leaving the river and entering the <b>waterless</b> stretch between the North Platte and the Sweetwater River. From here the settlers entered a difficult portion called Rock Avenue which moved from spring to spring across mostly alkaline soil and steep hills until it reached the Sweetwater River. Later settlers who had crossed to the northern side of the river at Casper would come to favor a route through a small valley called Emigrant Gap which headed directly to Rock Avenue, bypassing Red Buttes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterless</b> urinals {{may also}} use an outlet system that traps the odor, {{preventing}} the smell often present in toilet blocks. Another method to eliminate odor {{was introduced by}} Caroma, which installed a deodorizing block in their <b>waterless</b> urinal that was activated during use.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>waterless</b> urinals do {{not prevent}} odorous {{staining}} {{on the surface}} of the urinals, and periodic cleaning of the fixture and its surrounds is still required. When maintained according to manufacturers' recommendations, well-designed <b>waterless</b> urinals do not emit any more odors than flushed urinals do. However, some odor-trapping devices work better than others in the longer term. Regular, thorough maintenance of the respective odor control device is needed for all types of <b>waterless</b> urinals, as per the manufacturer's recommendation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterless</b> urinals can be {{installed}} in high-traffic facilities, and in situations where providing a water supply may be difficult or where water conservation is desired. Due to high-level water restrictions, Brisbane, Australia, has mandated conversion to <b>waterless</b> urinals, and flush urinals are rarely seen there.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterless</b> urinals {{have become}} rather common in Germany since about 2009 {{and can be}} found at restaurants, cinemas, highway rest stops, train {{stations}} and so forth. <b>Waterless</b> urinals can be integrated into ecological sanitation approaches where the collected urine—after storage—can be used in agriculture as a fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Plumbers' unions {{initially}} opposed <b>waterless</b> urinals, citing {{concerns about}} health and safety, {{which have been}} debunked by scientists who have studied the devices. Facing opposition to their attempts to have the devices allowed in plumbing codes, manufacturers devised a compromise. The Uniform Plumbing Code was modified to allow <b>waterless</b> urinals to be installed, provided that unneeded water lines were nevertheless run {{to the back of}} the urinals. This allows conventional water-flushing urinals to be retrofitted later, if <b>waterless</b> models were judged to be unsatisfactory over time.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Harrison {{started the}} On-Off Chemical Corporation, which {{manufactured}} and distributed On-Off, a <b>waterless</b> cleaner for hands.|$|E
25|$|Models of <b>waterless</b> urinals {{introduced}} by the <b>Waterless</b> Company in 1991 and others in 2001 by Falcon Waterfree Technologies and Sloan Valve Company, as well as Duravit, use a trap insert filled with a sealant liquid instead of water. The lighter-than-water sealant floats {{on top of the}} urine collected in the U-bend, preventing odors from being released into the air. The cartridge and sealant must be periodically replaced.|$|E
25|$|Composting toilets {{usually do}} not divert urine. Offering a <b>waterless</b> urinal in {{addition}} to the toilet can help keep excess amounts of urine out of the composting chamber.|$|E
25|$|Clearly {{it was no}} {{easy task}} to {{transport}} several dozen vehicles {{and a couple of}} hundred men across 800 miles of <b>waterless</b> desert without attracting the attention of the enemy.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a series}} reconnaissances and work by field {{engineers}} in the apparently <b>waterless</b> desert, based on intelligence produced sufficient water, {{to the west}} of Beersheba for the horses, and the horses circling to the south in a wide arch.|$|E
25|$|Since {{about the}} 1990s urinals are {{available}} on the market that use no water at all. These are called <b>waterless</b> urinals or flushless urinals. They were first invented by a German named Klaus Reichardt, who secured his innovation with several patents.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{is the first}} airport terminal in the United States to be LEED certified for environmentally friendly design by the U.S. Green Building Council. Among the building's features are heat-reflecting roof and windows, low-flow faucets and <b>waterless</b> urinals, self-dimming lights and storm water filtration.|$|E
25|$|The city is {{situated}} on a broad, flat, treeless and largely <b>waterless</b> plain, {{except for a}} large underground aquifer – {{at the time of}} its founding, a matter of national scandal and notoriety as to corrupt dealings at the time, since it is immediately adjacent to amply watered and treed rolling parklands.|$|E
25|$|Greywater systems reuse drained {{wash water}} to flush toilets or to water lawns and gardens. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most {{residential}} buildings; however, they require {{the purchase of}} a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary plumbing. Some builders are installing <b>waterless</b> urinals and even composting toilets that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.|$|E
25|$|The Terry Thomas {{was also}} {{designed}} to conserve {{as much water}} as possible. A storm water drainage system was designed to detain runoff into an on-site tank, and then slowly release it to the city storm water system. Low-flow fixtures, dual-flush toilets and <b>waterless</b> urinals were installed {{in order to save}} an approximate 50% of the water during everyday operation as compared to a typical office building.|$|E
25|$|Given the few {{roads and}} {{railroad}} lines, the nearly <b>waterless</b> and largely unpopulated Atacama Desert {{was difficult to}} occupy. From the beginning naval superiority was critical. Bolivia had no navy, so on March 26, 1879 Hilarión Daza formally offered letters of marque to any ships willing to fight for Bolivia. The Armada de Chile and Marina de Guerra del Perú fought the naval battles.|$|E
25|$|The {{drain pipes}} from <b>waterless</b> urinals {{need to be}} {{installed}} correctly in terms of diameter, slope and pipe materials {{in order to prevent}} buildup of struvite ("urine stone") and calcium phosphate precipitates in the pipes, which would cause blockages and could require expensive repairs. Also, the undiluted urine is corrosive to metals (except for stainless steel), which is why plastic pipes are generally preferred for urine drain pipes.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before this}} Australia's rice {{production}} greatly exceeded local needs, and rice exports to Japan {{have become a}} major source of foreign currency. Above-average rainfall from the 1950s to the middle 1990s encouraged the expansion of the Riverina rice industry, but its prodigious water use in a practically <b>waterless</b> region began {{to attract the attention of}} environmental scientists. These became severely concerned with declining flow in the Snowy River and the lower Murray River.|$|E
25|$|The separate, <b>waterless</b> {{collection}} {{and treatment of}} urine and feces in UDDTs prevents hormones, pharmaceutical residues and other micro-pollutants which are contained in human excreta from entering surface water or groundwater via treated sewage. This is because in conventional sewage treatment plants, these micro-pollutants are only partially removed and the remainder is discharged into surface water, possibly reaching the groundwater. Detected concentrations of pharmaceutical residues in groundwater {{were in the order}} of 50ng/L in several locations in Germany.|$|E
25|$|The citadel of Atlit {{having been}} {{dismantled}} by the Mamluks in 1291, Tortosa remained {{the most likely}} stronghold on the mainland which {{had the potential to}} be recaptured. From Cyprus, King Henry and members of the three military orders (Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights), attempted to retake Tortosa in 1300. The plan was to establish a bridghead on the tiny <b>waterless</b> island of Ruad, just two miles (3km) off the coast, from which they could launch raids on the city.|$|E
25|$|Common {{spaces in}} the {{building}} such as a lunchroom, the entry, conference rooms, and several support areas, are shared by the two state agencies. Laboratory spaces are designed for flexibility and allow usage {{for a variety of}} tasks. The building met state energy efficiency standards, in part by using natural light in offices located along the exterior walls and by incorporating skylights for interior hallways. Other efficiency items include a high-efficiency boiler that can be controlled from Salem, a <b>waterless</b> urinal, and motion detectors in offices to turn off lights after periods of no usage.|$|E
25|$|The {{bishops of}} Ascalon whose names are known include Sabinus, {{who was at}} the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and his {{immediate}} successor, Epiphanius. Auxentius took part in the First Council of Constantinople in 381, Jobinus in a synod held in Lydda in 415, Leontius in both the Robber Council of Ephesus in 449 and the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Bishop Dionysius, who represented Ascalon at a synod in Jerusalem in 536, was on another occasion called upon to pronounce on the validity of a baptism with sand in <b>waterless</b> desert and sent the person to be baptized in water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterless</b> urinals {{are often}} {{installed}} alongside UDDTs {{for the convenience}} of male users. Urinals also reduce the risk that male users standing over the UDDT for urination (rather than sitting or squatting) inadvertently urinate into the feces vault or feces container. It is generally advisable that all UDDT users sit or squat to urinate. If urinals are provided, they can be used for those who prefer a standing position. Female urination devices are also available but they are not necessary for use with UDDTs as women normally sit or squat to urinate, a good posture which minimises urine from getting into the feces vault.|$|E
25|$|The Grant's gazelle {{is found}} in East Africa and lives in open grass plains and is {{frequently}} found in shrublands; it avoids areas with high grass where the visibility of predators is compromised. They also occur in semiarid areas and are relatively well adapted to dry areas, relying on more browse or leafy material during dry seasons to supplement their intake of water. They are migratory animals, but travel {{in the opposite direction}} of most of the other ungulates, such as Thomson's gazelles, zebras, and wildebeest, which are more water dependent. They can subsist on vegetation in <b>waterless,</b> semiarid areas, where they face little competition.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} stages—egg, larva, and pupa—are largely aquatic. These stages {{typically}} last 5 to 14 days, {{depending on the}} species and the ambient temperature, but there are important exceptions. Mosquitoes living in regions where some seasons are freezing or <b>waterless</b> spend {{part of the year}} in diapause; they delay their development, typically for months, and carry on with life only when there is enough water or warmth for their needs. For instance, Wyeomyia larvae typically get frozen into solid lumps of ice during winter and only complete their development in spring. The eggs of some species of Aedes remain unharmed in diapause if they dry out, and hatch later when they are covered by water.|$|E
25|$|One {{advantage}} of squat toilets {{is that they}} are very easy to clean. They are also cheaper to make, they consume less water per flush than Western toilets, and, {{due to the lack of}} direct contact with the seat, some people claim that they are more hygienic. However, seat contact is not a real health risk and squat toilets allow splatter on one's own legs and feet. The <b>waterless</b> trough minimizes the risk of splash-back of water during defecation. However, because the products of excretion sit exposed to the open air until flushed away, they commonly produce much stronger odors than they would when submerged as in a Western toilet, an effect that is often quite noticeable in or anywhere near a Japanese restroom.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{portion of}} the Ad Dahna curves westward following the arc of the Jabal Tuwayq. At its southern end, it merges with the Rub' al Khali, one of the truly forbidding sand deserts in the world and, until the 1950s, {{one of the least}} explored. The topography of this huge area, covering more than 550,000 square kilometers, is varied. In the west, the elevation is about 600 meters, and the sand is fine and soft; in the east, the elevation drops to about 180 meters, and much of the surface is covered by relatively stable sand sheets and salt flats. In places, particularly in the east, longitudinal sand dunes prevail; elsewhere sand mountains as much as 300 meters in height form complex patterns. Most of the area is totally <b>waterless</b> and uninhabited except for the few wandering Bedouin tribes.|$|E
25|$|At Weishan Lake, both courses enter Shandong province. From here to Linqing, {{the canal}} {{is called the}} Lu or ‘Shandong’ Canal. It crosses a series of lakes – Zhaoyang, Dushan and Nanyang – which {{nominally}} form a continuous body of water. At present, diversions of water mean that the lakes are often largely dry land. North of the northernmost Nanyang Lake is the city of Jining. Further on, about 30km north of Jining, the highest elevation of the canal (38.5 m above sea level) is reached at the town of Nanwang. In the 1950s a new canal was dug {{to the south of}} the old summit section. The old summit section is now dry, while the new canal holds too little water to be navigable. About 50km further north, passing close by Dongping Lake, the canal reaches the Yellow River. By this point <b>waterless,</b> it no longer communicates with the river. It reappears again in Liaocheng City on the north bank where, intermittently flowing through a renovated stone channel, it reaches the city of Linqing on the Shandong – Hebei border.|$|E
500|$|As the {{building}} was under construction, in March 2006, Liberty Property Trust ran into trouble with Philadelphia's Plumbers Union Local 690, which had issues with {{the building}}'s <b>waterless</b> urinals. The <b>waterless</b> urinals {{were part of the}} plan to make the Comcast Center an environmentally friendly building because they would save an extra [...] of water a year. The plumbers union opposed the <b>waterless</b> urinals, claiming they were unsanitary and would provide less work for the plumbers. Philadelphia's Plumbing Advisory Board approved the <b>waterless</b> urinals on April 5 after a compromise, which stated that the building's owners and city officials would monitor the performance of the <b>waterless</b> urinals, was reached. Piping that would allow water to flow to the urinals in case they needed to be converted was installed in the Comcast Center, which Liberty Property Trust says was always part of the building's plan.|$|E
