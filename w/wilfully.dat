5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have <b>wilfully</b> impeded other competitors.|$|E
5|$|Rupert's {{reputation}} {{never truly}} recovered, and in subsequent sieges and attacks he was frequently accused of acting without restraint. Birmingham, a key arms producing town, {{was taken in}} April 1643, and Rupert faced allegations—probably untrue—of <b>wilfully</b> burning the town to the ground (see the battle of Camp Hill). Shortly afterwards Rupert attempted to take the town of Lichfield, whose garrison had executed Royalist prisoners, angrily promising to kill all the soldiers inside. Only the urgent call for assistance from the King prevented him from doing so, forcing him to agree to more lenient terms {{in exchange for a}} prompt surrender. Towards the end of the war, practices were changing for the worse across all sides; a rebellious Leicester was retaken by the Prince in May 1645, and no attempt was made to limit the subsequent killing and plunder.|$|E
5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and <b>wilfully</b> evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants {{were expected to}} be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were very poorly paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} {{people were}} indicted {{by a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of <b>wilfully</b> interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E

25|$|Obstructing {{the field}} is Law 37 in the Laws of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman can be given out for obstructing the field if he <b>wilfully</b> attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action.|$|E
25|$|Fielders cannot use {{gloves to}} field the ball. If they <b>wilfully</b> use {{any part of}} their {{clothing}} to field the ball they may be penalised 5 penalty runs to the opposition.

25|$|Law 37: Obstructing the field. If a batsman <b>wilfully</b> obstructs the {{opposition}} by word or action or strikes {{the ball with}} a hand not holding the bat, he is out.

25|$|A fielder or fieldsman may {{field the}} ball with any part of his body. However, if while the ball is in play he <b>wilfully</b> fields it {{otherwise}} (e.g. by using his hat), the ball becomes dead and five penalty runs are awarded to the batting side, unless the ball previously struck a batsman not attempting to hit or avoid the ball. Most of the rules covering fielders are in Law 28 of the Laws of cricket.|$|E
25|$|The {{charges on}} which Milošević was indicted were: genocide; {{complicity}} in genocide; deportation; murder; persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds; inhumane acts/forcible transfer; extermination; imprisonment; torture; willful killing; unlawful confinement; <b>wilfully</b> causing great suffering; unlawful deportation or transfer; extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity {{and carried out}} unlawfully and wantonly; cruel treatment; plunder of public or private property; attacks on civilians; destruction or wilful damage done to historic monuments and institutions dedicated to education or religion; unlawful attacks on civilian objects. The ICTY indictment reads that Milošević {{was responsible for the}} forced deportation of 800,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, and the murder of hundreds of Kosovo Albanians and hundreds of non-Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{criminal}} offence under cantonal and federal law to <b>wilfully</b> cause one's taxes to be incompletely assessed. The statutes distinguish, however, between tax evasion and tax fraud. Tax evasion is the act of causing a tax to be falsely assessed, such as through the failure to report taxable income. It is classed as a misdemeanour (Übertretung / contravention) and is punishable by a fine of 33% to 300% {{of the amount of}} tax evaded. Tax fraud, on the other hand, occurs if a tax evasion is committed by using false documents (such as untrue corporate financial reports) for deceptive purposes. It is classed as a crime (Vergehen / crime) and is punishable by additional imprisonment of up to three years or an additional fine of up to 30,000 CHF.|$|E
25|$|According to Quran 24:4, {{the proof}} that {{adultery}} has occurred requires four eyewitnesses to the act, {{which must have}} been committed by {{a man and a}} woman not validly married to one another, and the act must have been <b>wilfully</b> committed by consenting adults. Proof can also be determined by a confession. But this confession must be voluntary, and based on legal counsel; it must be repeated on four separate occasions, and made by a person who is sane. Otherwise, the accuser is then accorded a sentence for defamation (which means flogging or a prison sentence), and his or her testimony is excluded in all future court cases. There is disagreement between Islamic scholars on whether female eyewitnesses are acceptable witnesses in cases of zina (for other crimes, sharia considers two female witnesses equal the witness of one male).|$|E
25|$|The Serjeant-at-Arms is {{the officer}} of Parliament {{who has the}} duty of {{maintaining}} order in the precincts of the House. For instance, if the conduct of any MP is grossly disorderly during a sitting of Parliament, the Speaker or a committee chairman may order {{him or her to}} withdraw immediately from Parliament {{for the rest of the}} day's sitting, and the Speaker or chairman may instruct the Serjeant to enforce the order. The Speaker may also direct an MP to withdraw when Parliament has voted to suspend him or her for committing the offence of disregarding the authority of the Chair or of persistently and <b>wilfully</b> obstructing the business of Parliament. If the MP refuses to obey this direction despite having been summoned several times to do so by the Serjeant acting under the Speaker's orders, the Serjeant may use force to compel the MP's obedience to the direction.|$|E
25|$|British {{political}} {{opinion was}} also {{shaped by the}} attempted Impeachment of Warren Hastings; the trial, whose proceedings began in 1788, ended with Hastings' acquittal, in 1795. Although the effort was chiefly coordinated by Edmund Burke, it also drew support from within the British government. Burke accused Hastings not only of corruption, but—appealing to universal standards of justice—also of acting solely upon his own discretion, without concern for law, and of <b>wilfully</b> causing distress to others in India. Hastings' defenders countered that his actions were consistent with Indian customs and traditions. Although Burke's speeches at the trial drew applause and focused attention on India, Hastings was eventually acquitted, {{due in part to}} the revival of nationalism in Britain in the wake of the French Revolution. Nonetheless, Burke's effort had the effect of creating a sense of responsibility in British public life for the Company's dominion in India.|$|E
25|$|Obstructing {{the field}} {{is one of the}} nine methods of dismissing a batsman in the sport of cricket. It {{dictates}} that either batsman can be given out if he <b>wilfully</b> attempts to obstruct or distract the fielding side by word or action. It is governed by Law 37 of the laws of cricket, and is a rare way for a batsman to be dismissed: in the history of cricket, there have been only one instance in Test matches, six occasions in One Day International (ODI) games, and only one instance in Twenty20 International matches. However, there have also been seven instances in Test cricket, and two in ODIs, where a batsman has been dismissed handled the ball, a mode of dismissal now folded into obstructing the field. In most cases an obstruction occurs when a batsman thinks {{that he is going to}} be run out and he blocks the ball with his bat or changes his course while running between wickets to block the ball. The obstruction has to be deliberate, so a batsman will not be out any the contact with the ball is inadvertent.|$|E
25|$|After {{her death}} Mead's Samoan {{research}} was criticized by anthropologist Derek Freeman, who {{published a book}} that argued against many of Mead's conclusions. Freeman argued that Mead had misunderstood Samoan culture when she argued that Samoan culture did not place many restrictions on youths' sexual explorations. Freeman argued instead that Samoan culture prized female chastity and virginity and that Mead had been misled by her female Samoan informants. Freeman's critique was met with a considerable backlash and harsh criticism from the anthropology community, whereas it was received enthusiastically by communities of scientists who believed that sexual mores {{were more or less}} universal across cultures. Some anthropologists who studied Samoan culture argued in favor of Freeman's findings and contradicted those of Mead, whereas others argued that Freeman's work did not invalidate Mead's work because Samoan culture had been changed by the integration of Christianity in the decades between Mead's and Freeman's fieldwork periods. While Mead was careful to shield the identity of all her subjects for confidentiality Freeman was able to find and interview one of her original participants, and Freeman reported that she admitted to having <b>wilfully</b> misled Mead. She said that she and her friends were having fun with Mead and telling her stories.|$|E

500|$|Truman {{has had his}} latter-day {{critics as}} well. After a review of {{information}} available to Truman {{about the presence of}} espionage activities in the U.S. government, Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan concluded that Truman was [...] "almost <b>wilfully</b> obtuse" [...] concerning the danger of American communism. In 2010, historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that [...] "Harry Truman remains a controversial president." [...] However, since leaving office, Truman has fared well in polls ranking the presidents. He has never been listed lower than ninth, and was ranked fifth in a C-SPAN poll in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Assault {{requires}} a positive act, not an omission. Mere lawful {{presence in a}} location {{is not enough to}} satisfy the conduct requirement; illegal trespass, however, is sufficient. John Cyril Smith has suggested that <b>wilfully</b> refusing to retract an inadvertent act that causes the victim to apprehend violence may constitute an assault by omission. It is arguable that there was once a rule that [...] "mere words" [...] could not constitute an assault, but the case of R v Ireland confirmed that even silent phone calls would be grounds for the charge of assault. R. v Constanza added threatening letters to this category.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{cause of}} death could not be established. It was thought that a sharp {{instrument}} had been plunged into Marten's eye socket, possibly Corder's short sword, but this wound could also {{have been caused by}} her father's spade when he was exhuming the body. Strangulation could not be ruled out, as Corder's handkerchief had been discovered around her neck; to add to the confusion, the wounds to her body suggested that she had been shot. The indictment charged Corder with [...] "murdering Maria Marten, by feloniously and <b>wilfully</b> shooting her with a pistol through the body, and likewise stabbing her with a dagger." [...] To avoid any chance of a mistrial, he was indicted on nine charges, including one of forgery.|$|E

500|$|The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance states what {{manner of}} use of the Hong Kong flag is {{prohibited}} and that desecration of the flag is prohibited; it also states {{that it is a}} punishable offence for a person to use the flag in a prohibited manner or desecrate the flag. [...] According to the ordinance, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that [...] "publicly and <b>wilfully</b> burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling" [...] the flag is considered flag desecration. Similarly, the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance extends the same prohibition toward the national PRC flag. The ordinances also allow for the Chief Executive to make stipulations regarding the use of the flag. [...] In stipulations made in 1997, the Chief Executive further specified that the use of the flag in [...] "any trade, calling or profession, or the logo, seal or badge of any non-governmental organisation" [...] is also prohibited unless prior permission was obtained.|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{said that}} the album [...] "may be a return to core values, but there's still a bravery about Confessions on a Dancefloor. It revels in the delights of <b>wilfully</b> plastic dance pop {{in an era when}} lesser dance-pop artists– from Rachel Stevens to Price's protege Juliet– are having a desperately thin time of it." [...] Peter Robinson from Observer Music Monthly {{declared}} that the album ranks alongside Madonna's other albums like True Blue (1986) and Like a Prayer (1989). He credited producer Stuart Price for the album, noting that [...] "Confessions clearly wouldn't exist without Madonna, but it's Price who steals the show." [...] Stephen M. Deusner from Pitchfork noted that with the album [...] "Madonna again reinvents herself, and it appears she's nearly lapped herself." [...] According to Deusner, the music also makes her appear young. However he felt that {{the first half of the}} album till [...] "I Love New York" [...] was strong, while the second half [...] "loses its delicate balance between pop frivolity and spiritual gravity." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his later}} years Henson's lifelong sense of {{loneliness}} was compounded by the growing deafness of his wife, making their conversation difficult. He found some solace in the friendship of her companion, Fearne Booker, who lived with the Hensons for more than thirty years. He occupied a considerable part of his retirement writing a substantial work of autobiography, published in three volumes under the title Retrospect of an Unimportant Life. Both {{at the time and}} subsequently many of his friends and admirers regretted his publishing the work; they thought he had done his reputation a disservice. Despite what Williams calls the [...] "peculiar interest and vivacity" [...] of the books, his survey of his many campaigns and controversies, seemed to others to be self-justifying and <b>wilfully</b> to deny many changes of stance that he had manifestly made during his career. In Williams's view the posthumous publication of Henson's edited letters were a better legacy: [...] "delightful in both form and content, and, barbed though they often are, they do him fuller justice".|$|E
500|$|In April 2012, an American {{band that}} {{went by the}} same name filed a {{trademark}} infringement lawsuit. According to the lawsuit, the US band had been using the name since 2009, recorded two albums and filed an application to register the trademark name in the US in February 2011. The US band said they were entitled to three times the profits made by the UK band, as well as compensatory damages in excess of US$1million. The lawsuit claimed that Syco and Sony Music [...] "chose to ignore the plaintiff's rights and <b>wilfully</b> infringed them" [...] after they realised in early 2011 that the two bands shared the same name. Syco Records subsequently counter-sued, suggesting the US group {{was trying to make}} money from One Direction's success and that the boy band was the first to use the name in US interstate commerce. The BBC reported in September 2012 that the UK group won the legal dispute over the right to keep using their band name; the US band changed its name to Uncharted Shores. The change of name was announced in a joint statement that also noted both groups were happy with the outcome.|$|E
500|$|When Sullivan {{turned to}} comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. Peter Gammond writes of [...] "misapprehensions and prejudices, {{delivered}} to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements {{that could not}} be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art." [...] As early as 1877 The Figaro wrote that Sullivan [...] "has all the ability to make him a great composer, but he <b>wilfully</b> throws his opportunity away. ... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling." [...] Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores. The Theatre wrote that [...] "Iolanthe sustains Dr Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced." [...] However, comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The Athenaeum's review of The Martyr of Antioch declared: [...] "t is an advantage to have the composer of H.M.S. Pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art." ...|$|E
500|$|Jake Muncy of Wired, though {{impressed}} with the game, noted {{that the lack of}} any narrative or gameplay guidance could cause [...] "players to bounce off [...] entirely". Further, on completing the game, Muncy believed that though Blow had compared his game to the novel Gravity's Rainbow, it failed to create a vivid living setting in the island in contrast to the novel as to make it an engaging work. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised the game's puzzles for providing numerous [...] "eureka" [...] moments to the player and considered the title as the video game analog of the Goldberg Variations, but felt that the narrative atop the puzzles was [...] "self-involved and <b>wilfully</b> obscure", and believed {{that it could have been}} omitted, as Blow and his team [...] "needn't have tried to make a puzzle out of art when he had already, so beautifully and so successfully, made art out of puzzles". Justin McElroy of Polygon gave the game an 8/10 rating, describing it as [...] "uplifting but frustrating"; he criticized the length of time involved in solving certain puzzles while expressing concern that less-patient players would take shortcuts. [...] "That will naturally lead to more cheating. It will snowball." ...|$|E
