During the first months that she lived at the hospital, she gradually began to express more of her emotions outward. After a fairly short time, Genie's nonverbal communication skills became exceptional. Everyone who worked with her said she had an indescribable way of eliciting emotions, and she seemed able to communicate her desires <b>without</b> <b>talking.</b>|$|E

The film stars Ananda Everingham, has an {{appearance}} by American bilingual actor Erich Fleshman, and was shot by Christopher Doyle. The short film is shot in a minimalist style and slowly moves along the encounters {{of a man and a}} woman on a long-haul flight, where they spend the next 12 hours and 20 minutes reading, drinking, eating and watching movies and sleeping by each other's side <b>without</b> <b>talking.</b>|$|E

As the only prisoner, Barešić stated at 02:12 that he was interested in letting the transaction take place <b>without</b> <b>talking</b> to the hijackers. Others talked to the hijackers, but they did not agree to the transfer. Barešić thereafter convinced all but one of them to accept the deal. Planning the practical aspects of the transaction was forcing the issue past the deadline. This was finalised at 03:02 when it was decided that the dissident would not be exchanged. Under command of Superintendent Lewijn, 30 passengers would be released after which two prisoners would be sent by police escort to the aircraft and let on board. This would be done three times until all passengers were safe and all willing prisoners aboard, with the cabin crew being let off in the last wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} a new racino at Aqueduct Racetrack led to a {{proposal}} from Governor Andrew Cuomo to build a massive convention center in the vicinity. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented “The commute for people here {{is only going to}} go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center <b>without</b> <b>talking</b> about transportation.” Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park named Queensway, but said people who live in Rockaway, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and other areas along the right-of-way have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates the racino and has been asked to construct the convention center, was evaluating several plans to increase transportation access, and was committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Queensway advocates are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area.|$|E

500|$|The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{abandoned}} the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1962, {{and ever since}} it has been sought after for reactivation for train service. The line hasn't been reactivated due to local opposition, specifically the homeowners who live along the right-of-way. One group wants the line's reactivation for transit service. A second group would use the right-of-way as a linear park, known as the Queensway, a proposal inspired {{by the success of}} the High Line in Manhattan. The final group involving homeowners would have nothing done, keeping the line as is. Most plans call for the line to be used for subway service, with the line being connected to the south with the IND Rockaway Line. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented [...] "The commute for people here is only going to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center <b>without</b> <b>talking</b> about transportation."

Genting is committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Advocates of the Queensway, a proposed public park along the branch's route, are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area. Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013. Both representatives will push to allocate federal transportation subsidies to study a plan for restored passenger service.|$|E

2500|$|Jazani {{would explain}} that a revolutionary status {{does not exist}} in the country and in {{addition}} to that a revolution does not result from armed struggle rather it comes about as a development of a political, social, economical, and ideological process. A military uprising should be staged at the time of- and not before the revolution, as it does not cause a revolution by itself. In his opinion, those who are for a military uprising are similar to the Shah who is blocking a peaceful means of struggle. Because of this <b>without</b> <b>talking</b> about Ahmadzadeh, Jazani writes [...] "When we hear that revolution begins with a military uprising, we {{have to say that the}} believers of this train of thought do not know two things: one the current situation of military uprising and second revolution in general and the revolution we want is a specific one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chief Executive CY Leung {{said that}} protesters need to {{carefully}} consider {{what sort of}} democracy they are pursuing. He welcomed {{the end of the}} occupation, saying: [...] "Other than economic losses, I believe the greatest loss Hong Kong society has suffered is the damage {{to the rule of law}} by a small group of people... If we just talk about democracy <b>without</b> <b>talking</b> about the rule of law, it's not real democracy but a state of no government". Leung saw his popularity ratings slump to a new low following the occupation protests, down to 39.7 percent, with a net of minus 37%. This was attributed to public perception of Leung's unwillingness to heal the wounds, and his unwarranted shifting of the blame for the wrongs in society onto opponents. Leung also claimed negative effects on the economy without providing evidence, and his assertions were contradicted by official figures. On, 19 December 2014, the eve of the 15th anniversary of Macau's handover, authorities in Macau banned journalists covering the arrival of Chinese president Xi Jinping from holding umbrellas in the rain.|$|E
2500|$|Dixon {{had worked}} with Brian Higgins, of Xenomania, on her {{previous}} single, [...] "Knockdown", but it failed to enter the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, resulting in Dixon being dropped by her record label, Polydor Records. In early 2007, still with no recording contract, Dixon {{received a phone call}} from Higgins, who asked if she would like to continue working together. Dixon stated, [...] "The plan was to make the whole record with Brian <b>without</b> <b>talking</b> to any record labels, we were just going to wait until we had made something special and then approach people with a finished album." [...] However Dixon's profile was raised when she signed up to compete in Strictly Come Dancing, which she eventually won. Soon afterwards, Dixon signed a deal with Asylum Records. [...] "The Boy Does Nothing", by this time already written, was originally intended to be a jazz orientated track, but Dixon and Higgins decided to change the genre, incorporating mambo influences, due to her experience on Strictly Come Dancing. Dixon described the song as [...] "a very tongue-in-cheek record" [...] and Higgins likened the song to [...] "bottled happiness".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then {{president}} of the Council, announced that the Council would take a stricter view of language of a non-prescriptive character introduced in laws, sometimes known as [...] "legislative neutrons".Jean-Pierre Chevènement] presents us a bill of which I'll say, <b>without</b> <b>talking</b> in latin for once, but instead borrowing my words from the physicists, that it is mostly an assembly of legislative neutrons, I mean of texts with a null juridical charge." [...] Instead of prescribing or prohibiting, as advocated by Portalis, such language makes statements {{about the state of}} the world, or wishes about what it should be. Previously, this language was considered devoid of juridical effects and thus harmless; but Mazeaud contended that introducing vague language devoid of juridical consequences just dilutes law unnecessarily. He denounced the use of law as an instrument of political communication, expressing vague wishes instead for effective legislation. Mazeaud also said that, because of the constitutional objective that law should be accessible and understandable, law should be precise and clear, and devoid of details or equivocal formulas. The practice of putting into laws remarks or wishes with no clear legal consequences has been a long-standing concern of French jurists.|$|E
