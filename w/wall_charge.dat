Ions attached to a charged surface attract a cloud of mobile counterions. Fixed and mobile ions form a double layer. For small channels, surface conductivity is responsible for most of the charge transport. For small channels, surface conductivity exceeds volume conductivity. Negative surface charges can be occupied by firmly bound protons. At low pH (high proton concentration), the <b>wall</b> <b>charge</b> is completely neutralized. Surface conductivity vanishes.

This results {{in the development of}} a wall surface potential which will attract counterions {{from the surrounding}} solution and repel co-ions. In equilibrium, the surface charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions in solution. The region near the surface of enhancedcounterion concentration is called the electrical double layer (EDL). The EDL can be approximated by a sub-division into two regions. Ions in the region closest to the charged wall surface are strongly bound to the surface. This immobile layer is called the Stern or Helmholtz layer. The region adjacent to the Stern layer is called the diffuse layer and contains loosely associated ions that are comparatively mobile. The total electrical double layer due to the formation of the counterion layers results in electrostatic screening of the <b>wall</b> <b>charge</b> and minimizes the Gibbs free energy of EDL formation.|$|E

50|$|Electroosmotic flow is {{observed}} when an electric field {{is applied to}} a solution in a capillary that has fixed charges on its interior <b>wall.</b> <b>Charge</b> is accumulated on the inner surface of a capillary when a buffer solution is placed inside the capillary. In a fused-silica capillary, silanol (Si-OH) groups attached to the interior wall of the capillary are ionized to negatively charged silanoate (Si-O−) groups at pH values greater than three. The ionization of the capillary wall can be enhanced by first running a basic solution, such as NaOH or KOH through the capillary prior to introducing the buffer solution. Attracted to the negatively charged silanoate groups, the positively charged cations of the buffer solution will form two inner layers of cations (called the diffuse double layer or the electrical double layer) on the capillary wall {{as shown in figure}} 4. The first layer {{is referred to as the}} fixed layer because it is held tightly to the silanoate groups. The outer layer, called the mobile layer, is farther from the silanoate groups. The mobile cation layer is pulled in the direction of the negatively charged cathode when an electric field is applied. Since these cations are solvated, the bulk buffer solution migrates with the mobile layer, causing the electroosmotic flow of the buffer solution. Other capillaries including Teflon capillaries also exhibit electroosmotic flow. The EOF of these capillaries is probably the result of adsorption of the electrically charged ions of the buffer onto the capillary walls. The rate of EOF is dependent on the field strength and the charge density of the capillary wall. The wall's charge density is proportional to the pH of the buffer solution. The electroosmotic flow will increase with pH until all of the available silanols lining the wall of the capillary are fully ionized.|$|E

The conductivity of isolated walls was found to be about 0. 40 mho/m. If counterions associated with fixed, ionized groups in the wall have average mobilities equal to that of sodium ions in free solution, the fixed charge concentration required to account for the measured conductivity is between 75 and 95 meq/liter of wet wall volume. Estimates of the numbers of titratable amino and carboxyl groups in wall polymers indicate that conductivity is more closely related to net <b>wall</b> <b>charge</b> than to total <b>wall</b> <b>charge.</b> The measured wall conductivity was used to predict a value of 0. 15 ± 0. 03 mho/m for whole cell conductivity.

40|$|A space-charge {{model for}} {{electrolyte}} transport in charged capillary pores was examined experimentally with aqueous solutions of alkali chlorides and MgC 12 in track-etched mica membranes. The model combines the Gouy-Chapman {{view of the}} double layer with the Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes transport equations. The pores of experimental membranes were uniform capillaries with a well-characterized cross section. The pore sizes ranged from {{an order of magnitude}} smaller to an order of magnitude larger than the Debye screening lengths of solutions. Three independent quantities were mea-sured: streaming potential, for which an applied pressure across the membrane is the driving force for transport; pore con-ductivity, for which an applied electrical potential isthe driving force; and concentration potential, for which an electrolyte concentration difference is the driving force. Data follow the trends of model predictions but indicate that chloride ions affect he pore <b>wall</b> <b>charge.</b> For monovalent cations, the pore <b>wall</b> <b>charge</b> deduced from pore conductivity measurements yielded theoretical predictions for the streaming potential and for the concentration potential that gree quite well with the data.

30|$|Time-periodic electro-osmotic flow is {{also known}} as AC electro-osmosis, and it is driven by an {{alternating}} electric field. It is very important for biotechnology and separation science. Recently, various studies analyzed the time-periodic electro-osmotic flow theory and modeling in different geometry. Dutta and Beskok [5] were among the early researchers who analytically investigated the time-periodic electro-osmotic flow between two parallel plates, illustrating interesting similarities or dissimilarities with the Stokes second problem. Based on the method proposed by Dutta and Beskok, many researchers studied time-periodic electro-osmotic flows through microchannels, and some new results are given.

It is found that total EEVDFs influence the sheath solution and the threshold of total electron emission coefficient (EEC) for classic sheath dramatically, and can cause no solution for critical space-charge limited (SCL) sheath.
