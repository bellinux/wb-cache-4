50|$|The {{agricultural}} surplus JF created {{is needed for}} consumption by the same workers who left for the industrial sector. Hence, agriculture successfully provides not only the manpower for production activities elsewhere, but also the <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> required for the process.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with more}} direct {{responsibility}} for the <b>wage</b> <b>fund,</b> enterprises also gained the power to fire workers. In fact, the reform gave new incentive for layoffs, which in some cases could increase profitability. (When these occurred, the workers {{did not have a}} 'social safety net' in place in the form of unemployment insurance and career assistance).|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the various forms of the classical <b>wages</b> <b>fund,</b> and especially the claim that J. S. Mill reversed his position on the nature of the <b>wages</b> <b>fund.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Textual research from original publications of Adam Smith, David Ricardo and J. S. Mill, as well as references to current interpretations of their work are used in this paper. Findings – Although J. S. Mill was a supporter of the classical <b>wages</b> <b>fund</b> model, he did not consistently embrace its assumption of a fixed fund. His comment in his Principles that the “discretion of the capitalist” influences the size of the fund contradicts this assumption. Without consistent support for this component of the doctrine, the “recantation” loses its historical significance, in that it is simply a reaffirmation of the views which Mill held throughout. Research limitations/implications – It is hoped this paper can close the book on the debate on Mill's supposed recantation. There was no recantation because Mill held no firm position to recant. Originality/value – It is understood that no one has made the connection between Mill's recantation and his other inconsistencies regarding aspects of the <b>wages</b> <b>fund.</b> Capital, Division of labour, Economic doctrines, Economic theory, Pay...|$|R
50|$|Adam Smith notes this in The Wealth of Nations and it figures {{into the}} {{question}} of general equilibrium and the general glut controversy. In the general equilibrium model savings must equal investment for the economy to clear. The economy grows as division of labor increases productivity of laborers. This increased productivity in laborers creates a surplus that will be split between capitalists’ expenditure on goods for themselves and investment in other capital. The accumulation of saving and parsimony of capitalists leads to greater increases in capital {{which leads to a}} more productive state. Smith advocates this parsimony of profit as a virtue. Smith provides the example of the colonial United States for the positive relationship between the <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> and investment in capital. He says that England is a much more wealthy economy than anywhere in America, however, he believes that the true wealth lies within the market for wage funds and the growth rate of the population. The colonies have a much higher wage rate than England due to a lower cost of provisions and necessities to survive, which result in a higher competition for human capital among the “masters” of the economy, which in turn raises the wage rate and increases the <b>wage</b> <b>fund.</b> The core of this phenomenon, is why Adam Smith believes in the savings investment identity. The reason why wages go up and there is competition between employers {{is the result of a}} constant influx of capital that is equal or greater to the rate in which the amount of labor increases.|$|E
50|$|Agricultural surplus plays a {{major role}} as a <b>wage</b> <b>fund.</b> Its {{importance}} can be better explained {{with the help of the}} graph on the right, which is an integration of the industrial sector graph with an inverted agricultural sector graph, such that the origin of the agricultural sector falls on the upper-right corner. This inversion of the origin changes the way the graph is now perceived. While the labor force values are read from the left of 0, the output values are read vertically downwards from O. The sole reason for this inversion is for the sake of convenience. The point of commercialization as explained before (See Section on Basics of the model) is observed at point R, where the tangent to the line ORX runs parallel to OX.|$|E
5000|$|Foley also {{discusses}} the chapter On Machinery, which Ricardo included {{in his third}} and final (1821) version of Principles. Here Ricardo famously analysed {{the impact of the}} adoption of machinery on the different classes of society, revising his earlier view that mechanization could be expected to be of benefit to each of the classes of the society. The increase in productivity due to mechanization lowers the production costs and thus also the real prices of commodities. Whereas the landowning class and capitalists benefit from the lower prices, workers in contrast do not reap such benefit from the lower prices if capitalists reduce the <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> in order to finance the expensive machinery, causing technological unemployment among workers. In this case, Ricardo points out, wages are forced down by competition among workers, and the introduction of new machines can lead to an over-all decline in the well-being of the working class.|$|E

5000|$|According to Mill, {{supply is}} very elastic in {{response}} to wages. Wages generally exceed the minimum subsistence level, and are paid out of capital. Hence, wages are limited by existing capital for paying wages. Thus, wage per worker can be derived by dividing the total circulating capital {{by the size of}} the working population. Wages can increase by an increase in the capital used in paying wages, or by decrease in the number of workers. If wages rise, supply of labour will rise. Competition among workers not only brings down wages, but also keeps some workers out of employment. This is based on Mill's notion that [...] "demand for commodities is not demand for labourers". It means that income invested as advances of wages to labour creates employment, and not income spent on consumer goods. An increase in consumption causes a decline in investment. So increased investment leads to increases in the <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> and to economic progress.|$|E
40|$|This Paper {{addresses}} the intriguing {{issue of whether}} William Thomas Thornton plagiarized Francis Longe's (1866) pamphlet denouncing the classical <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> doctrine. In doing so, the paper comprehensively reviews all of the corroborative evidence surrounding the plagiarism allegation laid against Thornton, drawing particular attention to a little known letter to The Times written by Thornton, {{in an effort to}} clear his good name of any impropriety. It is the conclusion of this paper that Thornton has no case to answer; the evidence not only from Thornton's own early work on wages and trade unions, together with additional corroborative evidence suggests that far from having plagiarized Longe's (1866) work, Thornton apticipated many of his ideas.

The alternative model has the following characteristics: (1) as against related neo-Ricardian work, it is fully causal and capable of tracing the economy's traverse from arbitrary initial conditions to a growth steady state (with land-augmenting technical progress); and (2) the simultaneous presence of a <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> and of land makes possible the incorporation of expectations formation and perfect-foresight equilibrium.

40|$|The {{essence of}} {{controlling}} the <b>wages</b> <b>fund</b> — i. e. an institution existing for more than 30 years in Poland — consists in examination and interference into relations between streams {{of goods and services}} and of money wages. This form imposes an obligation on particular economic subjects — especially enterprises — to keep quantitative relations fixed individually between production (services) size and the <b>wages</b> <b>fund.</b> Formulas expressing the relations have undergone, however, to evolution and frequent changes. The article presents analytically principles accepted within that scope in Poland until the end of 1978. The institution {{of controlling the}} <b>wages</b> <b>fund</b> — as an instrument of central steering economic processes under real conditions of existing economy — makes use of parameters, which are fixed beyond an enterprise but addressed to it. The parameters are of quantitative expression. It causes a lot of problems connected with their contents, calculation, period of functioning as well as an organizational level of economic administration they are addressed to. Remarks presented in the article concern quantitative consistency of disposals expressed by the parameters. They are then connected with the way of settlement, {{as well as with the}} period of parameters functioning and rections of receivers.

50|$|Cairnes' defence of the <b>wages</b> <b>fund</b> doctrine: This doctrine, expounded by Mill in his Principles, {{had been}} relinquished by him, but Cairnes still {{undertook}} to defend it. He certainly succeeded in removing from the theory much that bad tended to obscure its real meaning and in {{placing it in}} its very best aspect. He also showed the sense in which, when treating the problem of wages, we must refer to some fund devoted to the payment of wages, and pointed out {{the conditions under which}} the <b>wages</b> <b>fund</b> may increase or decrease. It may be added that his Leading Principles contain admirable discussions on trade unions and protection, together with a clear analysis of the difficult theory of international trade and value, in which there is much that is both novel and valuable.

40|$|William T. Thornton's {{contribution}} to developments in {{late nineteenth century}} political economy is generally associated with his criticism of John Stuart Mill's 'supply and demand' theory of value and his attack on Henry Fawcett's version of the <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> doctrine. In a Fortnightly Review article (published in May and June 1869) on Thornton's book, On Labour, Mill publicly deferred to Thornton's criticism of the <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> doctrine but did not accept his criticism {{of the theory of}} value. There is another aspect of Mill's review article, however, which historians of economic thought seem to have overlooked: his enthusiastic discussion of Thornton's treatment of trade union efficacy and industrial co-partnership. The question explored in this paper is whether Thornton's work on labour relations, trade union efficacy and cooperativism helped shape Mill's own thinking on these subjects during the 1860 s. We begin by documenting Thornton's views on trade unionism and then examine Mill's evolving sympathy toward trade unions-an important feature of his social reform program. It is sometimes claimed that nineteenth century economists tended to ignore the role played by trade unions in industrial society. This paper points out that Mill and Thornton, two leading economists {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century, did not oppose trade unions and were favourably impressed with the advantages for society of labour combinations. Nonetheless, they looked forward to the gradual supplanting of the system of collective bargaining by 'higher' cooperation. ...|$|E

The analysis of this literature is derived from a 1942 article by Hans P.

Arguments classified under one of the Say's Law, neoclassical, or <b>wage</b> <b>fund</b> schools are examined using the Neisser framework. As a secondary aspect, some elaboration is undertaken of the process by which uncompensated technological unemployment could arise.

Therefore, the thesis presupposes an increase of Public Administration, as far as number of its employees as well as their wages and other costs are concerned.
