Among them, it is easy to perceive that areas of Computing and Telecommunications have had an impact of paramount importance to society as a whole. These technologies have allowed an increasing integration of research fields, people of various backgrounds and abilities as well as made the interaction of different cultures possible. As a result, we have been living in the Internet era with {{a very large number of}} Web sites which can be visited, queried and played with. That constitutes what we call social computing. Application examples are: digital libraries, health care information systems, Physics collaboratories, and <b>Web-based</b> <b>entertainments</b> like interactive Web games. Within this context, we are concerned with the user interface design requirements gathering for such systems. In that sense, we present a prot [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Presence is a {{theoretical}} concept describing {{the extent to}} which media represent the world (in both physical and social environments). [...] Presence is further described by Matthew Lombard and Theresa Ditton as “an illusion that a mediated experience is not mediated." [...] Today, it often considers the effect that people experience when they interact with a computer-mediated or computer-generated environment. The conceptualization of presence borrows from multiple fields including communication, computer science, psychology, science, engineering, philosophy, and the arts. The concept of presence accounts for a variety of computer applications and <b>Web-based</b> <b>entertainment</b> today that are developed on the fundamentals of the phenomenon, in order to give people the sense of, as Sheridan called it, “being there." ...|$|E
40|$|Investigations {{into law}} {{and popular culture}} preoccupy {{themselves}} with understanding how law and popular cultural forms work together to challenge or sustain community structures, identity and power. It is inevitable {{at this point in}} our cultural history that law and popular culture are intertwined. There are too many television shows, films, popular novels and <b>web-based</b> <b>entertainment</b> to withdraw 2 ̆ 2 the law 2 ̆ 2 (whatever that is) from the domain of popular culture. This article takes as a given the intermixing of law and popular culture, embracing it as a new feature of our popular legal consciousness. I suggest that one result of this mixing [...] what I call truth tales, which are fictionalized films that are nonetheless based on true stories about law [...] is to enhance our critical capacity to engage the law as a hopeful and evolving web of social, civic and political codes that shape our expectations for justice in contemporary society. This article proceeds in five parts. Part I outlines a brief history of interdisciplinary legal studies, in particular law and cultural studies. Part II discusses the subfield within law and cultural studies of law and film, as a way to {{set the stage for a}} longer discussion in Parts IV and V of two truth tales, 2 ̆ 2 Compulsion 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Swoon. 2 ̆ 2 Part III more specifically describes the parameters of the 2 ̆ 2 truth tale 2 ̆ 2 as a subgenre of courtroom drama that affects a particular kind of popular legal consciousness, one that accepts as futile law 2 ̆ 7 s presumed search for unconditional truth and embraces instead the legal system 2 ̆ 7 s promise of due process as based on normative values of fairness. Parts IV and V are close readings of the two films by way of application of the interpretive methodology and conceptual framework outlined in Parts II and III...|$|E
40|$|Content Addressable Storage (CAS) is a data {{representation}} technique that operates by partitioning a given data-set into non-intersecting units called chunks and then employing techniques to efficiently recognize chunks occurring multiple times. This allows CAS to eliminate duplicate instances of such chunks, resulting in reduced storage space compared to conventional representations of data. CAS {{is an attractive}} technique for reducing the storage and network bandwidth needs of performance-sensitive, data-intensive applications {{in a variety of}} domains. These include enterprise applications, <b>Web-based</b> e-commerce or <b>entertainment</b> services and highly parallel scientific/engineering applications and simulations, to name a few. In this paper, we conduct an empirical evaluation of the benefits offered by CAS to a variety of real-world data-intensive applications. The savings offered by CAS depend crucially on (i) the nature of the data-set itself and (ii) the chunk-size that CAS employs. We investigate the impact of both these factors on disk space savings, savings in network bandwidth, and error resilience of data. We find that a chunk-size of 1 KB can provide up to 84 % savings in disk space and even higher savings in network bandwidth whilst trading off error resilience and incurring 14 % CAS related overheads. Drawing upon lessons learned from our study, we provide insights on (i) the choice of the chunk-size for effective space savings and (ii) the use of selective data replication to counter the loss of error resilience caused by CAS...|$|R
