500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E

2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E
