Despite appeals by Dr. Saqqaf's heirs to re-open an investigation into the accident due to indicators that {{it may have been a}} carefully coordinated assassination, the authorities in 1999 refused to do so, resulting in a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> the trial <b>proceedings</b> against the car driver. Saqqaf's elder son Walid and younger daughter Nadia, who currently runs the Yemen Times, have mentioned on more than one occasion that they believe the accident was orchestrated due to their father's frequent critical writings against the former president of Yemen Ali Abdullah Saleh.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) affects 0. 5 - 1 % {{of population}} {{all over the}} world. As the duration of treatment is more in RA, patient′s adherence to treatment is less. Controlling {{the number of patients}} lost to follow-up is essential for the successful completion of randomized clinical trials. Also, patient adherence is critical in clinical trial setting as it has impact on validity of clinical data and also it remains an issue of utmost importance to pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as scientific and regulatory community. The studies which show reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trials are done for diseases like tuberculosis (TB). None of the study is available to find reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trials in RA. Hence, this study is planned. Aims and Objectives: Find reasons and effect of age, sex, duration of therapy, and distance <b>from</b> home on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trial. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective observational data analysis. Primary outcome are to find reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> trial. Results: <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trial in patients of RA is more in female. In this study, reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> study are change in location, loss to follow-up, failure of therapy, concomitant illness, patient withdrew consent, and adverse effects is the common reason for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> clinical trial in both patient and investigator-related reason for withdrawal...|$|R
