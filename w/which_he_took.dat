40|$|In {{his book}} Metaepistemology and Skepticism, Richard Fumerton formulates a "principle of {{inferential}} justification" <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> {{to be fundamental}} to our practice of reflection on the epistemic status of our beliefs and <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> to provide the basis of some powerful skeptical arguments. After introducing Fumerton's principle and the role it is given in skeptical arguments, the paper argues {{that it does not}} have the force that he claims...|$|R

The lack of reward for his work pushed him into depression, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> many months to recover from. He was eventually made a Privy Counsellor in the 1947 Birthday Honours list, but he saw this as poor reward for the work he had put in at Nuremberg.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from some}} western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first {{professional}} performance of Hamlet in Japan was Otojirō Kawakami's 1903 Shimpa ("new school theatre") adaptation. Tsubouchi Shōyō translated Hamlet {{and produced a}} performance in 1911 that blended Shingeki ("new drama") and Kabuki styles. This hybrid-genre reached its peak in Tsuneari Fukuda's 1955 Hamlet. In 1998, Yukio Ninagawa produced an acclaimed version of Hamlet {{in the style of}} Nō theatre, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> to London.|$|E
5|$|Buendía was {{recognized}} largely for his investigative reporting, and particularly for his {{coverage of the}} CIA's covert operations in Mexico, the rise of ultra-rightwing groups, fraudulent businessmen, corruption in Mexico's state-owned petroleum company Pemex, {{and the role of}} organized crime in Mexico's political system. He was also famous for breaking news on controversial political subjects thanks to his access to top Mexican officials.

5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E

Ross was offered a head coach position after the 1991 season for the San Diego Chargers, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took.</b> After first considering Ross assistant coaches, Ralph Friedgen and George O'Leary, Tech hired Bill Lewis away from East Carolina soon after Ross' departure.|$|E
5|$|Upon Fleming's {{demobilisation}} in May 1945, {{he became}} the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, {{which at the time}} owned The Sunday Times. In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take three months holiday every winter, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> in Jamaica. Fleming worked full-time for the paper until December 1959, but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961.|$|E

5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only {{if they could be}} constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
5|$|England {{played two}} spinners; left arm {{orthodox}} spinner Jack Young replaced fellow finger spinner Jim Laker, while the leg spin of Eric Hollies replaced the pace bowling of Dick Pollard. Hollies {{was brought into}} the team because he had caused the Australian batsmen difficulty in the tour match against Warwickshire. He took 8/107 in the first innings, the best innings figures against the Australians for the summer. His performance included bowling Bradman with a topspinner that went between bat and pad. It {{was part of a}} month-long run in <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> 52 wickets in seven matches, including two ten-wicket match hauls. Young had taken 12 and 14 wickets in consecutive matches against Northamptonshire and Surrey since his omission following the Third Test, while Pollard and Laker had managed totals of only 2/159 and 3/206 respectively in the Headingley Test.|$|E
5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able to pass along further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, <b>which</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
