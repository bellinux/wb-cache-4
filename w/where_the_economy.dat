40|$|The {{relationship}} between organizational culture and organizational effectiveness {{has been the}} subject of much research by Daniel Denison. Much of this research has been conducted in developed countries <b>where</b> <b>the</b> environment is highly competitive, highly productive and <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> are stable. There has been the challenge however to determine if the findings of such research are relatively universally consistent. In this case the challenge is to determine if the findings hold in circumstances <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> are less developed and more fragile than those previously studied. This research study is designed to examine the {{relationship between}} organizational culture and organizational effectiveness in circumstances typical of the English speaking Caribbean <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>economies</b> are weak and in some respects informal and to use these findings to compare with earlier findings from developed <b>economies.</b> <b>The</b> research study involves the administration of the Denison Organizational Culture Survey which was also used in the earlier studies, to persons engaged in the electronic media sector in the English-speaking Caribbean. This sector has the characteristic of competitiveness which is typical of other industries studied. The evidence points to a strong correlation between organizational effectiveness and all four of the Denison culture traits. The adaptability and the mission traits were identified as the more dominant and the organizations reflected an external focus. The results of the study indicate that notwithstanding the economic foundational differences, the findings hold true of a positive relationship between organizational culture and organizational effectiveness similar in extent to and in some cases stronger than earlier studies and as such provided support for the previous research findings...|$|R
