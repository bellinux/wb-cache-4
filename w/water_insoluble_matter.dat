In all samples, physicochemical parameters like moisture, reducing sugar, sucrose, ash, free acidity and <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> <b>matter</b> were also measured according to harmonized methods of the International Honey Commission (IHC). The results of physicochemical analysis showed that all the values, except for moisture of a small number of high altitude honey samples, are in good agreement with the current Nepalese standard. The total phenolic contents of honey, collected from high and low altitude, ranged from 154. 87 to 41. 90 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE/ 100 g) respectively, at corresponding antiradical activity using DPPH• expressed as percent inhibition of 76. 66 % and 25. 69 %.

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of marine aerosols {{as a function}} of their size is an important parameter for the evaluation of their impact on the global climate system. In this work we model fine particle organic matter emitted by sea spray processes and its influence on the aerosol chemical properties at the global scale using the off-line global Chemistry-Transport Model TM 5. TM 5 is coupled to a microphysical aerosol dynamics model providing size resolved information on particle masses and numbers. The mass of the emitted sea spray particles is partitioned between <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WIOM) and sea salt components in the accumulation mode using a function that relates the emitted organic fraction to the surface ocean chlorophyll-a concentrations. The global emission in the sub-micron size range of organic matter by sea spray process is 8. 2 Tg yr- 1, compared to 24 Tg fine yr- 1 sea-salt emissions. When the marine sources are included, the concentrations of modelled primary particulate organic matter (POM) increase mainly over the oceans. The model predictions of WIOM and sea salt are evaluated against measurements carried out at Mace Head (Northern Hemisphere) and Amsterdam Island (Southern Hemisphere), showing that in clean marine conditions WIOM marine emissions contribute significantly to POM values.

The concentrations of PM 2. 5 at the four sites were significantly higher than the Grade I national standard of 35 μg/m 3, indicating serious PM 2. 5 pollution in rural and suburban areas. The contributions of secondary WSIIs to total WSIIs at the four sites were lower than in urban areas. The TEs in XP and LC were significantly enriched in PM 2. 5. A significant difference was found in the main chemical compositions of different sites. Fireworks displays directly increased the concentrations of PM 2. 5 and many chemicals, especially K+, Cl−, K, Cl, S, Cu and Sr, and concentrations of NO 3 − and NH 4 + ions peaked after the fireworks period in the three rural sites, indicating the influence of firecrackers on the secondary formation of the precursors of NO 2.

40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{presented}} in the literature to predict an organic chemical's equilibrium partitioning between the <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WIOM) component of aerosol and the gas phase, K i,WIOM, {{as a function of}} temperature. They include (i) polyparameter linear free energy relationships calibrated with empirical aerosol sorption data, as well as (ii) the solvation models implemented in SPARC and (iii) the quantum-chemical software COSMOtherm, which predict solvation equilibria from molecular structure alone. We demonstrate that these methods can be used to predict K i,WIOM for large numbers of individual molecules implicated in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, including those with multiple functional groups. Although very different in their theoretical foundations, these methods give remarkably consistent results for the products of the reaction of normal alkanes with OH, i. e. their partition coefficients K i,WIOM generally agree within one order of magnitude over a range of more than ten orders of magnitude. This level of agreement is much better than that achieved by different vapour pressure estimation methods that are more commonly used in the SOA community. Also, in contrast to the agreement between vapour pressure estimates, the agreement between the K i,WIOM estimates does not deteriorate with increasing number of functional groups. Furthermore, these partitioning coefficients K i,WIOM predicted SOA mass yields in agreement with those measured in chamber experiments of the oxidation of normal alkanes. If a K i,WIOM prediction method was based on one or more surrogate molecules representing the solvation properties of the mixed OM phase of SOA, the choice of those molecule(s) was found to have a relatively minor effect on the predicted K i,WIOM, as long as the molecule(s) are not very polar. This suggests that a single surrogate molecule, such as 1 -octanol or a hypothetical SOA structure proposed by Kalberer et al. (2004), may often be sufficient to represent the WIOM component of the SOA phase, greatly simplifying the prediction. The presented methods could substitute for vapour-pressure-based methods in studies such as the explicit modelling of SOA formation from single precursor molecules in chamber experiments...|$|R

Emissions of marine primary organic aerosols (POA), phytoplankton-produced isoprene- and monoterpenes-derived secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and methane sulfonate (MS&minus;) are shown to affect surface concentrations of organic aerosols in remote marine regions. Global emissions of submicron marine POA {{is estimated to be}} 7. 9 and 9. 4 Tg yr− 1 , for the Gantt et al. (2011) and Vignati et al. (2010) emission parameterizations, respectively. Marine sources of SOA and particulate MS&minus; (containing both sulfur and carbon atoms) contribute an additional 0. 2 and 5. 1 Tg yr− 1 , respectively. Widespread areas over productive waters of the Northern Atlantic, Northern Pacific, and the Southern Ocean show marine-source submicron organic aerosol surface concentrations of 100 ng m− 3 , with values up to 400 ng m− 3 over biologically productive areas. Comparison of long-term surface observations of <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> organic <b>matter</b> (WIOM) with POA concentrations from the two emission parameterizations shows that despite revealed discrepancies (often more than a factor of 2), both Gantt et al. (2011) and Vignati et al. (2010) formulations are able to capture the magnitude of marine organic aerosol concentrations, with the Gantt et al. (2011) parameterization attaining better seasonality. Model simulations show that the mixing state of the marine POA can impact the surface number concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The largest increases (up to 20 %) in CCN (at a supersaturation (S) of 0. 2 %) number concentration are obtained over biologically productive ocean waters when marine organic aerosol is assumed to be externally mixed with sea-salt. Assuming marine organics are internally-mixed with sea-salt provides diverse results with increases and decreases in the concentration of CCN over different parts of the ocean. The sign of the CCN change due to the addition of marine organics to sea-salt aerosol is determined by the relative significance of the increase in mean modal diameter due to addition of mass, and the decrease in particle hygroscopicity due to compositional changes in marine aerosol. Based on emerging evidence for increased CCN concentration over biologically active surface ocean areas/periods, our study suggests that treatment of sea spray in global climate models (GCMs) as an internal mixture of marine organic aerosols and sea-salt will likely lead to an underestimation in CCN number concentration...|$|R

Production of nanoparticles using SAS was investigated using 2 types of model solutes: Fume silica and acetaminophen which represent a model of <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> (inorganic) material and water soluble material respectively. The morphology and characteristics of nanoparticles produced were assessed. Results: The fume silica had been coated and 50 nm diameter of nanoencapsulated acetaminophen had been produced. Conclusion: The results had revealed that both <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> and soluble substrates can be coated and encapsulated successfully in polymer by the SAS coating proces...|$|R
