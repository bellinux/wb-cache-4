25|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 December 2009, during the December 2009 European snowfall, five London-bound Eurostar trains failed inside the tunnel, {{trapping}} 2,000 passengers for approximately 16 hours, during the coldest temperatures in eight years. A Eurotunnel spokesperson explained that snow had evaded the train's <b>winterisation</b> shields, and the transition from cold air outside to the tunnel's warm atmosphere had melted the snow, resulting in electrical failures. One train was turned back before reaching the tunnel; two trains were hauled {{out of the tunnel}} by Eurotunnel Class 0001 diesel locomotives. The blocking of the tunnel led to the implementation of Operation Stack, the transformation of the M20 motorway into a linear car park.|$|E
500|$|While Christmas Island was {{the main}} base, the area around Malden Island [...] to the south {{was to be the}} site for the bomber-dropped tests, and Penrhyn Island, [...] farther south was used as a {{technical}} monitoring site and as a weather station. A USAF special weapons monitoring team was based here, and the airstrip was improved to allow its supporting Douglas C-124 Globemaster II to use it. The Task Force received generous support from the United States Army, Navy and USAF. RAF aircraft were allowed to overfly the United States, even when carrying radioactive or explosive materials, thereby obviating the need for <b>winterisation</b> for the more northerly journey over Canada. RAF ground crews were accommodated at Hickham and Travis Air Force Base in California, and a regular aerial courier service operated from Hickham to Christmas Island. Warrior had repairs made at Pearl Harbor, and the US Army base at Fort DeRussy gave Woollett use of its facilities.|$|E
5000|$|Replacement of [...] with an ice {{strengthened}} Tanker {{to support}} New Zealand's contribution to research in Antarctic. On 18 July 2016 the Minister of Defence announced that Hyundai Heavy Industries of South Korea had been awarded {{a contract for}} NZ$493,000,000 {{for the purchase of}} a new 23,000t tanker. The new tanker will be ice strengthened with <b>winterisation</b> features. The ship will be named , and is due for delivery in 2020.|$|E
50|$|After the <b>winterisation</b> was complete, the {{squadron}} turned to bridge repairs {{and the construction}} of a radar site at Pomos Point. Within this time the Squadron suffered other losses, Spr R.P.Melson (Bob) was wounded when his truck was ambushed near Petra, he died in hospital of bomb wounds on 24th Nov. 1955. Spr P.H.Percival was killed when a large boulder was rolled down an embankment into the path of his 2 Troop truck on 26th Nov.1955. 37 Field Squadron left Cyprus on the M.V.Devonshire on 26 February 1956, heading for the Invicta Lines, Maidstone.|$|E

5000|$|In 1954 the United Nations {{turned down}} an {{application}} by Greece for the self-determination of Cyprus, and widespread rioting ensued. By April 1955 the EOKA (the National Organisation of Cypriot Combatants) had begun a terror compaign on the island to rid it of British Rule. A state of Emergency was declared in June 1955 and more British troops were deployed to the island. By Autum 1955 {{it became apparent that}} the troops would still be there over the winter, and so 37 Field Squadron under the command of Major B.J. Coombe RE, were deployed to help with the <b>winterisation</b> of the temporary camps on 1 November, arriving on 11th. There were regular attacks made on the detachments of the squadron working in the Troodos Mountains, and on 15 December the OC was ambushed by four terrorists, and his driver, LCpl J.B. Morum was killed. Maj. Coombe managed to single-handedly take on the enemy with a sten machine carbine. When his ammunition was expended he returned from his firing position to the vehicle and retrieved his driver’s Sten, moved back to his firing position and continued his attack, when this ran out he drew his pistol and covered his opponents for 30 minutes. He killed one, wounded two and when the fourth attempted to escape he stopped him at 70 yards with his last three rounds. He was awarded the George Medal for his actions, where his citation said that he [...] "displayed courage and initiative of the very highest order".|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe idea of ‘sustainability’ is {{embedded}} in academia {{as well as in}} practice. It has the promise of doing something today, which will support tomorrow's generation. In practice it can be prescriptive, generalized and formulaic; which can hide the opportunity and superior value that can be achieved through “Sustainability by Design” (SbD) …. rather than sustainability by prescription. This paper looks at the particular context of post disaster reconstruction through 3 selected cases studies, namely i) The house design for Delmas 19 in Port au Prince following the Haiti Earthquake in 2010, ii) The provision of appropriate roofing assistance following the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in the Philippines, iii) The <b>winterisation</b> strategy of shelter (and non food items) following the 2014 Floods in Northern Afghanistan. The post disaster context by it's nature requires “doing something today” but how will that “support tomorrow's generation”? The case studies have been selected to underline the SbD approach in practice and how the link between these two was sought...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} {{and the development}} of shelters that are adapted to the specific conditions of a context where populations affected by disaster are in need is a growing concern in emergency response. To adress this challenge, IFRC-Shelter Research Unit, is studying and investigating new evaluation methods to better analyze the options available and facilitate the development of relevant modifications and upgrades. Using specific engineering software for thermal performance simulation of buildings is one of the ways forward to tackle this task. Once correctly calibrated such tools can provide objective results indicating the performance of a shelter model for any given context and weather exposure. To develop this research, the essential first step is to collect and to clearly identify the relevant specificities of the models to test, especially the real physical and technical aspects of cladding materials, structural elements and joints. The groundwork to set up the simulation is rather complex but once established, the potential of the application is immense. It will allow to analyze in detail the entirety of physical aspects, specific features and mechanisms of a given shelter solution and provide for example: - Simulations to compare the performance of different shelter models proposed by manufacturers. - A quick and easy way to explore alternative designs regarding climatic comfort and propose effective alternatives, for example upgrades for <b>winterisation</b> by introducing additional insulating layers for cold climates as well as heat reduction through the right shading layers to reduce the sun impact; - Clear evidence for to demonstrate suitability of shelter types for specific climatic conditions; - Improving energy efficiency of shelters, in order to reduce fuel/wood consumption and also to reduce fuel supply logistic and pressure on natural resources. As a first stage, a thermal simulation model of the IFRC/ICRC/UNHCR standard family tent is under development in collaboration with the Research Laboratory “Architecture et Climat” of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCL) in Belgium. This model will be calibrated and verified by measurements and tests on a tent in real conditions. Based on this model IFRC-SRU with the support of British Red Cross will start exploring <b>winterisation</b> solutions for cold climate scenarios. This tool will be a huge step forward for professional research and development of sustainable low-cost and energy efficient shelters...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the effects of the addition of by-products from the refining of vegetable oil on the behavior of co-digestion reactors treating a mixture of grass, cow dung and fruit and vegetable wastes. Three by-products were used: one soapstocks, one used <b>winterisation</b> earth and one skimming of aeroflotation of the effluents. Three 15 -L reactors were run in parallel and fed 5 times a week. In a first phase of 4 weeks, the three reactors were fed with the co-digestion substrates alone (grass, cow dung and fruit and vegetable wastes) at an OLR of 1. 5 g VS/kg. d. Then, one of the three by-products from the refining of oil was added to the feed of each reactor generating a 33 % increase in the OLR (2 gVS/kg. d). The results show that the addition of by-products from the refining of oil is an efficient way to increase the methane production of co-digestion reactors thanks to their high methane yield (0. 77 – 0. 80 l CH 4 /gVS). Indeed, in this work, it was possible to increase by 60 to 65 % the methane production of the reactors by a 33 % increase in the OLR thanks to the addition of the by-products...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as an additive for fossil derived diesel in compression ignition engines. It offers many advantages including: higher cetane number; reduced emissions of particulates, NOx, SOx, CO, and hydrocarbons; reduced toxicity; improved safety; and lower lifecycle CO 2 emissions. A characteristic of biodiesel limiting its application is its relatively poor low-temperature flow properties, which are primarily {{a consequence of}} the fatty acid make-up of the oil feedstock. Attempts to influence the fatty acid profile of either the oil feedstock or the biodiesel product include <b>winterisation</b> and fractionation which reduce the fraction of saturated fatty acids and result in large reductions in yield. A reduction in saturated fatty acids reduces ignition quality of the fuel, while an increase in unsaturation reduces oxidation stability. Additives designed for petroleum diesel have been used with limited success and specific additives for biodiesel remain in their infancy. The addition of branched moieties either to the alkyl head-group of the ester or as a side-chain to the tail-group can reduce the cloud point. Specifically, the removal of the double bonds on the ester group and the addition of a side-chain may provide a benefit in terms of low-temperature properties and offer improved oxidation stability. However, a negative impact on ignition quality and viscosity may result. Paul C. Smith, Yung Ngothai, Q. Dzuy Nguyen and Brian K. O'Neil...|$|E
