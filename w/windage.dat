5|$|To pack a muzzle-loading cannon, first {{gunpowder}} {{is poured}} down the bore. This {{is followed by}} a layer of wadding (often nothing more than paper), and then the cannonball itself. A certain amount of <b>windage</b> allows the ball to fit down the bore, though the greater the <b>windage</b> the less efficient the propulsion of the ball when the gunpowder is ignited. To fire the cannon, the fuse located in the vent is lit, quickly burning down to the gunpowder, which then explodes violently, propelling wadding and ball down the bore and out of the muzzle. A small portion of exploding gas also escapes through the vent, but this does not dramatically affect the total force exerted on the ball.|$|E
5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical viewing window. The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and <b>windage</b> by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E
5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach {{all the way to the}} bottom. An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant <b>windage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the UK {{produced}} derivatives {{of the design}} based on the T-1, {{as opposed to the}} original Mk. XIV. These T-2 and T-4 (Blue Devil) designs had much higher altitude, airspeed and wind-speed settings, suitable for high-altitude bombing in the jet stream. These were normally part of the Navigation and Bombing System, which combined inputs from aircraft instruments, H2S and Green Satin radars, star fixes and radio navigation systems, in a mechanical computer that directly output the latitude and longitude of the aircraft, based on automatic dead reckoning. The same outputs were also sent to the sighting head of the T-4, eliminating the need to manually set the <b>windage</b> and providing those values with much higher accuracy (about ±0.1mph and ±0.1 degrees).|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{originally}} {{equipped with the}} Ring Sights HC-14-62 reflex sight, but the current weapon is instead fitted with the Ring Sights MC-10-80 sight, which was specifically designed for it. The HC-14-62 has a polymer housing and uses a forward-aimed fiber optic collector to illuminate the white daytime reticle, which consists of a large circle of about 180 minutes of arc (MOA), with a 20 MOA circle surrounding a 3.5 MOA dot in the center. The MC-10-80 has an anodized aluminium housing, and has a similar black reticle. The night reticle for both the HC-14-62 and the MC-10-80 consists of an open T that is primarily illuminated by a tritium module, and, in the HC-14-62, ambient light drawn in by an upward-facing collector. The sight is adjustable for both <b>windage</b> and elevation, {{and it can be}} used in conjunction with night vision equipment. As backup in case the reflex sight is damaged, a set of fixed iron sights is provided {{on each side of the}} reflex sight housing.|$|E
25|$|W = about 0.0005 {{percent of}} C (or less) if the cooling tower has <b>windage</b> drift eliminators and uses sea water as make-up water.|$|E
25|$|The SR9's open iron sights {{are of the}} three-dot {{enhanced}} contrast variety, {{and offer}} drift adjustment on both front and rear blades for <b>windage,</b> as well as rear-sight adjustment for elevation.|$|E
25|$|Quantitatively, the {{material}} balance around a wet, evaporative cooling tower system {{is governed by}} the operational variables of make-up volumetric flow rate, evaporation and <b>windage</b> losses, draw-off rate, and the concentration cycles.|$|E
25|$|Early sailing vessels used rope of hemp {{or other}} fibers, which {{gave way to}} wire ropes of various types. Galvanized steel was common {{for the first half}} of the 20th century, {{continuing}} as an inexpensive option to its 1960s successor material—stainless steel cables and rods. In the late 20th Century, racing yachts adopted composite fiber lines for standing rigging, with the goal of reducing weight and <b>windage</b> aloft.|$|E
25|$|Drift (or <b>windage)</b> is {{the term}} for water {{droplets}} of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge. Drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001–0.005% of the circulating flow rate. A typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets. A well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for Legionella or water treatment chemical exposure.|$|E
25|$|The {{cast iron}} shell, similar in shape to a Minié ball, had a thin lead coating {{which made it}} fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell. This system had just been {{developed}} by Martin von Wahrendorff and Giovanni Cavalli in Sweden. This spin, together with the elimination of <b>windage</b> {{as a result of}} the tight fit, enabled the gun to achieve greater range and accuracy than existing smoothbore muzzle-loaders with a smaller powder charge.|$|E
25|$|Although {{technology}} such as electronics have improved, {{optical equipment}} such as rangefinders and ballistic calculators have eliminated manual mathematical calculations to determine elevation and <b>windage,</b> the fundamentals of accurate and precise long-range shooting {{are the same as}} throughout the history of shooting, and the skill and training of the shooter and his spotter where applicable are the primary factors. Accuracy and precision of ammunition and firearms are also still reliant primarily on human factors and attention to detail in the complex process of producing maximum performance.|$|E
25|$|While small {{generators}} may be cooled by air {{drawn through}} filters at the inlet, larger units generally require special cooling arrangements. Hydrogen gas cooling, in an oil-sealed casing, is used {{because it has}} the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity which reduces <b>windage</b> losses. This system requires special handling during start-up, with air in the generator enclosure first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that the highly flammable hydrogen does not mix with oxygen in the air.|$|E
25|$|The Colt Bisley was {{introduced}} in 1894 as a target pistol. The name Bisley came from the famous firing range in Bisley, England. The Colt Bisley can be distinguished by the longer grip, the wider hammer spur, and the wider trigger. The distinguishing feature of the Bisley Target Model is the topstrap, which is flat and fitted with a sliding rear sight, adjustable for <b>windage</b> only. The front sight is a removable blade, which fits into the slotted base attached to the barrel. The revolvers were supplied with different blades for elevation.|$|E
25|$|The L-shaped rear sight has two {{apertures}} preset for {{firing at}} 0–300m and 300–500m respectively (the rear sight {{can only be}} adjusted for elevation). The front post is fully adjustable for both <b>windage</b> and elevation zero and is enclosed in a protective hood. Low-light flip-up front blade and rear sight elements have three self-luminous tritium capsules (betalights) which are calibrated for 100 m when deployed. When the rear night sight is flipped up for use, the rear aperture sights must be placed in an offset position intermediate between the two apertures. Certain variants have a receiver-mounted dovetail adapter {{that is used to}} mount various optical sights.|$|E
25|$|Although the CSBS {{and similar}} designs allowed the {{calculation}} of the proper flight angle needed to correct for <b>windage,</b> it was normally not visible to the pilot. In early bombers the bomb aimer was normally positioned {{in front of the}} pilot and could indicate corrections by hand signals, but as aircraft grew larger it became common for the pilot and bomb aimer to be separated. This led to the introduction of the pilot direction indicator, or PDI. These typically consisted of a pair of electrical pointers mounted in a conventional aircraft instrument panel mount (a small dial). The bombardier used switches to move the pointer on his unit, which was repeated in the cockpit in front of the pilot.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, the SMLE Mk III {{was found}} to be too {{complicated}} to manufacture (an SMLE Mk III rifle cost the British Government £3/15/-) and demand was outstripping supply, so in late 1915 the Mk III* was introduced, which incorporated several changes, the most prominent of which were the deletion of the magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve, and the long-range volley sights. The <b>windage</b> adjustment of the rear sight was also dispensed with, and the cocking piece was changed from a round knob to a serrated slab. Rifles with some or all of these features present are found, as the changes were implemented at different times in different factories and as stocks of existing parts were used. The magazine cut-off was reinstated after the First World War ended and not entirely dispensed with until 1942.|$|E
500|$|The cannon could fire solid shot, {{explosive}} shells, grapeshot, case {{shot and}} [...] "Martins Liquid Iron Shell" [...] (thin walled shells filled with molten iron, intended {{to serve as}} heated shot). Although the cannon's barrel bore was , both shot and shells were [...] in diameter. [...] This allowed a <b>windage</b> gap of [...] around the projectile; enough to aid the loading process, {{but not enough to}} seriously diffuse the propellant gasses.|$|E

2500|$|All rifles are test {{fired for}} {{accuracy}} and function prior to leaving the factory at the manufacturer's underground 300 m test range. Random new rifles {{out of production}} were tested on a machine rest. In a 24 single shot string starting with a cold weapon and using GP 90 ammunition, the 50% <b>windage</b> and elevation dispersion of any individual weapon must have been within an [...] group at 300 m, the 50% <b>windage</b> and elevation dispersion must have averaged [...] The employed circular error probable method cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining rifle accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Windage</b> (or drift) losses (W) is {{the amount}} of total tower water flow that is entrained in the flow of air to the atmosphere. From {{large-scale}} industrial cooling towers, in the absence of manufacturer's data, it may be assumed to be: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 17 has a fixed polymer combat-type {{sighting}} {{arrangement that}} consists of a ramped front sight and a notched rear sight with white contrast elements painted on for increased acquisition speed – a white dot on the front post and a rectangular border on the rear notch. The rear sight can be adjusted for <b>windage</b> (on certain models due to the <b>windage</b> sights not coming as factory default), [...] as it has a degree of lateral movement in the dovetail it is mounted in.

2500|$|<b>Windage</b> or Drift — Water {{droplets}} {{that are}} carried out of the cooling tower with the exhaust air. Drift droplets have the same concentration of impurities as the water entering the tower. The drift rate is typically reduced by employing baffle-like devices, called drift eliminators, through which the air must travel after leaving the fill and spray zones of the tower. [...] Drift can also be reduced by using warmer entering cooling tower temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|Winema was {{salvaged}} and reconstructed, {{with the}} top cabin structure mostly removed, to catch less <b>windage.</b> The boat was returned to the run on August 29, 1907. On June 17, 1908, Winema {{was reported to be}} [...] "in commission" [...] and apparently ready to operate on the lake. Reconstruction may have taken place during the winter of 1907–1908, because the [...] "remodeled" [...] Winema is reported to have been used in an excursion on July 23, 1908, with Mrs. Totten as cook.|$|E
2500|$|The AR-15's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} carrying handle and rear sight assembly {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the original ArmaLite design, where the carry handle served to protect the charging handle. As the line of sight is [...] over the bore, the AR-15 has an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15–20 meters), the shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired. The standard AR-15 rifle has a 500mm (19.75inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for <b>windage.</b> The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool. The AR-15 can also mount a scope on the carrying handle. With the advent of the AR-15A2, a new fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow <b>windage</b> adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. Current versions such as AR-15A4 use Picatinny rails, which allows the use of various scopes and sighting devices.|$|E
2500|$|The SG 550 series rifles have a [...] {{long sight}} radius and are {{equipped}} with iron sights adjustable for both <b>windage</b> and elevation. The sights {{are similar to those}} on some Heckler & Koch weapons, such as the HK G3 or HK MP5. The sights consist of a rear, rotating diopter drum soldered to the receiver and a hooded front post installed in the gas block. The rear sight has an open notch setting marked [...] "1" [...] designed for immediate firing up to 100 m but also contains apertures with settings [...] "2", [...] "3" [...] and [...] "4" [...] corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 m firing ranges. The 400 m setting has a removable iris for sportive shooting. The sights are adjustable via micrometer screws with <b>windage</b> and elevation increments of 1.5 mrad or [...] at 300 m. For night use, the dedicated [...] "1" [...] notch setting in the rear sight drum is provided with two self-luminous tritium-powered inserts fitted laterally {{on each side of the}} notch and additionally in a flip-up post attached to the foresight. When firing rifle grenades the front sight hood is aligned with the uppermost edge of the grenade's warhead, this provides an estimated point of impact up to 75 m. The rifle grenades intended for this purpose were FN/Luchaire Type 58-N bullet-though anti-tank grenades.|$|E
2500|$|The generator, [...] {{long and}} [...] in diameter, {{contains}} a stationary stator and a spinning rotor, each containing miles of heavy copper conductor—no permanent magnets here. In operation it generates up to 21,000 amperes at 24,000 volts AC (504MWe) as it spins at either 3,000 or 3,600 rpm, synchronized {{to the power}} grid. The rotor spins in a sealed chamber cooled with hydrogen gas, selected because it has the highest known heat transfer coefficient of any gas and for its low viscosity, which reduces <b>windage</b> losses. This system requires special handling during startup, with air in the chamber first displaced by carbon dioxide before filling with hydrogen. This ensures that a highly explosive hydrogen–oxygen environment is not created.|$|E
2500|$|The 5906 is a full-sized, double/single-action, staggered-column magazine, 9×19mm pistol. Its {{construction}} is all stainless steel. The 5906 {{is equipped with}} a magazine disconnect feature which is designed to deactivate the trigger if the magazine is not fully inserted. The pistol comes standard with either a 10- or 15-round magazine. Other features include ambidextrous safety levers, a one-piece rear wraparound grip, and a choice of either fixed sights or a rear sight fully adjustable for <b>windage</b> and elevation. A popular model with law enforcement and military units in the United States, the 5906 is nevertheless being replaced by lighter, polymer-framed models from Glock, Heckler & Koch, SIG Sauer as well as Smith & Wesson's own M line of polymer framed handguns in both 9mm and [...]40 calibers.|$|E
2500|$|Iceboats {{designs are}} {{generally}} supported by three skate blades called [...] "runners" [...] supporting a triangular or cross-shaped frame with the steering runner in front. Runners {{are made of}} iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails. Once the lateral force has been effectively countered by the runner edge, the remaining force of [...] "sail-lift" [...] vacuums the boat forward with significant power. That power increases as {{the speed of the}} boat increases, allowing the boat to go much faster than the wind. Limitations to iceboat speed are <b>windage,</b> friction, the camber of the sail shape, strength of construction, and quality of the ice surface. Iceboats can sail as close as 7 degrees off the apparent wind. Ice boats can achieve speeds as high as ten times the wind speed in good conditions. International DN iceboats often achieve speeds of [...] while racing, and speeds as high as [...] have been recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{trees were}} pollarded {{for one of}} two reasons: for fodder to feed livestock, or for wood. This is not a {{practice}} to use if one wants an attractive, natural tree as the natural growth is stunted. [...] Many times this is done in southern states of the USA to crepe myrtles, and is called [...] "crepe murder" [...] by some. Fodder pollards produced [...] "pollard hay", which was used as livestock feed; they were pruned at intervals of two to six years so their leafy material would be most abundant. Wood pollards were pruned at longer intervals of eight to fifteen years, a pruning cycle that tended to produce upright poles favored for fence rails and posts, as well as boat construction. Supple young willow or hazel branches are harvested as material for weaving baskets, fences, and garden constructions such as bowers. One consequence of pollarding is that pollarded trees tend to live longer than unpollarded specimens because they are maintained in a partially juvenile state, {{and they do not}} have the weight and <b>windage</b> of the top part of the tree.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]45-70 is a {{long-range}} caliber {{but it takes}} adequate knowledge of <b>windage</b> and elevation. The [...]45-70 retains great popularity among American hunters for the niche it is suited for, and is still offered by several commercial ammunition manufacturers. Even when loaded with modern smokeless powders, pressures are usually kept low for safety in antique rifles and their replicas. Rifles which reproduce the original designs take the original load but are not strong enough for anything with higher pressure. Various modern sporting rifles are chambered for the [...]45-70, {{and some of these}} benefit from judicious handloading of ammunition with markedly higher pressure and ballistic performance. In a rifle such as the Siamese Mauser (commonly converted to fire [...]45-70 due to it being the only Mauser 98 derivative designed to feed rimmed cartridges, and the limited availability of ammunition for its original 8×50mmR chambering) or a Ruger No. 1 single-shot rifle, can be handloaded to deliver good performance even on big African game. The [...]45-70 has also been used in double rifles since the development of the Colt 1878 rifle and the more modern replicas, like the Kodiak Mark IV.|$|E
2500|$|The early fire lance, {{considered}} to be the ancestor of firearms, is not considered a true gun because it did not include projectiles. Later on, shrapnel such as ceramics and bits of iron were added, but these didn't occlude the barrel, and were only swept along with the discharge rather than make use of <b>windage.</b> These projectiles were called [...] "co-viatives." [...] The commonplace nature of the fire lance, if not in quantity, was apparent by the mid 13th century, and in 1257 an arsenal in Jiankang Prefecture reported the manufacture of 333 [...] "fire emitting tubes" [...] (突火筒). In 1259 a type of [...] "fire-emitting lance" [...] (突火槍) made an appearance and according to the History of Song: [...] "It is made from a large bamboo tube, and inside is stuffed a pellet wad (子窠). Once the fire goes off it completely spews the rear pellet wad forth, and the sound is like a bomb that can be heard for five hundred or more paces." [...] The pellet wad mentioned is possibly the first true bullet in recorded history depending on how bullet is defined, as it did occlude the barrel, unlike previous co-viatives used in the fire lance.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} 383 engines {{available for the}} 1969 model year: 2-barrel and 4-barrel. [...] The 2-barrel was rated at 290 hp. The four barrel engine was rated at 330 hp and was identified by the [...] "pie tin" [...] on the air cleaner as [...] "383 / FOUR BARREL". The 330-hp engine was unique to the Charger model in 1969. While this engine was available with an un-silenced air cleaner option, it differed internally from the 335-hp 383 [...] "Magnum". In 1969 the B-series engines were all painted Chrysler Engine Turquoise {{with the exception of}} the 383 four speed, 440 Magnum, These engines were painted Chrysler High-Performance Orange. Differing from the 426 Hemi which was painted Street Hemi Orange. The 335-hp 383 Magnum engines were also painted Chrysler High-Performance Orange. The 383 Magnum motor was used in Road Runners and Super Bees, but did not appear in a Charger body until 1971. Differences between the 330-hp 383 4-barrel and 335-hp 383 magnum were mostly internal. Both versions used the Carter AVS carb and the larger exhaust manifolds from the 440 Magnum engines, but the Magnum had a <b>windage</b> tray in the oil pan, a different camshaft profile, and different valve springs.|$|E
2500|$|The M1895 was {{equipped}} with a ladder-type rear sight adjustable {{to a maximum of}} 2,000 yards, determined by actual firing at Winchester in March 1896. [...] Because of the relatively high velocity and flat trajectory of the 6mm Lee cartridge, authorities calibrated the sights at their lowest setting with a point-blank or dead aim range of 725 yards (663 m). [...] The latter was intended for use on targets at all ranges from point-blank to 700 yards. [...] The single battle setting was intended to discourage individual soldiers or marines from adjusting their sight elevation unless firing at mass targets at extreme ranges, in which case officers would give commands for ranges to be set in such situations. [...] Owing to the necessity of supplying the Navy with rifles as soon as practicable, no provision for drift (<b>windage)</b> was included in the rear sight. [...] The prominence of the front sight and its exposure to damage led to the adoption of a sheet metal front sight cover for the 10,000 rifles in the original order. [...] The front sight cover was browned (blued) to reduce glare. [...] Each rifle was tested at Winchester for accuracy by firing a group of three shots at 50 yards, any rifle not showing the desired accuracy was returned to the line for adjustment, which sometimes involved restocking the entire rifle.|$|E
