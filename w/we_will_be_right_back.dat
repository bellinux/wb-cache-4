40|$|We are {{concerned}} with solutions to the difference equation Py(t - k) = f(t,y(t)) where^ (DIAGRAM, TABLE OR GRAPHIC OMITTED [...] . PLEASE SEE DAI) ^ Here, k and n are fixed integers with 0 (LESSTHEQ) k 3 ̆c n, and the coefficients (alpha) (,i) (t) are defined on I + k where I is an interval of integers of the form a,b or a,(INFIN)). Py(t - k) = 0 {{is said to be}} disconjugate on J provided no nontrivial solution has n zeros on J. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> interested in <b>right</b> and left (j,n - j) -disconjugacy as defined by Peterson. We obtain a partial factorization for P if P <b>is</b> <b>right</b> (j,n - j) -disconjugate and results relating right and left (j,n-j) -disconjugacy are given. An adjoint to Py(t) = 0 and disconjugacy properties for the adjoint equation are discussed. ^ Next, the equation Ly(t) + p(t) y(t) = 0 is considered, where L is a disconjugate operator. This work is motivated by results of Elias for the corresponding differential equation. A theorem which bounds the number of certain types of zeros for solutions on an interval is obtained. Using this, sign conditions on p(t) <b>are</b> determined that <b>will</b> guarantee that Ly(t) + p(t) y(t) = 0 <b>is</b> <b>right</b> (k,n - k) -disconjugate, and a uniqueness theorem for solutions to certain types of bound- ary value problems is given. Several results give some properties of solutions to this difference equation. Furthermore, a classification of solutions is obtained based on their behavior in a neighborhood of infinity. ^ Finally, we consider the nonlinear equation Py(t - k) = f(t,y(t)). A comparison theorem for solutions of related linear inequalities is obtained. This leads to some disconjugacy results. The Brouwer invariance of domain theorem is used to establish some results on the (j,n - j) -problem and its related variational equation. Then we show that under suitable conditions on f and certain related linear equations that the (n - 2, 2) -boundary value problem has a unique solution. ...|$|R
30|$|From the {{philosophical}} standpoint, {{the concept of}} purpose is generally defined {{as the reason for}} which something is done or created or for which something exists. Aristotle, the ancient Greek father of western philosophy called that purpose, telos. The word can mean “purpose”, “intent”, “end”, or “goal”, but as usual, Aristotle used it in a more specific and subtle sense - the inherent purpose of each thing, the ultimate reason for each thing being the way it is, whether created that way by human beings or nature. The root of telos is wholeness or completion. It is the root of the term “teleology”, roughly the study of purposiveness, or the study of objects with a view to their aims, purposes, or intentions. In human beings, the achievement of this wholeness of life requires choices carried out in action. Therefore, the end appears as a purpose, the accomplishment of which completes the action. The purpose behind all other purposes would be the human end that is complete simply (Sachs, 2002). Aristotle observed that every person is drawn by a telos or purpose in their lives. Aristotle argues that living happily requires living a life of virtue. Someone who is not living a life that is virtuous, or morally good, is also not living a happy life, no matter what they might think. Someone who does live according to the virtue, who chooses {{to do the right thing}} because it <b>is</b> the <b>right</b> thing to do, is living a life that flourishes. Human beings discover these things rather than creating them. We do not get to decide what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and wrong, but we do get to decide whether <b>we</b> <b>will</b> do what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> or what <b>is</b> wrong, and this is the most important decision we make in life (Aristotle, 1995). Aristotle, teleological concepts help us capture what living things are - namely, purposively organized entities that strive to achieve various aims - and what properties they possess.|$|R
40|$|Deep Learning {{has been}} gaining {{momentum}} and achieving the state-of-the-art results on many visual recognition problems. The roots of this field {{can be traced back}} to the 1940 s of the 20 th century. The field has recently started delivering some interesting results on many image understanding problems. This is mainly due to the availability of powerful hardware that can accelerate the training process. In addition, the growth of the Internet and imaging devices such as mobile phones and cameras has contributed to the increase in the amount of data that can be used to train neural networks. All of these factors have contributed to the success of deep learning on large scale image understanding tasks. Many image understanding problems do not have large training data. This is especially true in many special purpose datasets such as medical images, astronomical images, and environmental images. These application do not have large training datasets because unlike natural images, users do not typically take these images and upload them to the web. In addition, some of these applications, such as medical imaging, have many restrictions on sharing the data in order to protect the privacy of the patients. Finally, the labeling process needed for training natural images can be done by any person, unlike special purpose datasets. For example, in medical imaging, the images must be labeled by medical or clinical experts in the field. This results in datasets that are normally much smaller than natural images datasets as these experts have limited time to invest in the creation of the training sets. Luckily, in many of these applications, the most discriminative features may be present in a small region of interest. In this work, we present a method of training deep learning models on problems with low number of training images. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> do that by localizing a region of interest in these images, which will help reduce the problem of overfitting. In this thesis, two localization architectures are introduced, namely: the naive localization network and the wide localization network (wide net). The latter has several advantages which we explain thoroughly. The first problem <b>we</b> <b>will</b> introduce <b>is</b> the <b>Right</b> whale recognition problem. The problem involves recognizing whales from aerial images by analyzing the callosities pattern on their heads. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> study how localizing the region of interest can be used to make deep learning work on such a small dataset. The second problem <b>we</b> <b>will</b> study <b>is</b> the estimation of the ejection fraction and left ventricle volume by analyzing cardiac MRI images. Automatically estimating the ejection fraction and volume of the heart can help in identifying and diagnosing several cardiac health issues. Similarly, this dataset contains only a small number of training subjects...|$|R
40|$|New Zealanders {{are driving}} nearly 30 billion {{kilometres}} {{each year in}} their cars, vans, utes and SUVs. The road network also carries 70 percent {{of all of our}} freight. As a nation we have built and continue to maintain a network of roads to allow us to make these trips. The road network is worth more than 60 billion and costs more than 1 billion a year to maintain. We are planning to invest 10 billion {{over the next ten years}} to change the shape of the network to improve its quality and capacity. This would be relatively straightforward if we knew how demand would change. The challenge we face, however, is there have recently been changes to the patterns of demand for personal travel. From 1980 to 2004 we saw an annual increase in demand in the order of three percent per year. This highlighted the importance of tackling congestion and improving safety and gave us assurance revenue would grow to cover the costs of a growing network. From 2005 to 2013 total demand only grew by 0. 25 percent per year. We now face an uncertain future. We cannot <b>be</b> certain demand <b>will</b> return to pre- 2005 levels of growth nor can <b>we</b> <b>be</b> certain it <b>will</b> remain flat. This means we can no longer rely on traditional forecasting models alone to help us to decide how to invest. The aim of this project was to explore the uncertainty around demand for personal travel, car travel in particular, which represents 77 percent of the total kilometres travelled on our roads. We did this by developing four future scenarios which explored the possible impact on travel of our use of digital technology and also the impact of energy costs on future travel demand. The goal was not to create predictions of the future; nor was it to create a view on what our preferences were for the future transport system. Our goal was to produce a range of plausible futures. This would allow us to improve the likelihood the investment decisions <b>we</b> make today <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> for the future. The conclusions of our work were: 1. 	When we think about creating a thriving New Zealand we should recognise we are trying to improve access not just mobility. This can be achieved in three different ways: with good transport systems, with good spatial planning, or by improving digital access. We need to integrate our thinking across these three areas to achieve the optimal outcome. 2. 	To reduce the uncertainty we face we should seek to better understand the factors affecting the changing patterns of demand and refresh our demand models accordingly. We should look both at social trends and also speed in development, take-up and impact of new technologies. 3. 	To ensure resilience of the access system we develop for New Zealand we should seek to build in flexibility where <b>we</b> can. This <b>will</b> allow us to respond more quickly to changing patterns of demand and reduce the likelihood <b>we</b> <b>will</b> make investments which will become unnecessary. 4. 	We need to recognise the investment decisions <b>we</b> make <b>will</b> shape patterns of demand and not just respond to them. We should move away from the approach of seeking to simply predict future demand and then provide for it. We should instead debate the sort of access we want and decide how to invest to support the future...|$|R

40|$|On Christmas Eve, 1968, {{a ten-year-old}} girl, Pamela Powers, {{disappeared}} while {{with her family}} in Des Moines, Iowa. 2 Defendant Williams, an escapee from a mental institution and a deeply religious person, 3 was suspected of murdering her, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. 4 Williams telephoned a Des Moines lawyer, McKnight, and on his advice surrendered himself to the Davenport, Iowa, police. 5 Captain Learning and another Des Moines police officer arranged to drive the 160 miles to Davenport, pick up Williams, and return him directly to Des Moines. 6 Both the trial court 7 and the federal district court 8 found that defense attorney McKnight and the Des Moines police agreed that Williams would not be 2 ̆ 2 questioned 2 ̆ 2 until after he returned to Des Moines and conferred with his lawyer. 9 Before being driven back to Des Moines, Williams was advised of his rights many times-by McKnight over the phone, by Kelly (his Davenport attorney), by the Davenport judge who arraigned him on the warrant, by a Davenport police officer, and by Leaming himself. 10 More important, Williams asserted his rights many times. He retained counsel in both Des Moines I and Davenport. 12 He requested and was granted a private meeting with the Davenport judge. 2 ̆ 7 3 After Leaming arrived and advised him of his rights, Williams requested and was granted two private meetings with attorney Kelly. 2 ̆ 7 4 Kelly, furthermore, told Leaming that Williams {{was not to be}} questioned until he met with McKnight. 15 Kelly also requested, but was refused, permission to ride back with his client. 2 ̆ 7 6 Finally, on the trip back, Williams told Leaming several times that he would tell him 2 ̆ 2 the whole story 2 ̆ 2 after he saw McKnight in Des Moines. 17 The Court 2 ̆ 7 s reading of the record, and the best reading, 18 is that not long after Captain Leaming and his prisoner left Davenport and entered the freeway, the captain delivered his now famous 2 ̆ 2 Christian burial speech. 2 ̆ 219 Although there are two significantly different versions of 2 ̆ 2 the speech, 2 ̆ 220 I shall proceed, as did the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, on the assumption that there was only one. 21 According to the Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion, the detective addressed Williams as 2 ̆ 2 Reverend 2 ̆ 2 and continued: 2 ̆ 2 I want to give you something to think about while we 2 ̆ 7 re traveling down the road [...] ..
