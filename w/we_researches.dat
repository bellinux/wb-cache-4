40|$|Most {{conventional}} mass media such as television, news press, magazines treat mainly the information of Tokyo. The reason of {{it consists of}} three factors. The first factor is that the main office of mass media is concentrated into Tokyo (more than 95 % in mass media), and most managers of mass media live in Tokyo. The second factor is that for saving the interviewing cost and the producing cost of a program, many interviews are asked near Tokyo. The third factor is that the large part of viewers and consumers for mass media live in near Tokyo. The one of mass media problems is the concentration of the information about Tokyo. The information from the other region is reproduced by “Tokyo filter”. We must change the concentration of Tokyo for a specific region to power up. We established a Web news “Ise-shima keizai shinbun” in 2006. We are in alliance with the Web news “Yahoo News Japan” and so on, and our news is transferred to all Japan. The number of access in top page of “Yahoo News Japan” is 1. 9 billion access /month. If it would insert our regional news, then the news would be spread to all Japan. <b>We</b> <b>researches</b> the route of diffusion to all Japan about the spread articles in ”Ise-Shima keizai shinbun”, and we will construct a regional innovation model about regional news...|$|E
