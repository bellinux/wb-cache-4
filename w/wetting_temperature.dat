Nevertheless, many new technical challenges have arisen with this endeavor; to reduce the melting point of tin-based solder alloys various new alloys have had to be researched, with additives of copper, silver, bismuth as typical minor additives to reduce melting point and control other properties, additionally tin is a more corrosive metal, and can eventually lead to the failure of solder baths etc.|$|E

Using {{the properties of}} the transfer matrix spectrum we identify two pseudotransition temperatures and show that they satisfy similar scaling relations as expected for real transition temperatures in strips with d> 2. The solvation force between the boundaries of the strip is analysed as a function of temperature, surface fields and the width of the strip. For large widths the solvation force can be described by scaling functions in three different regimes: {{in the vicinity of the}} critical <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> of 2 D semi-infinite system, in the vicinity of the bulk critical temperature, and in the regime of weak surface fields where the critical <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> tends towards the bulk critical temperature.

40|$|Consider a {{two-dimensional}} capped capillary pore formed by capping two parallel planar walls {{with a third}} wall orthogonal to the two planar walls. This system reduces to a slit pore sufficiently far from the capping wall and to a single planar wall when the side walls are far apart. Not surprisingly, wetting of capped capillaries is related to wetting of slit pores and planar walls. For example, the <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the capped capillary provides the boundary between first-order and continuous transitions to condensation. We present a numerical investigation of adsorption in capped capillaries of mesoscopic widths based on density functional theory. The fluid-fluid and fluid-substrate interactions are given by the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. We also perform a parametric study of wetting in capped capillaries by a liquid phase by varying the applied chemical potential, temperature, and pore width. This allows us to construct surface phase diagrams and investigate the complicated interplay of wetting mechanisms specific to each system, in particular, the dependence of capillary <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> on the pore width...|$|E

For the (4) He/Rb system we find that a wetting transition on the Rb surface occurs at T similar to 1. 4 K, whereas;the experiments show either wetting down to T= 0 or a wetting transition at T similar to 0. 3,K; We suggest that this disagreement is due either to an inaccuracy of the fluid-substrate potential used in our calculations or the consequence of substrate roughness, which is known to affect the Rb surface, and whose effect would be to lower the <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature.</b> The sensitivity of the wetting transition to the He-surface potential is stressed for the He/Rb surface, which may justify the controversial experimental findings for this system...|$|E

40|$|To produce {{structurally}} sound carbon anodes for use {{in aluminum}} smelting, a strong bond between filler and binder coke is necessary. Bond strength results from mechanical interlocking and adhesion of the binder coke to the filler coke. Critical for creating such bonds {{is the ability of}} the pitch to wet the coke surface and penetrate the coke porosity during mixing and forming. Wettability is normally assessed from the pitch behavior during the initial stages of a penetration test. In the test, the observed contact angle between a pitch droplet and a bed of fine coke particles is recorded as the temperature is increased. The temperature at which this contact angle becomes 90 ° {{is referred to as the}} <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the pitch. The penetration test may be useful to identify pitch and coke combinations that are unlikely to produce baked anodes of acceptable quality with standard paste preparation conditions. It does not, however, provide a measure of the true wettability of a coke by a pitch. The isothermal penetration experiments reported here demonstrate that the observed contact angle of a pitch against a coke bed changes continuously from 90 ° to 90 °, even to 0 °, at a temperature much lower than the <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> derived from the penetration test. The requirements for the measurement of a true contact angle and the difference between the concepts of adhesion and wetting are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Using {{extensive}} Monte Carlo simulations, {{we study}} the interface localization- delocalization transition of a thin Ising film with antisymmetric competing walls {{for a set}} of parameters where the transition is strongly first-order. This is achieved by estimating the density of states (DOS) of the model by means of Wang-Landau sampling (WLS) in the space of energy, using both, single-spin-flip as well as N-fold way updates. From the DOS we calculate canonical averages related to the configurational energy, like the internal energy, the specific heat, as well as the free energy and the entropy. By sampling microcanonical averages during simulations we also compute thermodynamic quantities related to magnetization like the reduced fourth order cumulant of the order parameter. We estimate the triple temperatures of infinitely large systems for three different film thicknesses via finite size scaling of the positions of the maxima of the specific heat, the minima of the cumulant and the equal weight criterion for the energy probability distribution. The <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the semi-infinite system is computed with help of the Young equation. In the limit of large film thicknesses the triple temperatures are seen to converge towards the <b>wetting</b> <b>temperature</b> of the corresponding semi-infinite Ising model in accordance with standard capillary wave theory. We discuss the slowing down of WLS in energy space as observed for the larger film thicknesses and lateral linear dimensions. In case of WLS in the space of total magnetization we find evidence that the slowing down is reduced and can be attributed to persisting free energy barriers due to shape transitions.
