5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, {{penalties}} and disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. municipal bond market, after the bank and three of its employees were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. <b>Wood</b> <b>said</b> that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E

It's about these guys whose world is so tenuous and so fragile that they can't stand to have any of their beliefs shattered", referring to John and Tom's views of their lives, Brandon's aspirations and his biological sex. Along with other turn-of-the-millennium films such as [...] In the Company of Men (1997), American Beauty (1999), Fight Club (1999), and American Psycho (2000), Vincent Hausmann said Boys Don't Cry [...] "raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis".

The best-remembered tune from the show is the seven-minute-long [...] "The Ballad of Barry and Freda – Let's Do It". It concerns a couple, Barry and Freda; she is hungry for sex, he isn't. It climaxes with the lines [...] "beat me on the bottom with a Woman's Weekly, let's do it! Let's do it tonight!". The song was performed numerous times by Wood in her live performances. <b>Wood</b> <b>said</b> of the number: [...] "A joy to write, a sod to learn, and I daren't finish a show without it.

A pity we don't see more of her". The A.V. Club named Homer's line [...] "Stupid TV! Be more funny!" [...] as one of the quotes from The Simpsons {{that can be used in}} {{everyday}} situations. On their 2000 album And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out, indie rock band Yo La Tengo has a song entitled [...] "Let's Save Tony Orlando's House"; the song is named after a telethon in Troy McClure's fictional CV seen in this episode.|$|E

500|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>said</b> {{that she}} is {{sometimes}} puzzled when reading Steffy's scripts, but connects her present storyline to the character's past. She said: [...] "I just think back to all the things Steffy has been through. She {{has a lot of}} deep seeded [...] issues. That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that it makes sense that she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|Wood spotted Susie Blake in {{a musical}} at the King's Head Theatre and cast her {{in the role of}} the opinionated {{continuity}} announcer. <b>Wood</b> <b>said</b> of her casting at the time, [...] "I didn't think of her particularly for the continuity announcer, but she came in and could do it, just like that. I'd love to cast her in a song-and-dance number – I feel so sorry for her always having to wear those terrible blouses". When As Seen On TV ended Blake said [...] "I'm very sad that this is the last time we will all work together but I understand why Vic wanted to stop.

500|$|Between series one and two, <b>Wood</b> <b>said</b> {{she thought}} {{it was a mistake to}} do another As Seen On TV series, and had {{attempted}} to write a play instead: [...] "I've been seeking to branch out, but it hasn't happened. I wanted to do something different before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw it away and began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy.

[...] In a review of the sixth season of The Simpsons, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide writes, [...] "Homer’s disdain for Marge’s sisters– and vice versa– has always led to terrific sparks, and “Vs.” provides another great round in their eternal battle. It’s hilarious to see Homer indebted to the Terrible Two..." ...|$|E
500|$|Wood {{conducted}} his own compositions and arrangements {{from time}} to time. He gave his Fantasia on Welsh Melodies and Fantasia on Scottish Melodies on successive nights in 1909. [...] He composed the work {{for which he is}} most celebrated, Fantasia on British Sea Songs, for a concert in 1905, celebrating the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar. It caught the public fancy immediately, with its mixture of sea-shanties, together with Handel's [...] "See the Conquering Hero Comes" [...] and Arne's [...] "Rule, Britannia!". [...] He played it at the Proms more than 40 times, and it became a fixture at the [...] "Last Night of the Proms", the lively concert marking the end of each season.
