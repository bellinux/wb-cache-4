When the Folkston–Kingsland {{stretch of}} SR40 reappeared on maps in February 1932, the highway was {{recorded}} as an unimproved but maintained road. SR40 <b>was</b> <b>under</b> construction along its present alignment from US17 in Kingsland {{to the south}} end of Osborne Street in St. Marys by October 1934; the highway was completed as a paved road by January 1936.

The construction was extended east from the county line to the highway's original SR110 junction in July 1937. When construction concluded in October 1937, there was a paved highway from Folkston to the county line and a graded but otherwise unimproved highway from there to SR110.

Therefore, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law, {{they are}} in a sad condition, because they <b>are</b> <b>under</b> that which <b>is</b> more ready, through our infirmity, to curse than to bless; they <b>are</b> <b>under</b> that called the ministration of condemnation, that <b>is,</b> they <b>are</b> <b>under</b> that dispensation, or administration, whose proper work is to curse and condemn, and nothing else (2 Cor 3).|$|R
6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE UNDER THE LAW, OR UNDER THE COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against the law, {{and of the}} denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> the law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or {{the works of the}} law, either as it is the old covenant, these <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law, and not under the Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of the law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the curse; for mark, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the Covenant of Grace <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> the curse. Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the curse <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law, seeing those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the other covenant <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> the curse, but under the blessing. [...] "So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," [...] but the rest <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the law (Gal 3:9).|$|R
