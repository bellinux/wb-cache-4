5|$|Although NASA <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> {{his work}} with grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became {{frustrated}} by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research. He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies. In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the Space Studies Institute, a non-profit organization, at Princeton University. SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.|$|E
5|$|During {{early days}} of Becket's dispute with the king, Foliot helped mediate between Becket and Gilbert Foliot, who <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> the king. Robert Foliot {{was one of the}} first of Becket's clerks to leave the archbishop's service, asking {{permission}} to leave Becket's household shortly after the council at Clarendon in January 1164, which ratified the Constitutions of Clarendon.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey Talbot (sometimes Geoffrey II Talbot, died around 1140) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Norman nobleman {{during the civil}} war of King Stephen of England's reign. His landholdings around Swanscombe are {{considered}} to possibly constitute a feudal barony. Although he was at Stephen's court in early 1136, by 1138 Talbot <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> Stephen's rival, Matilda. After escaping capture twice, Talbot was captured by partisan's of Stephen but was released. In 1139 and 1140, Talbot was engaged in military operations around Hereford, which included fortifying Hereford Cathedral in an attempt to take Hereford Castle.|$|E

Keyes and his family were staunch supporters of the war, in which his father served two tours of duty. Keyes was criticized by opponents of the war in Vietnam, but he says he <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> his father and his brothers, who were also fighting in the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{confiscation}} of Jewish property gave Göring {{the opportunity}} to amass a personal fortune. Some properties he seized himself or acquired for a nominal price. In other cases, he collected bribes for allowing others to steal Jewish property. He took kickbacks from industrialists for favourable decisions as Four Year Plan director, and money for supplying arms to the Spanish Republicans in the Spanish Civil War via Pyrkal in Greece (although Germany <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> Franco and the Nationalists).|$|E
5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization of American States, or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E

5|$|After a brief posting as Director of Air Staff Policy at RAAF Headquarters, Rawlinson succeeded Wilf Arthur as {{commander}} of No.78 (Fighter) Wing at Tarakan on 25May 1945.

No.78 Wing's complement included Nos.75, 78 and 80 Squadrons, operating Kittyhawks, and several ancillary units. In June and July, the wing took part in the assaults on Labuan and Balikpapan, undertaking convoy escort in the former and, joined by Spitfires of No.452 Squadron, ground-attack missions in support of the 7th Division in the latter.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{fears of}} war with Germany were {{realised}} in 1914 with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement. This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> the creation of an independent Arab state.|$|E

5|$|Henry II's biographer, the {{historian}} W. L.

Mayr-Harting also suggests that Theobald of Bec <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> Hilary's efforts to assert Chichester's rights.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Gould {{was elected}} to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Patrick's Plains (renamed Singleton in 1894). Initially an {{opponent}} of the coalition associated with Henry Parkes and John Robertson, he later supported Robertson's government in 1885. By 1887 he <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> his career with his own legal practice in Singleton and Sydney, and when the party system came into being in New South Wales in that year he identified as a Free Trader. In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under George Reid from 1894 to 1898. During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Darley, over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory.|$|E

5|$|Matilda's half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} Anglo-Norman barons, controlling estates in Normandy as well as the Earldom of Gloucester. In 1138, he rebelled against Stephen, starting the descent into civil war in England. Robert renounced his fealty to the King and declared his support for Matilda, which triggered a major regional rebellion in Kent and across the south-west of England, although he himself remained in Normandy. Matilda had not been particularly active in asserting her claims to the throne since 1135 and in many ways it was Robert who took the initiative in declaring war in 1138. In France, Geoffrey took advantage of the situation by re-invading Normandy. David of Scotland also invaded the north of England once again, announcing that he <b>was</b> <b>supporting</b> the claim of Matilda to the throne, pushing south into Yorkshire.|$|E
