Furthermore, we aim to recommend effective tips {{in order to get}} high performance storage system whether in the personal or the group working areas. To achieve our intention, this research tried to investigate and evaluate the storage system not only inside a workplace, but also within the current market as follows: Part 1 : it concerns the research background. Part 2 : it aims to identify the main items inside a workplace (e. g. paper documents, digital tools, books, etc.) which are needed to be stored. Basically, each item is kept in the storage unit that matches well with its size, design and the other features. Therefore, the storage system that is required to evaluate and discuss its efficiency and problems in the following parts of this research determined according to the item that takes up great space of the storage units (including personal and communal units) within the workplace. For case studies, we selected companies that have a variety of work types. In the visited companies, since there are different divisions, such as design, accounting, and sales, so that we have a great chance to observe and know the features of the current workplaces and how the storage systems are influenced by the different work types. Based on the observation inside 15 workplaces within five Japanese companies (five accounting division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces,</b> five design division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces</b> and five sales division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces)</b> and hearing from 50 persons (including male and female) who work in these workplaces, the paper storage system was selected for studying on as the paper documents occupy a great space of the storage units. Part 3 : it includes two chapters and it aims to search for the features of the storage system. In the first chapter of this part, we tried to investigate within the market for the available paper storage products, including its types, size and capacity. Moreover, the modifications concerning the storage furniture design from 1950 s to the present day were discussed {{in order to understand the}} fitness of the storage product for the current office works. Therefore, four office furniture manufactures Kokuyo, Itoki, Uchida, and Plus were visited because they are the most famous manufactures for the sales of office furniture in Japan. Several interviews were carried out with their designers and the filing system teams. Moreover different catalogs were examined to get precise information about the development of the storage unit design in the market. In the second chapter of this part, as most of manufactures and designers emphasize on the importance of the storage unit 2 ̆ 7 s mobility in order to accommodate the worker 2 ̆ 7 s needs and save his/her time and effort, this chapter aims to identify the suitability of the mobile storage unit of individual use for the work performance. Therefore, five accounting division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces</b> and five design division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces</b> within five Japanese companies (the same companies we had previously visited in part 2) in Tokyo and Fukuoka were visited as a field survey. Observation, hearing, and taking pictures were used to evaluate their workplaces including the work style and its effects on the storage systems. In addition, a questionnaire was distributed among 106 persons who work in these workplaces (about 72 persons work in accounting division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces</b> and about 34 persons work in design division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces)</b> in order to know their opinions concerning the mobile storage unit. Part 4 : it includes two chapters. This part aims mainly to identify and discuss the paper storage system 2 ̆ 7 s problems including personal and communal use and its efficiency inside the workplace. We selected accounting division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplaces</b> within the visited companies for two reasons: a. The work type of accounting division 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplace</b> requires a person to use the storage systems during a work-time more than the other persons who work in the another divisions 2 ̆ 7 workplaces, such as the design and sales divisions. b. Its workplace is overloaded by the paper documents more than another divisions 2 ̆ 7 workplaces. In the first chapter of this part, the personal storage system 2 ̆ 7 s problems within the own workstation were identified according to observation, hearing from the workers and making a questionnaire for 72 persons (male and female). As well as, the main reasons that generate these problems were discussed. On the other hand, we recommend four steps in order to overcome these problems which regard mainly file organization within the workstation. First step is concerning how to reduce the amounts of paper that are placed in the workstation to keep a space for the next information. Second step is regarding how a worker displays his/her documents clearly, so that they can get a file quickly. Third step is concerning how a worker assigns a home for each paper. In addition, distribute the files within the available storage space well in order to be simply accessed. As for fourth step, we advise a worker to maintain his/her files 2 ̆ 7 organization within a workstation regularly. The recommended steps were tested on 20 persons at laboratory in Kyushu University to be sure of their effectiveness. In the second chapter of this part, based on observation, hearing from the workers and making a questionnaire, the problems of communal storage system were identified within the same workplaces that we had previously visited. These problems concern mainly file accessibility, as well as the file cabinets 2 ̆ 7 capacity. For overcoming each problem, several tips are recommended and tested on 20 persons at laboratory in Kyushu University so as to prove their effectiveness. Regarding the first and second problems of communal storage system which concern file accessibility, we recommend the following: A. Revamp the filing organization within the storage unit. A worker has to display the documents within a file cabinet clearly by considering these points: filing system application, filing arrangement, select the file tools, use a divider, create a filing index and select the storage unit type. In addition, the files have to distribute within a file cabinet based on frequency of use. B. File cabinets 2 ̆ 7 organization within the workplace has strong influences on file accessibility. Three points has to be considered for accessing the communal file easily as follows: the distance between the file cabinet and the workers 2 ̆ 7 workstations, the available space in front of the cabinet and the area around the file cabinet has to suit for the workers. As for the third problem of communal storage system which regards the storage capacity, six points are recommended: reduce the retention period of files inside the cabinet, promote the usage of digital storage, encourage sharing information, select convenient file tools, arrange the files horizontally to increase the cabinet 2 ̆ 7 s capacity about 2...|$|R

Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to examine the effect of 5 <b>S</b> <b>workplace</b> organization technique on nurses’ job satisfaction. Methods: In this semi-experimental study, 70 nurses, selected from medical and surgical units of two therapeutic-educational centers in Gorgan, Iran, were studied in 2015. The subjects were selected through census sampling and were assigned into intervention and control groups (n= 35 per group). The intervention group was exposed to an organized work environment for six weeks. A visual workplace audit checklist was used in order to assess the need for workplace organization in the units before and one month after the intervention. Also, nurses’ job satisfaction was measured using the questionnaire designed by Kohli and Jaworski before and after the intervention in both groups. For statistical analysis, Fisher's exact test, Chi-square, independent t-test, and paired t-test were performed, using SPSS version 20. Results: The nurses' mean score of job satisfaction changed after the intervention from 14. 94 ± 2. 66 to 18. 48 ± 2. 03 in the intervention group (P< 0. 001) and from 15. 31 ± 1. 54 to 14. 80 ± 1. 47 in the control group. The difference between the groups was significant after the intervention (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The present results showed that implementation of 5 <b>S</b> <b>workplace</b> organization technique could improve nurses’ job satisfaction. Considering the simplicity of this technique, nursing managers can use it as an effective strategy to improve nurses’ job satisfaction. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Smoking is {{the leading}} {{controllable}} risk factor for heart disease. Only about 69 % of U. S. indoor workers are currently covered by a smoke-free workplace policy. This analysis projects the cardiovascular health and economic effects of making all U. <b>S.</b> <b>workplaces</b> smoke free after 1 year and at steady state. METHODS: We estimated the number of U. S. indoor workers not covered by smoke-free workplace policies, {{and the effects of}} making all workplaces smoke free on smoking behavior and on the relative risks of acute myocardial infarctions and strokes. One-year and steady-state results were calculated using an exponential decline model. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed for a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The first-year effect of making all workplaces smoke free would produce about 1. 3 million new quitters and prevent over 950 million cigarette packs from being smoked annually, worth about $ 2. 3 billion in pretax sales to the tobacco industry. In 1 year, making all workplaces smoke free would prevent about 1500 myocardial infarctions and 350 strokes, and result in nearly $ 49 million in savings in direct medical costs. At steady state, 6250 myocardial infarctions and 1270 strokes would be prevented, and $ 224 million would be saved in direct medical costs annually. Reductions in passive smoking would account for 60 % of effects among acute myocardial infarctions. CONCLUSION: Making all U. <b>S.</b> <b>workplaces</b> smoke free would result in considerable health and economic benefits within 1 year. Reductions in passive smoking would account for a majority of these savings. Similar effects would occur with enactment of state or local smoke-free policies. (C) 2004 by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

There are some {{leadership style}}s that can adversely impact or vastly improve workplace performance. This descriptive phenomenological study was used to understand employee perceptions of leadership styles that affect their workplace performance. Bass 2 ̆ 7 s transformational leadership theory guided this study to explore how a supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s leadership style impacts an employee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplace</b> performance. The primary research question focused on positive and negative perceptions employees held related to supervisors 2 ̆ 7 leadership behaviors and characteristics. The data collection was derived from in-depth interviews with 10 mid-level management employees aged 27 to 55 years of age, who are currently or were previously employed with a local government agency. Using Moustakas 2 ̆ 7 s method of data analysis, four primary themes were disclosed: (a) perceptions of three leadership styles, (b) insights on workplace performance, (c) observations of leader behaviors and characteristics, and (d) work ethics, indicating that a supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s leadership behaviors and characteristics do impact employees 2 ̆ 7 workplace performance. The 4 primary themes indicated that participants preferred leader characteristics and behaviors associated with transformational leaders than they did with transactional or laissez-faire leaders.

It was hypothesised that participation in both these forms of community in their different contexts may enhance each other, or could potentially have a disrupting effect on each. The research employed an interviewing technique. The students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the impact of participation in the one form of community on their participation in the other was mixed, with some suggesting that it was enhancing, and others suggesting the contrary, or that there was no impact. The findings indicate that the enhancing effect of participation in communities of learning relevant to a learner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplace</b> community of practice occur when the learning tasks are designed to enable negotiation of tasks and collaboration with learners who have similar workplace issues. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the {{widespread}} abusive practice of e-mail and Internet surveillance by employers in the American workplace. At present, U. S. employees in the private workplace have no constitutional, common law or statutory protection against abusive e-mail monitoring practices. In effect, American workers wave goodbye to their right to privacy as soon as they log onto their workplace computer because U. S. courts have formalistically applied a property rights regime to electronic surveillance of e-mail and Internet usage. This article uses the device of a hypothetical multi-national company to compare the diametrically opposed U. S. property-rights approach with the human rights approach to the European law of monitoring employees’ e-mail and Internet usage. Part I of this article reviews the case law and statutory developments for e-mail eavesdropping in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>workplace.</b> At present, American employers can lawfully intercept, search, and read any messages stored in workplace computers because courts have ruled that employees have no expectation of privacy in workplace electronic communications. Part II examines the European human rights tradition that accords workers a privacy expectation in the workplace. We explain the evolution of the human rights approach as a function of a wider social movement of worker’s co-determination in Europe. This part of the article next examines statutory and caselaw development from the Council of Europe and the European Union, as well as case studies of e-mail privacy rights in the United Kingdom and France, representing the common law and civil law traditions. In Part III, we propose that Congress enact the Electronic Monitoring Act of 2005, which is a proposed statute that will harmonize U. <b>S.</b> <b>workplace</b> monitoring law with European law. The model statute will provide U. S. workers with one-time written (?) supplemented by electronic notice of employer monitoring each time an employee boots up her computer. In addition, we propose civil remedies for non-compliance with the statute. The long-term impact of this model statute will be to appropriately balance the employers’ need to monitor with employee privacy. The long-term impact of the statute in the global economy will be to give American companies a competitive edge in cross-border transactions and reduce their liability costs. Our proposed Federal Electronic Monitoring Act is only the first step to harmonizing U. S. employment law with the rights that European employees have in an increasingly borderless global economy...|$|R
40|$|Process safety {{accidents}} can be prevented. On March 23, 2005, the BP Texas City refinery {{experienced a}} catastrophic process accident. It {{was one of}} the most serious U. <b>S.</b> <b>workplace</b> disasters of the past two decades, resulting in 15 deaths and more than 170 injuries. In the aftermath of the accident, BP followed the recommendation of the U. S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and formed this independent panel to conduct a thorough review of the company’s corporate safety culture, safety management systems, and corporate safety oversight at its U. S. refineries. We issue our findings and make specific and extensive recommendations. If implemented and sustained, these recommendations can significantly improve BP’s process safety performance. Throughout our review, we focused on being thorough and then letting the chips fall where they may. As our charter contemplates, we allowed BP to comment on our report to ensure its factual accuracy. However, we are solely responsible for our report’s final content. Although we necessarily direct our report to BP, we intend it for a broader audience. We are under no illusion that deficiencies in process safety culture, management, or corporat...|$|R
40|$|KEVIN RUDD and Julia Gillard are {{performing}} three different and sometimes discordant tunes as they promote their industrial relations policy. This tells {{us a lot}} about the nature and transformation of the Labor Party. Labor knows it 2 ̆ 7 s on a winner with its promise to rip up the Government 2 ̆ 7 s unpopular and employer-friendly WorkChoices regime. So the party 2 ̆ 7 s leaders have taken turns on the megaphone, booming out that John Howard 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplace</b> and dismissal laws are unfair. Rudd used the word unfair 14 times in his speech on industrial relations to the Press Club. Labor 2 ̆ 7 s policy, his fairness jingle stresses, will be fair; it is titled Forward with Fairness, and the proposed new industrial relations body will be called Fair Work Australia. Air on a Dog Whistle is Labor 2 ̆ 7 s second tune. Greg Combet got a blast when he requested more details about Labor 2 ̆ 7 s industrial relations policies.

40|$|Business and {{government}} leaders have long {{taken advantage of}} the latest technologies, learning that it pays to remain connected in an increasingly shrinking world and in step with the rapid pace of today 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>workplace.</b> That lesson has also been learnt by leaders in the education arena and it is now being mirrored increasingly in classrooms across the country. Innovative schools and teachers are fostering kids 2 ̆ 7 love of technology and have begun to integrate information and communication technology (ICT) deeper into the curriculum, connecting classrooms across Australia and the world to improve learning conditions. The traditional days of chalk-and-talk classrooms are drawing to an end. Interactive whiteboards and other modern tools are appearing in more classrooms and bringing a new dimension to learning. According to a 2006 PISA report for the OECD, students who are established computer users perform better than students with limited computing experience. The partnership between Australian schools, teachers, Microsoft {{and government}} is ensuring that as many children as possible are being provided with the necessary ICT skills and knowledge to enable them to forge their own successful careers so that we can continue fostering home-grown talent.
