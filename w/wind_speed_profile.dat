40|$|The {{advent of}} a new {{generation}} of Adaptive Optics systems called Wide Field AO (WFAO) mark the beginning {{of a new}} era. By using multiple Guide Stars (GSs), either Laser Guide Stars (LGSs) or Natural Guide Stars (NGSs), WFAO significantly increases the field of view of the AO-corrected images, and the fraction of the sky that can benefit from such correction. Different typologies of WFAO have been studied over the past years. They all require multiple GSs to perform a tomographic analysis of the atmospheric turbulence. One of the fundamental aspects of the new WFAO systems is the knowledge of the spatio-temporal distribution of the turbulence above the telescope. One way to get to this information is to use the telemetry data provided by the WFAO system itself. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that WFAO systems allows one to derive the Cn 2 and wind profile in the main turbulence layers (see e. g. Cortes et al. 2012). This method has the evident advantage to provide information on the turbulence stratification that effectively affects the AO system, property more difficultly respected by independently vertical profilers. In this paper, we compare the <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>profiles</b> of GeMS with those predicted by a non-hydrostatical mesoscale atmospherical model (Meso-NH). It has been proved (Masciadri et al., 2013), indeed, that this model is able to provide reliable <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> on the whole troposphere and stratosphere (up to 20 - 25 km) above top-level astronomical sites.

Analysis of one year of meteorological data from the FINO 1 research platform in the German Bight reveals that vertical <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> frequently do not conform to the expected modified logarithmic profile of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory.

40|$|Wind {{energy has}} become a major {{competitor}} of traditional fossil fuel energy, particularly with the successful operation of multi-megawatt sized wind turbines. However, wind with reasonable speed is not adequately sustainable everywhere to build an economical wind farm. The potential site has to be thoroughly investigated at least with respect to <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> and air density. Wind speed increases with height, thus an increase of the height of turbine rotor leads to more generated power. Therefore, it is imperative to have a precise knowledge of wind speed profiles in order to assess the potential for a wind farm site. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based neuro-fuzzy method to find <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profile</b> up to height of 100 m based on knowledge of wind speed at heights 10, 20, 30, 40 m. The model estimated wind speed at 40 m based on measured data at 10, 20, and 30 m has 3 % mean absolute percent error when compared with measured wind speed at height 40 m. This close agreement between estimated and measured wind speed at 40 m indicates the viability of the proposed method.

But this profile is used also for wind power prediction where the output of the numerical weather prediction (with very coarse vertical resolution) is transformed to the wind speed in hubheight for each specific situation of the boundary layer (so no statistics).

40|$|To achieve precise wind {{resource}} assessments, {{to calculate}} loads and wakes {{as well as}} for reliable short-term wind power forecasts, the vertical wind profile above the sea has to be modelled with high accuracy for tip heights up to 160 m. For these purposes, it is crucial to consider the special meteorological characteristics of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. Continuing our work in the EU-project ANEMOS [1], we analysed marine <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> that were measured at the two met masts Horns Rev (62 m high) and FINO 1 (103 m) in the North Sea. We found pronounced effects of thermal stratification and of the influence of the land-sea transition. In many situations, the wind shear is significantly higher than expected with standard approaches in mesoscale models. Nevertheless, the numerical analysis of the marine wind field above the North Sea from the German Weather Service seems to provide a good assessment of <b>wind</b> <b>speeds</b> at 103 m height. For an improved simulation of the vertical <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profiles,</b> we developed a new analytic model of marine wind velocity profiles. In particular, the flux of momentum through the Ekman layers of the atmosphere and the sea is described by a common wave boundary layer.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results of}} an experiment focusing on <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and momentum fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer up to 200 m. The measurements were conducted in 1996 at the Cabauw site in the Netherlands. Momentum fluxes are measured using the K-Gill Propeller Vane. Estimates of the roughness length are derived using various techniques from the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> and flux measurements, and the observed differences are explained by considering the source area of the meteorological parameters. A clear rough-to-smooth transition is found in the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profiles</b> at Cabauw. The internal boundary layer reaches the lowest k-vane (20 m) only in the south-west direction where the obstacle-free fetch is about 2 km. The internal boundary layer is also reflected in the roughness lengths derived from the <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> <b>profiles.</b> The lower part of the profile (< 40 m) is not in equilibrium and no reliable roughness analysis can be given. The upper part of the profile can be linked to a large-scale roughness length. Roughness lengths derived from the horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> variance and gustiness have large footprints and therefore represent a large-scale average roughness. The drag coefficient is more locally determined but still represents a large-scale roughness length when it is measured above the local internal boundary layer. The roughness length at inhomogeneous sites can therefore be determined best from drag coefficient measurements just above the local internal boundary layers directly, or indirectly from horizontal <b>wind</b> <b>speed</b> variance or gustiness. In addition, the momentum and heat fluxes along the tower are analysed and these show significant variation with height related to stability and possibly surface heterogeneity.
