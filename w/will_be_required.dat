5|$|The program {{stresses}} {{discipline and}} performance. There are no appreciation courses; the curriculum emphasizes that arts appreciation grows from practicing an art. The interrelation {{of the arts}} is also stressed. All students take at least one course in each major area.

Under a new law, the California Fire Marshall <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to review the oil pipelines conditions every year while federal regulations only mandate a review every five years. Another new law provides for making oil spill response times faster and more effective. Finally, a new law will force intrastate pipelines to use the best-known technology such as automatic shut-off valves.|$|E
5|$|MRO has two {{rechargeable}} nickel-hydrogen batteries used {{to power}} the spacecraft {{when it is not}} facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50ampere-hours (180kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the operators to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain {{is one of the most}} common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries' capacities <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> during the lifetime of the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write {{the data from the}} host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

5|$|Eris's orbit {{is highly}} eccentric, and brings Eris to within 37.9AU of the Sun, a typical {{perihelion}} for scattered objects. This {{is within the}} orbit of Pluto, but still safe from direct interaction with Neptune (29.8–30.4AU). Pluto, on the other hand, like other plutinos, follows a less inclined and less eccentric orbit and, protected by orbital resonance, can cross Neptune's orbit. It is possible that Eris is in a 17:5resonance with Neptune, though further observations <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to check that hypothesis. Unlike the eight planets, whose orbits all lie roughly in the same plane as the Earth's, Eris's orbit is highly inclined: It is tilted at an angle of about 44degrees to the ecliptic. In about 800years, Eris will {{be closer to the}} Sun than Pluto for some time (see the graph at the right).|$|E
5|$|For comparison, Euclid's {{original}} subtraction-based algorithm {{can be much}} slower. A single integer {{division is}} equivalent to the quotient q number of subtractions. If the ratio of a and b is very large, the quotient is large and many subtractions <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required.</b> On the other hand, {{it has been shown that}} the quotients are very likely to be small integers. The probability of a given quotient q is approximately ln|u/(u−1)| where u=(q+1)2. For illustration, the probability of a quotient of 1, 2, 3, or 4 is roughly 41.5%, 17.0%, 9.3%, and 5.9%, respectively. Since the operation of subtraction is faster than division, particularly for large numbers, the subtraction-based Euclid's algorithm is competitive with the division-based version. This is exploited in the binary version of Euclid's algorithm.|$|E

5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, {{which would make it}} a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to verify its dynamic status.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time {{it would be so}} close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners {{have the option to}} choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E

5|$|In March 2016, the ICAO adopted several {{amendments}} to the Chicago Convention to address issues raised by Flight 370's disappearance. For aircraft manufactured after 2020, cockpit voice recorders <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to record at least 25 hours of data, so that they record all phases of a flight. Aircraft designs approved after 2020 will {{need to have a}} means to recover the flight recorders, or the information they contain, before the recorders sink below water. This provision is performance-based {{so that it can be}} accomplished by different techniques, such as streaming flight recorder data from aircraft in distress or using flight recorders which eject from aircraft and float on the water's surface. The new regulations will not require modifications to existing aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> to manage the effects of an ashfall, but there will not be service interruptions.|$|E
