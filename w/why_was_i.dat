2500|$|The second {{adaptation}} was in 1983, when Blake scholar Joseph Viscomi adapted {{it into a}} one-act musical {{under the}} title An Island in the Moon: A Satire by William Blake, 1784. The piece was staged in the Goldwin Smith Hall on Cornell University's Central Campus {{as part of the}} Cornell Blake Symposium, Blake: Ancient and Modern. Viscomi wrote the adaptation himself, which included musical versions of [...] "The Garden of Love" [...] from Songs of Innocence and of Experience (1794) and [...] "O <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> born with a different face", a poem from a letter written by Blake to Thomas Butts in 1803. Original music was composed by Margaret LaFrance. Department of Theatre lecturers Evamarii Johnson and Robert Gross directed and produced, respectively. Viscomi consolidated all of the events of the piece into a single night in a tavern (owned by Tilly Lally, who also doubled as the narrator), and reduced the cast from fifteen to fourteen by removing Mrs Nannicantipot. Viscomi also moved the last section to earlier in the play, and thus the play ends with the various songs from Chapter 11 which would appear in Songs of Innocence.|$|E
