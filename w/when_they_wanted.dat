25|$|Don't You Want Me is a Eurodance song {{performed}} by Swedish band Alcazar and released internationally in 2002.

25|$|In 1934, 68 Romani, {{most of them}} Norwegian citizens, {{were denied}} entry into Norway, and they were also denied transit through Sweden and Denmark <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to leave Germany.

There are occasions when girls like Bathsheba will {{put up with a}} great deal of unconventional behaviour. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be praised, which is often, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be mastered, which is sometimes; and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> no nonsense, which is seldom. Just now the first feeling was in the ascendant with Bathsheba, with a dash of the second. Moreover, by chance or by devilry, the ministrant was antecedently made interesting by being a handsome stranger who had evidently seen better days.|$|R

25|$|A {{study on}} {{examining}} sexual messages in popular TV shows found that 2 out of 3 programs contained sexually related actions. 1 out of 15 shows included scenes {{of sexual intercourse}} itself. Shows featured a variety of sexual messages, including characters talking about <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to have sex {{and how to use}} sex to keep a relationship alive. Some researchers believe that adolescents can use these messages as well as the sexual actions they see on TV in their own sexual lives.|$|E
25|$|Tension existed {{within the}} Cuban revolutionary {{committee}} between Martí and his military compatriots. Martí feared a military dictatorship would {{be established in}} Cuba upon independence, and suspected Dominican-born General Máximo Gómez of having these intentions. Martí knew that the independence of Cuba needed time and careful planning. Ultimately, Martí refused to cooperate with Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo Grajales, two Cuban military leaders from the Ten Years' War, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to invade immediately in 1884. Martí {{knew that it was}} too early to attempt to win back Cuba, and later events proved him right.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{society was}} based on a matrilineal system, meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived {{together}} with other women and their children apart from the men. Because of this Taíno women seem to {{have had a lot of}} control over their lives, their co-villagers and their bodies. Since they lived separately from men, they were able to decide <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to involve in sexual contact. This is in part what shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with Taíno culture. They reportedly perceived women as “macho women” who had strong control over the men.|$|E

25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not.

25|$|TLATA {{came into}} force on 1 January 1997 {{and was a}} result of a {{recognised}} need for reform in the part of the Law of Property Act 1925 which dealt with trusts. Some problems included {{the fact that it was}} hard to establish a trust without it coming under the auspices of the Settled Land Act 1925, which brought with it a range of problems. In particular, the co-owners of property were regarded as having beneficial interests in money and not in the land. Problems arose where partners disagreed over <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to sell a property – usually in the case of separation, and this led to situations where spouses and children might find themselves homeless.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year King John III of Portugal ordered a search to be instituted for {{the tomb of}} the Apostle St. Thomas. As long as the tomb, with the counterpart of the Ortona relics, was looked for, nothing was found; however when the search was given up, both were accidentally discovered. The royal commission found traces of the old Nestorian chapel, but nothing of the tomb. But while directing operations to build an oratory commemorative of the spot, and digging deeply in the sandy soil to lay its foundations, it found in 1522 a masonry tomb, containing what might have been expected {{to be found in the}} Apostle's tomb: some bones of snowy whiteness, the head of a lance, a pilgrim's staff and an earthen vase. The find brought ruined Betumah into popularity with the Portuguese, who settled here in large numbers and called the new European town São Tomé (after St. Thomas) and São Tomé de Meliapor, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to distinguish it from São Tomé the West African island, though the town was somewhat distant from Mylapur.|$|E

25|$|There were {{generally}} two approaches to metering losses. The first was attritional - operations {{were conducted to}} inflict maximum losses on ARVN/US forces. This meant expending lives and resources in attacks (ambushes, raids etc.) or in defensive operations (digging in to fight, bleeding opponents and then withdrawing when enemy forces grew too strong). Attacks were scaled up or down depending on a myriad of factors including the political situation in a particular area. The second approach was avoidance of battle unless numerical superiority and chances of success were good. In the Vietnam War, most Communist units (including mobile NVA regulars using guerrilla tactics) spent {{only a limited number}} of days a year fighting. While they might be forced into an unwanted battle by an ARVN/US action, most of the time was spent in population control, training, intelligence gathering, propaganda indoctrination or construction of fortifications, with Communist troops typically only fighting an average of 1 day in 30. In essence, the VC/NVA largely fought on the ground only <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to fight.|$|E
25|$|Robinson's father {{founded the}} {{successful}} Home Brewery in Daybrook, Arnold in 1875, later acquired Worksop Manor and was knighted in 1905; Sandford Robinson {{was sent to}} Harrow School {{and then he went}} to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper, but neither at school nor at university did he make much impression: at Harrow he did not play in the grand set-piece cricket matches against the other major public schools, though he did appear in a 12-a-side match with the MCC in 1886. At Cambridge, he played in two trial games but was given only one chance in the first team: a match against the Gentlemen of England in which he opened the batting, scored 7 and 1, and took a catch in each innings. He did no better in a game for Nottinghamshire later in that season and in single matches in both 1889 and 1890 against Cambridge University – playing for an opposing team was a frequent ploy used by Cambridge <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to try a cricketer out, but in Robinson's case it led to no further first-team appearances.|$|E

500|$|Critics near universally {{took issue}} with the game's controls. Critics found that the webs that they shot did not go where they wanted them to go, and {{multiple}} reviewers described navigation as [...] "trial and error". Reviewers also found {{that they could not}} always jump <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to, and one reviewer found that power-ups failed to activate when she wanted them to. Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next, forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again.

500|$|SIR {{had become}} {{powerful}} enough for political maneuvering. In 1971 SIR members Jim Foster, Rick Stokes, and Advocate publisher David Goodstein formed the Alice B. Toklas Memorial Democratic Club, known as simply [...] "Alice". Alice befriended liberal politicians {{to persuade them}} to sponsor bills, proving successful in 1972 when Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon obtained Feinstein's support for an ordinance outlawing employment {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation. Alice chose Stokes to run for a relatively unimportant seat on the community college board. Though Stokes received 45,000votes, he was quiet, unassuming, and did not win. Foster, however, shot to national prominence by being the first openly gay man to address a political convention. His speech at the 1972 Democratic National Convention ensured that his voice, according to San Francisco politicians, was the one to be heard <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> the opinions, and especially the votes, of the gay community.|$|E

Lennon's [...] "Help!" [...] expressed his own feelings in 1965: [...] "I meant it... It was me singing 'help'". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his [...] "Fat Elvis" [...] period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change.
