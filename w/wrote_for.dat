40|$|Teaching and Learning Department Capstone ProjectThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to look at Kindergarten {{students}} and understand how they move from <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> themselves to <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience. Kindergarten students are still young children and have difficulty taking on the perspectives of others. For this reason, it is hard <b>for</b> them to <b>write</b> so that someone other than themselves can read their writing. However, during the Kindergarten year students experience a shift in perspectives that makes <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience possible. Students move from <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> themselves to <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience. This paper examines the journey that Kindergarteners go through as they move from <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> themselves to <b>writing</b> <b>for</b> an audience.
