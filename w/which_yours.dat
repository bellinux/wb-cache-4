You now heap coals of fire, as the phrase is, on my head--and I can scarcely bear it, for the pure crushing sense of your goodness. I was in truth, at the time of your other letter, deeply submerged--at once horribly bereft and very ill physically, but I was really almost as much touched by the kindness of <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> was a part as I was either. Only I was unable to do anything at the time in the way of recognition--at the time or for a long while afterwards; and when at last I did begin to emerge--after a very difficult year in America which came to an end only two months ago, my very indebtednesses were paralysing--my long silence required, to my sore sense, so much explanation. However, I have little by little explained--to some friends; though I think not to those I count as closest--for such, one feels, are the best comprehenders, without one's having to tell too much.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Your {{despatch}} {{of yesterday}} has been received, and it disappoints and distresses me. I have shown it to General McClellan, {{who says he}} will write you to-day. I am not competent to criticize your views, and therefore what I offer is in justification of myself. Of the two, I {{would rather have a}} point on the railroad south of Cumberland Gap than Nashville. First, because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's communication, which Nashville does not; and secondly, because it {{is in the midst of}} loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is not. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be a diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a movement toward Nashville is the main object. But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South. My despatch, to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> is an answer, was sent with the knowledge of Senator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they will be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them. They would despair, possibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or die with them. I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but merely, as intimated before, to show you the grounds of my anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|I get, habitually, the {{sympathetic}} infection, from Colvin, {{of so much}} general uneasiness and even alarm about you, that it is reassuring to find you apparently incommoded by nothing worse than the privation of liquor and tobacco. [...] "Nothing worse?" [...] I hear you echo, while you ask to what more refined savagery of torture I can imagine you subjected. You would rather perhaps--and small blame to you--perish by the sword than by famine. But you won't perish, my dear Louis, and I am {{here to tell you}} so. I should have perished--long ago--if it were mortal. No liquor--to speak of--passes my wasted lips, and yet they are capable of the hypocrisy of the sigh of resignation. I am very, very sorry for you--for I remember the genial tray which in the far-off, fabulous time used to be placed, as the evening waxed, under the social lamp at Skerryvore. The evenings wax at Vailima, but the tray, I gather, has waned. May this heavy trial be lightened, and, as you missionaries say, be even blessed to you. It wounds, I repeat, but it doesn't kill--more's the pity. The tobacco's another question. I have smoked a cigarette--at Skerryvore; and I shall probably smoke one again. But I don't look forward to it. However, you will think me objectionably destitute of temperament. What depresses me much more is the sad sense that you receive scarcely anything I send you. This, however, doesn't deter me from posting you to-day, registered, via San Francisco (it is post-day,) a volume of thin trifles lately put forth by me and entitled Essays in London and Elsewhere. It contains some pretty writing--not addressed to the fishes. My last letter to you, to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> of June 17th [was a reply]--the only dated one, dear Louis, I ever got from you!--was intended to accompany two other volumes of mine, which were despatched to you, registered, via San F., at the same moment (The Real Thing and The Private Life.) Yet neither of these works, evidently, had reached you when you ask me not to send you the former (though my letter mentioned that it had started,) as you had ordered it. It is all a mystery which the fishes only will have sounded. I also post to you herewith Paul Bourget's last little tale (Un Scruple,) as to which nothing will induce me to utter the faintest rudiments of an opinion. It is full of talent (I don't call that a rudiment,) but the French are passing strange. I am very glad to be able to send you herewith enclosed a petit mot from the said Paul Bourget, in response to your sense of outrage at his too-continuous silence.... His intentions, I can answer for it, had been the best; but he leads so migratory a life that I don't see how any intention can ever well fructify. He has spent the winter in the Holy Land and jumps thence in three weeks (from Beyrout) to his queer American expedition. A year ago--more--he earnestly asked me (at Siena) for your address. I as eagerly gave it to him--par écrit--but the acknowledgment that he was then full of the desire to make to you succumbed to complex frustrations. Now that, at last, here it is, I wish you {{to be able to read}} it! But you won't. My hand is the hand of Apollo to it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{have read}} you then, I need {{scarcely}} tell you, with an intensified {{sense of that}} life and force and temperament, that fulness of endowment and easy impudence of genius, which makes you extraordinary and which have long claimed my unstinted admiration: you being for me so much the most interesting and masterful prose-painter of your English generation (or indeed of your generation unqualified) that I see you hang there over the subject scene practically all alone; a far-flaring even though turbid and smoky lamp, projecting the most vivid and splendid golden splotches, creating them about the field--shining scattered innumerable morsels of a huge smashed mirror. I seem to feel {{that there can be}} no better proof of your great gift--The N.M. makes me most particularly feel it--than that you bedevil and coerce to the extent you do such a reader and victim as I am, I mean one so engaged on the side of ways and attempts to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> are extremely alien, and for whom the great interest of the art we practise involves a lot of considerations and preoccupations over which you more and more ride roughshod and triumphant--when you don't, that is, with a strange and brilliant impunity of your own, leave them to one side altogether (which is indeed what you now apparently incline most to do.) Your big feeling for life, your capacity for chewing up the thickness of the world in such enormous mouthfuls, while you fairly slobber, so to speak, with the multitudinous taste--this constitutes for me a rare and wonderful and admirable exhibition, on your part, in itself, so that one should doubtless frankly ask one's self what the devil, in the way of effect and evocation and general demonic activity, one wants more. Well, I am willing for to-day to let it stand at that; the whole of the earlier part of the book, or the first half, is so alive and kicking--and sprawling!--so vivid and rich and strong--above all so amusing (in the high sense of the word,) and I make remonstrance--for I do remonstrate--bear upon the bad service you have done your cause by riding so hard again that accurst autobiographic form which puts a premium on the loose, the improvised, the cheap and the easy. Save in the fantastic and the romantic (Copperfield, Jane Eyre, that charming thing of Stevenson's with the bad title--"Kidnapped"?) it has no authority, no persuasive or convincing force--its grasp of reality and truth isn't strong and disinterested. R. Crusoe, e.g., isn't a novel at all. There is, to my vision, no authentic, and no really interesting and no beautiful, report of things on the novelist's, the painter's part unless a particular detachment has operated, unless the great stewpot or crucible of the imagination, of the observant and recording and interpreting mind in short, has intervened and played its part--and this detachment, this chemical transmutation for the aesthetic, the representational, end is terribly wanting in autobiography brought, as the horrible phrase is, up to date. That's my main [...] "criticism" [...] on the N.M.--and on the whole ground there would be a hundred things more to say. It's accurst that I am not near enough to you to say them in less floundering fashion than this--but give me time (I return to England in June, never again, D.V., to leave it--surprise Mr. Remington thereby as I may!) and we will jaw as far as you will keep me company. Meanwhile I don't want to send across the wintry sea anything but my expressed gratitude for the immense impressionistic and speculative wealth and variety of your book.

6000|$|Alexander Pope {{went through}} doubt, contradiction, confusion, to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> are simple and light; and conquered. He {{was a man}} of like passions with yourselves; {{infected}} with the peculiar vices of his day; narrow, for his age was narrow; shallow, for his age was shallow; a bon-vivant, for his age was a gluttonous and drunken one; bitter, furious, and personal, for men round him were such; foul- mouthed often, and indecent, as the rest were. Nay, his very power, when he abuses it for his own ends of selfish spite and injured vanity, makes him, as all great men can be (in words at least, for in life he was far better than the men around him), worse than his age. He can out-rival Dennis in ferocity, and Congreve in filth. So much the worse for him in that account which he has long ago rendered up. But in all times and places, {{as far as we can}} judge, the man was heart-whole, more and not less righteous than his fellows. With his whole soul he hates what is evil, as far as he can recognise it. With his whole soul he loves what is good, as far as he can recognise that. With his soul believes that there is a righteous and good God, whose order no human folly or crime can destroy; and he will say so; and does say it, clearly, simply, valiantly, reverently, in his [...] "Essay on Man." [...] His theodicy is narrow; shallow, as was the philosophy of his age. But as far as it goes, it is sound--faithful to God, and to what he sees and knows. Man is made in God's image. Man's justice is God's justice; man's mercy is God's mercy; man's science, man's critic taste, are insights into the laws of God himself. He does not pretend to solve the great problem. But he believes that it is solved from all eternity; that God knows, God loves, and God rules; that the righteous and faithful man may know enough of the solution to know his duty, to see his way, to justify God; and as much as he knows he tells. There were in that diseased sensitive cripple no vain repinings, no moon-struck howls, no impious cries against God: [...] "Why hast thou made me thus?" [...] To him God is a righteous God, a God of order. Science, philosophy, politics, criticism, poetry, are parts of His order--they are parts of the appointed onward path for mankind; there are eternal laws for them. There is a beautiful and fit order, in poetry, which is part of God's order, which men have learnt ages ago, for they, too, had their teaching from above; to offend against which is absolutely wrong, an offence to be put down mildly in those who offend ignorantly; but those who offend from dulness, from the incapacity to see the beautiful, or from carelessness about it, when praise or gain tempts them the other way, have some moral defect in them; they are what Solomon calls fools: they are the enemies of man; and he will [...] "hate them right sore, even as though they were his own enemies"--which indeed they were. He knows by painful experience that they deserve no quarter; that there is no use giving them any; to spare them is to make them insolent; to fondle the reptile is to be bitten by it. True poetry, as the messenger of heavenly beauty, is decaying; true refinement, true loftiness of thought, even true morality, are at stake. And so he writes his [...] "Dunciad."
