5|$|By {{the late}} 3rd century, sewing, {{followed}} later by <b>weaving,</b> {{was introduced to}} Japan from Korea. Early textiles were made of simple twisted cords from wisteria, mulberry, hemp or ramie fibres. Following a gift of silk clothes and silk worms from the Chinese court, the Japanese court started to support textile and silk production from the 4th century onward. Chinese and Korean weavers were encouraged to exhibit their fabrics bringing new techniques such as those used to make brocades or delicate silk gauzes. In the 8th century Nara period, Japanese weavers employed {{a variety of techniques}} such as tie-dyeing, stenciling, batik, and embroidery. They skillfully imitated continental weaves, including rich damasks, many types of brocades and chiffon-like gauzes. Because of a general change in aesthetics in the Heian period <b>weaving</b> and dyeing techniques became less varied with less colourful brocades, smaller patterns, and less elaborate gauzes. The Japanese aristocracy preferred plain silks over woven or dyed designs.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes new {{algorithms}} for the computeraided {{design and}} manufacture (CAD/CAM) of 3 D <b>woven</b> multi-layer textile structures. Existing commercial CAD/CAM systems are often {{restricted to the}} design and manufacture of 2 D <b>weaves.</b> Those CAD/CAM systems that do support the design and manufacture of 3 D multi-layer <b>weaves</b> are often limited to manual editing of design paper grids on the computer display and <b>weave</b> retrieval from stored archives. This complex design activity is time-consuming, tedious and error-prone and requires considerable experience and skill of a technical weaver. Recent research {{reported in the literature}} has addressed some of the shortcomings of commercial 3 D multi-layer <b>weave</b> CAD/CAM systems. However, earlier research results have shown the need for further work on <b>weave</b> specification, <b>weave</b> generation, yarn path editing and layer binding. Analysis of 3 D multi-layer <b>weaves</b> in this research has led to the design and development of efficient and robust algorithms for the CAD/CAM of 3 D <b>woven</b> multi-layer textile structures.
