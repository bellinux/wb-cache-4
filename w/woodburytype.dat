50|$|The <b>Woodburytype</b> {{process was}} invented by Walter B. Woodbury and {{patented}} in 1864. It was the first successful photomechanical process fully able to reproduce the delicate halftones of photographs. It produced true middle values and did not make use of a screen or other image deconstruction method. It was often considered the most perfect, most beautiful photomechanical process and inspired a number of books, magazines, and special edition printings between 1864 and 1910. When {{attempts were made to}} adopt <b>Woodburytype</b> to rotary printing, the process could not compete with the quickly developing collotype and halftone photomechanical processes that almost completely replaced <b>Woodburytype</b> {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century.|$|E
50|$|Regardless of {{the fact}} that many {{historical}} findings speak to Joseph Swan’s priority of original ideas of the photorelief process introduced under the name photo-mezzotint, it was Woodbury who advanced his research ideas into a fully workable and practical method of photomechanical printing of continuous-tone photographs. Woodbury’s patents in England, France, Belgium, and the United States, as well as production of several <b>Woodburytype</b> process printing establishments in England, France, and the US, were responsible for the printing {{of hundreds of thousands of}} <b>Woodburytype</b> photographs that provided book and magazine illustrations, short-run advertisement material,and promotional material. A number of <b>Woodburytype</b> images were also printed for sale as individual images or as cartes-de-visite (CDV) or cabinet cards (CC).|$|E

50|$|A <b>Woodburytype</b> {{is both a}} {{printing}} process and the print that it produces. In technical terms, the process is a photomechanical rather than a photographic one, because sensitivity to light plays {{no role in the}} actual printing. The process produces very high quality continuous tone images in monochrome, with surfaces that show a slight relief effect. Essentially, a <b>Woodburytype</b> is a molded copy of an original photographic carbon print.|$|E

50|$|It is {{therefore}} not overly remarkable that {{some or all of}} the credit for the invention of “photorelief printing” was claimed by, or on behalf of, more than one inventor when the <b>Woodburytype</b> process was current, or that the matter can still generate heated debate among those inventors' present-day admirers.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>Woodburytype</b> prints {{are easy to}} identify because the process was clearly described in print in books and on many prints sold commercially. Those that are described as “permanent prints” or not described at all, however, {{can be difficult to}} identify correctly even when using highly sophisticated analytical methods.|$|E

50|$|Like many {{practical}} inventions, the <b>Woodburytype</b> {{process was}} built on, or had features in common with, other inventions and discoveries. It utilized the photosensitivity of dichromated gelatin, discovered in 1852 by Henry Fox Talbot, who was thereby building on Mungo Ponton's 1839 contribution of potassium dichromate {{to the list}} of known sensitizing agents for making photographs on paper. The photochemical formation of the gelatin relief dates back to the first carbon printing patent of Alphonse Poitevin (1855). The idea of washing unhardened gelatin from the lower part of an exposed gelatin layer {{can be found in the}} early experiments of Adolphe Fargier (1861) and in the development of Joseph Swan’s fully practical carbon-transfer process (1864). Alois Auer, in his 1853 book on nature printing, describes making printing plates by forcibly impressing soft low-relief objects, such as leaves, into sheets of lead. The ancient Egyptians made molds and used them to mass-produce small ceramic goods.|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{printing}} {{technologies in}} the late 19 th century {{led to the development}} of half-toning techniques enabling the economical reproduction of photographic images in print. Whilst undoubtedly successful in low cost high volume image reproduction, half-toning representations are less faithful in detail when compared to continuous tone photomechanical methods in use at that time. This thesis asks the question: can the creative application of 21 st century digital fabrication technologies enable the qualities of continuous tone imaging to be regained? In the 21 st-century, printmaking may be seen as the interchange of ideas, experimental practice and interdisciplinary thinking. Printmaking has always been a means of combining modern technology and methods with existing traditional and commercial imaging processes. Technological advancement in print however does not always provide a finer quality of print. Qualities often attributed to pre-digital continuous tone printing can be lost in the transition to a digital half tone print workflow. This research project examines a near obsolete 19 th century print process, the continuous tone <b>Woodburytype,</b> developed to address the issue of permanence in photography. Through a methodological approach analyses of the <b>Woodburytype</b> an empirical reconstruction of the process provides a comprehensive critique of its method. The Woodburytype’s surface qualities are not found in other photomechanical printing methods capable of rendering finely detailed photographic images. Its method of image translation results in the printed tonal range being directly proportional to the deposition thickness of the printing ink, however it never successfully developed into a colour process. By examining and evaluating digital imaging technology this study identifies, current computer aided design and manufacturing techniques and extends upon known models of <b>Woodburytype</b> printing through the development of this deposition height quality enabling a new digital polychromatic colour printing process...|$|E
40|$|In {{a digital}} age where artists and {{printers}} {{are required to}} learn {{a wide range of}} skills, from graphic design to colour science, is it possible to return to a more artistic application of colour, tone and texture with a mechanically printed image using CAD software? The reproduction of digitally generated works is divided between the on screen (RGB) representation of colour and a colorimetric translation through an imaging pipeline to a printing device (CMYK). The developers’ goal of inkjet hardware and software is to match printed colour and texture {{as close as possible to}} its on screen representation. The texture in this case is a simulation though contrast, tone and through the illusional properties of halftoning. So far inkjet has not fully addressed the three dimensional rendering of texture. As touch-screen devices develop and evolve to replicate the creative methods of the artist, can an on screen difference in appearance between a thickly applied paint or watercolour, be replicated in the same way through the printing hardware? Drawing tablets have made digital input devices closer to how an artist would intuitively generate the image, so now is it the turn of the digital printer to bring the prints closer to how artists would apply the colour? My research and practice explores tonal image creation through texture via a variety of digital output devices that are not solely restricted to digital print machines. By looking at 19 th century photomechanical methods of low relief continuous tone images, primarily focusing on the <b>Woodburytype.</b> The <b>Woodburytype</b> process translates a two-dimensional tonal gradation present in the image to a three dimensional model in gelatine. The <b>Woodburytype</b> photomechanical print is the only continuous tone print process ever invented. The research moves into the 21 st century investigating alternative methods that incorporates vector based software and 3 D printing. The surface relief contained within the image is created through the varying density of pigmented gelatin which is used as a vehicle to transfer the image on to paper. However the <b>Woodburytype</b> and variations of the process have been achieved so far as single colour prints. Limitations with their technical process and materials available in the 19 th Century meant that the processes were never finalised. Within the context of 21 st Century technologies this research proposes to digitally explore the generation of print matrices through CNC and additive layer manufacturing (3 D printing) and the exploration of alternative materials that emulate 19 th Century pigmented gelatins but will assist in the introduction of two or more colours to create a more robust surface relief whilst retaining the photographic image qualities. By exploring, adapting and modifying current technology and methodologies the research and practice will provide the opportunity for developing closer links and crossovers between the industrial printer and the artistic printmaker. It intends to explore and create controlled mechanical output of images through an investigation of the practitioner application of colour...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{contemporary}} method of continuous tone colour printing {{based upon the}} Nineteenth Century printing process of <b>Woodburytype</b> as developed by Walter Bentley Woodbury in 1865. <b>Woodburytype</b> was the only truly continuous tone printing process yet invented, and died out {{in the late nineteenth}} century as more expedient and cost effective methods of printing prevailed, thus laying the path for current CMYK print technologies. Digital print itself, since its development as a range of colour printing technologies, has followed a route based on the half-tone dot and four colour separation predicated around CMYK. In recent years stochastic algorithms and dithering have allowed the lay down of multiple passes and colour sets to create a near continuous tone image. The downside of this approach is that in order to create a full colour subtractive image, the resultant prints have very little surface topography and a mechanical uniformity that demonstrates none of the surface characteristics, tactile qualities and rich tonal warmth of the 19 th century photo-mechanical processes. Current research at the Centre for Fine Print Research (CFPR) at the University of the West of England, Bristol, is exploring the potential of CNC milled imagery, where the tonal range of each colour is assigned a physical height to produce a continuous tone topographic relief printing matrix, from which the colour image is cast in a silicone ink. A translucent image is cast from each of the colour matrices and each colour is assembled one on top of another resulting in a true four colour separation continuous tone print, where colour tone is created by physical depth of colour...|$|E
40|$|Whilst {{the primary}} focus for the {{creation}} and preservation of digitally based artwork in hardcopy has relied in recent years on the gradual refinement of digital printing devices, reference points for their development often appear to follow a strictly linear route. To broaden the current possibilities for permanent, accurate digital hardcopy, Thirkell and the Centre for Fine Print Research has been engaged in the re-assessment of some early photomechanical printing processes which were eclipsed by the mainstream printing approaches long {{before the advent of}} the digital era. Thirkell's paper drew on a three-part methodology surveying printing techniques through historical and current literature, examining actual printed examples and testing findings through practice. The paper re-evaluated the high resolution and archival qualities of three unique 19 th century printing processes in the context of current digital practice. Although in mainstream terms such techniques have become redundant, this re-assessment identified and demonstrated valuable principles such as lightfast ink qualities and continuous tone image rendering which has once again renewed currency in the rapidly expanding field of museum quality digital imaging and printing.
