5|$|When the Anteaters {{defeated}} the Washington Huskies men's basketball team on November 14, 2013, N'Diaye recorded a season-high 18 points. He also added 8 rebounds and 9 blocks. The game was also his first {{experience in the}} 2K Sports Classic. His blocked shots total broke the school's single-game record under the category. He recorded his first career double-double with Irvine on December 28, 2013 against Arizona State, with 12 points, 4 blocks, and a career-high 12 rebounds. In January, in a game at rival Long Beach State, coach Dan Monson told reporters that he believed his team was still afraid to attack the paint even when N'Diaye <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench. In early February, N'Diaye broke the school's single-game block record {{for the second time}} in the season, totaling with 11 blocked shots and 10 rebounds against Long Beach State. N'Diaye also broke the conference's all-time record. It was his first career game in which he recorded a double-double without scoring over ten points.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his ulnar nerve and three tendons. He <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E

5|$|Young {{started the}} season in the second spot in the Padres {{rotation}} between ace Peavy and Maddux. He pitched his first three turns from the second spot in the rotation. On April 18, he missed his turn and Maddux moved into the second spot in the rotation. Young has since been pitching in the third spot in the rotation. The number three spot in the rotation {{is the only one}} that was not scheduled to start during the Padres visit to Wrigley Field May 12–15, 2008. Young, thus, did not make a start against the Cubs with whom he had an altercation in 2007. On May 21, 2008 in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals, Young was hit in the face by a line-drive from Albert Pujols. Young <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground for several minutes but was able to leave the field under his own power as he only sustained a nasal fracture and a laceration on his nose. Later in the same inning, Pujols would also sprain the ankle of Padres catcher Josh Bard while sliding into home plate. Young returned to the mound on July 29 with five shutout innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Young then did not pitch between August 10 and September 1 due to another disabled list stint and returned to the lineup to take the loss in a game where Greg Maddux, who had become a Los Angeles Dodger, earned his 354th victory to tie Roger Clemens for eighth on the all-time list.|$|E

25|$|In , {{the rivalry}} hit {{an all-time high}} when Darcy Tucker {{attacked}} the Senators' Chris Neil, who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench. This resulted in numerous players exchanging punches before order was restored. Tucker, Neil and Shane Hnidy all received fighting majors and game misconducts for the same incident. After the game, Tucker claimed Neil spit on him, an allegation which Neil denied. The NHL board looked into this claim and concluded that Tucker's allegation was false. Tempers remained frayed, especially with 1:23 to play, when Toronto's Tie Domi went after Magnus Arvedson and threw several punches at Arvedson. Video evidence showed Arvedson spearing Domi just prior, awaiting the faceoff. Domi received a roughing minor, instigator minor, fighting major, misconduct and game misconduct. Arvedson {{did not get a}} penalty on the play. Suspensions were announced a few hours after Tucker and Domi appeared at NHL head offices in Toronto for a hearing. Tucker was suspended for five games, without pay, after it was determined that Neil did not spit at Toronto's bench. Domi was suspended for three games, also without pay. A total of 163 minutes in penalties were called in the game.|$|E
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants underneath his skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2008, Life.ru {{reported}} that several Russian peacekeepers {{were buried in}} Vladikavkaz. Among them was 32-year-old lieutenant colonel Oleg Golovanov, native of Tskhinvali, who fought against the Georgian army for several hours. MK published an article where one senior officer of the mortar battery is documented as saying that Oleg Golovanov was the commander of an artillery reconnaissance platoon and <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof of the peacekeepers' base and corrected fire. Golovanov was wounded. He died on Friday (8 August 2008). According to MK, Oleg Golovanov was buried in Tskhinvali on 11 August 2008. REGNUM News Agency published the list of killed Russian peacekeepers on 12 August 2008, where lieutenant colonel Oleg Golovanov is included. In the August 2008 issue of Spetsnaz Rossii Oleg Golovanov was described as lieutenant colonel who commanded one group of Russian peacekeepers resisting the Georgian advance. This group fought against the Georgian army for several hours. In November 2008 OsRadio {{reported that}} on 7 August Lieutenant Oleg Galavanov was following orders to detect the targets and adjust artillery fire. Galavanov was adjusting fire aimed at advancing Georgian army during the night until the Georgians located his position and he was wounded. He was awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation. In February 2009, Galavanov's mother {{said in an interview}} that her 32-year old son worked in the intelligence service in the South Ossetian Ministry of Defense and had the rank of lieutenant. In March 2009, Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that on the morning of 8 August 2008, at around 6:00 AM tank shell hit the observer post and wounded lieutenant Oleg Galavanov. Galavanov had returned from Russia to Tskhinvali in 2007 and worked in the Ministry of Defense and Emergency Situations of South Ossetia. He served as artillery spotter.

500|$|Seinfeld regular John O'Hurley had {{auditioned for}} several roles {{on the show}} but Carter had not {{previously}} {{thought of him as}} [...] "an X-Files actor".

Stewart Gale, who played Izzy Berkowitz, was a non-actor who <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of a truck when Carter passed. Carter convinced Gale's father—who was initially suspicious of the director's credentials—to let Gale travel to Vancouver {{to take part in the}} episode.

A {{founding member of the}} Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright's credits include Freeway, Ted Bundy, and Tiptoes. Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, [...] "I didn't have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn't know what I was doing. I needed reining in." [...] During filming, Bright <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital.
