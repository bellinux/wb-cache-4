500|$|Disagreements {{about the}} {{ownership}} of the story ultimately led Moore to sever ties with DC Comics. Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement, Moore and Gibbons had a reversion clause in their contract for Watchmen. Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic-Con, Moore said: [...] "The <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>works,</b> if I understand it, is that DC owns it for the time they're publishing it, and then it reverts to Dave and me, so we {{can make all the}} money from the Slurpee cups." [...] For Watchmen, Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series' earnings. Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when [...] "DC have not used the characters for a year, they're ours." [...] Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them [...] "a substantial amount of money" [...] to retain the rights. Moore added, [...] "So basically they're not ours, but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be. On the other hand, if the characters have outlived their natural life span and DC doesn't want to do anything with them, then after a year we've got them and we can do what we want with them, which I'm perfectly happy with." ...|$|E

The author of the report, Robert Perkins, said [...] "Errors occur with this type of shell, it is fundamental to the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>works,</b> but there is no margin for error in Gaza because you will hit markets, houses, and civilians, and that is what happened".|$|E

[...] The song opens with rattling tablas and stuttering guitars. In the lyrics, Jackson again sings {{from the point}} of view of [...] "Damita Jo", in [...] "intermittent vocal bubbles" [...] to discuss the pleasures she intends to provide. Jackson states [...] "Relax, it's just sex", at the song's closing. The fourth track, [...] "Strawberry Bounce", depicts Jackson method acting a sensual display as alter ego [...] "Strawberry." [...] Characterizing herself as a one-woman gentleman's club, Jackson asks her partner to [...] "Let me be your playground." [...] The song morphs a sample of Jay-Z's vocals into its instrumentation of chimes, snapping rhythms, and synthesizers. Fusing new-school hip-hop with pop, Jackson sings [...] "watch the way I pump it, the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> is gonna keep you comin'", in a feverish pant. Jackson's looped chorus hook, and the song's [...] "tasty" [...] beat, were described to compose an [...] "insanely catchy number", which merits repeats and [...] "begs to be remixed, flipped, and stripped." ...|$|E

60|$|No {{description}} of London {{would be complete}} without a reference, however brief, to the singular salubrity and charm of the London climate. This is seen at its best during the autumn and winter months. The climate of London and indeed of England generally is due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. The <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> is thus: The Gulf Stream, as it nears the shores of the British Isles and feels the propinquity of Ireland, rises into the air, turns into soup, and comes down on London. At times the soup is thin and is in fact little more than a mist: at other times it has the consistency of a thick Potage St. Germain. London people are a little sensitive on the point and flatter their atmosphere by calling it a fog: but it is not: it is soup. The notion that no sunlight ever gets through and that in the London winter people never see the sun is of course a ridiculous error, circulated no doubt by the jealousy of foreign nations. I have myself seen the sun plainly visible in London, without the aid of glasses, on a November day in broad daylight; and again one night about four o'clock in the afternoon I saw the sun distinctly appear through the clouds. The whole subject of daylight in the London winter is, however, one which belongs rather to the technique of astronomy than to a book of description. In practice daylight is but little used. Electric lights are burned all the time in all houses, buildings, railway stations and clubs. This practice which is now universally observed is called Daylight Saving.|$|E

A literature review reveals some gaps between the English and Japanese literature.

She also identifies a future research question: might Toyota’s domestic success have arisen partly because its competitors did not understand the <b>way</b> <b>it</b> <b>worked?...</b>|$|R
