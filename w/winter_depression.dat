50|$|SAD {{is a type}} {{of major}} {{depressive}} disorder, and sufferers may exhibit any of the associated symptoms, such as feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, thoughts of suicide, loss of interest in activities, withdrawal from social interaction, sleep and appetite problems, difficulty with concentration and decisions, decreased sex drive, a lack of energy, or agitation. Symptoms of winter SAD often include oversleeping or difficulty waking up in the morning, nausea, and a tendency to over eat, often with a craving for carbohydrates, which leads to weight gain. SAD is typically associated with <b>winter</b> <b>depression,</b> but springtime lethargy or other seasonal mood patterns are not uncommon. Although each individual case is different, in contrast to winter SAD, people who experience spring and summer depression {{may be more likely to}} show symptoms such as insomnia, decreased appetite and weight loss, and agitation or anxiety.|$|E
5000|$|Associated with a {{connection}} to mood disorders, NPAS2 {{has been found to}} be involved with dopamine degradation. This was first suggested by the observation that the clock components BMAL1 and NPAS2 transcriptionally activated a luciferase reporter driven by the murine monoamine oxidase A (Maoa) promoter in a circadian fashion. This suggested that these two clock components (BMAL1 and NPAS2) directly regulated Maoa transcription. [...] Subsequent findings discovered positive transcriptional regulation of BMAL1/NPAS2 by PER2. In mice lacking PER2, both Maoa mRNA and MAOA protein levels were decreased. Therefore, dopamine degradation was reduced, and dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens were increased. These findings indicate that degradation of monoamines is regulated by the circadian clock. It is very likely that the described clock-mediated regulation of monoamines is relevant for humans, because single-nucleotide polymorphisms in Per2, Bmal1, and Npas2 are associated in an additive fashion with seasonal affective disorder or <b>winter</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E
50|$|The light-dark {{cycle is}} the most {{important}} environmental time cue for entraining circadian rhythms of most species, including humans, and bright artificial light exposure has been developed as a method to improve circadian adaptation in night workers. The timing of bright light exposure is critical for its phase shifting effects. To maximize a delay of the body clock, bright light exposure should occur in the evening or first part of the night, and bright light should be avoided in the morning. Wearing dark goggles (avoiding bright light) or blue-blocking goggles during the morning commute home from work can improve circadian adaptation. For workers who want to use bright light therapy, appropriate fixtures of the type used to treat <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> are readily available but patients need to be educated regarding their appropriate use, especially the issue of timing. Bright light treatment is not recommended for patients with light sensitivity or ocular disease.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of {{some aspects of the}} nutritive value of ryegrasses with {{particular}} emphasis on the relationship between the chemical composition of the pasture and {{the quantity and quality of}} milk produced by grazing dairy cattle. The fat content of the milk from Friesian cattle was shown to be depressed when grazing an annual variety of ryegrass during the <b>winter.</b> <b>Depressions</b> in the solids-not-fat content of the milk, on the other hand, were associated with the grazing of Ruanui perennial ryegrass in experiments carried out in the winter and in the spring. The mechanisms involved in producing these differences in milk composition were investigated in a series of experiments in which various supplements were given to animals consuming pasture. Carbohydrate, protein, and lipid supplements were given to: lactating cows to measure effects on milk production, cattle and sheep with rumen fistulea to measure end-products of rumen fermentation, and dry sheep in metabolism crates to study the digestibility of pasture components. It was concluded that the nature or levels of the carbohydrate, protein and lipid fractions of pasture may all influence milk composition and that optimum plant composition is likely to vary according to the type of milk product that is required to be produced...|$|R

50|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>depression</b> is {{a common}} slump in the mood of some {{inhabitants}} {{of most of the}} Nordic countries. It was first described by the 6th century Goth scholar Jordanes in his Getica wherein he described the inhabitants of Scandza (Scandinavia). Iceland, however, seems to be an exception. A study of more than 2000 people there found the prevalence of seasonal affective disorder and seasonal changes in anxiety and depression to be unexpectedly low in both sexes. The study's authors suggested that propensity for SAD may differ due to some genetic factor within the Icelandic population. A study of Canadians of wholly Icelandic descent also showed low levels of SAD. It has more recently been suggested that this may be attributed to the large amount of fish traditionally eaten by Icelandic people, in 2007 about 90 kilograms per person per year as opposed to about 24 kg in the US and Canada, rather than to genetic predisposition; a similar anomaly is noted in Japan, where annual fish consumption in recent years averages about 60 kg per capita.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the unexpectedly low preva-lence of <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> in Iceland is explained by Icelanders enjo-ying more daylight, during the winter months, than allocated to them by latitude. Methods. A conventional photometer was applied to measure illumi-nance on a horizontal surface at 64 ° 8. 8 ’ N and 21 ° 55. 8 ’ W every min-ute throughout the year. The illuminance thus measured was compared with computed illuminance, based on theoretical upper bounds. Results. Daylight availability proved to be, on average, 60 % of the theoretical upper bounds derived using clear sky conditions. Snow cover did not, on average, cause a significant increase in daylight availability. Great variability was observed in illuminance from day to day, as well as within days. Conclusions. Average daylight availability does not explain the lower than expected prevalence of <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> in Iceland. The great variability in illuminance might, however, affect the expression of <b>winter</b> <b>depression,</b> as could daylight quality and genetic factors.

40|$|Some people {{experience}} a serious mood change when the seasons change. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a mood disorder. The term 'winter depression' describes {{a form of}} SAD that occurs in the winter months: people who have normal mental health {{throughout most of the}} year experience depressive symptoms in the winter year after year. One of the major theories for explaining SAD involves the circadian rhythms of the body. Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein- 1 BMAL 1 is a transcription factor playing {{a central role in the}} regulation of circadian rhythms. Mutations in or deletions of a single circadian clock gene cause alterations to the circadian rhythms. Polymorphisms of circadian clock genes Per 2, BMAL 1, and Npas 2 contribute to <b>winter</b> <b>depression.</b> Several polymorphisms of BMAL 1 can be selected to determine their influence on <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> sensitivity. Single-nucleotide polymorphism rs 2290035 in the BMAL 1 gene may regulate the circadian activities of BMAL 1. Because of these alterations in the circadian rhythms, it has a direct influence on patients mood and can influence the person's sensitivity to <b>winter</b> <b>depression.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> of {{photosynthesis}} in {{leaves of}} Cryptomeria japonica was studied {{in relation to}} the diffusive resistance to CO_ 2 transfer, and the influence of soil temperature on the depression was examined. (1) The light intensity curves suggest the interference with both the photochemical process and the biochemical process of photosynthesis in winter. (2) The <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> of photosynthesis is mainly due to the inhibition of stomatal openings and the low permeability of leaf cuticule to CO_ 2 (an increase of leaf resistance) as well as the depression of CO_ 2 transport in mesophyll (an increase of mesophyll resistance). (3) The low soil temperature in winter is fairly concerned with the increases of leaf resistance and mesophyll resistance and the changes in water relation of leaves. The <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> of photosynthesis seems to have close contacts with the low soil temperature through its effect on some physiological processes such as water balance and translocation in trees. 冬季におけるスギ葉の光合成低下をGAASTRAやMILTHORPEの理論にしたがって, 葉の外囲からクロロプラストまでのCO_ 2 輸送過程に働くCO_ 2 拡散抵抗の面でしらべた。また, 冬季の光合成低下と生育地温とのかかわりあいについてしらべた。(1) 光合成-光強度曲線より, 冬季では, 光合成の生化学的過程と同時に光化学的過程の著しい阻害が推定される。(2) 冬季では, 気孔開度の減少や表皮細胞の解剖学的性質の変化(気孔抵抗, 表皮抵抗の増大) により, CO_ 2 が葉の外囲から葉内にはいりにくくなっていることが, 葉肉細胞におけるCO_ 2 輸送の低下(葉肉抵抗の増大) とならんで, 葉の光合成低下に大きく関与している。(3) 生育地温は, 気孔抵抗と葉肉抵抗の両方に影響し, 葉の光合成と深くかかわる。また, 葉の水分特性にも影響を与える。生育地温は, 樹体内水収支や葉からの転流などの樹木生理への影響を通して, 冬季の光合成低下に密接に関係すると考えた...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to {{investigate}} the pituitary volume in patients with seasonal <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> and healthy volunteers in winter and summer, and to assess the effects of phototherapy in these patients. METHOD: The pituitary volume of 12 patients with <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> and 12 healthy controls, paired according gender, age and menstrual cycle, were obtained from magnetic resonance imaging in winter and summer. Eight patients were submitted to phototherapy (10000 vs. 2500 lux) in a double-blind crossover fashion during the winter, and reassessed (symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging) after treatment. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} in pituitary volume between controls and patients in winter or summer. Exposure to phototherapy (10000 lux) decreased the depressive symptoms (p = 0. 004), but the glandular volume did not change (p = 0. 5). However, the pituitary volume in winter showed a positive correlation with the severity of depression in these patients (r = 0. 69, p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that neither <b>winter</b> <b>depression</b> nor the change of seasons is associated with significant change in the pituitary volume.
