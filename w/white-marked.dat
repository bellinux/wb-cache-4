5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the <b>white-marked</b> tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly have also made their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E
6000|$|The {{two species}} figured, though {{belonging}} to such distinct and even remote genera, have acquired almost identical tints and markings {{so as to}} be deceptively alike. The surface of the wings is, in both, transparent yellowish, with black transverse bands and white marginal spots, while both have similar black-and <b>white-marked</b> bodies and long yellow antennae. Dr. Müller states that they both show a preference for the same flowers growing on the edges of the forest paths.[105] ...|$|E
60|$|So {{many cases}} are adduced {{from so many}} {{different}} islands, both in the eastern and western hemisphere, {{that it is impossible}} to doubt the existence of some common cause; and it seems probable to me now, after a fuller consideration of the whole subject of colour, that here too we have one of the almost innumerable results of the principle of protective coloration. White is, as a rule, an uncommon colour in animals, but probably only because it is so conspicuous. Whenever it becomes protective, as in the case of arctic animals and aquatic birds, it appears freely enough; while we know that white varieties of many species occur occasionally in the wild state, and that, under domestication, white or parti-coloured breeds are freely produced. Now in all the islands in which exceptionally <b>white-marked</b> birds and butterflies have been observed, we find two features which would tend to render the conspicuous white markings less injurious--a luxuriant tropical vegetation, and a decided scarcity of rapacious mammals and birds. White colours, therefore, would not be eliminated by natural selection; but variations in this direction would bear their part in producing the recognition marks which are everywhere essential, and which, in these islands, need not be so small or so inconspicuous as elsewhere.|$|E

5000|$|In dogs, roan {{manifests itself}} only in unpigmented areas, the {{presence}} and shape of which are determined by other genes. This is {{in stark contrast to}} true roan horses and roan cattle, which are roan only in pigmented regions of their coat and may have white markings. Instead, dogs with roaning or ticking are born with clear, open white markings which begin to fill in with flecking in the subsequent weeks and continue to darken with age. Most breed standards use the terms [...] "ticked" [...] and [...] "roan" [...] interchangeably, with the former referring to clearly defined flecks on a white background and the latter to flecks so closely spaced that the mixture appears even. [...] The terminology that relates the underlying coat color with the roan modifier is often breed-specific, but most standards call a black dog with roaning blue. In breeds that are characterized by roaning and ticking such as the Large Munsterlander, clear <b>white-marked</b> individuals may be called plated. The term belton is reserved for English Setters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Simple rearing {{experiments}} were con-ducted to address two questions relevant to under-standing how generalist lepidopteran herbivores interact with alien plants. Yellow-striped armyworm (Spodoptera ornithogalli), luna moth (Actias luna), bagworm (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) and <b>white-marked</b> tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma) were reared from egg to 5 th instar on excised foliage {{in the laboratory}} to determine {{the degree to which}} highly polyphagous lepidopteran herbivores are physiologically capable of surviving and developing on the suite of alien plants naturalized in the mid-Atlantic. Actias luna larvae from a single population were similarly reared on a representative of each of the 25 native plant genera recorded as hosts for this species to compare the diet breadth of a local population with that listed over the entire geographic range of the species. With few exceptions, all four generalists either quickly starved or grew at an unsustainably low rate on alien foliage. Actias luna larvae survived for 18 days on only 44 % of the native plants recorded as hosts over the entire range of this insect and thrived on only 7 %. The data suggest that (1) alien plants are unlikely to produce as much generalist insect biomass as the native plants they replace and (2) Lepidoptera that qualify as generalists when host breadth is considered over their entire geographic range may express a far more specialized diet within local populations. Both of these conclu-sions support the hypothesis that alien plant invasions may seriously disrupt terrestrial food webs by reducing the insect biomass required by insectivores in higher trophic levels...|$|E
40|$|Direct and {{interactive}} effects of CO 2 and light on tree phytochemistry and insect fitness parameters were examined through experimental manipulations of plant growth conditions {{and performance of}} insect bioassays. Three species of deciduous trees (quaking aspen, Populus tremuloides: paper birch, Betula papyrifera; sugar maple, Acer saccharum) were grown under ambient (387 +/- 8 mu L/L) and elevated (696 +/- 2 mu L/L) levels of atmospheric CO 2, with low and high light availability (375 and 855 mu mol x m(- 2) x s(- 1) at solar noon). Effects on the population and individual performance of a generalist phytophagous insect, the <b>white-marked</b> tussock moth (Orgyia leucostigma) were evaluated. Caterpillars were reared on experimental trees {{for the duration of}} the larval stage; and complementary short-term (fourth instar) Feeding trials were conducted with insects fed detached leaves. Phytochemical analyses demonstrated strong effects of both CO 2 and light on all foliar nutritional variables (water. starch and nitrogen). For all species. enriched CO 2 decreased water content and increased starch content, especially under high light conditions. High CO 2 availability reduced levels of foliar nitrogen. but effects were species specific and most pronounced for high light aspen and birch. Analyses of secondary plant compounds revealed that levels of phenolic glycosides (salicortin and tremulacin) in aspen and condensed tannins in birch and maple were positively influenced by levels of both CO 2 and light. In contrast, levels of condensed tannins in aspen were primarily affected by light, whereas levels of ellagitannins and gallotannins in maple responded to light and CO 2, respectively. The lone-term bioassays showed strong treatment effects on survival, development time, and pupal mass. In general. CO 2 effects were pronounced in high light and decreased along the gradient aspen > birch > maple. For larvae reared on high light aspen, enriched CO 2 resulted in 62 % fewer survivors. with increased development time, and reduced pupal mass. For maple-fed insects, elevated CO 2 levels had negative effects on survival and pupal mass in low light. For birch, the only negative CO 2 effects were observed in high light, where female larvae showed prolonged development. Fourth instar feeding trials demonstrated that low food conversion efficiency reduced insect performance. Elevated levels of CO 2 significantly reduced total consumption, especially by insects on high light aspen and loa: light maple. This research demonstrates that effects of CO 2 on phytochemistry and insect performance can be strongly light-dependent, and that plant responses to these two environmental variables differ among species. Overall, increased CO 2 availability appeared to increase the defensive capacity of early-successional species primarily under high light conditions, and of late successional species under low light conditions. Due to the interactive effects of tree species, light, CO 2, and herbivory, community composition of forests may change in the future...|$|E
