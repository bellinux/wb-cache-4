25|$|In 1923, Karl Lashley {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} rhesus monkeys that demonstrated changes in neuronal pathways, which he concluded were evidence of plasticity. Despite this, and other research that suggested plasticity took place, neuroscientists did not <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> {{the idea of}} neuroplasticity.|$|R
50|$|Under FSDR, {{the basic}} {{elements}} of glass, mass and insulation were the basis of the design principles of a five star home. The building industry did not <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> the system due to its simple pass/fail rating and its restrictive guidelines.|$|R

5|$|The {{species was}} {{segregated}} from Asplenium as Chamaefilix bradleyi by Farwell in 1931. The change was not <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> and current authorities {{do not recognize}} this segregate genus.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} amount of {{research has focused on}} determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> that there is a factor within the tissues of the first pharyngeal arch that is necessary for the development of teeth.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} community <b>widely</b> <b>accepts</b> that indigenous peoples are holders {{of a specific}} set of rights and are also the victims of historically unique forms of discrimination, and it enshrined this idea in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The first australopithecine {{discovered}} in eastern Africa was a skull belonging to an A. boisei that was excavated in 1959 in the Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania by Mary Leakey. Since then, the Leakey family {{have continued to}} excavate the gorge, uncovering further evidence for australopithecines, {{as well as for}} Homo habilis and Homo erectus. The scientific community took 20 years to <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> Australopithecus {{as a member of the}} family tree.|$|R
5000|$|Different {{economists have}} {{different}} views about what events are {{the sources of}} market failure. Mainstream economic analysis <b>widely</b> <b>accepts</b> a market failure (relative to Pareto efficiency) can occur for three main reasons: if the market is [...] "monopolised" [...] or {{a small group of}} businesses hold significant market power, if production of the good or service results in an externality, or if the good or service is a [...] "public good".|$|R
5|$|Despite an {{extensive}} police investigation, {{the killer was}} never found and his identity is still a mystery. Both {{at the time and}} subsequently, many amateur and professional investigators have proposed solutions but no single theory is <b>widely</b> <b>accepted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Moravian {{palaeontologist}} Ferdinand Stoliczka {{separated the}} Himalayan {{population as a}} third subspecies, P.g.forsythi, but {{this has not been}} <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> and is usually treated as synonymous with digitatus. A Pleistocene form from Europe was similar to the extant subspecies, and is sometimes categorised as P.g.vetus.|$|E
5|$|Sibley and Ahlquist's {{taxonomy}} {{has included}} {{all the members}} of the Procellariiformes inside the Procellariidae and that family in an enlarged Ciconiiformes, but this change has not been <b>widely</b> <b>accepted.</b>|$|E
40|$|Interest in how {{institutional}} factors shape {{economic development}} has escalated substantially in recent years. Economists {{and other social}} theorists have recognized that the design of effective policy, at both the national and firm levels, requires {{an understanding of the}} institutional context within which policies will be implemented, and of the interaction of organizational forms with that context. Leading economists now <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> that 'institutions do matter' (Williamson, 2000). As Williamson acknowledges, however, agreement essentially terminates at that point...|$|R
50|$|It {{was once}} {{common in the}} United States to <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> a check (cheque) as a medium of exchange, several parties {{endorsing}} it perhaps multiple times before it would eventually be deposited for its value in units of account, and thus redeemed. This practice became less common as it was exploited by forgers {{and led to a}} domino effect of bounced checks - a forerunner of the kind of fragility that electronic systems would eventually bring.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these {{supportive}} stances, the anarchist {{movement of}} the time certainly wasn't free of homophobia: an editorial in an influential Spanish anarchist journal from 1935 argued that an Anarchist shouldn't even associate with homosexuals: [...] "If you are an anarchist, {{that means that you}} are more morally upright and physically strong than the average man. And he who likes inverts men is no real man, and is therefore no real anarchist." [...] However, despite this history, present-day anarchists <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> homosexuality.|$|R
5|$|The Moon {{is thought}} to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> {{explanation}} is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published {{description}} has priority; therefore, the valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus maou. However, Lesson's name remained forgotten {{for so long that}} Carcharhinus longimanus remains <b>widely</b> <b>accepted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Sanskrit {{literature}} remained popular {{during the}} Hoysala rule, royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased. In the 12th century some works {{were written in}} the Champu style, but distinctive Kannada metres became more <b>widely</b> <b>accepted.</b> The Sangatya metre used in compositions, Shatpadi (six line), tripadi (three line) metres in verses and ragale (lyrical poems) became fashionable. Jain works continued to extol the virtues of Tirthankaras (Jain saviour figures).|$|E
50|$|A {{large and}} publicized {{component}} of the PDA’s HIV/AIDS campaign is Viravaidya’s initiative to desensitize the condom. The rationale behind the condom movement is that if Thai society can <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> the advocacy of condoms then individuals would be actively supporting positive sexual behaviors and practices. The PDA and Viravaidya support advocacy of the condom for all ages because it {{is viewed as a}} generational issue. Parents and teachers do not object to integrating condoms and HIV/AIDS instruction into all levels of education, since such programs are saving lives. See more under PDA strategy.|$|R
40|$|Because most {{myocardial}} infarctions {{result from}} the rupture of a plaque that did not significantly compromise the coronary lumen before the event, experts <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> that the morphology, composition, and degree of inflammation of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque {{is more important than}} the degree of luminal stenosis. Two depicting examples are the concentric, calcified lesion that shows significant luminal stenosis but is stable because of the stabilizing clasp of calcification. In contrast, a smaller but inflamed thin fibrous cap atheroma with a big lipid/necrotic core may rupture and cause an immediate fatal coronary occlusion...|$|R

5|$|Although {{this is a}} <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> {{theory for}} how most tornadoes form, live, and die, it does not explain the {{formation}} of smaller tornadoes, such as landspouts, long-lived tornadoes, or tornadoes with multiple vortices. These each have different mechanisms which influence their development—however, most tornadoes follow a pattern similar to this one.|$|E
5|$|As of 1997, its {{official}} name is the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.

5|$|Hong Kong's {{transportation}} {{network is}} highly developed. Over 90% of daily travels (11million) are on public transport, the highest such percentage in the world. Payment {{can be made}} using the Octopus card, a stored value system introduced by the MTR (Mass Transit Railway), which is <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> on railways, buses and ferries, and accepted like cash at other outlets.|$|E
40|$|Isotopic {{dating and}} recent {{regional}} mapping {{have led to}} reappraisal of conventional inter-pretations of {{the southern part of}} the East Greenland Caledonides. The metamorphic complexes of the Scoresby Sund region pre-serve evidence of Archaean and Proterozoic orogenic episodes, and high grade metasedi-mentary sequences thought to be late Pre-cambrian Caledonian geosynclinal rocks have yielded middle Proterozoic isotopic ages. The intensity of the Caledonian orogeny is much less than formerly imagined. The interpreta-tions of the Scoresby Sund region are extended northwards into the classic areas of the central metamorphic complex where the <b>widely</b> <b>accept...</b>|$|R
50|$|Contemporary Slovene film {{criticism}} <b>widely</b> <b>accepts</b> {{that the}} 5 films that František Čap directed in Slovene, Vesna, Trenutki odločitve, Ne čakaj na maj, X 25 Reports and Our Car, introduced a Hollywood type of narrative and cosmopolitan appearance to 1950’s Slovene cinema. Though struggling with negative criticism {{in his own}} time, today Čap is praised as a craftsman who helped the undeveloped Slovene and Yugoslav cinema - at the time infected with dilettante technical standards, problematic focus on local issues and stiff literary adaptations - {{to rise to the}} level of an exquisite craft with universal intelligibility.|$|R

5|$|However, if {{they were}} common, more than the {{occasional}} specimen might be expected in exceptionally preserved fossil assemblages (Konservat-Lagerstätten) such as the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang. There are at present no <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> reports of Ediacara-type organisms in the Cambrian period, though {{there are a few}} disputed reports, as well as unpublished observations of 'vendobiont' fossils from 535Ma Orsten-type deposits in China.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> that {{no single}} English word is a true rhyme for orange, though there are half rhymes such as hinge, lozenge, syringe, flange, Stonehenge, or porridge. Although this {{property}} {{is not unique to}} the word—one study of 5,411 one-syllable English words found 80 words with no rhymes—the lack of rhyme for orange has garnered significant attention, and inspired many humorous verses.|$|E
5|$|John Gould {{and other}} early writers {{referred}} to the species as the black-and-white fantail, although did note the current name. However, willie wagtail rapidly became <b>widely</b> <b>accepted</b> sometime after 1916. Wagtail is derived from its active behaviour, while the origins of willie are obscure. The name had been in use colloquially for the pied subspecies of the white wagtail (Motacilla alba) on the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the global}} health {{community}} <b>widely</b> <b>accepts</b> that WHO, as currently configured, {{is no longer}} fit-for-purpose, commentators cling to renovation (‘reform’), rather than innovation, {{at the expense of}} a global health governance system that reflects the needs of a very changed world. Collective action in a globalised world requires institutions that look very different from what we currently have. Rather than the renovation of outdated institutional forms—which are closed, territorially fixed and hierarchical—we need to harness innovations such as social networks, open-source systems and the sharing economy. One of the biggest forms of institutional innovation more broadly is ‘network governance’, by which collective action is achieved through interconnected institutions spanning government, business and civil society...|$|R
2500|$|Even {{before his}} arrival in St. Petersburg in 1903, the city was wildly fascinated with mysticism and aristocrats were obsessed with {{anything}} occult. While fascinated by him, the Saint Petersburg elite did not <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> Rasputin. He did not {{fit in with the}} royal family, and he and the Russian Orthodox Church had a very strained relationship. The Holy Synod frequently attacked Rasputin, accusing him of a variety of immoral or evil practices. Because Rasputin was a court official, though, he and his apartment were under 24-hour surveillance, and, accordingly, there exists some credible evidence about his lifestyle {{in the form of the}} famous [...] "staircase notes" [...] — reports from police spies, which were not given only to the Tsar but also published in newspapers.|$|R
50|$|Popular culture grew to <b>widely</b> <b>accept</b> {{whales and}} {{dolphins}} as interesting, entertaining and intelligent over {{the latter half}} of the 20th century. From the original tourist attractions at Marineland to giant SeaWorld theme parks, captive dolphins and orcas (killer whales) became star attractions. The 1960s television series, Flipper, starred a Lassie-like dolphin character who befriends a young boy and performs feats of intelligence often saving the day. The 1967 novel, The Day of the Dolphin which inspired the 1973 film, featured dolphins trained to speak English that help to save the world from nuclear destruction. In 1970 the biologist and environmentalist Roger Payne recorded and produced the popular Songs of the Humpback Whale album, after his 1967 discovery (with Scott McVay) of Whale song among Humpback whales.|$|R
