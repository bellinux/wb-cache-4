5|$|The {{reaction}} usually <b>works</b> <b>best</b> with aromatic nitriles Aryl-CN. A related reaction (called the Sonn-Müller method) {{starts with}} an amide, which is treated with PCl5 {{to form the}} imidoyl chloride salt.|$|E
5|$|While {{background}} matching <b>works</b> <b>best</b> for {{a single}} background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may {{have a variety of}} backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Although erections are not {{necessary}} for satisfying sexual encounters, many men see them as important, and treating erectile dysfunction improves their relationships and quality of life. Whatever treatment is used, it <b>works</b> <b>best</b> in combination with talk-oriented therapy to help integrate it into the sex life.|$|E

5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is an {{oxidizing}} agent. Depending on the reaction, {{this may}} be due to the Pb2+(aq) ion, which has a standard reduction potential (E0) of −0.125V, or the nitrate ion, which under acidic conditions has an E0 of +0.956V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition, while the lead(II) <b>works</b> <b>best</b> in a neutral aqueous solution.|$|E
5|$|The Northumbria Hang Gliding and Paragliding Club, {{based in}} Newcastle upon Tyne, organises both hang gliding and {{paragliding}} at Coldsmouth Hill, which works in an easterly or west north westerly wind, and Longknowe, which <b>works</b> <b>best</b> in a west north westerly wind.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategy}} appears paradoxical and counter-intuitive as {{a method}} of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast strongly with each other, so the patches are themselves conspicuous. While background matching <b>works</b> <b>best</b> for a single background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may have a variety of backgrounds.|$|E

5|$|Broaching <b>works</b> <b>best</b> on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still}} has a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, but is still possible.|$|E
5|$|The surface {{friction}} tester {{is a small}} {{fifth wheel}} attached to a hydraulic system mounted on the rear axle of the vehicle, used to measure road slipperiness. The wheel, allowed to roll freely, is slightly turned relative to the ground so that it partially slides. Sensors attached to the axis of the wheel calculate the friction between the wheel and the pavement by measuring the torque produced by {{the rotation of the}} wheel. Surface friction testers are used at airports and on major roadways before ice formation or after snow removal. The vehicle can relay the surface friction data back to the control centre, allowing gritting and clearing to be planned so that the vehicles are deployed most efficiently. Surface friction testers often include a water spraying system, to simulate the effects of rain on the road surface before the rain occurs. The sensors are usually mounted to small compact or estate cars or to a small trailer, rather than the large trucks used for other winter service equipment, as the surface friction tester <b>works</b> <b>best</b> when attached to a lightweight vehicle.|$|E

25|$|The third {{method is}} the {{inversion}} method, which <b>works</b> <b>best</b> when the DV is flipped {{over to the}} right side of the cylinder.

25|$|Spinning in {{the grease}} <b>works</b> <b>best</b> if the fleece is newly sheared. After several months, the lanolin becomes sticky, {{which makes the}} wool harder to spin using the short-draw technique, and almost {{impossible}} to spin using the long-draw technique. In general, spinners who use the long-draw technique do not spin in the grease.|$|E

25|$|A dipole is a {{symmetrical}} antenna, as it {{is composed}} of two symmetrical ungrounded elements. Therefore, it <b>works</b> <b>best</b> when fed by a balanced transmission line, such as a ladder line, because in that case the symmetry (one aspect of the impedance complex, which is a complex number) matches and therefore the power transfer is optimum.|$|E
