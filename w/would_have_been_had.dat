25|$|These rules use area scoring, {{and have}} a komi of 6.5. Black has one further point deducted {{in the event that}} White was the first player to pass in the game. This last feature is a {{compromise}} with Japanese and Korean rules in that it is similar, in terms of its strategic consequences, to territory scoring. Unlike the Chinese rules, this rule will generally impose a penalty for an additional move {{at the end of the}} game within one's territory. In particular, the result of the game may differ by up to a point from what it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> both players played it out.|$|E

25|$|However, Charmley {{dismisses the}} {{concerns}} of contemporaries such as Charles Webster and Lord Cecil of Chelwood that Bevin, a man of very strong personality, was “in {{the hands of his}} officials”. Charmley argues that much of Bevin's success came because he shared the views of those officials: his earlier career had left him with an intense dislike of communists, whom he regarded as workshy intellectuals whose attempts to infiltrate trade unions were to be resisted. His former Private Secretary Oliver Harvey thought Bevin’s staunchly anti-Soviet policy was what Eden’s <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> he not been hamstrung, as at Potsdam, by Churchill’s occasional susceptibility to Stalin’s flattery, whilst Cadogan thought Bevin “pretty sound on the whole”.|$|E
25|$|The first HM V tram, number 1, was {{delivered}} to the HKL on 27 April 1959, with number 15 delivered last in the series on 23 October 1959. Coinciding with the delivery of these new trams the HKL had decided to reset their numbering scheme. Therefore, the HM V trams were numbered starting from one and not from 376, as they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> the old numbering been continued. The HM V trams were built to be compatible with the HP II type trailers that had been constructed in 195859, also by Karia. The usage of trailers in Helsinki ended in 1983, although the couplers needed for hauling trailers were retained in the HM V type trams for many years afterwards, number 14 being the last tram to have one, with the coupler removed only in 2006.|$|E
25|$|With stylometric {{approaches}} it {{is possible}} to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, {{such as the use of}} particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been,</b> <b>had</b> he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out.|$|E

25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower than they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Gustave Flaubert {{was also}} {{substantially}} influenced by Balzac. Praising {{his portrayal of}} society while attacking his prose style, Flaubert once wrote: [...] "What a man he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> he known how to write!" [...] While he disdained the label of [...] "realist", Flaubert clearly took heed of Balzac's close attention to detail and unvarnished depictions of bourgeois life. This influence shows in Flaubert's work L'éducation sentimentale which owes a debt to Balzac's Illusions Perdues. [...] "What Balzac started", observes Lehan, [...] "Flaubert helped finish".|$|E

500|$|After lunch, Harvey {{accelerated}} {{after the}} second new ball was taken, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. Harvey's knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours. The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Harvey ended as the first Australian left-hander to score a century on his Ashes debut, in an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of}} the wicket. The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match into a balanced position when Australia were finally dismissed for 458. In the second innings, Harvey took two noted catches, including one where he bent over to catch the ball at ankle height while running. Fingleton said that it [...] "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Australia {{lost the}} {{services}} of Toshack after he broke down {{with a knee injury}} in the first innings, increasing the burden on the remaining bowlers as England sought to extend their lead on the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. After reaching 50, Washbrook hooked a short ball from Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch. However, Washbrook soon repeated the shot from the bowling of Johnston with fatal results. The ball again went in the air, and Neil Harvey quickly ran across the ground and bent over to catch it at feet height while on the run, removing the opener for 65. Fingleton said that Harvey’s effort [...] "was the catch of the seasonor, indeed, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ". O’Reilly doubted [...] "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it".

500|$|On August 20, 1845, Griswold married Charlotte Myers, a Jewish woman; she was 42 {{and he was}} 33. Griswold {{had been}} {{pressured}} into the marriage by the woman's aunts, despite his concern about their difference in religious beliefs. This difference was strong enough that one of Griswold's friends referred to his wife only as [...] "the little Jewess". On their wedding night, he discovered that she was, according to Griswold biographer Joy Bayless, [...] "through some physical misfortune, incapable of being a wife" [...] or, as Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman explains, incapable of having sex. Griswold considered the marriage void and no more valid [...] "than there <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>had</b> the ceremony taken place between parties of the same sex, or where the sex of one was doubtful or ambiguous". Still, the couple moved together to Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte's home town, and lived under the same roof, albeit sleeping in separate rooms. Neither of the two was happy with the situation, {{and at the end}} of April 1846 she had a lawyer write up a contract [...] "to separate, altogether and forever,... which would in effect be a divorce". The contract forbade Griswold from remarrying and paid him $1,000 for expenses in exchange for his daughter Caroline staying with the Myers family. After this separation, Griswold immediately moved back to Philadelphia.|$|E
