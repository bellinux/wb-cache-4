40|$|The {{aging of}} wine {{requires}} {{a long time}} therefore it can cause loss of time and money. Therefore using of new techniques for wine aging shortens the length of aging time and wines may {{be placed on the}} market more quickly. Nowadays, gamma irradiation, ultrasonic waves, AC electric field and micro-oxygenation are the new techniques for wine aging. Gamma irradiation (after fermentation) is accelerated physical maturation method. Gamma irradiation, in a suitable dosage (200 [*]Gy), is a suitable method for improving some wine defects and producing a higher taste quality in wine. The 20 [*]kHz ultrasonic waves aged wine much more quickly than standard aging, with similar quality. The wine treated by 20 [*]kHz ultrasonic waves had a taste equivalent to 1 year aged wine. Wine maturing with AC electric field promises novel process accelerating aging process of fresh wine when suitable conditions are applied. As a result of research, an optimum treatment (electric field 600 [*]V/cm and duration time 3 [*]min) was identified to accelerate wine aging. Harsh and pungent raw wine become harmonious and dainty. This process is equivalent to 6 month aging in oak barrel. Microoxygenation is a very important technique used in aging wines in order to improve their characteristics. The techniques of <b>wine</b> <b>tank</b> aging imply the use of small doses of oxygen (2 [*]ml L− 1 month− 1) and the addition of wood pieces of oak to the wine. Studies concerning these new techniques demonstrated that maturation of wines become more quickly than standard maturation procedures with keeping and improving the wine quality...|$|E

40|$|Mixing {{processes}} for modern wine-making occur repeatedly during fermentation (e. g. yeast addition, wine fermen- tation additives), {{as well as}} after fermentation (e. g. blending, dosage, sulfur additions). In large fermentation vessels or when mixing fluids of different viscosities, an inadequate mixing process can lead to considerable costs and problems (inhomogeneous product, development of layers in the tank, waste of energy, clogging of filters). Considering advancements in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{in the last few}} years and the computational power of computers nowadays, most large-scale wineries would be able to conduct mixing simulations using their own tank and agitator configurations in order to evaluate their efficiency and the necessary power input based on mathematical modeling.

40|$|Predictable {{winemaking}} {{depends upon}} the control of all the factors that affect fermentation, including the grape varieties, yeast selection, enzyme addition, the size and type of the vats, the temperature control regime, nutrient selection, and pumping regimes. The relationship between yeast behaviour and temperature control is well understood, forming the fundamental basis of winemaking. Temperature control in fermentation {{is crucial to the}} development of desirable flavours, alcohol levels and colour in all wine making grape varieties. Continuing issues in winemaking include the problems in measuring temperature across a vat, with the existence of large temperature gradients in vats as well as the inability of a single temperature reading to identify temperature differentials across fermentation vats leading to fermentation issues. A seemingly accurate measurement of temperature may be completely incorrect, at potentially high cost. Furthermore, we cannot have the most experienced winemakers everywhere at the same time; therefore, we must depend upon automated measurement and temperature control systems in a number of cases. In this paper we propose a low cost sensor array capable of measuring temperature gradients across vats for real time monitoring of wine fermentation processes {{and the development of a}} decision support system based on fuzzy logic to aid winemaking decisions.

40|$|The Brettanomyces / Dekkera yeasts can {{be found}} in fermenting must and in wine. Typically they grow after {{alcoholic}} and malolactic fermentation during storage of <b>wine</b> in <b>tank,</b> barrel, or bottle. They contribute characteristic bretty flavors which are described as smoky, barnyard, plastic, burnt plastic, vinyl, Bandaid, and creosote. They can also contribute a metallic bitterness. Compounds which are responsible for brett flavor in wine include 4 -ethyl phenol, 4 -ethyl guaiacol, isovaleric acid, and unidentified burnt plastic compound. Descriptive sensory evaluations show an inverse relationship between fruity and bretty flavor perception. The brett aromas in some wines are considered a positive attribute, especially when present at low concentration. Often these flavors are considered a defect. The wine's varietal and regional flavor characteristics might be completely masked by these flavors and the wine can be unpleasantly bitter. 4 -ethyl phenol is used by some wineries as an indicator compound for the activity of Brettanomyces. Yet some wines having a strong brett flavors do contain none or very little 4 -ethyl phenol. Preliminary studies show that 4 -ethyl phenol is formed all through growth of Brettanomyces. Thus this compound can be used to confirm the presence of bretty flavors. The search for indicator compounds formed during early stages of growth of B. continues. The Brettanomyces yeasts can produce the characteristic brett flavors when growing at low cell density of several hundred to several thousand cells per mL. The fact that these yeasts are often present at low cell numbers and that they are slow growing makes detection difficult. Genetic analyses of wine isolates have shown that only strains of B. bruxellensis grow in wine. Semi-selective plating is performed prior to genetic analysis on media including cycloheximide. The development of DNA based probes has made it possible to reliably identify the yeast once it is plated on a nutrient agar plate. Further developments of specific probes and of probe application techniques will improve the specificity and speed of detection...|$|R
40|$|This project, with an {{interdisciplinary}} group of two computer engineers and one materials engineer, {{was seeking to}} implement an automated temperature monitoring system which is affordable and easy to use, as well as adaptable to any arrangement and scale of a winemaker’s fermentation setup. My goal, as the materials engineer, was to design, fabricate, and test the enclosure, for the wireless nodes that are placed in the <b>wine</b> fermentation <b>tanks,</b> and the materials used for the node enclosure. For the enclosure of the system, materials selection was completed using CES software using limitations of only polymer materials which absorb less than 0. 01 % of water in a 24 hour period, are resistant to weak acids, cost-effective, and have a high stiffness. The material which passed all of the stages and was chosen {{for the design of}} the node enclosure was high density polyethylene (HDPE). However, to make sure that HDPE and the adhesive used to connect to individual HDPE components (PDMS) can withstand the fermenting wine environment, a two-week long preliminary test was completed. It was found that PDMS had the greatest difference in water adsorption between day 0 to day 1 and 20. HDPE had the greatest difference in water adsorption between day 20 to day 0 and 1. PS did not change. All of these changes in water adsorption were around the required limit set in the materials selection process of 0. 01 %. Then to make sure the PDMS adhesive could withstand the cleaning chemicals (sodium hydroxide, NaOH, and citric acid) used at the winery, a week-long degradation test was completed and found the PDMS sample’s surface changed when exposed to a sodium hydroxide solution. The PDMS samples which were exposed to the diluted citric acid solution, around 3 %, had the greatest strength, average of 2. 73 MPa compared to the control average of 1. 2 MPa due to stress relaxation by the formation of silanols, but could also be due to the run order and human error. However, all of these changes are minor enough to where it would not affect the reliability of the node enclosure.

5000|$|Findings {{of seeds}} {{dating back to}} the Iron (Stufels near Bressanone) and archaeological {{findings}} dating back to 400 BC witness that winegrowing was practised in South Tyrol already 3,000 years ago. Probably the earliest sources date back to before the Romans and to the wine produced by the Rhaetian. Marcus Porcius Cato in his De agricoltura highlighted the Rhaetian wine, before the territory was conquered by the Romans. The Romans learned by the Rhaetian how to store and transport wine in wooden barrels (according to Pliny). Especially Augustus and Tiberius (nicknamed “Biberius”) appreciated Rhaetian wine. In 720 AD, under the commissioner Corbinio, first bishop of Freising, vineyards landed in Burggrafenamt. From the twelfth century the monasteries in Southern Germany and the aristocrats incentive the winemaking. In the late Middle Ages and during the Asburgic monarchy the production of wine in the South Tyrolean wineries flourished. The wine production and sale developed thanks to the activity of the families of winemakers from the nineteenth century and thanks to the cooperatives since the twentieth century. In the twentieth century there were several critical periods: first due to the phylloxera and then in the First Post-war with the breakdown of the traditional markets (Austria, Hungary, Bayern) with the fascist repression, as well as during the Second Post-war. With the mass production, the wine industry consolidated until the 80s. In the 80s there was a deep crisis of the sales channels most common at the times, especially the sale of <b>wine</b> in <b>tanks</b> in Switzerland. Cellars changed their sales strategy. More quality wines were produced; quantity moved to the background and nowadays it hasn’t value any longer. Decisive for the wine making in South Tyrol was 1971, when people returned to the division and classification of wine zones according to the PDO rules. The quality production, pursued up until now since 20 years, as well as the spread of the bottling in bottles of 0,75 litres have earned this small wine area an excellent reputation. This is especially true for white wines in Italy, but also for the wine experts in the international markets.The South Tyrolean Wine Museum in Kaltern offers an overview of the history and the traditional grape cultivation methods in South Tyrol.|$|R
40|$|The {{resultant}} {{color of}} a Cabernet Sauvignon wine connotes overall quality. Therefore, {{it is in the}} best interests of a winery to produce a well-balanced wine, containing the deepest color possible, using the least amount of additives. This experiment studied the effects of adding ColorPro, VRSupra, and Gelatin Extra No. 1 to Cabernet Sauvignon fruit from Paso Robles to determine if anthocyanin and tannin levels changed with respect to the aforementioned supplements. To increase color and tannin extraction, ColorPro was added to the grape must prior to fermentation. A tannin powder, VRSupra, was added later in the winemaking process to reduce the bitterness and astringency obtained as a by-product of the enzyme addition. It is our presumption that the more tannin added throughout the winemaking process, the less gelatin remediation is needed on the wine prior to bottling. Three different tanks of Cabernet Sauvignon were monitored and analyzed. Varying rates of ColorPro were added at the hopper (0, 60, and 100 mL/ton). Postfermentation, four neutral American barrels were filled with free-run <b>wine</b> from each <b>tank.</b> Different rates of VRSupra tannin were added to the four barrels from each tank (0, 10, 20, 40 g/hL).
