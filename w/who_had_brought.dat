5|$|In two months, Cornelius and his 200 men {{cut down}} trees, burned down {{vegetation}} and dug away {{the earth to}} reveal the monument. Due to the danger of collapse, he could not unearth all galleries. He reported his findings to Raffles, including various drawings. Although the discovery is only mentioned by a few sentences, Raffles has been credited with the monument's recovery, as one <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> it to the world's attention.|$|E
5|$|Ine was King of Wessex from 688 to 726. He {{was unable}} to retain the {{territorial}} gains of his predecessor, Cædwalla, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> much of southern England under his control and expanded West Saxon territory substantially. By the end of Ine's reign, the kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, and Essex were no longer under West Saxon domination; however, Ine maintained control {{of what is now}} Hampshire, and consolidated and extended Wessex's territory in the western peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette's father {{likewise}} {{died on the}} battlefield. On 1 August 1759, Michel de Lafayette {{was struck}} by a cannonball while fighting a British-led coalition at the Battle of Minden in Westphalia. Lafayette became marquis and Lord of Chavaniac, but the estate went to his mother. Perhaps devastated by the loss of her husband, she went to live in Paris with her father and grandfather, leaving Lafayette to be raised in Chavaniac-Lafayette by his paternal grandmother, Mme de Chavaniac, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> the château into the family with her dowry.|$|E
5|$|On 11 October 1855, Brunner married Jane Robson, the 26-year-old {{daughter}} of a labourer <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> his family to New Zealand the previous year. It was a respectable match for Jane as Brunner was considered a particularly eligible bachelor in Nelson, one of around 45 professionals working {{in the town of}} about 1600 people. His salary had increased to ₤300 (₤24,000) and he was now Chief Surveyor for the Nelson Province, the local returning officer and the Commissioner of Native Reserves for Nelson. He also owned three properties, including his Nelson office.|$|E
5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew so little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> {{with him}} a large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through Euboea towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through Euboea, he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E
5|$|His {{marriage}} to the hot-tempered Sarah Jennings – Anne's intimate friend – ensured Marlborough's rise, first to the Captain-Generalcy of British forces, then to a dukedom. Becoming de facto leader of Allied forces during the War of the Spanish Succession, his victories on the fields of Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709), ensured {{his place in history}} as one of Europe's great generals. But his wife's stormy relationship with the Queen, and her subsequent dismissal from court, was central to his own fall. Incurring Anne's disfavour, and caught between Tory and Whig factions, Marlborough, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> glory and success to Anne's reign, was forced from office and went into self-imposed exile. He returned to England and to influence under the House of Hanover with the accession of GeorgeI to the British throne in 1714.|$|E
5|$|J.R.R. Tolkien found {{inspiration}} in the Malvern landscape {{which he had}} viewed from his childhood home in Birmingham and his brother Hilary's home near Evesham. He {{was introduced to the}} area by C. S. Lewis, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> him here to meet George Sayer, the Head of English at Malvern College. Sayer had been a student of Lewis, and became his biographer, and together with them Tolkien would walk the Malvern Hills. Recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were made in Malvern in 1952, at the home of George Sayer. The recordings were later issued on long-playing gramophone records. In the liner notes for J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings his The Hobbit & The Fellowship of the Rings, George Sayer wrote that Tolkien would relive the book as they walked and compared parts of the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.|$|E

He made his Huddersfield debut in a 2–0 home win over Luton Town on 29 September 2007. On 20 October, he scored his first goal for Town in a match against Oldham Athletic, which {{finished}} 1–1. His loan was extended by another month on 29 October. He was also given permission by West Bromwich Albion {{to play in}} Town's FA Cup first round tie against Accrington Stanley on 10 November.

5|$|After the Man and His World summer {{exhibitions}} were discontinued, {{with most}} pavilions and remnants demolished between 1985 and 1987, the former site for Expo 67 on Saint Helen's Island and Notre Dame Island {{was incorporated into}} a municipal park run {{by the city of}} Montreal. In 2000, the park was renamed from Parc des Îles to Parc Jean-Drapeau, after Mayor Jean Drapeau, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> the exhibition to Montreal. In 2006, the corporation that runs the park also changed its name from the Société du parc des Îles to the Société du parc Jean-Drapeau. Today very little remains of Expo but two prominent buildings remain in use on the former Expo grounds: the American pavilion's metal-lattice skeleton from its Buckminster Fuller dome, now enclosing an environmental sciences museum called the Montreal Biosphere; and Habitat 67, now a condominium residence. Also, the France and Quebec pavilions now form the Montreal Casino. La Toundra Hall is part of the surviving structural remains of the Canadian pavilion. It is now a special events and banquet hall, while another part of the pavilion serves as the administration building of Parc Jean-Drapeau (Katimavik's distinctive inverted pyramid and {{much of the rest of}} the Canadian pavilion were dismantled during the 1970s).|$|E
5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E

A co-passenger who had travelled with Cheenu and Viji from Chennai to Ooty by train gives them a lead. Cheenu takes Viji to an Ayurvedic medical practitioner and leaves her there for treatment for a day. In his absence, the police come to his house searching for Viji. Finally, the police learn that Viji is getting treated at the doctor's place and reach there. Cheenu is unable to come as he is afraid of police action. The treatment goes through successfully.

5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the debut of the No. 5 locomotive, the railroad, {{for the first time in}} its history, hosted a privately owned train on its track. On the morning of May 10, before Disneyland opened for the day, a private {{ceremony}} was held at New Orleans Square Station to honor Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ollie Johnston, supposedly to thank him for helping to inspire Walt Disney's passion for trains, which led to the creation of Disneyland. The true motive for having Johnston there was soon revealed when a simple steam train not part of the DRR's rolling stock, consisting of a locomotive named Marie E. and a caboose, rolled towards the station and stopped at its platform. Johnston, a previous owner of the steam train, used to run it on his vacation property, which he sold, along with the train, in 1993. The man who now owned the train was Pixar film director John Lasseter, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> the train to Disneyland in order to give Johnston, his mentor, an opportunity to reunite with and drive his former locomotive. Johnston, then in his nineties, was helped into the Marie E., and with Lasseter at his side, he grasped the locomotive's throttle and drove his former possession three times around the DRR's main line. Although Johnston died in 2008, Lasseter continues to run the Marie E., the caboose, and an assortment of train cars on his private Justi Creek Railway, which is complemented by the depot building and water tower from Ward Kimball's former Grizzly Flats Railroad.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak, {{infantry}} in the 8th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division) advanced {{with the}} 7th Light Horse and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiments (2nd Light Horse Brigade), covered by infantry in the 7th Scottish Rifles, 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> 16 {{machine guns and}} Lewis guns into a position from which they could sweep the crest and reverse slopes of Wellington Ridge. The Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, with the 7th Light Horse Regiment and supported on the left by Scottish Rifles' infantry posts, fixed bayonets and stormed Wellington Ridge. They encountered heavy rifle and machine gun fire, but rushed up the sandy slope and quickly broke through the German and Ottoman front line. After clearing Wellington Ridge, the mounted riflemen, light horsemen and infantrymen pressed forward from ridge to ridge without pause. These troops swept down on a body of about 1,000 to 1,500 Ottoman soldiers, who became demoralised. As {{a result of this}} attack, a white flag was hoisted and by 05:00 the German and Ottoman soldiers who had stubbornly defended their positions on Wellington Ridge, dominating the camps at Romani, were captured. A total of 1,500 became prisoners in the neighbourhood of Wellington Ridge; 864 soldiers surrendered to infantry in the 8th Scottish Rifles alone, while others were captured by the light horse and mounted rifles regiments. By 05:30, the main German and Ottoman force was in a disorganised retreat towards Katia, with the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades and the Ayrshire and Leicestershire batteries not far behind. At 06:00, a further 119 men surrendered to the infantry in No. 3 Redoubt; while these prisoners were being dealt with, it became apparent that {{they were part of a}} rearguard and that a full retreat was under way. At 06:30, Lawrence ordered Chauvel to take command of all troops and to initiate a vigorous general advance eastwards.|$|E
