25|$|Stranger in a Strange Land {{contains}} an early {{description of the}} <b>waterbed,</b> an invention that made its real-world debut in 1968. Charles Hall, who brought a <b>waterbed</b> design to the United States Patent Office, was refused a patent {{on the grounds that}} Heinlein's descriptions in Stranger in a Strange Land and another novel, Double Star (1956), constituted prior art.|$|E

40|$|Flotation {{devices are}} {{currently}} being used prophy-lactically and {{in the treatment of}} a wide range of medical disorders. 1 - 3 In a nationwide survey I did of medical facilities in the United States (unpublished data, 1979), more than half of the responding facilities had patients using <b>waterbeds</b> or modular units. How-ever, only a few of these facilities had physical ther-apists using <b>waterbeds</b> in therapy. Water-filled cush-ions, mattresses, and beds eliminate pressure points by supporting the entire surface of the body and conforming to its shape. <b>Waterbeds,</b> in particular, can provide the additional advantages of warmth and significant movement. This report describes how these features of <b>waterbeds</b> can be used in both physical therapy and home care of handicapped children...|$|R
50|$|<b>Waterbeds</b> {{primarily}} {{consist of}} two types, hard-sided beds and soft-sided beds.|$|R

25|$|The {{cover was}} done by Dave McMacken as {{somewhat}} in vein of Salvador Dalí's surreal imagery depicting a two-headed man sitting on a <b>waterbed</b> in a Holiday Inn hotel room surrounded by various objects like a Mothers backstage pass and a television set showing Zappa's face with slime oozing out of it. The entire painting is depicted in a frame showing many sexual acts.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from the living room, and featured a <b>waterbed,</b> the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E

In a comedy storyline Darren buys Nancy a <b>waterbed,</b> which Stephen opined was [...] "all {{the better to}} drown him in...", she added that Nancy isn't impressed [...] "when she learns that he expects her {{to move in with}} his family. Still, it’ll all be waterbeds under the bridge when Nancy becomes pregnant (my theory)". Stephen's colleague Caroline Fitton commented on Darren and Nancy spending less time together because of her new job, saying it proved [...] "the girl had some sense". Stephen later questioned if Nancy would forgive Darren after he planned a surprise wedding or if she would [...] "notice that he has LOSER tattoed across his forehead?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Across {{the street}} from the supper club, the Gobbler Motel had an adventurous, futuristic Googie {{architecture}} design that featured 49 rooms with symbol-shaped <b>waterbeds</b> (such as a heart-shape), 8-track players, round sunken bathtubs,and differently colored shag carpet that extended up the walls in each themed room. According to a 1978 newspaper article, it required two maids to make the motel's round <b>waterbeds,</b> with the maids [...] "hanging by one arm and stretching out a stockinged foot to smooth away wrinkles" ...|$|R
5000|$|Science {{fiction writer}} Robert A. Heinlein {{described}} therapeutic <b>waterbeds</b> in his novels Beyond This Horizon (1942), Double Star (1956), and Stranger in a Strange Land (1961). In 1980 Heinlein recalled in Expanded Universe: ...|$|R
5000|$|Place {{the baby}} on a firm mattress, such as in a safety-approved crib. Research has shown that placing a baby to sleep on soft mattresses, sofas, sofa cushions, <b>waterbeds,</b> sheepskins, or other soft {{surfaces}} raises the risk of SIDS.|$|R
500|$|Much of {{the episode}} relied on props. The <b>waterbed,</b> which was {{purchased}} by Morris Fletcher earlier in the sixth season episode [...] "Dreamland" [...] while in Mulder's body, {{proved to be the}} hardest prop to locate. Stepeck searched Los Angeles and was unable to find a suitable bed. He had to order the bed from a specialized furniture store in San Francisco. Mulder's paycheck and envelope were created after several calls to the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C. The checks were made to be as realistic as possible without looking too convincing. During the hold-up scene outside the bank, the police cruisers were all turned off, because the combined noise of the cars would drown out dialogue. To ensure their flashing lights, car coordinator Danny Briggs installed battery chargers in the cars.|$|E
500|$|Mulder then wakes, unharmed, to {{find that}} his <b>waterbed</b> has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, {{and he needs to}} pay his {{landlord}} for water damage. To do so, he is forced to go to the bank, instead of going to the meeting with his partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and various other FBI officials. When he arrives, the same gunman, named Bernard, arrives and nervously attempts to rob the bank, shooting Mulder in the process. [...] The teller sets off the bank's silent alarm and police cars come rushing to the scene. Scully arrives and once again attempts to help her partner as he lies dying, but events go the same way - the police rush the building, Bernard detonates the bomb, and everybody dies.|$|E
500|$|Suddenly, {{the action}} starts over. Mulder wakes {{to find that}} his <b>waterbed</b> has sprung a leak, his alarm clock is broken, {{and he needs to}} pay his {{landlord}} for water damage. To the audience, time itself is stuck in a loop. Everyone is oblivious to the repetition of events except for one person, Pam (Carrie Hamilton), Bernard's girlfriend. [...] Over multiple iterations of the events, Pam does everything in her power to save the agents, including trying to prevent them from entering the bank, trying to inform them of the time loop, and even begging Skinner not to let the police into the building. It is implied that she has lived these events many times, as she refers to having had Mulder ask her the same question over fifty times. There are subtle changes in the events, and Mulder and Scully's conversation is worded differently each time, but the results are always the same: Bernard detonates the bomb, usually after shooting Mulder, and they all die.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Waterbeds</b> in Trinidad! {{was their}} lowest charted album, {{climbing}} to only #194 on Billboard.

50|$|While the {{aquaculture}} industry nationally {{is monitored}} by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in Connecticut it is regulated by the state Department of Agriculture. In 2010, Connecticut's aquaculture industry produced 450,000 bushels of clams and 200,000 bushels of oysters, supporting about 300 jobs. As of 2010, the state leased 53,000 acres of <b>waterbeds</b> to aquaculture operators, and municipalities leased another 20,000 acres.|$|R
500|$|Wilt Chamberlain was {{the first}} big earner of basketball: {{immediately}} becoming the highest paid player upon entering the NBA, Chamberlain was basketball's first player to earn at least $100,000 a year, and earned an unprecedented $1.5 million during his Lakers years. As a Philadelphia 76er, he could afford to rent a New York apartment and commute to Philadelphia. In addition, he would often stay out {{late into the night}} and wake up at noon, a point that became notorious in the 1965–66 NBA season. When he became a Laker, Chamberlain built a million-dollar mansion he called the [...] "Ursa Major" [...] in Bel-Air, as a play on his nickname [...] "The Big Dipper". It had a 2,200-pound pivot as a front door and contained great displays of luxury. [...] Robert Allen Cherry, journalist and author of the biography , describes his house as a miniature Playboy Mansion, where he regularly held parties and lived out his later-notorious sex life. This was also helped by the fact that Chamberlain was a near-insomniac who often simply skipped sleeping. Designed according to his preferences, the house was constructed with no right angles, and had an [...] "X-rated" [...] room with mirrored walls and a fur-covered <b>waterbed.</b> Chamberlain lived alone, relying on a great deal of automated gadgets, with two cats named Zip and Zap and several Great Dane dogs as company. In addition, Chamberlain drove a Ferrari, a Bentley, and had a Le Mans-style car called Searcher One designed and built at a cost of $750,000 in 1996. Following his death, in 1999 Chamberlain's estate was valued at $25 million.|$|E
2500|$|The search ended a {{week after}} the {{disappearance}} when Phillips' mother Melissa went to clean his room and found that his <b>waterbed</b> seemed to be [...] "leaking". Upon further examination, she discovered Maddie's body hidden inside the base of the <b>waterbed.</b> She promptly ran outside her home and went across the street to get the police.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, future company co-founder Bob Kaufman {{was injured}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident. He discovered {{the benefits of a}} <b>waterbed</b> for recuperation. The experience inspired Kaufman to become involved with <b>waterbed</b> sales, and during the 1980s, he rented space in 24 New England stores for selling waterbeds. By 1990, <b>waterbed</b> sales had dwindled, and Kaufman partnered with Gene Rosenberg (owner of Wholesale Furniture, where Kaufman had rented space for <b>waterbed</b> sales). [...] At this point, Rosenberg acquired a building in Newington, Connecticut previously owned by a furniture company that had become bankrupt. In 1991, the Newington, Connecticut location became the first Bob's Discount Furniture store. The company was initially co-owned by Rosenberg (two-thirds) and Kaufman (one-third). As time progressed, the company expanded to additional locations, often acquiring buildings that had been vacated by tenants bankrupted during the recession. By 1997, the company operated a dozen stores in Connecticut and two in western Massachusetts. The company's ability to grow during its early years in spite of unfavorable economic conditions has been partially attributed to the extensive use of commercials. In early 2005, the investment firm Saunders Karp & Megrue acquired 70 percent ownership of Bob's Discount Furniture; subsequently, Saunders Karp & Megrue was acquired by Apax Partners Worldwide in March 2005. In November 2006, Ted English, former president and CEO of TJX Companies, became the CEO of Bob's Discount Furniture, replacing Stan Adelstein, who became chairman. Adelstein retired in April 2013, with English taking over as chairman. By this point, Bob's Discount Furniture had recently expanded into Rhode Island, New Jersey, and New York. [...] Ted has led Bob's into its expansion further south into Maryland and Virginia.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, Lake Tuz was {{declared}} a specially protected area, including {{all of the}} lake surface and surrounding <b>waterbeds</b> {{and some of the}} important neighboring steppe areas. The main Turkish breeding colony of greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) is present on a group of islands {{in the southern part of}} the lake. Greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) is the second largest breeder here. Lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) is a common breeder in surrounding villages.|$|R
50|$|Raft {{construction}} differs {{depending on}} the watercourse. Rocky and windy rivers saw rafts of simple, yet sometimes smart, construction. For example, the front parts of the logs were joined together by wooden bars, while the rear parts were loosely roped together. The resulting slack allowed for easy adaptation for narrow and windy <b>waterbeds.</b> Wide and quiet rivers, like the Mississippi River, allowed huge rafts to travel in caravans and even be chained into strings.|$|R
2500|$|Mulder {{is almost}} never seen {{sleeping}} in a bed. The bedroom in his apartment (which appeared {{as late as the}} sixth season of the show's run) is apparently used for storage and is filled floor to ceiling with junk, including a couple of boxes of pornographic magazines. Instead, Mulder sleeps on his couch, often falling asleep to a blaring television. Mulder can seem to go through manic periods when worried or working on a case, contributing to or exacerbating his insomniac tendencies. Since [...] "Dreamland II" [...] where a [...] "man in black" [...] body-swaps with Mulder and takes over his life, Mulder gets his bedroom renovated and equipped with a <b>waterbed.</b> In [...] "Monday" [...] he finds himself soaked through when his <b>waterbed</b> (which he can't remember getting because Morris Fletcher got it in Dreamland) is leaking.|$|E
2500|$|After Tillson, NY32 and NY 213 turn southeast, {{cross over}} the Wallkill River in Rosendale and fork at a {{junction}} {{just to the}} south. NY213 turns northeast along the Wallkill, crossing under, but not interchanging with, the New York State Thruway (I-87). Passing Perrine's Bridge Park, NY213 enters the hamlet of Dashville as Main Street, now {{in the town of}} Esopus. At Dashville Road, NY213 turns northward along the Wallkill. The route bends northeast, [...] entering the area of Sturgeon Pool, and entering the hamlet of Rifton. In Rifton, the route is a two-lane residential street, and intersects with the northern terminus of CR16 (Old Post Road). NY213 continues north out of Rifton alongside the <b>waterbed,</b> leaving northward through the town of Esopus.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Waterbeds</b> in Trinidad! is {{the seventh}} studio album (and ninth album overall by {{including}} a greatest hits and a live album) by The Association. This album was the group's only release for Columbia Records {{as well as}} their last recorded project of the 1970s. Released in 1972, it was the last album to feature original bassist Brian Cole, who died in August that year. One last recording with Cole, the non-album track [...] "Names, Tags, Number, & Labels", was released as a single on the Mums label the following year.|$|R
50|$|Mattresses {{which are}} mostly the same are often sold under {{different}} brand names; {{two of the}} largest brands, Serta and Simmons, became owned by the same company after a private equity buyout. Simmons, founded in the late 1800s, was bought and sold multiple times and faced bankruptcy after a major decline in the bedding industry in the 2000s. The International Sleep Products Association was founded in 1915 and releases a report on U.S. mattress sales. Another association, Specialty Sleep Association, represents companies such as Innomax and Boyd Specialty focused on latex, <b>waterbeds,</b> and airbeds. However, Select Comfort, which produces airbeds (a specialty bed), {{is a member of}} the ISPA.|$|R
50|$|Some parents pose {{threats to}} infants {{due to their}} {{behaviors}} and conditions, such as smoking or drinking heavily, taking drugs, a history of skin infections, obesity, or any other specific risk-increasing traits. In addition, there are certain dangerous behaviors that increase SIDS and should be avoided whether placing a baby in a crib or co-sleeping: infants should always sleep on their backs on a firm surface (not <b>waterbeds,</b> pillows, recliners, or couches), mattresses should intersect the bedframe tightly, {{there should be no}} stuffed animals or soft toys near the baby, blankets should be light, a baby's head should never be covered, and other SIDS risk factors should be avoided.|$|R

5000|$|Motels {{which allow}} {{a room to}} be rented inexpensively for less than one full night's stay or which allow a couple not wishing to be seen {{together}} publicly to enter a room without passing through the office or lobby area have been nicknamed [...] "no-tell motels" [...] due to their long association with adultery. Even where rooms were rented overnight to middle-class travelers (and not locals or extended-stay clients) there have been ongoing problems with theft of motel property by travelers; everything from <b>waterbeds</b> to television sets to bedspreads and pillows have routinely gone missing in what one 1970s Associated Press report labelled [...] "highway robbery".|$|R

40|$|International audienceNowadays, in {{the valleys}} {{surrounding}} rivers, the problematic of flood hazard leads to observe familiar functional floodplain objects from a point of vview slightly different from those generally admitted in fluvial dynamics. Interest in microtopography and its variation thus allows us to distinguish up to four beds in a Mediterranean watercourse valley. Currently under development, the hydrogeomorphological method already has produced new results wuith the description of exceptional high <b>waterbeds</b> in some watercourses in Mediterranean France and Tunisia. Building up of numerous Mediterranean functional flood plains began during Classical Antiquity. The high water bed finegrained formations have accumulated during the Middle Ages and the Modern and Contemporary periods. Using isotopic dating, {{we were able to}} show that this trend goes on during {{the second part of the}} 20 th century and should continue in the future. Those formations are mainly produced by soil erosion due to cultural practices...|$|R
