50|$|Arc strike {{cracking}} {{occurs when}} the arc is struck but the spot is not welded. This occurs because the spot is heated above the material's upper critical temperature and then essentially quenched. This forms martensite, which is brittle and may lead to higher chances of micro-cracks. Usually the arc is struck in the <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> so this type of crack does not occur, but if the arc is struck outside of the <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> then it must be welded over to prevent the cracking. If {{this is not an}} option then the arc spot can be postheated, that is, the area is heated with an oxy-acetylene torch, and then allowed to cool slowly.|$|E
50|$|For optical {{measurement}} without active structured lighting, {{a camera}} is directed {{on the region}} of the <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> and the scene of interest is observed directly. This is used, for example, for SA welding processes in order to provide the welder with a live photograph of the <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> on the monitor.We know two semiconductor technologies for image sensing. The CCD camera (CCD: Charged Coupled Device) is the best known, most widely spread camera type, it is also used in standard video cameras.If a CMOS image sensor has been used, the high input dynamics allow, even with a burning arc, to record a usable image of the weld groove.The method of optical measuring technique with active structured lighting, mainly generated by a laser with a defined wavelength, is often used for the automation of welding processes. It is differentiated between 1, 2 and 3-D measuring systems. Since measuring in the arc directly is not possible, a defined distance (advance) which depends on the type and size of the arc itself must be maintained.|$|E
50|$|Optical sensors {{belong to}} the group of {{non-contact}} measuring, geometry-oriented sensors (Figure 1). For information retrieval, the <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> is scanned via a radiation detector which records the emitted optical radiation of the measured object. Semiconductor image sensors are applied for the detection of radiation. The optical measuring principles are differentiated into sensors with and without active structured lighting. If there is no active structured lighting, a camera is used for signal acquisition. The camera observes the workpiece and extracts the required information from the two-dimensional halftone picture. Active structured lighting means the application of a light source for the defined lighting of specified regions of the part. For the subsequent acquisition, single photo elements, lines or arrays can be used, depending on their design.|$|E

Through the arrangement of several lines along the <b>weld</b> <b>groove,</b> a further dimension is achieved which shows the change of the height profiles of the groove geometry. Through the number of the lines, the resolution in groove longitudinal direction is increasing, however, the data processing expenditure is also increasing. Similar to the projection of several parallel lines, the measurement via a projected circle or other geometrical figures on the workpiece surface is possible.|$|E
50|$|Lack of fusion is {{the poor}} {{adhesion}} of the weld bead {{to the base}} metal; incomplete penetration is a weld bead that does not start {{at the root of}} the <b>weld</b> <b>groove.</b> Incomplete penetration forms channels and crevices in the root of the weld which can cause serious issues in pipes because corrosive substances can settle in these areas. These types of defects occur when the welding procedures are not adhered to; possible causes include the current setting, arc length, electrode angle, and electrode manipulation. Defects can be varied and classified as critical or non critical. Porosity (bubbles) in the weld are usually acceptable to a certain degree. Slag inclusions, undercut, and cracks are usually unacceptable. Some porosity, cracks, and slag inclusions are visible and may not need further inspection to require their removal. Small defects such as these can be verified by Liquid Penetrant Testing (Dye check). Slag inclusions and cracks just below the surface can be discovered by Magnetic Particle Inspection. Deeper defects can be detected using the Radiographic (X-rays) and/or Ultrasound (sound waves) testing techniques.|$|E
50|$|Any {{impairment}} {{of the electric}} contact between sensor scanning element and workpiece is, {{in the case of}} electric-contact sensors, problematic, e.g. welding spatters at the shielding gas nozzle, scale and rolling skin on the workpiece surface or through a wire electrode end which has molten spheroidally and has adherence of slag.When mechanical-contact sensors are used, the scanning elements must be adapted to the respective groove shapes. Butt welds with a square butt joint preparation must have a groove gap of more than 3 mm; in overlap joints the top plate must have a thickness of more than 3 mm.The sensor must be mounted separately from the welding torch.Thus, the groove scanning is mainly carried out in a leading position in front of the torch. If the welds are mainly straight, this adjustment is no problem. It is also possible to use scanning element arrays (e.g. fork callipers or separated scanning elements for height and lateral scanning which allow scanning in the torch level and thus weld scanning which is almost free from errors. Apart from the torch guidance along a <b>weld</b> <b>groove,</b> mechanical contact sensors can also be applied for detection of the weld start and end of the weld.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{generalised}} view on {{the causes}} leading to humping during high-speed seam welding is proposed. It {{is based on the}} fact that, whenever the melt velocity in a welding bead exceeds considerably the welding speed, the <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> cannot be completely filled by melt at any location and any instant. As a consequence of solidification from the walls of the <b>weld</b> <b>groove,</b> the shape of the free cross section for the melt flow is changed {{in such a way that}} the rest melt stream experiences an upwards deflection which initiates the formation of a hump. Conservation of volume in an incompressible fluid requires that in the solidified seam regions of smaller and larger cross sections compared to that of the groove must exist. The initiation of humping is discussed for different situations in laser beam welding characterized by the aspect ratio welding depth over spot diameter. As this figure is typical for the geometry of the melt pool/ <b>weld</b> <b>groove,</b> it appears as a meaningful parameter for correlating the onset of humping...|$|E

The all weld metal approximation fails to properly account for the effect of the weld on the limit load and on plasticity distribution within the SE(B) specimen.

40|$|Dodds and Anderson {{provide a}} {{framework}} to quantify finite size and crack depth effects on fracture toughness when failure occurs at deformation levels where 1 no longer uniquely describes the state of stresses and strains {{in the vicinity of}} the crack-tip. Size effects on cleavage fracture are quantified by defining a value termed Jssy: the J to which an infinite body must be loaded to achieve the same stressed volume, and thereby the same likelihood of cleavage fracture, as in a finite body. In weld metal fracture toughness testing, mismatch between weld metal and baseplate strength can alter deformation patterns, which complicates size and crack depth effects on cleavage fracture toughness. However, the virtually limitless number of weld joint geometry / crack depth combinations preclude calculation of Jssy for each individual case. This study addresses the accuracy with which Jssy for a welded single edge notch bend, SE(B), specimen can be approximated by previously published results for homogeneous specimens. The case of a crack located on the weld joint centerline is treated. The combined effects of <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> type, degree of mismatch, and crack depth to specimen width (a/W) ratio are considered by performing plane-strain elastic-plastic finite clement analyses of SE(B) specimens containing a variety of common <b>weld</b> <b>groove</b> details. These results demonstrate virtually no effect of Â± 20 % mismatch on Jssy if the distance from the crack-tip to the weld/plate interface (Lmin) exceeds 0. 2 -inches. If Lmin falls below 0. 2 -inches, there exists a deformation (applied-J) dependent value of Lmin below which reasonably accurate Jssy estimation is possible. At higher levels of overmatch (500 / 0 to 100 %), it is no longer possible to parameterize departure of 1 ssy for a weldment from that for a homogeneous SE(B) based on Lmin alone. Weld geon 1 etry significantly influences the accuracy with which Jssy for a welded SE(B) can be approximated by Jssy for a homogeneous specimen at these extreme overmatch levels.
