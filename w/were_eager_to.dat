In the ensuing months, the Meccans sent ambush parties to Medina while Muhammad led expeditions against tribes allied with Mecca and sent raiders onto a Meccan caravan.

5|$|After the season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for his services of Taylor with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Generals owner Donald Trump had given Taylor a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> keep Taylor, took part in negotiating his way out of it. To free Taylor from the contract, the Giants had to pay Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons for Trump to release Taylor's rights, and give Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
5|$|During the AprilAugust 1832 Black Hawk War, {{between white}} {{settlers}} in the lead mining regions and Sauk Chief Black Hawk's British Band, Hamilton again served in the volunteer militia. Accounts of the war indicated that Hamilton was often {{in charge of the}} militia's indigenous allies. At the war's onset it was known that many of the Sioux and Menominee <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> join the conflict against the Sauk. Hamilton was sent to the Michigan Territory, north of Prairie du Chien, to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies. The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned Native Americans joined the war.|$|E
5|$|In August 1999, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone {{topped the}} New York Times list of best-selling fiction, and stayed {{near the top}} of the list for much of 1999 and 2000, until the New York Times split its list into children's and adult {{sections}} under pressure from other publishers who <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> see their books given higher placings. Publishers Weeklys report in December 2001 on cumulative sales of children's fiction placed Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 19th among hardbacks (over 5 million copies) and 7th among paperbacks (over 6.6million copies).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Black Hawk {{learned that}} the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi tribes were less {{supportive}} than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies. The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois had family ties to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while trying not to provoke the Americans. Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 Winnebago War, decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks with ties to the Dakotas and Menominees, most notably Waukon Decorah and his brothers, <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> fight against the British Band.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1832, {{a supply}} wagon loaded with meat and lead bars from Galena arrived at Apple River Fort around noon.

Black Hawk's forces were able to elude detection until the time they opened fire. At around 4 p.m. four couriers from Galena bound for the army camp at Dixon's Ferry arrived at the fort.

5|$|Seeing {{their leader}} fall, the Loyalists began to surrender.

(At Waxhaws, Tarleton's horse was shot, pinning him to the ground and leading his men to believe their commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of surrender.) Also, other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender.|$|E
5|$|The Guthrie Theater, {{opened in}} 1963, was {{the brainchild of}} Sir Tyrone Guthrie, who wanted to found a {{regional}} theater without the commercial constraints of Broadway. The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the New York Times, and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.|$|E

5|$|After {{production}} concluded on Harlem Nights, Bakshi {{wanted to}} distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact. Bakshi began writing the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin while editing Coonskin, and storyboarding a proposed series for ABC. The characters of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro were based upon Bakshi's high school friends, Norman Darrer and Allen Schechterman. }} Warner Bros. had previously agreed to distribute Fritz the Cat before pulling their funding from that film, but <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> option the screenplay for Hey Good Lookin, and greenlit {{the film in}} 1973. Several African American animators, including graffiti artists, were hired by Bakshi's studio, {{at a time when}} black animators were not widely employed by major animation studios. Following controversy over the film Coonskin, some black animators left Bakshi's studio in embarrassment, resulting in production problems for Hey Good Lookin.|$|E
5|$|Grant was {{president}} during the Gilded Age, {{a time of}} massive industrial wealth, railroad speculation, and extravagance that fueled unethical behavior and influence in government offices. Although Grant was not personally involved in scandal, multiple corruption charges swept through his administration, clouding Grant's historical reputation. Grant was greatly trusting of men involved in speculation, particularly wealthy Gilded Age tycoons, loyally defending his corrupt cabinet or appointees whom he believed were innocent. Grant's failure was in his poor selection of cabinet officers and how he responded to their downfalls. Grant did not stop the guilty parties prosecutions, but was often insistent about having them prosecuted. His political enemies, outraged over the scandals, <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> discredit Reconstruction, and the moral integrity of his administration. No person linked any of the scandals together, except possibly Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock, who indirectly controlled many cabinet departments and delayed federal investigations. Historians debate how effective he was at halting corruption.|$|E
