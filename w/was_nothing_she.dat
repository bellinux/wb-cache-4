500|$|The stab victim {{dies and}} Maddy blames herself, {{even though there}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could have done. [...] But Ric tells Maddy he has reconsidered and she can have an interview. Although she's happy to have this {{opportunity}} she knows that Ric is only doing it to avoid a court case.|$|E
500|$|Despite being {{relieved}} that war was over, Alice was {{appalled by the}} behaviour of Prussian troops in Hesse; Berlin took the grand duchy's railways and telegraph systems, and assessed Hesse for three million florins in indemnity. Alice wrote to her mother, who in turn wrote to Princess Victoria, who responded that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could do to relieve the [...] "painful and distressing position darling Alice was in", as it was [...] "one of the unavoidable results of this dreadful war". Influence came from the Emperor of Russia, who urged the Prussian King to allow the Grand Duke to keep his throne. The facts that the Emperor's mother was the Grand Duke's aunt, and Alice's sister being also the Prussian Crown Princess {{are likely to have}} influenced Prussia's generosity. However, Alice was angered by an untactful visit by Princess Victoria to the conquered region of Homburg, originally part of Hesse, shortly after it became Prussian territory.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't think I should enjoy it,' {{replied the}} hen doubtfully. 'And I don't think the cat {{would like it}} either.' And the cat, when asked, agreed there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> would hate so much.|$|E
6000|$|Carol was dream-strayed. The {{turbulent}} voices, even Guy Pollock being connotative beside her, <b>were</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> repeated: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's clever, she's full of life, full of activities, {{eager to}} make and arrange and order; but there's <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> <b>is,</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> makes, that doesn't centre on you." ...|$|R
50|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} {{is a love}} song in which Ryder claims there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't do for her lover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if Daisy feels up to it--" [...] said Mrs. Miller, {{in a tone}} {{impregnated}} with a {{sense of}} the magnitude of the enterprise. [...] "It seems as if there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> wouldn't undertake." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a stillness with {{a little}} joy. He could not tell her any more. Why could he not tell her any more? She felt a pang of disconsolate sadness. But it <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> went to him.|$|E
60|$|Kate {{tried to}} call for help, {{but she had no}} voice. What could she do? A boxing on the ears <b>was</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> now thought; she wished she had not called out, for it was evident that Harry was going to get a terrible whipping.|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. It {{is so good}} of you--only, you--you will {{be careful}} there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could regard as a PERSONAL allusion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not mind}} it," [...] he said; [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> the best-tempered {{woman in the}} world; but at times it is {{impossible}} to answer even for the best-tempered." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Gyp went on smiling. Between that, and {{stabbing}} these false raptures to the heart, {{there seemed}} to <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could do. The moment his hands relaxed, {{she got up and}} said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear colonel,' said Lord Montacute, 'on the contrary, {{there is}} nothing more {{interesting}} to them. Miss Mountjoy was saying only yesterday, that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> found so difficult to understand as the account of a battle, and how much she wished to comprehend it.' ...|$|E
60|$|As the day wore on, the life-blood {{seemed to}} ebb away from Ursula, {{and within the}} {{emptiness}} a heavy despair gathered. Her passion seemed to bleed to death, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> sat suspended {{in a state of}} complete nullity, harder to bear than death.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I can {{venture to}} say the poor {{appreciate}} them, too," [...] Hilda answered, bridling up a little--for there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> hated so much as class-prejudices. [...] "Besides, they need sympathy more; they have fewer comforts. I should not care to give up attending my poor people {{for the sake of}} the idle rich." ...|$|E
6000|$|The timber-merchant said, quickly, [...] "Oh, it <b>is</b> <b>nothing!</b> <b>She</b> {{must bear}} these little mishaps." [...] But {{there could be}} discerned in his face {{something}} which said [...] "I ought to have foreseen this." ...|$|R
50|$|Milly Millimurra, Jimmy's sister, who {{has three}} children. She stands {{up for what}} she {{believes}} is right and does her best {{to care for her}} children. She dislikes being treated badly, but realises there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can do.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> {{can have}} on her mind," [...] Hesba Powlett replied. [...] "You know we had trouble with her about that good-for-nothing George Forester?" [...] The doctor nodded. It was pretty well known {{throughout}} the village how matters stood.|$|R
6000|$|Of course, {{you know}} just what comes next, {{when a child is}} as lovely [...] as that: [...] She wasted quite slowly away; it was {{goodness}} was killing that cat. [...] I know it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> ate, for her taste was exceedingly nice; [...] But they said she stole Bobby's ice cream, and caught a bad cold [...] from the ice.|$|E
6000|$|Haidee was Nature's bride, {{and knew}} not this; [...] Haidee was Passion's child, born {{where the sun}} [...] Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss [...] Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one [...] Made but to love, to feel that she was his [...] Who was her chosen: what was said or done [...] Elsewhere <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> had naught to fear, [...] Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.|$|E
60|$|But this {{improbable}} iniquity he had committed, and {{now there}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could not believe of him. In the first place it was quite manifest that he was tipsy; in the next place {{it was to be}} taken as proved that all his religion was sheer hypocrisy; and finally the man was utterly shameless. She therefore stood watching for the sound of his footfall, not without some fear that he might creep out at her suddenly from among the bushes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah! there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> hates like a Fotheringham; {{but she has}} not {{the power}} over my father she once had. She {{will have to take}} up with us for very spite. But what they are to live on I do not know, unless my father keeps them.' ...|$|R
50|$|Lidi: A Terran; seventy-two Earth-years old and not {{interested}} in grandmothering. Lidi had been navigating for fifty years, and there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> doesn't know about NAFAL (nearly as fast as light) ships, although occasionally she forgets that their ship is the Shoby and calls it the Soso or the Alterra.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>nothing.</b> <b>She</b> may marry Archie if she pleases, for me. I {{shall not}} set her against him. But, Lady Clavering, {{you might as}} well tell him to get one of the stars. I don't think you can know your sister when you suppose such a match to be possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|No reign {{ever was}} more glorious or {{better for the}} people than Queen Elizabeth's. It {{was a time when}} there were many very great men living --soldiers, sailors, writers, poets--and they all loved and look up to the queen as the mother of her country. There really <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> did love like the good of her people, and somehow they all felt and knew it, and [...] "Good Queen Bess" [...] had their hearts--though she was not always right, and had some serious faults.|$|E
60|$|One {{important}} {{result of}} the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking {{almost as if they}} wanted tit-bits to eat.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> did {{not think}} of during these character-forming days. The beauty and peace of love, the {{physical}} joy of it; the problem of marriage, the terror of birth--all the things girls are supposed not to think of, and which such girls as Rose must irresistibly think of, came to her, tormenting her, shaking her to the inmost center of her nature, and through it all she seemed quite the hearty young school girl she was, for this thought was wholesome and natural, not morbid in any degree.|$|E
500|$|The Upanishad, in verses 26 to 28, {{asserts that}} Devi is [...] "Unknowable, the Endless, the Incomprehensible, the Unknown, the One and the Many." [...] The Upanishad states that Devi is the fountainhead of all mantras. All {{knowledge}} is her inherent characteristic, beyond her there <b>is</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{the pilot of}} worldly life.|$|R
50|$|Thaïle, a Gifted pixie in mysterious Thume, stands Death Watch over a neighbor, and {{receives}} her first Word of power. This earns her interest from the College, and Jain arrives at her parents’ house {{to talk to}} Thaïle. He informs her she {{will be going to}} the College next year, and there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can do about it.|$|R
50|$|Mrs. Dalton: Mary Dalton's mother. Her {{blindness}} {{serves to}} accentuate the motif of racial blindness throughout the story. Both Bigger and Max comment on how people are blind {{to the reality of}} race in America. Mrs. Dalton betrays her metaphorical blindness when she meets Mrs. Thomas. Mrs. Dalton hides behind her philanthropy and claims there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> can do for Bigger.|$|R
6000|$|For {{two years}} she had been meeting Mr. Brumley as {{confidently}} {{as though they had}} been invisible beings, and now she had to rack her brains for just what might be mistaken, what might be misconstrued. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> told herself, nothing, it was all as open as the day, and still her mind groped about for some forgotten circumstance, something gone almost out of memory that would bear misinterpretation.... How should she begin? [...] "Isaac," [...] she would say, [...] "I am being followed about London." [...] Suppose he denied his complicity! How could he deny his complicity? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She, and {{pardon me}} for repeating, was amazing. It {{is the one}} {{adequate}} word. Even the most minor adjectives applicable to her {{are bound to be}} sheer superlatives. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could not do better than any woman and than most men. Sing, play--bah!--as some rhetorician once said of old Nap, competition fled from her. Swim! She could have made a fortune and a name as a public performer. She was one of those rare women who can strip off all the frills of dress, and in simple swimming suit be more satisfying beautiful. Dress! She was an artist.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a terrible}} state of things for Rosie. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> could do; and to sit still and wait was torture {{to one of her}} restless, {{energetic}} mind. When her mistress was out of the house she could give vent to her spite by getting into Fan's room and teasing her in every way that her malice suggested. But Fan usually locked her out, and would not even open the door to take in her dinner when it was brought; then Rosie would wait until it was cold before leaving it on the landing.|$|E
60|$|FERRAND. [Out of the silence.] It <b>is</b> <b>nothing,</b> Ma'moiselle! <b>She</b> {{has failed}} to drown herself. They run her in a little.|$|R
60|$|She {{continued}} {{to teach and}} heal. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> charging <b>nothing,</b> <b>she</b> says, although she was very poor. She taught and healed gratis four years altogether, she says.|$|R
5000|$|He takes Clotilde {{dancing at}} a raucous nightspot. The singer there sings [...] "Bel Ami", {{which is about}} a scoundrel. Clotilde calls Georges Bel Ami; he {{promises}} to live up (or down) to that name. While they are out one night, Rachel spots them and makes a scene. Afterward, Clotilde writes Georges a letter in which she confesses she loves him so much that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>she</b> cannot forgive him.|$|R
