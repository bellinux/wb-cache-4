5|$|The High Court {{held that}} the plaintiffs lacked locus standi to bring the action as {{they were not the}} temple's legal owners. In any case, as there was {{evidence}} that the authorities had rational reasons for treating the temple property differently from the property of the Mission and the Church, the High Court found that there had been no breach of Article 12(1). Furthermore, the Court determined that the plaintiffs <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> inordinate delay in bringing the action.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{federal investigation}} into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced {{that two of the}} ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of dubious origins and might be seized. However, as of 2011, the federal government has not attempted to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.|$|E

5|$|In 1783, the Kodavas {{erupted in}} revolt against Tipu and threw their forces out of Coorg. In 1785, he marched into Mercara {{the capital of}} Coorg and {{addressed}} them. He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the Kodavas <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> polyandry in a speech before a gathering of Kodavas. He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub-group of matriarchal Nairs. He threatened {{that he would not}} revile or molest a single individual among them, but instead make Ahmadis (Muslims) out of the whole of them; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam. This inflammatory speech with false accusations of polyandry and an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him. Tipu seized nearly 70,000 Hindus of Coorg along with their king, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, and held them captive at Seringapatam. They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics. From 1786 until 1789, even the Nairs of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} exaggerating the atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, making the population decline look worse than it actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic – ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans. The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> similar exaggerations.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutor John McGohey did not {{assert that}} the {{defendants}} had a specific plan to violently overthrow the US government, but rather alleged that the CPUSA's philosophy generally advocated the violent overthrow of governments. The prosecution called witnesses who were either undercover informants, such as Angela Calomiris and Herbert Philbrick, or former communists who had become disenchanted with the CPUSA, such as Louis Budenz. The prosecution witnesses testified about the goals and policies of the CPUSA, and they interpreted the statements of pamphlets and books (including The Communist Manifesto) and works by such authors as Karl Marx and Joseph Stalin. Belknap (1994), p 209. The prosecution argued that the texts advocated violent revolution, and that by adopting the texts as their political foundation, the defendants <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> advocating violent overthrow of the government.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, in {{reaction}} to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.|$|E
5|$|In 1926–1927, a royal {{commission}} into bribery {{of members}} of the police by bookmakers was conducted, finding that it was probable that two detectives and several plainclothes constables <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> taking bribes. After considering the report of the royal commission, Leane submitted his own report to the government, in which he criticised the vague nature of its findings, and while accepting that some police may have accepted bribes, he asserted that corruption was not widespread. One detective and three constables were offered the opportunity to resign and took it, and another plainclothes constable was returned to uniformed duty. During the course of the royal commission, several other plainclothes constables had resigned. Before the commission concluded, Leane recommended to the Chief Secretary, James Jelley, who was the minister responsible for the police, that the plainclothes branch of the police be abolished, with uniformed constables to be rotated through those duties as required. His recommendation was accepted. In January 1927, the design by Leane's brother-in-law, Louis Laybourne Smith, was selected for the National War Memorial in Adelaide. In early 1928, Leane became a foundation member and the inaugural president of the Legacy Club of Adelaide, established to assist the dependents of deceased ex-servicemen.|$|E
25|$|It {{was said}} {{to the public and}} press that workers {{involved}} in this conflict <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> outrageous conduct at the farm, which motivated accusations brought forth before the authorities whereby the police had to intervene in order to safeguard company assets. The company told that conflict arose causing substantial losses due to unlawful stoppage of agricultural activity.|$|E
50|$|The court further distinguishes {{that if a}} {{defendant}} intends to kill a target and also kills others in the kill zone, then they <b>are</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> the murder of each person killed, i.e., <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> multiple counts of murder. However, if the defendant by the same act fails to kill anyone, defendant <b>is</b> only <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> a single count of attempted murder by the act.|$|R

25|$|Official {{estimates}} of forced religious conversions were put at 180, but unofficial estimates suggest {{a figure of}} between 1000 and 1500. Arya Samaj sources reported a number of 1766, adding that the total might exceed 2500, the highest estimate made. Out {{of a total of}} almost 50,000 Mappilas involved in the rebellion, 678 were charged with the crime of forced religious conversion, not all of who <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> involvement.|$|E
25|$|In April 1938, Papadima {{signed a}} congratulatory article {{addressed}} to the justice system. This came after a tribunal ordered avant-garde writer Geo Bogza to be imprisoned for publishing some frankly erotic poems. On the occasion, Papadima furnished a list of other writers who, he claimed, <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> that offense: Aderca, H. Bonciu, and Max Blecher. The text referred to the former two solely under their Jewish names (respectively, Froim Aderca and Haimovici Bonciu), which neither were using in their literary careers.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{libel case}} against John Murray, {{not because he}} was the author, but because he was the {{publisher}} of a book that libelled Lecesne and Escoffery. The case was {{based on the fact that}} the book recorded that the politicians in Jamaica considered Lecesne and Escoffery guilty of a criminal conspiracy. This case was held in Britain in order that it should not be biased. If they <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> a conspiracy, then under the 1818 Alien Act they could be transported for life if they were born elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|During the {{apartheid}} years South Africa's security forces were also {{accused of using}} extrajudicial means {{to deal with their}} political opponents. After his release, Nelson Mandela would refer to these acts as proof of a Third Force. This was denied vehemently by the administration of F.W. de Klerk. Later the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu would find that both military and police agencies such as the Civil Cooperation Bureau and C10 based at Vlakplaas <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> gross human rights violations. This led the International Criminal Court to declare apartheid a crime against humanity.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, an RAF {{board of}} inquiry ruled {{that it was}} {{impossible}} to establish the exact cause of the accident. This ruling was subsequently overturned by two senior reviewing officers, who stated the pilots <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> gross negligence for flying too fast and too low in thick fog. This finding proved to be controversial, especially in light of irregularities and technical issues surrounding the then-new Chinook HC.2 variant which were uncovered. A Parliamentary inquiry conducted in 2001 found the previous verdict of gross negligence on the part of the crew to be 'unjustified'. In 2011, an independent review of the crash cleared the crew of negligence.|$|E

It is unknown if Floyd was aware of how the regiment was planned to be used. The regiment of 30 men and boats assembled on Silver Creek in Clark County and left from the Falls of the Ohio to sail downriver to Natchez, Louisiana. They expected to join army troops there but were betrayed by General James Wilkinson. They were unable {{to meet up with}} the rest of assembling regiments because President Thomas Jefferson, already aware of the plot, decided the men <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> treason and ordered them all arrested. Floyd fled Louisiana and returned to Indiana where he was captured.|$|E

Surely it would have been no diminution of the sternness of new republican virtue, no disgrace to the magnanimity of a great nation, if it had pardoned the perfidy which its own oppression had occasioned, if it had remitted the punishment of the perjury of the king to the tribunal of Him by whom kings reign and princes decree justice.|$|R
25|$|According to a {{story from}} Tabari on the authory of Ibn Masud and Ibn Abbas, Harut and Marut (Arabic: هاروت وماروت) are fallen angels who asked God to destroy mankind after humans {{committed}} acts of disobience around the world. Consequently, God gave them humanlike urges and made them descend to Earth {{in order to determine}} whether or not Satan would have authority over the angels; they would not do better than humans for long. On Earth, they entertained and acted upon sexual desires and <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> idol worship, whereupon they even killed an innocent witness. For their deeds, they were not allowed to ascend to Heaven again. Those who reject the angelic origin of Harut and Marut prefer to view them as kings (malikayn) than angels (malak). Their origin story is not in the Quran.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 2012, nine American jurors {{ruled that}} Samsung {{had to pay}} Apple $1.05 billion in damages for violating six of its patents on {{smartphone}} technology. The award was still less than the $2.5 billion requested by Apple. The decision also ruled that Apple did not violate five Samsung patents cited in the case. Samsung decried the decision saying that the move could harm innovation in the sector. It also followed a South Korean ruling stating that both companies <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> infringing on each other's intellectual property. In first trading after the ruling, Samsung shares on the Kospi index fell 7.7%, the largest fall since October 24, 2008, to 1,177,000 Korean won. Apple then sought to ban the sales of eight Samsung phones (Galaxy S 4G, Galaxy S2 AT, Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, Galaxy S2 T-Mobile, Galaxy S2 Epic 4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Droid Charge and Galaxy Prevail) in the United States which has been denied by the court.|$|E
25|$|The defendants' cases {{took two}} paths. The defendants' lawyers {{obtained}} {{reversal of the}} verdicts by the Arkansas Supreme Court in six of the cases: Ed Ware, Will Wordlow, Albert Giles, Joe Fox, Alf Banks Jr., and John Martin (henceforth Ware et al.) due to a defect in {{the wording of the}} jury verdict. The court ruled that the jury had failed to specify whether the defendants <b>were</b> <b>guilty</b> <b>of</b> murder in the first or second degree; those cases were accordingly sent back to the lower court for retrial. They were convicted again, but the state supreme court overturned the verdicts, saying that discrimination against black jurors (the juries were all-white) was contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Because the lower court had not acted upon their cases {{for more than two years}} by April 1923, under Arkansas law the defendants were entitled to be released. Jones applied for and gained an order for their release from the Arkansas Supreme Court on June 25, 1923.|$|E
