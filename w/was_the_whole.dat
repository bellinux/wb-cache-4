500|$|The {{music on}} Stone Temple Pilots was {{influenced}} by various styles, most notably country music and 1960s and 1970s rock. Various amps and vintage guitars from Dean's and Robert's personal collections were used to produce the desired sounds. Dean's guitars included two 1970s Gibson Les Pauls, a 1956 Stratocaster, three Telecasters dating between 1965 and 1966, and a 1960s double-cut Danelectro. An assortment of amps were used, including 10-, 15-, and 20-watt Valco speakers and late 1960s 18- and 20-watt Marshall combos. Robert recorded the bass lines to [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] with a 1950s six-string Danelectro Longhorn bass, and Weiland used Robert's collection of vintage microphones for some of his vocals. Dean exclaimed, [...] "Most bands do a retro thing and apologize for it. We're unapologetically retro here. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> idea!" ...|$|E
500|$|Tanner {{joined the}} Ted Weems band {{as a singer}} in 1929 and became a {{prominent}} feature of the group. Tanner's whistling talent was unveiled by accident. In high spirits {{on their way to}} their next performance, the band members were singing, yelling and whistling on the bus. [...] When Tanner joined in, Weems was impressed enough to add a whistling segment to one of the band's sets. [...] Tanner whistled the Show Boat song, [...] "Make Believe"; the audience asked for an encore. Tanner's whistling became so popular that Perry Como, another featured performer in the band, said “The whistler <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> band.” [...] On occasion, Tanner’s lips would pucker up, interfering with his whistling. [...] Although generally noted for his graciousness as a bandleader, Weems would have fun at Tanner’s expense, running him through the most difficult songs in his repertoire when he noticed Tanner was struggling.|$|E

I think {{that by the end of}} that session we all knew that nothing was going to be used. They just said, let's forget it." [...] Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited [...] to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. [...] Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in [...] "two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> album." [...] In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as [...] 1 October and states that [...] "Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album" [...] contending that this is the reason for the different [...] "lounge-jazz sound" [...] on this track. Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.|$|E

500|$|Rings Around the World was the Super Furry Animals' {{first album}} for Epic Records {{following}} the demise, in 1999, {{of their previous}} label Creation {{and the success of}} 2000's Mwng, which was issued on the band's own label, Placid Casual. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a [...] "laid back and sort of wiped clean" [...] record with Rings.... In a 2008 interview with Uncut Rhys described the album as [...] "a very ambitious project" [...] stating that [...] "We were trying to make a blockbuster album {{that was going to be}} like The Eagles ... We were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting." [...] Rings... was originally going to be called Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It and released as a double album containing 75–90 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was [...] "into the excess of it, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> point". The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.|$|E
500|$|Gary Burton, of Berklee College of Music, {{noted the}} {{consistent}} innovation present throughout the album, stating: [...] "It wasn’t just one tune {{that was a}} breakthrough, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> record. When new jazz styles come along, the first few attempts to do it are usually kind of shaky. Early Charlie Parker records were like this. But with Kind of Blue [...] all sound like they’re fully into it." [...] Along with the Dave Brubeck Quartet's Time Out (1959) and Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960), Kind of Blue has often been recommended by music writers as an introductory jazz album, for similar reasons: the music on both records is very melodic, and the relaxed quality of the songs makes the improvisation easy for listeners to follow, without sacrificing artistry or experimentation. Upon {{the release of the}} 50th anniversary collector's edition of the album, a columnist for All About Jazz stated [...] "Kind of Blue heralded the arrival of a revolutionary new American music, a post-bebop modal jazz structured around simple scales and melodic improvisation. Trumpeter/band leader/composer Miles Davis assembled a sextet of legendary players to create a sublime atmospheric masterpiece. Fifty years after its release, Kind of Blue continues to transport listeners to a realm all its own while inspiring musicians to create to new sounds—from acoustic jazz to post-modern ambient—in every genre imaginable." [...] Later in an interview, renowned hip-hop artist and rapper Q-Tip reaffirmed the album's reputation and influence when discussing the significance of Kind of Blue, stating [...] "It's like the Bible—you just have one in your house." [...] The 2014 album Blue by Mostly Other People Do the Killing is a note-for-note reproduction of Kind of Blue.|$|E
