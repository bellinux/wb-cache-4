In a 2009 interview, Cross praised the planning for the invasion and the removal of Saddam Hussein, but said that he [...] "was very keen that we thought through carefully the postwar aspects of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do once the military campaign was over. And I think it's now very public knowledge that that was not well handled. It was not well thought through, it was not well executed. And we lived with the consequences of that." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a number of up-tempo songs before {{expanding}} to a variety of tempos for its second half. Vedder attributed the faster and more aggressive songs to the band writing a lot of material that kept getting pared down, with the band leaving behind mid-tempo songs, while Ament suggested that {{it was because of the}} band balancing recording and touring which resulted in [...] "physicality... from being out on the road." [...] The band attempted to create an environment in which McCready and drummer Matt Cameron could play much as they do live. Ament said that there was [...] "a lot of honing of the guitars and vocals in the middle and toward the end," [...] which resulted in the album sounding [...] "more polished." [...] On the overall feeling of the album, Ament said, [...] "The band playing in a room—that came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> for." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] was {{originally}} written by Natalie Hemby and Blu Sanders in 2008. The idea of writing the song came from Hemby. She explained [...] "My friend Blu Sanders and I were together, and he goes, ‘Have you ever met Lindsay Champan?’ And I was like, ‘Nope!’ Basically he was like, ‘Why don’t we write with her? She has an absolutely gorgeous R voice.’ He was like ‘Let’s {{get together and}} see what we can develop." [...] Hemby also admitted that the song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time. She added, [...] "It had an Al Green-ish feel with a '70s throwback kind of vibe, and that's kind of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> for with her sound." [...] Once the collaboration was completed, the song was never recorded and Hemby said that it [...] "just kind of fell by the wayside". Being a good friend with Clarkson, Sanders decided to take the initiative to send the song with a few other songs to the singer.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When you make your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E

They are going through <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> through." [...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E

'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. [...] "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do." [...] Cauty: [...] "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{work for}} Pearl Jam's {{follow-up}} to Riot Act began after its {{appearance on the}} 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of Sony Music Entertainment (then known as Sony BMG), though J has since folded into RCA Records. The band's eighth studio album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl Jam as {{a return to the}} band's early sound, and McCready compared the new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview. Ament said, [...] "The band playing in a room—that came across. There’s a kind of immediacy to the record, and that’s <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> for." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "in a world full of boys sent to do a man's job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas." [...] Current socio-political issues in the United States are addressed on the album. [...] "World Wide Suicide", a song criticizing the Iraq War and U.S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam's first number one on that chart since [...] "Who You Are" [...] in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when [...] "Given to Fly" [...] reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl Jam also included the singles [...] "Life Wasted" [...] and [...] "Gone".|$|E

We were referring to it as 'sexual intimidation,' 'sexual coercion,' 'sexual exploitation on the job.' None of those names seemed quite right.

Jay Joyce, {{who had played}} guitar on the Wallflowers' Bringing Down the Horse agreed to produce the album. [...] Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than {{they had in the}} past. [...] Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. [...] Dylan {{and the rest of the}} band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. [...] Joyce explained: [...] "Jakob came to Nashville and we sat down and I asked him to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn’t really know going in <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do.

Around December 2004, the group signed to the label. As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show), fans on the Internet began to bash the group. [...] "Almost right away we {{knew what was going to}} happen," [...] Ross explained in a 2006 interview.

On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover.

[...] Retrieved on January 18, 2010. [...] The premiere will introduce a new narrative technique to the show, following flashbacks in the first five seasons, flashforwards in the third and fourth seasons and time travel in the fifth season. [...] According to Lindelof, who is apprehensive that the audience will not understand or reject it, [...] "the show demands constant shifts to best tell the story. [...] We've known <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to do for a couple years now and there's been a tremendous amount of work setting up the premise so it would work." [...] Lindelof has commented that the sixth season will most resemble the first for the show, even including characters sparsely seen since, saying, [...] "We want the show to feel like a loop is closing with this final year", to which Carlton Cuse added that when the characters in the first season [...] "were running around the jungle, things felt intense and surprising. [...] We have a way that we're going to be able to do that in the final season too." [...] Cuse has also stated, [...] "We feel tonally it's most similar to the first season of the show. [...] narrative device … is creating some emotional and heartfelt stories, and we want the audience to have a chance in the final season to remember the entire history of the show … We're hoping to achieve a circularity of the entire journey so the ending is reminiscent of the beginning." [...] Cuse further explained that the new narrative [...] "doesn't require either a deep investment or in-depth knowledge about the series", keeping in line with ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson's conclusion that [...] "you really don't have to have seen the show [...] [...] There will be stuff that will go completely over your head for sure, but because of the way that they're telling this last season, it is this beautiful standalone conclusion." [...] For years, Lindelof and Cuse have responded to theories about the greater meaning and answers of the show by pointing out that viewers did not have adequate information to theorize well. [...] Lindelof finally conceded that [...] "by the end of the season premiere of season six, you will have pretty much all the fundamental building blocks you need to put together a...theory as to what it all means and where the show [...] end." [...] Confronted that the bomb detonating would force a timeline change and thus render the past five seasons pointless, Damon Lindelof responded with [...] "Trust us." [...] While producing the fourth season, Lindelof said, [...] "We want people to believe in the stakes of the show. [...] The problem with alternative realities is that you never know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you. [...] We want the audience to believe that the jeopardy is real. [...] Postulating alternative realities would be an escape valve that would be damaging that as a narrative value … Carlton and I are PRO time-space continuum bending! [...] But we're ANTI-paradox.
