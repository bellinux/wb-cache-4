5|$|All other cerium {{isotopes}} are synthetic and radioactive.

All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half-lives under four days, {{and most of them}} have half-lives under ten minutes.

5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and repetitive compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. Repetitive compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality <b>while</b> <b>that</b> of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity.
