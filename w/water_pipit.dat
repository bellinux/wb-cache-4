5|$|A {{new species}} of feather mite, Proctophyllodes schwerinensis, was {{discovered}} on the <b>water</b> <b>pipit,</b> {{which is also a}} host to the fleas Ceratophyllus borealis and Dasypsyllus gallinulae. Along with other Motacillidae species, the <b>water</b> <b>pipit</b> is a host of the protozoan parasite Haemoproteus anthi.|$|E
5|$|The <b>water</b> <b>pipit</b> {{is closely}} related to the Eurasian rock pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the <b>water</b> <b>pipit</b> is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The <b>water</b> <b>pipit</b> in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also {{typically}} much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.|$|E
5|$|The <b>water</b> <b>pipit</b> is hunted by {{birds of}} prey {{including}} the Eleonora's falcon, and eggs and young may be taken by terrestrial predators including stoats and snakes.

40|$|Abstract Studies {{relating}} reproduction to food avail-ability {{are usually}} restricted to food quantity, but ignore food {{quality and the}} effects of habitat structure on obtaining the food. This is particularly true for insec-tivorous birds. In this study we relate measures of repro-ductive success, time of reproduction and nestling size of <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> (Anthus spinoletta) to biomass, taxo-nomic composition and nutritional content of available food, and to vegetation structure and distance to feed-ing sites. Clutch size was positively correlated with the proportion of grass at the feeding sites, which facili-tates foraging. This suggests that <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> adapt their clutch size to environmental conditions. Also, pipits started breeding earlier and produced more fledglings when abundant food and a large proportion of grass were available, probably because these condi-tions allow the birds to gain more energy in less time. The number of fledglings was positively correlated with the energy content of available food. No significant relationships were found between feeding conditions and nestling size or the time that nestlings took to fledge. This suggests that <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> do not invest more in individual nestlings when food conditions are favourable but rather start breeding earlier and pro-duce more young. Taxonomic composition and nutri-tional content of prey were not correlated with any of the reproductive parameters, indicating that profit-ability rather than quality of food affects reproductive success...|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian rock pipit's song is a {{sequence}} of about twenty tinkling cheepa notes followed by a rising series of thin gee calls, and finishing with a short trill.

40|$|While {{many studies}} on {{foraging}} have related energy gain to the density {{and the size}} of prey, only few have investigated whether and how habitat structure modifies the gain through affecting foraging success. In this study the influences of habitat structure and prey characteristics on the foraging success of <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> (Anthus sp. spinoletta) were investigated experimentally. The birds take longer to find prey in tall than in short vegetation. The effects of vegetation on searching times differ between prey types. These differences are probably caused by variation in prey behaviour and in cryptic coloration, but not by prey size. Searching times increase with decreasing density for mealworms and tipulids, but not for caterpillars. Handling large prey items requires more time than handling smaller prey. Tipulids and caterpillars, which were offered alive, are handled for a longer time than dead mealworms of corresponding size. The success of attacks on flying insects is probably influenced by the prey's flight speed: Fast houseflies are missed more often than slow tipulids. Overall the results show that the time costs of foraging <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> are influenced to a comparable degree by vegetation structure, by prey density and by other specific prey characteristics such as camouflage, hiding behaviour or agility. The amount of food gathered per unit time is determined primarily by factors that affect searching times, and less by handling and travelling times. Insertion of our data into an optimal diet model predicts that <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> should be generalist foragers which agrees with the observed behaviour...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} for free-living insectivorous <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> (Anthus spinoletta) whether prey is chosen according to biochemical quality as measured by protein, lipid, carbohydrate, energy and water contents and/or according to profitability as measured by density, size and catchability.

Uni- and multivariate statistics detected no relations between food preference and nutrient contents, but revealed that larger prey items are fed to nestlings more than smaller ones, both for all prey taken together and within individual taxa.

40|$|Variation in avian {{reproductive}} success is often caused by differences among territories in food supply, safety from predators and microclimatic {{conditions at the}} nest. Yet, in some habitats these components of territory quality, and hence future {{reproductive success}}, are difficult to assess {{at the time of}} settlement. Here, we analyse territory quality for <b>Water</b> <b>Pipits</b> breeding in an unpredictable alpine habitat and relate it to settlement patterns and reproductive success. In the study area, prey biomass differed between various vegetation types and steadily increased during the breeding season. Territory-specific prey biomass was also negatively correlated to snow cover during the pre-breeding period. Males, on average, arrived prior to females, and both sexes settled earlier in prey-rich than in prey-poor areas. Early settling males also occupied larger territories, early settling females showed a longer time lag between settlement and clutch initiation than late ones. However, prey biomass, territory size and time lag as well as male and female age were not related to clutch size and number of fledglings per brood and season. The only factor significantly determining reproductive success was the occurrence of nest predation for which we could not find an environmental predictor. Apparently, the birds could not either, because both sexes settled independent of later predation. In the discussion we address the question why <b>Water</b> <b>Pipits</b> cannot reliably assess habitat quality when choosing a territory and what alternatives they have...|$|R
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the <b>water</b> <b>pipit.</b> Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily distinguishable from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
5|$|The water pipit's feeding {{habitat is}} damp grassland, {{rather than the}} rocky coasts favoured by the Eurasian rock pipit. The <b>water</b> <b>pipit</b> feeds mainly {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, {{including}} crickets and grasshoppers, beetles, snails, millipedes and spiders. Barkflies, true flies, caterpillars and homopterans can form a large part of the diet of fledglings. Birds close to snow fields take insects specialised for that habitat such as the springtails Isotoma saltans (the glacier flea) and I. nivalis, and the scorpion fly Boreus izyemalis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>water</b> <b>pipit</b> has a {{complete}} moult between July and September, {{although there is}} considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage {{as soon as a}} month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult {{is similar to that of}} the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.|$|E
40|$|A basic {{but rarely}} tested {{assumption}} in optimal foraging {{theory is that}} positive relationships exist between the foraging pattern of an animal, its short-term benefits in feeding, and its long-term fitness. We present evidence for these relationships for a central place foraging situation. We studied the foraging behavior of adult <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> (Anthus sp. spinoletta) feeding nestlings in an Alpine habitat near Davos, Switzerland, with the following results: (1) searching effort decreases with increasing distance from the nest, (2) the amount of prey {{and the proportion of}} large items brought to the nest increases with increasing foraging distance, (3) <b>water</b> <b>pipits</b> do not forage according to habitat availability, but prefer vegetation types with the highest food density (mainly grass and herbs) and avoid those with the lowest, and (4) this selectivity is only expressed when the birds forage more than 50 m from the nest, i. e., usually outside the territory. Among the several potential interpretations of these results, the most parsimonious is that foraging decisions are based on profitability, i. e., on the net energy gain per time unit. Additionally, we found that food conditions translate into fitness: the number of fledglings per nest is related positively to the average prey biomass at the foraging place and negatively to the average distance between the foraging place and the nest. Maximum economic distances, which were predicted from this food-fitness relationship, agreed well with the actual foraging distances observed. This suggests a dose connection between foraging decisions and fitness. In addition to the theoretical issues, some conservation issues are also briefly discusse...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] {{tract of}} land {{including}} the lake and surrounding mountains has been designated a nature reserve.

Over half of the reserve, comprising , has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as breeding or passage migrants.

50|$|Another form of defence is {{the taste}} of the {{butterfly}}. Similar to the monarch butterfly, the Apollo butterfly produces a repulsive taste to its predator. The butterfly seems to get this foul taste from its plant host, the Sedum stenopetalum. There is a bitter tasting cyanoglucoside, sarmentonsin, which is found in both the butterfly and the plant. There is a much higher concentration of sarmentonsin in the wings as opposed {{to the rest of the}} body. The high concentration in the wings indicates that the wings of the butterfly would taste much worse comparatively. A common predator, nesting <b>water</b> <b>pipits,</b> have evolved a strategy to avoid the poor taste of the butterfly; the bird will remove the wings before consuming the body. In theory, this will get rid of the poor tasting elements of the butterfly, leaving only the nutritious body.|$|R
