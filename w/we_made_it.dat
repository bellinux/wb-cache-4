It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E

So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like {{they really wanted to}} know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E

Sneak King is the game that Burger King had creative control over, and which was envisioned based on the King commercials. Oliver stated, [...] "Sneak King is derived by them, purely from their commercials. It was basically 'here's our commercials, {{we have to have}} a video game around them.' They threw in all their ideas, and <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> work." [...] Originally, Sneak King was designed as a tile-based puzzle game, but it soon evolved into a Spy vs Spy caper with multiple Kings who are [...] "trying to out-deliver one another while laying traps for their enemies".|$|E

500|$|Fantasia {{began to}} make a profit from its $2.28 million budget after its return to theaters on December 17, 1969. The film was {{promoted}} with a psychedelic-styled advertising campaign, and it became popular among teenagers and college students who reportedly appreciated it as a psychedelic experience. Animator Ollie Johnston recalled that young people [...] "thought we were on a trip when <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it...</b> every time we'd go to talk to a school or something, they'd ask us what we were on." [...] The release is also noted for the controversial removal of four scenes from The Pastoral Symphony over racial stereotyping. Fantasia was issued on a regular basis, typically for exhibition in art houses in college towns, until the mid-1970s.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{criticism}} towards Moore's Boston accent in the series, executive producer Robert Carlock, {{who is from}} Boston, defended Moore. In an interview with New York magazine, Carlock said, [...] "I grew up with people like that. Not everyone talks like that in Boston, but I think she's enough of an actress to pull it off." [...] When asked if her accent [...] "sounded realistic", he noted, [...] "I'm {{going to go with}} that. I know people who sound like that." [...] In response to the accent, Moore explained [...] "I went to school in Boston and worked with a lot of guys from Dorchester, so that's where [...] came from. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> thick... for humor's sake, but then again, not really. There are folks with seriously heavy accents there, and they are proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{direction}} of the film, Selick reflected, [...] "It's as though he [...] laid the egg, and I sat on it and hatched it. He wasn't involved in a hands-on way, but his hand is in it. It was my job {{to make it look like}} 'a Tim Burton film', which is not so different from my own films." [...] When asked on Burton's involvement, Selick claimed, [...] "I don't want to take away from Tim, but he was not in San Francisco when <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it.</b> He came up five times over two years, and spent no more than eight or ten days in total." [...] Walt Disney Feature Animation contributed with some use of second-layering traditional animation. Burton found production somewhat difficult because he was directing Batman Returns and in pre-production of Ed Wood.|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Suttirat Anne Larlarb {{says the}} real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck jumper {{at any of}} the launches: [...] "The turtleneck was the off book decision. In those 3 actual launches, in real life, he never wore that. In the 1998 portion of the film, in real life he was wearing a dark greyish/brownish suit. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it. As we got closer to the time of filming, I thought we'd set up rules for 1984, we'd set up rules for 1988 – there's so much of the film that's about design and he was about design." [...] Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional, believing that wearing the attire [...] "felt like I had arrived at [...] vision, that the person had arrived." [...] Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming, and wanted to [...] "give the audience kind of a payoff." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written at the ocean's point of view, {{detailing}} the human's evolution. According to Jason Killingsworth from Paste magazine, it calls listeners' attention to [...] "Mother Oceania" [...] {{from which the}} singer believes all life emerged, whilst she sings: [...] "You have done well for yourselves / Since you left my wet embrace / And crawled ashore [...] ". The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla, [...] "jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling, spitfire cadence of Rahzel's beatbox", according to the reviewer. The last line from the song, [...] "Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why", is about how [...] "we were all little jellyfish or whatever before <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> on to land", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as [...] "frank sensuality". [...] "Oceania" [...] also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that [...] "the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [...] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins. Here she imagines herself as the sea itself, proud of all the belegged creatures she's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years. It's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune".|$|E
500|$|On 1August 1986, U2 regrouped in Dublin {{to resume}} {{work on the}} album and begin the {{recording}} stage proper. During this more intense phase of the sessions, the group began {{to work at the}} Edge's newly purchased house, Melbeach, in seaside Monkstown. Lanois said of Melbeach, [...] "That was less of a rock 'n' roll room but <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> work. I think {{there were a lot of}} headaches, isolating people and having to build baffles around the place." [...] The Edge called the house [...] "more sombre" [...] but said it had a [...] "solid unpretentious quality that seemed to hold the energy in". [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] and [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] were among the songs that evolved at Melbeach. Lanois said that most of the record was done there, and that it was the preferred location for mixing. Writing and recording alternated between the two houses and Windmill Lane Studios. In late August during Hurricane Charley, U2 were visited at Danesmoate by Robbie Robertson, the former guitarist of the Band. Robertson was in Ireland to complete his self-titled debut solo album that he had begun with Lanois. Together, U2 and Robertson recorded the tracks [...] "Sweet Fire of Love" [...] and [...] "Testimony", both of which appear on Robertson's album.|$|E

500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a scene in}} which the survivors pull a bloated walker out of a well in order to prevent contamination of the water. Such attempts prove to be unsuccessful, as all of the water retention severs the walker in half. Greg Nicotero, the special effects director for The Walking Dead, collaborated with KNB Efx Group to produce the sequence. Nicotero {{received a phone call from}} staff members of the company two hours after leaving production offices. They devised and expressed plans of creating a scenario in which a walker falls into a well. Nicotero worked with KNB Efx Group in several other films in the past. [...] "One of the things we've noticed—looking at some morgue research and cadaver research—is that everything gets really swollen," [...] he articulated. [...] "The liquid saturates the skin so much that it swells up, and the skin starts to split. That was one of the things that we really wanted to play up." [...] A costume was sculpted using a body and a head cast. It was composed of three layers; a thin skin-like substance covers the exterior of the suit, followed by a layer of silicone and a layer of foam in the costume's center. A mask that was previously utilized in the action horror film Grindhouse (2007) was used as part of the costume. Nicotero inserted water balloons between the silicone and foam layering. He explained that as the performer begins to move, the liquid transfers from one side of the costume to another. Nicotero added: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out of foam latex, it would've been stiff. But we used silicone that was heavily plasticized—which means that the silicone was really soft." [...] The suit weighed approximately sixty pounds.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>it.</b> But we did." ...|$|E
