5|$|In 1861, Parry married Jane Thomas. She was the {{daughter}} of Welsh immigrants and the sister of Gomer Thomas, who published many of Parry's early compositions. The couple had three sons and two daughters. The older children were born when the family was still living in Danville; only Parry's youngest child was born in Wales. Two of Parry's three sons died after the family moved to Penarth. Parry's youngest son, William, died in 1892; his oldest son, Joseph Haydn, died two years later. <b>While</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Parry's children are said to have had musical talent, his eldest, Joseph Haydn, followed in his father's footsteps as a composer and teacher.|$|E
5|$|In the High Court Colin Rimer QC, sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge, {{held that}} since the shares were all identical, the lack of {{segregation}} between them did not invalidate the trust. The standard case in this area, Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd, was distinguished because the subject matter there was potentially different, <b>while</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Moss's shares were identical. Rimer J instead cited with approval Rollestone v National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis, a decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota where it was held {{that there was no}} need for segregation in such a situation.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It {{was a chance to}} gain a psychological advantage. Given Hamence's early struggles in the English conditions, which saw him make only 161 runs at 26.83 in his first six innings, <b>while</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> Australia's first-choice top six had made centuries,N- he was not selected; Australia amassed 552 and won by an innings.|$|E

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} may come across one other player {{temporarily}} connected to their game. When players approach each other they charge one another's scarves. They cannot {{communicate with each}} other beyond patterns of singing. Players can help each other by activating strips of cloth or showing paths, but cannot hinder each other and are not necessary for completing any level. When two players finish a section {{at the same time they}} remain together into the next one; otherwise they are connected to new players when they move on. <b>While</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the figures generally look the same, without distinguishing characteristics, individual players can be told apart by unique symbols which are shown floating in the air when they sing and are displayed on their robes at all times. The entire game takes about two to three hours to complete.|$|E

5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward from its current southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls <b>while</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic circle with NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} Britain, Seymour was celebrated and {{rewarded with a}} baronetcy for his second victory in {{less than six months}} <b>while</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his {{officers}} were promoted. Niémen was purchased into the Navy for the sum of £29,979-2-10d, which was split between the government, the crew {{and a number of other}} parties. The share that went to the captors came under dispute: Mends had no intention of abiding by Seymour's agreement with Maitland and refused to allow Emerald to share in the prize money. Seymour and Maitland took Mends to court and the ensuing legal battle lasted years, Mends deliberately exaggerating his role in the capture of Niémen in public (although privately admitting that the victory was entirely Seymour's). Seymour and Mends became bitter enemies and their animosity continued throughout their lives, although both remained in the Navy and had successful careers. Forty years later, the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} anthem is frequently played at sign-ons and sign-offs of TV {{and radio stations}} in Singapore, but that use of the anthem has declined somewhat {{by the emergence of}} 24-hour TV channels and radio stations. Media Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel NewsAsia, for example, played the anthem just before 6:00 am daily to signal the start of their respective channel's broadcast day; <b>while</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its owned radio stations begin their day by playing the abridged version of the anthem (consisting of the first six bars) at exactly 6:00 am, except Malay station Warna 94.2FM which plays it at 5:00 am as a way of protecting the protocol from reaching the Islamic Azan Subuh (which occurs between around 5:25 and 5:58 am).|$|E

25|$|In 1937, {{full-blown}} war erupted between Japan and China, and Ikeda's eldest brother, Kiichi, {{was drafted}} into military service.

25|$|Norrie {{disease is}} a genetic {{disorder}} caused by mutations in the NDP gene, located on Xp11.4 (GeneID: 4693). It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men {{will not have the}} mutation, <b>while</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> their daughters will be genetic carriers of the mutation. They also usually show no clinical symptoms, but will inherit the mutation to 50% of their offspring. Daughters receiving the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms.|$|E
