Over half of the work is unpainted, essentially bare canvas. According to the theologian and curator Friedhelm Mennekes, the viewer's attention is thus solely focused [...] "on the figure in agony on the cross, or more precisely: on the mouth, gaping and distorted in its cry". The body of the chimera, or hybrid bird, is rendered with light paint, and from it hang narrow red streams of paint, indicating the drips and spatter of blood. Bacon uses pentimenti to emphasise the hopelessness of the animal's death throes.|$|E

But as the tendency of the influence of phosphor particle size is well reproduced by simulation, the simulation method presented here is able to show the right way for a comprehensive PC-LED light source design (see Figure  1) including all technological and visual aspects.|$|R

This aspect of the movement was also satirised by Punch magazine and in Patience.|$|E

The platform hall is faced with marble. On the platform walls are decorative grilles with the inscription [...] "1958," [...] the year the station was opened.

50|$|The LG Rumor/LG Scoop is a {{phone that}} was {{released}} by Sprint Nextel in September 2007.

A 176x220 pixel screen rotates as the keyboard is open, but has no contrast controls. The 1.3-megapixel camera lacks an LED flash and a self-portrait mirror but does have negative, sepia, black & <b>white</b> <b>tones,</b> borders and an image enhancer to customize a picture. Basic MP3 playing functions are embedded in this phone, with the capability of expanding music storage via MicroSD card (125 to 1,000 music files depending on file size, encoding method, and card capacity). The music player will not launch unless a card is inserted in the phone, and will not accept a card with the memory that is over 4 GB.|$|E
50|$|In medieval Christian tradition, sibyls became prophetesses {{warning the}} pagan Romans {{of the coming}} of Christ. Sibyls were often, as here, portrayed with tablets (or with open books), {{although}} they were usually depicted in late Renaissance and Baroque art in sumptuous robes and head-dress. In contrast, this woman has disheveled hair, with loose strands spilling on her neck and exposed upper back, and is dressed in relatively plain clothing. Against this, {{it has been argued}} that she is portrayed in a unusually for the time spontaneous manner, captured as if in the fleeting moment in which she gives her prophecy. Her skin is rendered in pearly <b>white</b> <b>tones,</b> her lips are parted as if about to speak while her finger rests on the seemingly blank tablet (tabula rasa). Art historian Simona Di Nepi, among others, has noted Velázquez's habit for employing unexceptional looking models to sit for classical subject matter and for rendering their features in a realistic, unidealised manner.|$|E

The wind was strong but amiable, and was full of the smell of corn and of that warm, pungent, smoky odor which forms the Indian summer {{atmosphere}} of the West. The wind rushed up the broad street past him, carrying the dust and leaves in its powerful clutches, and laying strong hands upon his broad back. The sky was absolutely without speck, but a pale mist seemed to dim the radiance of the sun, and lent a milky <b>white</b> <b>tone</b> to {{the blue of the}} sky.|$|R

50|$|Robert Kipniss (born Brooklyn, New York, February 1, 1931) is an American {{painter and}} printmaker. His mature paintings, lithographs, mezzotints, and drypoints share stylistic {{characteristics}} and {{subject matter and}} typically depict trees seen close up or at varying distances in fields. Other works show one or more houses in a landscape or town setting. Some are interiors with a view toward a window or with a still life set close to one, frequently with a landscape beyond. No human figures are present, and all forms are reduced to essentials. The time is often dusk or nighttime. Kipniss' use of exceptionally subtle black and <b>white</b> <b>tones</b> or, less often, lightly toned hues creates an overall atmospheric effect. His works {{have been described as}} conveying solitude and inward experience. Kipniss often uses the subject matter of a painting in a lithograph or mezzotint, sometimes with variations. His paintings date from the early 1950s. His main body of prints are lithographs and mezzotints, the former dating from 1968 into 1990, the latter since 1990.|$|E
5000|$|His style {{became more}} fluid {{while he worked}} at Rubens' {{workshop}} where he produced his best work. [...] At Rubens' workshop Witdoeck learned to engrave large plates. Witdoeck worked between 1634 and 1638 under the close supervision of Rubens on many engravings, including Abraham and Melchizedek, the Adoration of the Magi, the three-part Raising of the Cross, the Supper at Emmaus, Saint Ildefonso receiving the chasuble, Cicero and Demosthenes. Rubens specified the year 1638 for all these prints likely so that he only needed to apply for one printing privilege for the lot. The following year an Assumption of Mary and the Miracle of St. Just by Witdoeck were published. Witdoeck also produced a few undated prints while at Rubens' workshop.It {{is clear from the}} revision and production process of these prints that Rubens was closely involved in their design and execution. [...] This is documented by the process of the creation of a series of twelve plates after antique marble portrait sculptures (heads, busts, herms) by the four printmakers Hans Witdoeck, Paulus Pontius, Lucas Vorsterman, and Boetius à Bolswert working for Rubens. The production of the prints was closely supervised by Rubens as is demonstrated by five retouched proof impressions. Only six of Rubens' preparatory drawings for the series have survived. [...] Witdoeck showed in his prints after Rubens a great skill in capturing the movement and variety of colour in the original works through his clever use of black, grey and <b>white</b> <b>tones.</b> A typical example is Abraham and Melchizedek.|$|E
50|$|The winter fur is {{soft and}} tall, with short, dense underfur and long, sparse guard hairs. The fur is {{generally}} shorter and not as thick {{as that of the}} European polecat. The guard hairs are especially well developed on the lower back, though still sparser than those of the European polecat. Contrary to the former, the steppe polecat's guard hairs never completey cover the underfur. The base colour of the winter fur is very light yellowish or whitish-yellowish. The tips of the guard hairs are blackish-brown or brown, forming a frosting effect over the yellow underfur. This frosting is stronger in the middle and lower back, where the guard hairs are denser and longer. The guard hairs on the upper back, the flanks, between the shoulders and along the upper neck are extremely short, thus being lighter in colour than the posterior region. The head is piebald, with the eye region and the upper side of the nose being covered by a brownish mask. Behind the mask, a white band crosses the head from cheek to cheek. A small brownish area is usually located in front of each ear. The ears are completely white, while the throat is yellowish-white or almost white. Sometimes, the head is entirely white. The lower surface of the neck is dark blackish-brown or brown, while the chest and forelegs are black or blackish-brown. The abdomen is light, yellowish-straw in colour. The groin is the same colour of the forelimbs. The base of the tail is light in colour, while the tip is dark brown. The summer coat is shorter and coarser than the winter fur, and is not as dense and close-fitting, with a more strongly developed ochreous or reddish tone. The head is, overall, darker than in winter, with greater contrast between the dark and <b>white</b> <b>tones.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kim Mikyung (Prof. Kangnam Univ. Art History): Lee Dong-Yeop debuted at the First Independents Exhibition (1972) with {{paintings}} of semi-transparent cups against a white background. At the FIVE HINSEK show, he presented images of melting cups on neutral-colored canvases. What his paintings address wasn't {{the problem of}} <b>white</b> <b>tone</b> per se, but rather: 'if the cup is a container of the universe, ice is the existence in it; through depicting the processes of melting and evaporation of ice and the resulting emptiness, the painting suggests the fungible or inconstant nature of things. Nonetheless, the indistinct white-toned background was already there {{in all of his}} paintings, and the Japanese organizers paid attention to this aspect of his work.|$|R
