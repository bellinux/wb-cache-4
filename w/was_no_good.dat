5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall {{got off to a}} good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E
5|$|Having {{regained the}} ball, Wake Forest {{answered}} Georgia Tech's drive {{with one of}} their own. Several Wake running backs rushed with the ball, but it was Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner who advanced the ball the most. He completed a 24-yard pass to Willie Idlette, then an eight-yard toss to Nate Morton. Inside Tech territory, Wake's offense stumbled. Skinner was sacked by a Tech defender, and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game to attempt a 45-yard field goal. Swank's kick <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good,</b> and with 7:26 remaining in the second quarter, Georgia Tech still had a 30 lead.|$|E
5|$|Texas scored {{first when}} Selvin Young ran {{the ball in}} for a touchdown. The extra point attempt by Richmond McGee <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> The Cajuns were able to score threepoints on a field goal by Sean Comiskey making the score Texas 6, Louisiana Lafayette 3. Texas replied with 54unanswered points {{to win the game}} 60–3. With the win, Texas {{improved}} its record in season-opening games to 93–17–3 and 72–2–2 when they open the year at home. That figure includes 11straight wins and victories in 30of their last 31games at home. Their home record under Mack Brown improved to 39wins and 3losses.|$|E

5|$|The Midshipmen {{began the}} second quarter with a two-play, 30-second drive that ended with a 61-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Polanco to receiver Corey Dryden, increasing the team's lead to 21–7. The Lobos responded with a rushing touchdown from running back Rodney Ferguson, but kicker Wes Zunker's extra point attempt <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good,</b> making the score 21–13. Midshipmen kicker Geoff Blumenfeld added a 27-yard field goal to bring the score to 24–13. McKamey scored another rushing touchdown to cap off another long drive, this time taking up over five minutes of game time, but the team's two-point conversion attempt failed. Lane Jackson intercepted McKamey's pass on the Lobos final drive before half-time, ending {{the first half of}} the game with a score of 24–19 in favor of the Midshipmen.|$|E
5|$|A one-yard rush was {{followed}} by a pass to running back Ken Oxendine that lost three yards. Following the negative-yardage play, North Carolina committed a five-yard penalty that gave the Hokies a third down and seven. Despite the extra yardage provided by the penalty, Clark's pass attempt on third down was incomplete and the Hokies again prepared to punt. During the kick, however, North Carolina defender Quinton Savage broke through the Virginia Tech offensive line and blocked the punt by Jimmy Kibble. Tar Heels' defender Dre Bly picked up the loose ball and ran into the end zone for North Carolina's second touchdown of the game. Following the play, North Carolina was penalized 15 yards for excessive celebration and the resulting 35-yard extra point kick <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> Despite the missed kick, North Carolina extended its lead to 160 with 1:03 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Although a close {{game was}} predicted, {{the game was}} the exact opposite, as the Wolverines finally {{displayed}} the long sought offensive firepower from a Rich Rodriguez offense. Michigan scored the only points of the first quarter, as Vincent Smith opened the scoring with a 12-yard touchdown run and quarterback Denard Robinson added another touchdown on a 32-yard run. Michigan started the second quarter with another touchdown, {{this time with a}} 3-yard run by Michael Shaw. All of Connecticut's scoring came in the second quarter: a 32-yard field goal by Dave Teggert, and then a 2-yard run by Jordan Todman. The only scoring of the third quarter came on a 24-yard Michigan field goal by Brendan Gibbons. Connecticut managed to enter Michigan's red zone during the third quarter, but D.J. Shoemate fumbled the ball after a hit by J.T. Floyd and Obi Ezeh recovered it to prevent Connecticut from scoring. In the fourth quarter, Smith caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Robinson; however, the extra point attempt <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E

5|$|The game {{started with}} both teams exchanging several punts {{in the first}} quarter. Maryland gained good field {{position}} after Lauricella kicked a short punt. Running backs Ed Modzelewski and Ed Fullerton then led an 11-play, 56-yard rushing drive for a touchdown. On the kickoff, Bob Ward hit Lauricella and forced a fumble that Maryland recovered on Tennessee's 13-yard line. After four plays, Jack Scarbath pitched to Fullerton who then threw a six-yard forward pass to Bob Shemonski {{in the end zone}} and expanded the Maryland lead to 14–0. Scarbath then engineered a 48-yard drive and ran it in himself for the Terrapins' third touchdown within seven minutes. Late in the second quarter, Tennessee back Bert Rechichar caught a four-yard pass for a touchdown, but the extra point <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> At {{the end of the first}} half, Maryland had stunned Tennessee by gaining a 21–6 lead. In the fourth quarter, Fullerton intercepted a pass and returned it 46 yards for a touchdown. In the final minutes, Tennessee's goal-line quarterback Herky Payne ran it in from the one-yard line. Maryland won the game with a final result of 28–13.|$|E
5|$|The post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 20-yard line, and the Hokies began an offensive drive hoping to run down the clock and preserve their two-touchdown lead. Because the game clock continues to run on rushing plays, the Hokies executed five consecutive rushing plays, picking up a first down in the process. The Hokies were unable to gain a second first down, however, and Tech punted from its 40-yard line. The kick rolled out of bounds at the Eagles' 28-yard line with 9:28 remaining in the game, and Boston College took over on offense. On the first play after the punt, however, Tech defender Jason Worilds tackled Davis, forcing a fumble, which bounced {{into the hands of}} fellow defender Orion Martin, who ran it 17 yards for a defensive touchdown. The extra point bounced off an upright, however, and <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> Still, with just 9:05 remaining in the game, Tech took a commanding 30–10 lead.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{began the}} first half in {{possession}} of the football, North Carolina received the ball to begin the second half. The Hokies' kickoff was returned to the 39-yard line, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, and North Carolina began the first possession {{of the second half}} at the Virginia Tech 46-yard line. The first play of the half was a short run by Linton, and after two incomplete passes by Keldorf, the Tar Heels prepared to punt. Rather than kick, however, North Carolina faked a punt and had punter Brian Schmitz pass the ball to linebacker Brian Simmons, who normally played defense. Simmons gained 28 yards and a first down on the play, which allowed the Tar Heels to continue their drive. Now at the Hokies' 13-yard line, North Carolina committed a five-yard delay of game penalty. On the next play, Linton made up the lost yardage, gaining six yards and advancing the ball to the Tech 12-yard line. The running play was followed by a pass from Keldorf to Linton for an eight-yard gain. Needing one yard to gain a first down, North Carolina was stopped on third down then attempted to convert the fourth down rather than kick a field goal. Keldorf ran the ball straight ahead and gained the needed yardage, gaining a first down at the three-yard line. Two plays later, Linton ran across the goal line and into the end zone for the Tar Heels' first touchdown of the second half. The extra point kick was partially blocked by the Virginia Tech defense and <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good,</b> but the Tar Heels still extended their lead to 280 with 9:43 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half, the Cowboys scored their only {{touchdown}} {{in the third quarter}} with a two-yard touchdown run by Marion Barber. Finally in the fourth quarter New Orleans got a touchdown when running back Mike Bell scored from one yard out to make a 24–10 Dallas lead. Drew Brees also made a 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lance Moore. After that, Nick Folk attempted a 24-yard field goal, but the kick <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> With a big advantage to take the lead as the clock was expiring, the Saints were driving for the game-tying score, but DeMarcus Ware made his second sack on Drew Brees, which again caused the ball to be fumbled. This time the ball was recovered by nose guard Jay Ratliff. With the ball in possession, Dallas took a knee to conclude the game.|$|E

25|$|Playing without star {{receiver}} Sterling Sharpe, who {{had suffered}} a career-ending neck injury {{at the end of}} the season, Green Bay scored first with a 14-play, 76-yard drive. Packers quarterback Brett Favre completed 7/8 passes for 57 yards, while Dorsey Levens finished it off with a 3-yard touchdown run on fourth and inches. In the second quarter, Packers kicker Chris Jacke missed a 37-yard field goal attempt, but with 2:56 left in the half, he increased the score to 10-0 on a 51-yard field goal (a franchise posteason record) at the end of a 37-yard drive jump-started by Favre's 20-yard completion to tight end Mark Chmura. Detroit responded with Dave Krieg's 46-yard completion to Brett Perriman, earning them a first down on the Packers 11-yard line. But after two incompletions and a 1-yard loss by Sanders, Jason Hanson's 30-yard field goal attempt <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trinity got {{the ball}} to start the game and used four plays, {{culminating}} in a 25-yard run by Chris Baer, to score a touchdown. Millsaps was unable to get a first down and they punted back to Trinity. On the punt, Trinity's Caleb Urban fumbled the ball and Eric McCarty of the Majors recovered at the Trinity 40-yard line. The Tigers defense prevented the Majors from reaching the end zone so the Majors attempted a field goal, which <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> The Tigers punted on their next possession and then Majors quarterback Juan Joseph's pass was intercepted by Lee Patterson at the Trinity 4-yard line. The Tigers also ended their drive when Blake Barmore's pass was intercepted by Ray Kline. Millsaps took over at the Trinity 20-yard line and fourplays later scored a touchdown on a 12-yard pass from Joseph to Louis Conley. A punt by each team left Trinity with the ball and the score was tied at 7 {{at the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E
25|$|In week 9, the Lions {{traveled}} to Seattle, Washington {{to take on}} the Seattle Seahawks. The Lions took an early lead in the first quarter, scoring 17 unanswered points. First came 2 TD's: a Brandon Pettigrew 7-yard catch, then a Bryant Johnson 29-yard catch, and afterward was a 41-yard field goal. The Seahawks responded in the second quarter with a TD and 2 field goals. First the TD, a 3-yard run by Julius Jones. The field goals by Olindo Mare were both from 37 yards out. In the 3rd quarter came another Seattle field goal, from 24 yards out. Then a Seahawks TD to give them the lead, a 2-yard TD catch by T.J. Houshmandzadeh. However, the fake field goal for a 2-point conversion <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> The Lions' only score of the second half was a 50-yard field goal. The Seahawks sealed their win with a 61-yard interception for a TD by Josh Wilson.|$|E

25|$|The Montgomery County Charter Board {{opened its}} {{campaign}} headquarters in Bethesda, {{to serve as}} an information center regarding the draft charter. The Charter Board emphasized that the draft charter would allow for county affairs to be decided by local representatives rather than by a vote of members of the Maryland General Assembly who represent citizens of all parts of the state. Another group opposing the draft charter opened its headquarters in Bethesda. The group said there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> reason to abolish the functional state-level system already in place, and that the draft charter would increase taxes and establish heads of governmental agencies with indefinite terms who are not directly accountable to the public. The group also said that making the council seats nonpartisan would go against the country's political history. The editorial board of The Washington Post supported the draft charter. The Montgomery County League of Women Voters also endorsed the draft charter.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas ran for 257 yards, and Ole Miss QB Eli Manning {{threw for}} 414 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. The first {{points of the}} game came for the Rebels when Matt Jones was called for {{intentionally}} grounding in the end zone, which by rule is scored a safety. Ole Miss gained a 2–0 lead, but fumbled near {{the close of the}} first quarter, resulting in a Razorback field goal. Lerinezo Robinson for the Hogs then returned a fumbled kickoff eight yards for a touchdown, giving Arkansas a 10–2 lead. Jonathan Nichols of Ole Miss then hit a 48-yard field, but a Jimmy Beasley interception of Eli Manning set up Arkansas for a 34-yard option keep touchdown by Matt Jones, giving an edge to the Hogs, 17–5. Manning then connected with Justin Sawyer, but the two point play <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good.</b> First a field goal, then a touchdown closed out the first half for the Razorbacks, the TD set up by a 55-yard punt return by Decori Birmingham, to the Ole Miss 20.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the number}} of Red Cross food parcels, prisoners {{sometimes}} ate better than their guards, who had to rely on Wehrmacht rations. Prisoners could use their relative luxuries for trade and, for example, exchange their cigarettes for German Reichsmarks that they hoped could later use in their escape attempts. Occasionally this turned to be a mistake as several of the bills they received were of the earlier Papiermark varieties that were no longer considered valid. There were also other currencies in circulation, including the Registermark, utilized for travelling and investments in Germany; the Reisemark, for tourists; the Kreditsperrmark, for sales of property belonging to foreigners; the Effektensperrmark, arising from the sale of securities in Germany; the Reichskreditkassenschein in occupied territories; and the Behelfszahlungsmittel (Auxiliary Payment Certificates) for the German Armed Forces. The Kreditsperrmark and Effektensperrmark were consolidated into the Handelsperrmark in 1939. Because of the massive variety of currency types and uses, in several escape attempts, escapees with one of these various currencies printed before 1939 were told their money <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>good</b> — leaving them moneyless and easier to recapture.|$|E
