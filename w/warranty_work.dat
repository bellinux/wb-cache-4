Budget limitations {{have reduced the}} number of military components available for testing, and time constraints have reduced the amount of time available for actual testing resulting in many items still operating at the end of test cycles. These two factors produce small test populations (small sample size) with "heavily" censored data. The assumption of "normal approximation" for estimates based on these small sample sizes reduces the accuracy of confidence bounds of the probability plots and the associated quantities. This creates a problem in acquisition analysis because the confidence in the probability estimates influences the number of spare parts required to support a mission or deployment or determines the length of warranty ensuring proper operation of systems.

40|$|As atividades lúdicas podem desempenhar um papel {{relevante}} no processo de ensinoaprendizado e no desenvolvimento da criança na educação infantil em seus múltiplos aspectos: cognitivo, afetivo, social, motor, ético, estético, entre outros, e expressam o modo pelo qual uma criança reflete, ordena, constrói e reconstrói o mundo à sua maneira. O desenvolvimento de atividades lúdicas na educação infantil pode reestruturar o espaço e tempo escolares e, principalmente, as relações estabelecidas entre as crianças e o conhecimento, das crianças entre si e com suas professoras. Torna-se importante, portanto, conhecermos melhor os limites e as possibilidades das atividades lúdicas na educação infantil e o que está em jogo na vida cotidiana escolar de nossas crianças e professoras. Como brincam, por quais jogos se interessam, quais são os temas de suas brincadeiras, quais objetos utilizam, como os utilizam e por que o fazem? Nesse sentido, no âmbito da presente pesquisa, questionamos: como se constitui o cotidiano da atividade lúdica em uma sala de aula de educação infantil do município de Itapetinga-BA? Como se dá a relação de interação entre crianças e professoras nas atividades educativas, principalmente naquelas em que se utilizam recursos lúdicos? De que modo as relações intersubjetivas mediadas pelo lúdico contribuem para a constituição desses sujeitos na escola? Compreender o processo de organização cotidiana do lúdico em uma escola de educação infantil e a relação desse processo com o jeito de ser de alunos e professoras implica em trazer à reflexão comportamentos marcados por significados e sentidos inseparáveis das histórias dos sujeitos envolvidos. A presente pesquisa, desenvolvida para buscar respostas às questões anteriores, foi construída a partir de princípios teóricos e epistemológicos da investigação qualitativa e orientação etnográfica, com a utilização de entrevistas com professoras, equipe pedagógica de uma escola infantil na cidade de Itapetinga-BA; observações em sala de aula, de reuniões pedagógicas, análise documental (proposta pedagógica da Educação Infantil, planejamentos de ensino, cadernos de atividades das crianças e cadernetas de anotações com registro das avaliações do desenvolvimento da criança, dentre outros). Os dados deste estudo apontaram que o cotidiano da atividade lúdica da escola configura-se como um espaço-tempo de aprendizagens, mesmo com as limitações de espaço físico da Escola Brincando e Aprendendo; inexiste um planejamento para o recreio das crianças; o cotidiano escolar estrutura-se como um espaço formativo, e o lúdico torna-se uma ferramenta importante nas relações sociais estabelecidas entre os sujeitos apresentando-se como espaço potencial de aprendizagens e constituição do sujeito social; urge investir na formação continuada (e lúdica) das professoras e a garantia de melhores condições de trabalho. Buscamos, portanto, nesse percurso, tecer itinerários que possibilitem a (re) construção e/ou ampliação de conhecimentos e reflexões acerca do lúdico, bem como o entendimento do processo de constituição dos sujeitos no espaço-tempo da educação infantil. The {{game activities}} {{can play a}} relevant role in the teaching-learning process and in the child's development in the infantile education in their multiples aspects: cognitive, affectionate, social, motor, ethical, aesthetic, among other, and they express {{the way that a}} child contemplates, orders, builds and rebuilds the world with his or her way. The development of game activities in the infantile education can restructure the space and time in scholar and, mainly, the established relationships between the children and the knowledge, the children among themselves and their teachers. It becomes important, therefore, that we better know the limits and the possibilities of the game activities in the infantile education and what is in "game" in our children's life daily scholar and teachers. How do they play, for which games they are interested, which are the themes of their games, which objects do they use, how do they use them and why do they make it? In that sense, in this research, we question: how is constituted the daily of the game activity at a classroom of infantile education of the town of Itapetinga-BA? How is the interaction relationship between children and teachers in the educational activities, mainly in those that use game resources? How the intersubjective relationships mediated by the game contribute for the constitution of those subjects in the school? To understand the process of daily organization of the game in a school of infantile education and the relationship of that process with the way of behavior of students and teachers is to implicate in bringing to the reflection behaviors marked by meanings and inseparable senses of the histories of the involved subjects. This research, developed to look for answers to the previous subjects, was built starting from theoretical and scientific beginnings of the qualitative investigation and orientation of ethnography, with the use of interviews with teachers, pedagogic team of an infantile school in the town of Itapetinga-BA; observations in classroom, of pedagogic meetings, documental analysis (pedagogic proposal of the Infantile Education, teaching plannings, notebooks of the children's activities and notebooks of annotations with registration of the evaluations of the child's development, among others). The data of this study showed that the daily of the game activity of the school is configured as a space-time of learnings, even with the limitations of physical space of the Escola Brincando e Aprendendo; a planning for the children's recreation inexists; the daily scholar is structured as a formative space, and the game become as an important tool in the social relationships established among the subjects being configured as potential space of learnings and constitution of the social subject; it urges to invest in the teachers' continuous (and game s) formation and the <b>warranty</b> of better <b>work</b> conditions.

40|$|Rob Chalmers explains {{the term}} open access, {{and how it}} fits into the wider “open {{movement}}” in The Conversation.. You’ll have read on this site, and perhaps others, about the push towards “open access” for journal articles. But what is open access, {{and how does it}} fit into the wider “open movement”? The topic has been much talked about of late, not least in the context of Open Access Week – a crowd-based movement promoting the push toward open access for journal articles. After decades of paying staff to generate journal content and then having to pay again to access that content, universities appear to have finally woken up. This is one of several different faces of a continuing trend towards an open exchange of information and innovation. So what are those faces, and how do these relate to “old school” or “closed” approaches of developing and exploiting intellectual property? Open Source “Open source” is often seen as the first of the open movements. Emerging out of the Free Software Movement in the 1980 s, open source provides access to the source code of computer software so others can further develop that code. The alternative, “closed” approach, still adopted by many software developers, involves hiding or encrypting a piece of software’s source code to prevent others “reverse engineering” it and creating rival or derivative products. There are many different flavours of open source, with many tricks and traps for those who aren’t aware of the detail of the conditions of access. Understanding what is or isn’t permitted when it comes to editing open-source software requires analysis of the licence terms. Consider the GNU Public Licences, which have different models for software, software used over networks, manuals and a library of exceptions for different purposes. There are more than 70 different open source licences available – some permitting restricted use in educational communities, others being more commercially oriented. All contain different provisions around rights of use, restrictions on downstream <b>works,</b> <b>warranties,</b> indemnities and other matters. Many people don’t bother trying to untangle the differences, and fail to understand what is cost-free, what is in the public domain, and whether they are required to give others access to the source code of works they create. Many benefits have flowed from the use of open-source models of software and hardware development, including the Linux operating system, Arduino electronics, and even key software embodied in nearly every mobile phone (developed by an Australian company Open Kernel Labs – acquired last month by General Dynamics). The open-source model has spilled over into biology and science. One example is molecular biologist Richard Jefferson’s sharing of his discovery of a key genetic tool – the beta-glucuronidase gene – a key indicator of gene activity used in plant genetic engineering. Jefferson gave research labs free access to this tool but also charged for its commercial use. He then invested the proceeds in the foundation of the independent non-profit institute Cambia to further promote open-source initiatives. Open Innovation “Open innovation” is a concept promoted by the author and academic Henry Chesbrough. Unsurprisingly, this approach boils down to the need to engage with other people and their perspectives to develop better products or services. Of course, open innovation has been happening since time immemorial, embraced by companies such as: Siemens, with its attempt to tap the minds of consumers, researchers and external partners to supplement internal innovation Cadbury, with a similar program to embrace innovation partnerships with universities, small to medium enterprises and other multinationals Lilly, with its open innovation drug discovery program. Open data: a patchwork quilt Newer than any of the “open” movements is the push for so-called “open data” – essentially open access to data sets rather than just research publications. There are many different groups working on this from different angles, including: the Open Data Commons, a sort-of copyright-based Creative Commons (all articles on The Conversation are Creative Commons) the Open Data Foundation, directed at enabling access to consistent metadata to inform public policy and decision-making) Open Data Protocol, for querying or updating data that can break down “silos” that prevent sharing between applications. At the moment there are no universally-accepted standards for open data. Too often researchers struggle with clunky paths to access: navigating the shoals of differing access conditions and even having to divert funding into legal resources to map and better articulate the basis on which they share data between themselves (let alone with others). The promise of understanding, innovation, efficiency and effectiveness held out by making use of “Big Data” in the public and private sector will not be fully realised until there is better progress on common standards for open data. And beyond data and data structures {{there needs to be a}} change in culture and mindset – otherwise some predict the promise will turn into a minefield. Crowdsourcing Crowdsourcing of ideas and funding is all the rage: from philanthropic purposes, to start-ups facilitated by the likes of Kickstarter, to multinational companies, which now routinely use crowdsourcing to gather innovation they can’t generate internally. The rise of crowdsourcing raises a number of understandable concerns. There’s potential for scandal: where a crowdsourced project takes money, fails or doesn’t even use it for the project; or exploitation: where those who contribute ideas to a site seeking competitive generation of ideas for a project have their ideas appropriated with no reward. Still, the signals are clear: this style of engagement is growing. Kickstarter is a good example – US$ 350 million has been pledged for more than 30, 000 projects since April 2009, with a rapid escalation this year. A plethora of other crowd-sourcing platforms have emerged with a variety of business models, some for-profit and others not – the educational not-for-profit the Khan Academy is a case in point. Proprietary path “Open” models are often cast in opposition to closed or proprietary models, which are founded on protecting and exploiting intellectual property. But this apparent opposition is an illusion. Many of the open models are actually built on intellectual property rights – it is the way in which those rights are used that differs from proprietary models. Consider “copyleft”, which uses copyright to force others who make derivative works of underlying enabling software platforms to also make their modifications or additions freely available to the benefit of all (and to enable the creation of yet further derivative works). There is nothing new about successful business models that stack proprietary approaches on top of open layers. An open conclusion Individuals can and do choose how open or closed they wish to be in their work. This does not have to be an ideologically fixed and static choice between opposites. A more natural and sophisticated stance is to blend the two approaches to best fit the context. Being open – through social networks, in research or business – is the trend and has much to commend it, but a blend of different approaches gives us a healthy innovation ecosystem.

These flaws were mostly rectified on a rebuilding programme in 1961-62. The positioning of minor components within the locomotive bodyshell meant that small faults could only be rectified on depot or by return to a railway workshop, which resulted in poor daily availability for traffic figures for the type.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis work is to {{identify}} the <b>warranty</b> <b>work</b> and aftermarket work that the case company faces. In recent years the case company has met {{an increase in the}} <b>warranty</b> <b>work.</b> The master thesis has been carried out in a Swedish contractor and is limited with remarks from warranty inspection protocols and data collection for four apartment projects. The study is based on interviews with senior executives in the case company. The results in this study show that the three most common defects that occur during the first two years are as follows: cracks on walls/ceilings, cabinet and boxes and doors. This three building parts account for 55. 5 % {{of the total number of}} remarks, based on the warranty inspection reports. The study presents appropriate improvement work to avoid the emergence of the <b>warranty</b> <b>work</b> and to facilitate the follow-up of the <b>warranty</b> <b>work.</b> The main reasons for warranty remarks are based on several different conditions. The causes can be attributed to moisture-related movements, lack of care and maintenance, assembly errors and lack of product selection. The design phase has the major role when it comes to rework. This in turn led to quality errors to occur. Furthermore, the pressure of time in the construction sector has an impact in the result of quality shortcomings. Construction companies are willing to be done in a shorter time than they really need. This naturally leads to stress at the last stage and leading to shortages at the end of the handover of the residence.
