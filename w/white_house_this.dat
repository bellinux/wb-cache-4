5|$|Another celebrated {{image of}} Washington is the Lansdowne {{portrait}}, a large portrait with one version {{hanging in the}} East Room of the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> painting was saved during the burning of Washington by British troops in the War of 1812 through the intervention of First Lady Dolley Madison and Paul Jennings, one of President James Madison's slaves. Four versions of the portrait are attributed to Stuart, and additional copies were painted by other artists for display in U.S. government buildings. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D. C.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{entered the}} White House as a bachelor, {{and his sister}} Rose Cleveland joined him, to act as hostess {{for the first two}} years of his administration. However, unlike the {{previous}} bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for very long. In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington. Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married. On June 2, 1886, Cleveland married Frances Folsom in the Blue Room at the White House. He was the second President to wed while in office, and has been the only President married in the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> marriage was unusual, since Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match. At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history, and the public soon warmed to her beauty and warm personality.|$|E
25|$|Theodore Roosevelt hired {{architect}} Charles Follen McKim {{to reorganize}} the layout {{and use of}} the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> included constructing the West Wing in 1902 and moving executive offices out of the central White House. The original structure, some of which is still extant in the present West Wing, was originally intended to be temporary. With some modifications by William Howard Taft the West Wing remained largely unchanged until a fire on December 24, 1929 during the administration of Herbert Hoover. Because of the recent stock market crash, Hoover chose only to repair rather than expand. In 1933, early in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, the president began a series of meetings with staff architect Eric Gugler to enlarge and modify the West Wing. Roosevelt moved Taft's Oval Office, centered {{on the south side of}} the wing, to its present location in the southeast corner adjacent to the Rose Garden. This made moving to and from the Executive Residence to the Oval Office quicker, and allowed for more privacy, a concern in concealing FDR's paralysis.|$|E

50|$|White's home, The Wakes, {{has been}} {{converted}} into a museum, known as Gilbert <b>White's</b> <b>house.</b> <b>This</b> museum also contains the Oates Museum and family archive. This comprises an exhibition relating to the life of Captain Lawrence Oates, who died on Robert Falcon Scott's ill-fated expedition to Antarctica in the early 20th century, and Frank Oates, his uncle. Frank Oates was an explorer and naturalist, who mounted expeditions in the late 19th century into Central America and Africa.|$|R

500|$|Although Kaufman's {{book had}} a minimal {{impact in the}} United States, it {{achieved}} notoriety in Nazi Germany, where propagandists used it as evidence of an international Jewish plan to destroy the German people. On July 24, 1941, the Nazi Party's newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, published a front-page article on the book titled: [...] "The Product of Criminal Jewish Sadism: Roosevelt Demands the Sterilization of the German People." [...] The newspaper alleged that Kaufman was a close ally of Samuel Irving Rosenman, a well-known advisor to Franklin Delano Roosevelt and that: [...] "Given the close relationship of the writer to the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>this</b> monstrous war program {{can be seen as}} a synthesis of genuine Talmudic hatred and Roosevelt’s views on foreign policy." [...] At the time, the German leadership was engaged in a propaganda campaign designed to rally popular support for the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Antisemitism in general, and Kaufman's ideas in particular, became a focus of this campaign.|$|E
500|$|American public feeling towards Truman grew {{steadily}} warmer {{with the}} passing years; as early as 1962, a poll of 75 historians conducted by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr. ranked Truman among the [...] "near great" [...] presidents. The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians {{and members of the}} public. [...] Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises in Vietnam and Watergate, and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career. In the early and mid-1970s, Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948, this time emerging as a kind of political folk hero, a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability many observers felt was lacking in the Nixon <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences Truman had recounted to journalist Merle Miller beginning in 1961, with the agreement {{that they would not be}} published until after Truman's death.|$|E

After the video's conclusion, former U.S. Senator Max Cleland delivered a speech proclaiming that the global conflict and active wars in Afghanistan and Iraq required a decorated military hero such as Kerry in the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> concluded with Kerry's entrance, where he made a military salute and announced, [...] "I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty!"

2500|$|The NBC {{telecast}} of the game, with play-by-play announcer Dick Enberg {{and color}} commentators Merlin Olsen and Bob Griese (who {{was not in}} the booth with Enberg and Olsen), garnered the third highest Nielsen rating of any Super Bowl to date, a 48.3 but it ended up being the first Super Bowl to garner over 90 million viewers the highest to date up to that point. While Dick Enberg, Merlin Olsen and Bob Griese called the game, Bob Costas and his NFL '85 castmates, Ahmad Rashad and Pete Axthelm anchored the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage. Other contributors included Charlie Jones (recapping Super Bowl I) and Bill Macatee. Also, the pregame coverage included what became known as [...] "the silent minute"; a 60-second countdown over a black screen (a concept devised by then-NBC Sports executive Michael Weisman); a skit featuring comedian Rodney Dangerfield and an interview by NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw of United States President Ronald Reagan at the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> (<b>this</b> would not become a regular Super Bowl pregame feature until Super Bowl XLIII; when Today show host Matt Lauer interviewed U.S. President Barack Obama).|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{staff in}} {{pressuring}} the FBI to launch an investigation had been heavily criticized; on May 28, 1993, the FBI issued a report saying it had done nothing wrong in its contacts with the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> [...] (<b>This</b> conclusion was reiterated by a March 1994 report by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.) ...|$|R

2500|$|The initial story {{arc of the}} Superman/Batman ongoing series {{depicts the}} fall of Luthor's reign as U.S. President. In [...] "The World's Finest" [...] (more {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "Public Enemies"), a cadre of superheroes eventually break ranks from the Justice League to oppose Luthor. Superman and Batman, who had previously forbidden any attempt to unseat Luthor from office by force, led the storming of the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> was predicated by an attempt on Luthor's part to link Superman to a kryptonite asteroid that is hurtling toward Earth, claiming that he had 'evidence'—which he declined to share while claiming that it would make the public laud his actions if they knew it—that the asteroid was being drawn to Earth by Superman, offering a billion dollar reward for Superman's capture that pitted Superman and Batman against an army of villains, all of whom they defeated. Luthor even attempted to send a team of heroes after them under the leadership of Captain Atom—the team consisting of Major Force, Black Lightning, Power Girl, Starfire, Katana and Green Lantern, but this plan failed when Katana and Power Girl quickly sided with Superman and Batman and Major Force was apparently killed, Power Girl noting that Luthor had assumed in his arrogance that the heroes would obey him simply because he was President. When the Justice Society's forced attempt to stop them by sending Hawkman and Captain Marvel against them met with failure and resulted in Superman and Batman briefly infiltrating the White House, Luthor, in an enraged and desperate gambit after Superman's rapid defeats of his plans, used a variant combination of the [...] "super-steroid" [...] Venom (a chemical associated with the Batman villain Bane), liquid synthetic kryptonite, and an Apokoliptian battlesuit to fight Superman directly.|$|E

Orders had previously been sent, through Halleck, for Butler to send Smith's corps to <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> order was repeated on the 25th, with directions that they should be landed {{on the north side of}} the Pamunkey, and marched until they joined the Army of the Potomac.|$|E

50|$|It {{was rumored}} but never {{confirmed}} that Stans {{was the source}} for raising the million dollars in cash which Nixon kept in the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> safe. <b>This</b> cash was used to pay Howard Hunt and the other Watergate burglars, who eventually blackmailed the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> It was also rumored, but never confirmed that Stans raised the cash {{from a list of}} large contributors by threatening IRS audits.|$|R
60|$|One of the disadvantageous {{points about}} the White House was its {{distance}} from any town or market. The nearest shop was four miles off, so that bread, butter, meat, and groceries, {{had to be}} ordered {{a couple of days}} beforehand, and were conveyed to their destination by the mail-coach. Even after they were deposited at the gate of Mr McAllister's farm, there was still about half a mile of rugged cart-road to be got over before they could be finally deposited in the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> <b>This</b> was a matter of constant anxiety to Mr Sudberry, because it was necessary that someone should be at the gate regularly to receive letters and parcels, and this involved constant attention to the time of the mail passing. When no one was there, the coachman left the property of the family {{at the side of the}} road. Hobbs, however, was usually up to time, fair weather and foul, and this was the first time his master had been called on to go for the letters.|$|E
5000|$|Extension of ARRA's {{treatment}} of the Earned Income Tax Credit for two years. According to the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> <b>this</b> would benefit 6.5 million working parents with 15 million children.|$|E
