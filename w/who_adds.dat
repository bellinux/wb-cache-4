25|$|The term {{intimate}} partner {{violence is}} often used synonymously with domestic abuse or domestic violence, but it specifically refers to violence occurring within a couple relationship (i.e., marriage, cohabitation, or non-cohabitating intimate partners). To these, the World Health Organization (<b>WHO)</b> <b>adds</b> controlling behaviors {{as a form of}} abuse. Intimate partner violence has been observed in opposite and same-sex relationships, and in the former instance by both men against women and women against men. Family violence is a broader term, often used to include child abuse, elder abuse, and other violent acts between family members.|$|E
25|$|Accepting {{that the}} {{conflicting}} {{data in the}} typed report's flight times indeed require both northward and southward ground speeds greater than the flight's eighty-five mph airspeed, a Byrd defender posits a westerly-moving anti-cyclone that tailwind-boosted Byrd's ground speed on both outward and inward legs, allowing the distance claimed to be covered in the time claimed (the theory is based on rejecting handwritten sextant data in favor of typewritten alleged dead-reckoning data). This suggestion has been challenged by Dennis Rawlins <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> that the sextant data in the long unavailable original official typewritten report are all expressed to 1", a precision not possible on Navy sextants of 1926 and not the precision of the sextant data in Byrd's diary for 1925 or the 1926 flight, which was normal (half or quarter of a minute of arc).|$|E

25|$|The Ecumenical Order {{is one of}} many listed “Unrecognised Orders” putting {{claim on}} the successors of the Order of St. John, however with some {{international}} recognition. By the early 19th-century, the original Order of St. John became defunct but various orders put claim over it; one of the Orders is the Ecumenical Order which is believed {{to be based on the}} Russian tradition dating back to Tsar Paul I in 1810 and to their split American Order in 1890 or 1908. Since 1997, the Prince and Grand Master of the Order was Joseph Frendo Cumbo, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> to his name the title Torre Sarocca, and resided in Canada. Roberto Paterno acts as the Prince and Grand Master Emeritus. Other notable individuals are Derrick Langford, the Grand Chancellor and Busietta himself was the Grand Prior of Malta. Busietta and others claim titles of nobility but there is no historic prove in support, and in any case such titles in Malta have been void since the 1970s. After the sudden death of Cumbo in 2006 and the disassociation of Nicholas Papanicolaou in 2011, Busietta was elected as the 78th Grandmaster of the Ecumenical Order and was eventually replaced on May 2, 2015 by Sandor Habsburg-Lothringen due to his declining health.|$|E
500|$|While comics {{are often}} {{the work of a}} single creator, the labour of making them is {{frequently}} divided between a number of specialists. [...] There may be separate writers and artists, and artists may specialize in parts of the artwork such as characters or backgrounds, as is common in Japan. [...] Particularly in American superhero comic books, the art may be divided between a penciller, who lays out the artwork in pencil; an inker, who finishes the artwork in ink; a colourist; and a letterer, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> the captions and speech balloons.|$|E

Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when working late, since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning her that was the last nice thing she would say. Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.|$|E

500|$|The sparse funk song [...] "Chicken Grease" [...] has lyrics advising against acting [...] "uptight", and it {{features}} D'Angelo referencing the line [...] "I know you got soul" [...] from Eric B. & Rakim's {{song of the}} same name (1987). It contains an ambiguous harmony and bass by Pino Palladino, who evokes the playing style of James Jamerson, with spontaneously improvised variations-on-a-theme parts that sit back [...] "in the pocket". The track was originally intended for Common's Like Water for Chocolate, but D'Angelo offered Common the song [...] "Geto Heaven Part Two" [...] as a trade. [...] "Chicken Grease" [...] is named after a technical term that musician Prince used for his guitarist to play a 9th minor chord while playing 16th notes. The song contains background voices, which one writer described as [...] "omnipresent party people channeled in from 'What's Going On' and 'Voodoo Chile', laughin and carryin on all over". Co-written by D'Angelo's former girlfriend, singer Angie Stone, [...] "Send It On" [...] contains lyrics concerning themes of honesty and faith in love, and features jazz trumpeter Roy Hargrove on flugel horn. Titled after a southern colloquial conflation of the terms [...] "One More Time" [...] and [...] "Again", the mid-tempo ballad [...] "One Mo'Gin" [...] has its narrator reminiscing about a former lover. Its introductory sound consisting of soft organ work and dim percussion evokes the sound of D'Angelo's [...] "Sh★t, Damn, Motherf★cker" [...] (1995). [...] "One Mo'Gin" [...] contains strong jazz overtones and a prominent rocksteady drum rhythm played by Questlove. It incorporates Delta blues-style bass and keyboard-driven verses with a melodic hook. The song is introduced with lead-in bass licks by Pino Palladino, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> musical texture to its sparse composition by using 10th notes and other arpeggio shapes. According to Seattle Weeklys Tricia Romano, the song's music actualizes [...] "new skool sensibility with old school soul".|$|E

[...] In any case, notes Flint, Huston took [...] "uncommon care to preserve the writer's styles and values... and sought repeatedly to transpose the interior essence of literature to film with dramatic and visual tension", as he did in Red Badge of Courage, Moby Dick, and Under the Volcano.|$|E

The documentary is titled Liang Sicheng Lin Huiyin and was directed by Hu Jingcao. Although Lin did not receive the recognition due to her during her lifetime because she was a woman, there is now a renewed revival of her legacy. It has been quoted of Lin Huiyin that [...] "it is often only through the light given off by a man that we see the woman behind him, particularly so for young women in the arts who emerged from the republican era. But Lin Huiyin is an exception. In her, we see the reflection of many outstanding men of the time, but in fact it is she <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> extra color and shine to their images." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series is}} {{written by a}} team of writers led by Armando Iannucci, who also directs the series, with Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Roger Drew, Sean Gray, Ian Martin, Will Smith and Tony Roche. [...] Some of the {{dialogue}} is improvised rather than scripted (with the cast credited as providing [...] "additional material"), and includes some very strong language. Peter Capaldi said [...] "Fundamentally 80% of the final cut is the script that we started with. The improvisation just makes it feel more real and not written." [...] Prior to rehearsals, the scripts are sent to a [...] "swearing consultant" [...] in Lancaster called Ian Martin, <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> some of the more colourful language. The programme's producer is Adam Tandy, who has produced all of Iannucci's television projects since 2000. The programme is shot with hand-held cameras to give it a sense of vérité or fly-on-the-wall documentary. The documentary style is furthered by the absence of any incidental music or laughter track.|$|E
2500|$|The Verve's members {{sometimes}} expressed bitter sentiments {{about the}} band's later years.

It just sits nicely next to the Oasis record", though conceding, [...] "I'm {{not going to say}} it was bad. I mean, we were good as far as pop goes". During his solo career, Ashcroft expressed regret at having asked McCabe to return for the album instead of releasing it under his own name, saying: [...] "Imagine being the guy that's written an album on his own, bottles it near the end, feels like there's unfinished business, rings Nick McCabe up <b>who</b> <b>adds</b> some guitars, puts it out as the Verve and the same problems arise again. Imagine being that mug. I've now got to rewrite history. Everyone thinks those songs are somehow associated with another bunch of people that I'm not with now". Jones claimed that [...] "The Verve were going off in a direction of strings and ballads, and that's not where I was coming from at all. Loud guitars is it for me", though noting that this was not why the band split up.|$|E
