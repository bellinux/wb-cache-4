25|$|The Hôtel Alexandre or Hôtel Soult, rue de la Ville l'Évêque, Paris (1763–1766), is {{the sole}} {{survivor}} of Boullée's residential work in Paris. It was built for the financier André-Claude-Nicolas Alexandre. In its cour d'honneur four Corinthian columns embedded against a recess in the <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> create an entry (now glazed). Flanking doors {{in the corners of}} the courtyard have isolated architraves embedded in the wall above their plain openings, while above oval bull's-eye windows are draped with the swags of husks that became a common feature of the neoclassical manner. The garden front has a colossal order of pilasters raised on the high basement occupied by the full height of the ground floor.|$|E
50|$|Buildings {{that had}} their main axis {{oriented}} East-West {{were in the}} same direction of the seismic waves and they responded much better: some of their parts were damaged but they were not totally ruined. They also presented the typical shear cracks when the ground motion is {{in the direction of the}} <b>wall</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stone County Courthouse is a {{historic}} courthouse located at Galena, Stone County, Missouri. It was built in 1920, and is a three-story, Classical Revival style brick building on a concrete foundation. It features two colossal, modified Doric order columns on a recessed <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> at {{the second and third}} stories. It cost $47,600 to complete.|$|E
30|$|The <b>wall</b> <b>planes</b> contain most of {{the points}} that form several {{straight}} lines on the x–z plane. Therefore, the four peaks of the Hough space are recognised as the parameters of the boundary <b>wall</b> <b>planes</b> after the (r, α) coordinates are generated from all the sensed indoor points using the Hough Transform. Each (r, α) cell in the Hough space records the count of the mapped LiDAR points; these indicate the occurrence frequency. The four peaks always exist in the intensive areas as shown in Fig.  4 d.|$|R
50|$|The {{church was}} built in a {{cruciform}} plan with few internal <b>wall</b> <b>planes,</b> an arched ceiling space formed by an exposed scissor-braced roof frame and a tall nave and arched windows giving the illusion of verticality.|$|R
50|$|Le Corbusier was {{impressed}} by the house and built a summer house nearby. At Badovici's behest, Le Corbusier painted several colourful murals {{on the wall of the}} building. Gray vehemently disapproved of the murals as they destroyed the integrity of the <b>wall</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Waist Wrap {{refers to}} a type of fountain, often {{performed}} in a <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> fashion by which the spinner moves his or her hand {{from one side of}} the body to the other by either reaching around the front, spinning behind him or herself, or from behind the back, spinning in front of him or herself.|$|E
50|$|Isolations {{refer to}} a class of moves where the poi handle is also spun in a circle, 180 degrees apart from the poi head. 'Perfect' {{isolation}} occurs when the poi handle and poi are moving in the same circle, and can usually create beautiful synchronized moves. Isolations can be done during a buzzsaw or {{in front of the}} body on a <b>wall</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
50|$|In medieval {{architecture}} {{the technique}} {{was used to}} support upper storeys or a parapet projecting forward from the <b>wall</b> <b>plane,</b> often to form machicolation (openings between corbels {{could be used to}} drop things onto attackers). This later became a decorative feature, without the openings. Corbelling supporting upper stories and particularly supporting projecting corner turrets subsequently became a characteristic of the Scottish baronial style.|$|E
40|$|Demands on {{heat flow}} {{detection}} at a <b>plane</b> <b>wall</b> via a thermoelectric module have drawn researchers’ attention to quantitative understanding {{in order to}} properly implement the thermoelectric module in thermal engineering practices. Basic mathematical models of both heat transfer through a <b>plane</b> <b>wall</b> and thermoelectric effects are numerically solved to represent genuine behaviors of heat flow detection by mounting a thermoelectric module at a <b>plane</b> <b>wall.</b> The heat transfer through the <b>plane</b> <b>wall</b> {{is expected to be}} detected. It is intriguing from simulation results that the heat rejected at the <b>plane</b> <b>wall</b> is identical to the heat absorbed by the thermoelectric module when the area of the <b>plane</b> <b>wall</b> is {{the same as that of}} the thermoelectric module. Furthermore, both the area sizes of the <b>plane</b> <b>walls</b> and the convective heat transfer coefficients at the wall influence amount of the heat absorbed by the thermoelectric module. Those observational data are modeled for development of sensing heat flow through a <b>plane</b> <b>wall</b> by a thermoelectric module in practical uses...|$|R
50|$|The church {{resembles a}} Baroque {{architectural}} style. The {{third and fourth}} levels form a large pediment with the raking cornice consisting of huge scrolls. The topmost level was painted with the picture of Saint Dominic. The middle segment gives contrast within the levels through the designs along its <b>wall</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{was the first}} in Britain built entirely with pre-stressed concrete. To cast the concrete, plywood shuttering was used. Because of the limitations of this technique, unintended horizontal bands appear on the external walls every 1.2m, where the joints between the levels of shuttering were inadequately sealed. There was also some bowing of the plywood under the pressure of the drying concrete, which caused some bowing of the <b>wall</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The five {{floors of}} office space that makeup the second section provide a {{contrast}} with {{the base of the}} building and except for quoins, are unadorned. The windows in this section are set close to the exterior <b>wall</b> <b>plane.</b> A narrow cornice divides the second and third sections. Its two-story pilasters emphasize the structure's vertical thrust, but the dark, recessed spandrels counteract the effect. [...] The building culminates in a wide, bracketed, overhanging cornice.|$|E
50|$|In a traditional, often {{decorative}} use, large exactly cuboid ashlar stone blocks or replicas {{are only}} {{used on the}} corners with their longest sides horizontally: the longest sides are laid to be on one <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> then the other that the corner forms (course after course). This forms a long-side, short-side alternate pattern, which by using the same size blocks alternates when the viewer passes the corner. This can be called the alternate, horizontal quoining technique.|$|E
5000|$|A jharokha (or jharoka) {{is a type}} of {{overhanging}} {{enclosed balcony}} used in Architecture of Rajasthan. It was also used in Indo-Islamic architecture [...] Jharokhas jutting forward from the <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> could be used both for adding to the architectural beauty of the building itself or for a specific purpose. One of the most important functions it served was to allow women to see the events outside without being seen themselves. Alternatively, these windows could also be used to position archers and spies.|$|E
50|$|The {{early twentieth}} century {{movement}} Modern Architecture, pioneered by Russian Constructivism, used rectilinear Euclidean (also called Cartesian) geometry. In the De Stijl movement, the horizontal and the vertical were seen as constituting the universal. The architectural form consists of putting these two directional tendencies together, using roof <b>planes,</b> <b>wall</b> <b>planes</b> and balconies, which either slide past or intersect each other, as in the 1924 Rietveld Schröder House by Gerrit Rietveld.|$|R
50|$|Jones is {{also noted}} for his many ecclesiastical projects, and {{completed}} {{a total of}} six churches for the Catholic Church. All of his churches were inspired by cave-like catacombs, a common metaphor he used in the design of communal spaces. The Church of St Cecilia, in Kenmore Crescent Floreat, references this cave-like metaphor, and departs from the typical cruciform plan. Instead, St. Cecilia's pentagonal form was based on a total of ten <b>planes</b> (five <b>walls</b> <b>planes</b> and five roof planes), which symbolised the Ten Commandments and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.|$|R
50|$|Potter {{used the}} Beaux-Arts style {{that had become}} popular over the {{preceding}} decades, particularly for public buildings. Only one other building in the village, the Bank for Savings, a contributing property to the Downtown Ossining Historic District built {{the year after the}} school, would use it. The school is a particular strong example of the style, with its axial symmetry, advancing and retreating <b>wall</b> <b>planes</b> and classical detailing. Despite the building's relatively small size, it achieves the monumental presence characteristic of Beaux-Arts buildings through an exaggerated sense of its height conveyed the combination of its siting on a low rise and its hipped roof and chimneys.|$|R
50|$|Though {{intended}} for masonry in stone, the motif can be executed in other materials, especially brick, often masked in stucco, wood, or just paint. British vernacular housing {{of the late}} 19th century often uses alternating coloured blocks, {{with little or no}} projection from the main <b>wall</b> <b>plane,</b> but emphasized by a different colour from the main wall. These can be seen even on small terraced houses, often using cast stone, and used on both the door and ground floor windows.|$|E
50|$|Wall dormers {{are less}} {{commonly}} seen than typical “roof dormers”. They locate the window {{flush with the}} <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> above or through the cornice line. They are essentially {{a continuation of the}} wall above the roof eaves. They are thus more of a vertically projecting wall element than an elaboration of the roof. Unlike roof dormers, wall dormers tend to feature highly ornamental window surrounds. Also in contrast to roof dormers, they generally offer little or no increase in floor space or head room.|$|E
5000|$|Butterfly - {{also known}} as [...] "{{opposite}}s," [...] refers to any number of tricks in which the poi move in opposite directions. For example, while spinning in parallel, one poi head would be moving forward while the other in reverse. While in a <b>wall</b> <b>plane,</b> one head would be moving clockwise, the other counter-clockwise. Poi spinning in the same-time and same position are considered the traditional [...] "butterfly" [...] as when viewed from the front, the poi appear to meet {{at the top and}} bottom of the spin thus simulating the flapping of butterfly wings.|$|E
5000|$|This {{architectural}} {{description of}} the National building was written for its National Register nomination in 1982: [...] "The Western Avenue facade consists of eight bays encompassing storefronts at the ground story, and horizontal window bands in the upper five stories. The bays are defined by nine piers which are expressed externally as pilasters, and terminated at the sixth story by large ionic capitals. <b>Wall</b> <b>planes</b> within each bay are recessed behind the nine pilasters and enriched with molded back surrounds at the sides and top. Fenestration {{is characterized by a}} regular system of horizontal window groupings, each consisting of four pivoting windows with transoms. The window bands are separated vertically by wide, unadorned brick spandrels. Two of the bays include fire escapes.|$|R

50|$|At {{the first}} two stories, the granite is rusticated to {{articulate}} {{the base of the}} building. The upper stories of the south facade, which faces United Nations Plaza, are covered with smooth-faced granite and dominated by a colonnade of detached two-story Doric columns that are aligned with Doric pilasters on the building. A classical balustrade supports the railing between the columns. Fenestration consists primarily of regularly spaced rectangular windows with multi-pane configurations. The attic story is set back from the <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> of the building and is surrounded by a classical balustrade and topped by a molded cornice.|$|E

5000|$|Archer's design was, as requested, in the Italian Baroque style. On the {{entrance}} facade of eleven bays, the giant order {{with a level}} balustraded roof {{is very similar to}} the design which William Talman had executed for the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House just few years earlier. Archer's Corinthian order shifts restlessly against the <b>wall</b> <b>plane,</b> varying on {{the entrance}} front from flat pilasters to attached columns, to a free-standing screen that marches across the recessed entrance bays. The <b>wall</b> <b>plane</b> is ashlar on the entrance front but with strictly conventionalized channeled rustication the full height of the garden front. On the side elevations, the channeled rustication appears only on the rusticated pilaster-like corner quoins of the lightly projecting five central bays. In the frieze under the main cornice, occasional discreet square openings give light to the low attics.The inspiration for the Baroque facade at Heythrop was Gian Lorenzo Bernini's final design for the Louvre, a plan never executed. Like Chatsworth, Heythrop Park comprises two floors linked by the giant order standing upon a raised semi-basement; the bays are articulated by a giant order with the Baroque inturned Corinthian volutes invented by Francesco Borromini. The elevation is broken by three projections, the centre being the central portico with Corinthian columns; this has no pediment to break the roof-line. In a break from his usual style, Archer has given the fenestration unusual emphasis by contrasting architectural detailing: the windows on the ground floor are from a design by Bernini, while those on the floor above are in a mannerist style with overlarge keystones penetrating the cornice, as at Talman's Chatsworth. The central nine bays of the 13-bay garden front carry the rustication of the half-basement right up the wall to the cornice, with perfectly plain window openings and a central door framed in a very sober Doric order; this severe front is relieved by its richly treated two-bay end pavilions, which take up all the rich motifs of the entrance front.|$|E

50|$|The Lafayette Building's {{steel frame}} is encased with {{concrete}} and brick, collectively {{selected by the}} architects for their fireproof qualities. The first story of the building, which contains retail space, is clad in black granite, while the upper levels are faced with smooth light grey limestone on the street-front elevations. Less costly brick faces the alley and courtyard elevations. Regularly spaced square windows with one-over-one, double-hung configurations dominate all elevations and are slightly recessed to avoid interruption of the <b>wall</b> <b>plane.</b> Bronze is used liberally {{on the first two}} stories, forming spandrels that divide the first and second levels, window frames, entrance doors, shop fronts, and select railings. Simple recessed panels at select ends of the building run the full height of the main mass and suggest plain classically inspired pilasters. A parapet wall with a deeply recessed mortar joint tops the tenth story and forms the terrace edge that contains the building's upper two stories.|$|E
5000|$|The Grand Auditorium and Hotel Block is a {{group of}} four {{adjoining}} historic commercial buildings located in Story City, Iowa, United States. From the east, buildings one and three housed various commercial establishments over the years. Building two housed the Grand Opera House, now known as the Story Theatre/Grand Opera House. It has been used for both live theater productions and movies. The fourth building housed the Grand Hotel. The Grand Hotel and Auditorium Company was organized from Story City's Commercial Club in 1913. They hired Estherville, Iowa architect James S. Cox to design the complex, which was completed in December 1913. While each facade is unique, all four buildings share common elements. Their commonalities include two-stories in height, red brick exterior walls ornamented with buff brick and concrete details. The first three buildings share the same <b>wall</b> <b>plane,</b> while the hotel is slightly recessed from the others. They also decrease in scale from east to west. This slight variation is due to differing treatments of the cornices and parapets. [...] The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The ease of {{panorama}} creation {{has made}} it very popular. Although it is a very convenient way to convey the environment, panoramic images can often be confusing. This discomfort has major influence in a 360 degree indoor panorama, where the viewer is forced to look in all the directions at the same time. In this paper we propose an alternative approach for visualization of the indoor environment. Instead of using the panorama directly, our method reconstructs a floor-plan from it and displays the created 3 D model. During the reconstruction the user is only required to mark the corners in the original image. For the <b>wall</b> <b>planes</b> we use unwrapped texture mapping. Our experiments show that the proposed approach copes very well with the complex environments that include large spaces and corridors. 1...|$|R
