40|$|The present article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between social desirability and <b>worry.</b> In particular, it addresses {{the question of whether}} socio-political <b>worries</b> (i. e. <b>worries</b> about societal or environmental problems) show a different relationship with social desirability than <b>worries</b> related to one's social-evaluative self-concept (i. e. <b>worries</b> about one's own relationships, future, work, or finances). A sample of 155 students responded to self-report questionnaires on <b>worry</b> and social desirability, first under standard instructions and then under social desirability-provoking instructions (imaginary job-application instructions). As expected, results showed opposite relationships for socio-political and social-evaluation <b>worries.</b> First, socio-political <b>worries</b> showed positive correlations with scores from the social desirability questionnaire, whereas social-evaluation <b>worries</b> showed negative correlations. Second, endorsements of socio-political <b>worries</b> increased under social desirability-provoking instructions, whereas those of social-evaluation <b>worries</b> decreased. However, all correlations between self-reported <b>worry</b> and social-desirability scores were rather small. Moreover, in absolute terms, socio-political <b>worries</b> did not show any greater social-desirability bias than social-evaluation <b>worries.</b> Implications for self-report measures of socio-political <b>worries</b> (e. g. environmental <b>worry,</b> <b>worry</b> about technological risks) and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Background Despite being {{extensively}} {{studied in}} adults, investigation of <b>worry</b> and it's associated cognitive variables remains {{in its infancy}} in paediatric samples. Aims This study aimed to investigate 1) whether the child cognitive variables of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), positive beliefs about <b>worry</b> (PBW), negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> (NBW), negative problem orientation (NPO) and cognitive avoidance (CA) were associated with child <b>worry,</b> 2) whether parental <b>worry</b> and cognitive variables were associated with child <b>worry,</b> 3) whether the relationship between child and parent <b>worry</b> was mediated by child cognitive variables and 4) whether the relationships between specific parent cognitive factors and child <b>worry</b> were mediated by specific child cognitive factors. Method Participants were 114 children plus one of their parents. Parents and children completed questionnaires assessing {{each of the five}} cognitive variables and <b>worry.</b> Results When examined together, child NBW and CA significantly predicted child <b>worry.</b> Parent <b>worry,</b> IU and CA were significantly and positively related to child <b>worry.</b> The relationship between parent <b>worry</b> and child <b>worry</b> was mediated by child NBW and CA. The relationship between parent IU, NPO and CA and child <b>worry</b> was mediated by child IU, NPO and CA respectively.

40|$|Objective: <b>Worry</b> is {{a common}} and {{distressing}} problem in Parkinson’s disease(PD). However, {{little is known about}} the nature and content of <b>worry</b> in PD and how it might differ to non-PD populations. The study aimed to explore the content and nature of <b>worry</b> in middle and older aged adults with and without PD. Method: 4 groups of participants: 20 PD patients(10 high <b>worry,</b> 10 low <b>worry)</b> 19 middle and older aged adults(10 high <b>worry,</b> 9 low <b>worry)</b> completed the Catastrophising Interview(CI) for three <b>worry</b> topics. Worriers were classified(high/low) based on Penn State <b>Worry</b> Questionnaire scores. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis. Results: High worriers showed a greater diversity of <b>worry</b> topics than low worriers. Health <b>worries</b> differentiated high and low worriers in the non-PD sample but were common across all PD participants. The CI revealed that the root concern of <b>worry</b> was often different to that initially described. In particular, PD high worriers were more likely to express underlying concerns about negative self-perception and death/severe incapacity. Conclusion: The CI was able to identify the root cause of <b>worry,</b> demonstrating the value of this technique in the exploration and treatment of <b>worry</b> and psychological distress. Exploring <b>worry</b> content may help to distinguish patients with problematic <b>worry,</b> with <b>worries</b> about self-perception and death/severe incapacity characteristic of high worriers. Therapeutic interventions designed to alleviate problematic <b>worry</b> and distress in PD need to take account of the realities of living with PD and the potentially realistic nature of <b>worries</b> which may appear catastrophic in a healthy population...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that <b>worry</b> is associated with distressing paranoia. Therefore, the aim was to target <b>worry</b> in a therapeutic intervention for individuals with delusions. It was predicted that a <b>worry</b> intervention would reduce levels of <b>worry</b> and paranoia distress. Twenty-four individuals with persistent persecutory delusions and high levels of <b>worry</b> were randomly assigned to receive a four session cognitive-behavioural <b>worry</b> intervention (W-CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). The <b>worry</b> intervention was specifically designed not to target the content of delusions. In this open-label evaluation, assessments of <b>worry</b> and paranoia were conducted at baseline, at one month (end of treatment) and at two months. The <b>worry</b> intervention achieved a statistically significant reduction in <b>worry</b> which was maintained at two month follow up. A significant reduction in delusional distress was also reported. There was an indication that the <b>worry</b> intervention may also reduce the frequency of paranoid thoughts but this was not statistically significant. In the first trial specifically for persecutory delusions, a brief <b>worry</b> intervention was shown to have benefits.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} {{that there is a}} {{significant}} gender difference in the <b>worry</b> report of women and men, with women consistently reporting more <b>worry</b> than men (Stavosky & Borkovec, 1988). This study investigated this phenomenon by looking at gender differences in cognitive variables associated with excessive <b>worry.</b> Intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, positive beliefs about <b>worry,</b> and cognitive avoidance have been linked with the generation and maintenance of <b>worry</b> (Dugas et al., 1998). Two-hundred and twenty-one female and 103 male university students completed six questionnaires assessing trait <b>worry,</b> intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, positive beliefs about <b>worry,</b> and cognitive avoidance. The results showed that women reported significantly more <b>worry</b> than men on two trait <b>worry</b> scales, as well as significantly more <b>worries</b> about lack of confidence issues. In relation to cognitive variables associated with <b>worry,</b> women also reported engaging in significantly more thought suppression and negative problem orientation than men. A non-significant trend emerged for a closer relationship between positive beliefs about <b>worry</b> and trait <b>worry</b> for men. It is postulated that thought suppression and negative problem orientation may account for women's increased reporting of <b>worry,</b> and that positive beliefs about <b>worry</b> may have a closer relationship to <b>worry</b> in men.

40|$|AbstractBackground and objectivesWorry is {{predominantly}} a verbal-linguistic process with relatively little imagery. This study investigated whether the verbal nature of <b>worry</b> {{contributes to the}} maintenance of <b>worry</b> by enhancing attention to threat. It was hypothesised that verbal <b>worry</b> would lead to greater attentional bias to threat than imagery-based <b>worry.</b> MethodsFifty high-worriers were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two groups, one in which they were instructed to <b>worry</b> in a verbal way and one in which they <b>worried</b> in an imagery-based way, before completing a dot probe task as a measure of attention to threat-related words. ResultsThose who <b>worried</b> in verbal form demonstrated greater attentional bias to threat than did those who <b>worried</b> in imagery-based form. These findings could not be accounted for by group differences in personal relevance of or distress associated with <b>worry</b> topics, state mood following <b>worry,</b> levels of the relatedness of participants' <b>worries</b> to stimuli on the dot probe task, trait anxiety, general propensity to <b>worry,</b> nor adherence to the <b>worry</b> training. LimitationsThe present study only included word stimuli in the dot probe task; inclusion of images would allow for firmly rejecting the hypothesis that the attention effects observed following verbal <b>worry</b> were merely a result of priming verbal threat representations. Also, future studies could include a further control group that does not engage in any form of <b>worry</b> to ascertain that verbal <b>worry</b> increased attentional bias rather than imagery decreasing pre-existing attentional bias.

40|$|Although {{previous}} research has pointed to <b>worry</b> {{as one of the}} highest causal attributions reported by MI patients, no studies have primarily investigated the concept of <b>worry</b> in this cohort. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of pathological <b>worry</b> in MI patients who reported <b>worry</b> as a causal factor to their MI (Experimental group), compared to MI patients that did not implicate <b>worry</b> as a causal attribute (Control group). A central hypothesis to this study was that higher pathological <b>worry</b> would be found in the Experimental group, and would be significantly associated with meta-worry (<b>worry</b> about <b>worry),</b> rather than health worry.;The design was cross-sectional, and consisted of administering self-report questionnaires to a total of 34 post-MI patients (n= 17 in each group). The questionnaire measured: pathological <b>worry,</b> meta-worry, anxiety, depression, and thought control strategies. Participants in the Experimental group were found to be significantly younger than the Control group, and a higher proportion were employed.;The main results indicated that no {{differences were found between the}} two groups in terms of <b>worries</b> relating to their health. However, pathological <b>worry,</b> meta-worry, social <b>worry,</b> anxiety and the use of thought control strategies were significantly higher in the Experimental group, compared with the Control group. Interestingly, none of the participants (N= 34) reported symptoms of depression at a clinical level. Further analysis revealed that pathological <b>worry</b> significant correlated with meta-worry and the thought control strategy known as 'Punishment'.;In conclusion MI patients who rated <b>worry</b> highly as causal to their MI were also found to be more pathologically <b>worried</b> after their MI than participants who implicated physical factors as causal attributes. However, this pathological <b>worry</b> was not related to <b>worry</b> about health, but was regarded as a coping response that is best understood from a metacognitive model of a generalised anxiety disorder...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>worry</b> {{is common}} in children, {{little is known about}} its {{development}} and maintenance. The current study reviews several areas of the literature to inform a comprehensive cognitive model of clinical <b>worry</b> in children.

Next, the potential impact of cognitive development on childhood <b>worry</b> is presented. A cognitive model is then proposed, and empirical support for the model is reviewed. Finally, a portion of the model is identified and tested empirically. Specifically, this study tests the hypothesis that cognitive development will predict the cognitive variables of threat interpretation, beliefs about <b>worry,</b> negative problem orientation, and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). It is also hypothesized that the cognitive variables will predict <b>worry</b> and that this association will be moderated by child development, such that the predictive power of the cognitive variables increases with child development. It was also hypothesized that female children will score higher than male children on the four cognitive variables and on measures of <b>worry.</b> Finally, it was predicted that scores on the cognitive variables will discriminate children with clinical levels of <b>worry</b> from those with nonclinical levels of <b>worry.</b> Children were recruited from public and private schools. A total of 80 {{children between the ages of}} 8 and 12 years completed the study. Overall, hypotheses were partially supported. Cognitive development, as measured by child age, explained variance in intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, and negative beliefs about <b>worry.</b> Intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, and negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> significantly predicted <b>worry,</b> and negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> emerged as the strongest predictor. Threat interpretation and positive beliefs about <b>worry</b> were not correlated with <b>worry.</b> Female children reported higher levels of negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> and negative problem orientation, but not <b>worry.</b> Finally, intolerance of uncertainty, negative beliefs about <b>worry,</b> and negative problem orientation discriminated clinical from nonclinical levels of <b>worry.</b> Exploratory analyses examined potential developmental trends in associations between the cognitive variables and <b>worry.</b> Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and clinical implications and suggestions for future research are offered...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{studies suggest}} that <b>worry</b> content and {{prevalence}} may vary {{as a function of}} age, but evidence is limited. Methods: Cross-sectional national survey of 8, 580 householders in Great Britain, (GB) aged between 16 and 74 years. This analysis examined the relationship between age, <b>worry</b> content (relationships/family, financial/housing, work, health, miscellaneous) common mental disorders, and functional limitation, adjusting for other sociodemographic factors. Results: Overall, the prevalence of <b>worries</b> declined with age. However, with the exception of <b>worry</b> about relationships, the strength of associations between <b>worry</b> types and mental disorder either remained constant or increased in the older age groups. Compared to the 16 - 24 year reference group, <b>worries</b> about relationships/family, finances/housing and work were lower in the 55 - 74 year age groups. Financial/housing <b>worries</b> were increased in the 25 - 44 year group, and health <b>worries</b> were increased in the 25 - 64 year groups. There were independent associations between all <b>worry</b> items and the categories of mental disorder. All <b>worry</b> types apart from miscellaneous <b>worries</b> were independently associated, positively or negatively, with functional limitation. Conclusions: <b>Worry</b> content in the general population varies as a function of age, gender, marital status, and educational attainment. All categories of <b>worry</b> are more prevalent in individuals with common mental disorders. The lower prevalence of <b>worries</b> and their stronger association with mental disorder in old age emphasize the clinical significance of these symptoms in this age group.
