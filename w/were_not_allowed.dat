5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> {{to eat or}} {{smoke in}} processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of}} each day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>allowed</b> in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
