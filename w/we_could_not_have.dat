500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had a better, braver officer. He was with us {{all the time in the}} front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could have done better. Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E

As we got into deep water, the sea did not make such terrible surges over us; though they continued to break over our quarter. The masts were thumping away; but for this I cared little, the hold being full of water already. Sink <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> <b>having</b> a wept hold, and being built, in a great measure, of pine. The schooner floated with about five feet of her quarter-deck above water. Her bows had settled the most; and this gave us rather a better chance aft.|$|R
60|$|But {{there were}} warm hearts and kind faces waiting {{us on the}} quay, and good news too. The gentlemen at the Custom-house courteously {{declined}} the least inspection of our luggage; and we were at once away in the train home. At first, I must confess, an English winter was a change for the worse. Fine old oaks and beeches looked to us, fresh from ceibas and balatas, like leafless brooms stuck into the ground by their handles; while the want of light was for some days painful and depressing But we had done it; and within the three months, as we promised. As the king in the old play says, 'What has been, has been, and I've had my hour.' At last we had seen it; and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> unsee it. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been in the Tropics.|$|R
500|$|After the 2009 Afghan presidential election, Afghan President Karzai's {{views about}} the {{security}} issues confronting Afghanistan {{and how best to}} deal with them reportedly changed. This impacted the working relationship between the President of Afghanistan and some of his cabinet ministers including his intelligence chief. Saleh said, [...] "He [...] thought democracy had hurt him as a person. His family had been attacked by the media unfairly, and the West was criticizing him unfairly. So after a presidential election, he was a changed man, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the same relationship as before the presidential election." [...] Political analyst Ahmed Rashid in 2010 observed the same, [...] "Karzai's new outlook is the most dramatic political shift he has undergone in the twenty-six years that I have known him." [...] Both Saleh and Interior Minister Hanif Atmar subsequently had strong disagreements with Karzai on how to proceed against the Taliban, who Karzai began referring to as [...] "brothers". At that point Saleh and Atmar were increasingly isolated in the Karzai administration.|$|E
500|$|The journal, which {{switches}} {{between the}} first-person singular and plural but never identifies its narrators, describes Percy, Mary, and Claire's 1814 six-week tour across the Continent. It is divided by country: France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. After the group arrives in Calais {{and proceeds to}} Paris, they decide on a plan: [...] "After talking over and rejecting many plans, we fixed on one eccentric enough, but which, from its romance, was very pleasing to us. In England <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> put it in execution without sustaining continual insult and impertinence: the French are far more tolerant of the vagaries of their neighbours. We resolved to walk through France". Each day they enter a new town; but even while travelling, they spend time writing and reading. The journal comments on the people they meet, the countryside, and the current events that have shaped the environment. Some of what they see is beautiful and some is [...] "barren and wretched". Percy sprains his ankle, which becomes an increasing problem—the group is forced to hire a carriage. By the time the trio reaches Lucerne, they are nearly out of money and decide to return home. They return by boat along the Rhine, the cheapest mode of travel. Despite problems with unreliable boats and dangerous waters, they see some beautiful scenery before landing in England.|$|E

On September 21, 2011, it was announced via PR Newswire that Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) would launch [...] "a star-studded" [...] new Public Service Advertising (PSA) campaign and that the soundtrack for the campaign would be [...] "I Was Here". Nationwide, Boys & Girls Clubs provide high-impact, affordable programs, and caring adult mentors, to keep kids {{on the path to}} great futures, emphasizing academic success, good character and citizenship, and healthy lifestyles. The director, Ron Howard explained the reason behind choosing [...] "I Was Here" [...] as the soundtrack of their new PSA: [...] "We wanted the most powerful piece of music possible, to underscore the dramatic message that what we do today to shape the future of our children is vitally important. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> picked a more moving track.

500|$|On the tour, {{the dynamic}} nature of Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with his quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. He was {{described}} as aloof from his teammates {{and he did not}} offer to buy them a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw. Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone, writing, as he had sold the rights to a book. On his return to Australia, Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception; he became a [...] "reluctant hero". Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee's newly won fame. They asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, where he received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Bradman received a level of adulation that [...] "embarrassed" [...] him. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, [...] "...permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries". Commenting on Australia's victory, the team's vice-captain Vic Richardson said, [...] "...we could have played any team without Bradman, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett". A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying [...] "I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia." ...|$|E

The overconfident Emperor neglected to scout ahead. On 25 July his army entered the Varbica Pass but his cavalry told him the road was barred with thick wooden walls and Krum's detachments watched from the heights around.
