40|$|Water {{temperature}} {{is a very}} important parameter of water quality. In the natural conditions water {{temperature is}} determined by hydrological and meteorological factors, in particular by the heat budget of river or lake. For the few decades, however, due to the many new power and industrial developments, anthropogenic factors have greater influence on river and lake water temperatures. The temperature of water affects biological and chemical processes in aquatic environment and can {{play an important role in}} shaping ice phenomena. In this paper a simple, one-dimensional thermal model is presented. It allows to determine the average water temperature in the cross-sections of the river downstream of the heated <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>point.</b> The model has been developed in the Department of Water Physics at the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, Warsaw, Poland. It can be useful for the design of water management systems in taking decisions on hydraulic structures or on location of large conventional and nuclear power plants. The work has been done within the framework of cooperation between the Polish scientific institutions and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria...|$|E
40|$|In a {{waste water}} {{biological}} treatment process, the novelty is that: (a) non-dissolved substances are removed by a quantitative membrane separation process {{before the first}} aerobic biological treatment stage; (b) the membrane treatment is a single-stage or multi-stage process, the first or last stage of which is filtration, micro-filtration, nano-filtration, ultra-filtration and reverse osmosis; (c) the filtrate arising from the membrane separation process is surrendered to aerobic fermentation, while the membrane process concentrate is surrendered to anaerobic fermentation; (d) the concentrate contains 3 - 15 % solids by weight; (e) inorganic substances are removed from the filtrate before aerobic fermentation by precipitation or steam stripping; (f) the filtrate is aerobically fermented in a ventilated, fully mixed fermenter, in which the cells discharged from the brew are further cleaned by a filter unit before being returned to the fermenter {{in whole or in}} part; (g) the filtrate is ni trified or de-nitrified as required, phosphates precipitated and then discharged to a receiving tank; (h) the biocatalysts discharged from the aerobic fermentation reactor are surrendered to an anaerobic bioreactor and; (i) the concentrate from the membrane separation process and the biocatalysts are surrendered to the same bioreactor. USE - Separation of the waste into organic and dissolved substances. The concentrate is then suited for treatment by aerobic fermentation.

40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} work {{was carried out}} to investigate the chemistry and ecotoxicity of stream water affected by acid mine drainage in a tributary catchment of the Pearl River in subtropical China during a major flood that corresponded to a return period of 100 years. The results indicate that stream water was affected by acid mine drainage from the Dabaoshan mine at least to a distance of 25 km downstream of the mine <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>point.</b> It appears that H+ generated from sulfide oxidation in the waste rock dumps was readily available for exporting. The amount of H+ being discharged into the receiving stream depended on the volume of out-flowing waters. However, there was a lag time for the discharges of the metals. This {{may be attributed to}} the slower release of metals, relative to H+, because it might take more time for the dissolution of heavy metal-bearing compounds, particularly the sparsely soluble jarosites. Fe, Zn and Al were the major metals of potential toxicity contained in the AMD-affected stream water, followed by Mn, Cu, Pb, As, Cd and Ni. The concentrations of these metals in the water decreased rapidly down the stream. This corresponds with an increase in the concentrations of reactive heavy metal fractions in benthic mud down the stream, reflecting the precipitation of heavy metal compounds with increasing pH and their subsequent deposition in the streambed. Toxicity tests show that the AMD-affected stream water at 3. 5 km downstream of the discharge point was highly toxic to the test organism. At 25 km downstream of the discharge point where stream water pH was as high as 5. 75, marked toxic responses of the test organism were still observed...|$|E

The objective of the survey {{was to assess the}} extent to which produced water (PW) discharged from Gullfaks C platform affects organisms living in the water column. The study was designed to monitor bioaccumulation and biomarker responses in mussels held in cages {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>point,</b> with supporting information from passive sampling devices. Significantly greater bioaccumulation of PAH and NPD compounds was found in mussels from the two stations positioned 500 m from the platform, with concentrations significantly higher in mussels from one of the 500 m stations (i. e. station 2). All other mussel stations positioned 1000 m and 2000 m from the platform had PAH-NPD bioaccumulation typical of offshore background concentrations. There was very good agreement between the biomarker responses and the chemical concentration data. The calculated integrated biological response (IBR/n) was markedly higher in mussels from station 2, indicating poorer health. The IBR/n was also slightly raised in mussels from station 3 (1000 m), which was considered to be due to other chemicals within the PW. Alkyl phenols and naphthenic acids were detected in all POCIS placed at selected mussel stations from 500 to 2000 m, with mussel station 2 (500 m) and 3 (1000 m) showing highest concentrations of these compounds. PAH metabolites were detected in wild caught whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and tusk (Brosme brosme). The measured PAH metabolites in both fish species were indicative of weathered PW chemicals. Overall chemical bioaccumulation and impaired health to caged mussels was observed in mussels exposed to the PW plume located 500 m downstream from the platform.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the TENORM samples for their initial activity concentrations, the chemical types of bounding the contained natural radionuclides occur, the resulting radon emanation coefficients and finally the transfer factors, leads to the following statements: • Phosphate industry: 1. In dependence from the geological origin, the used raw materials and the produced fertiliser can contain enhanced initial activity concentrations, the latter mainly uranium 2. From the raw materials 226 Ra can be easily mobilised, in case of the phosphogypsum waste and produced fertiliser attention must be paid for 238 U and 210 Pb 3. Highly contaminated raw materials can result in enhanced radon emanation rates, also the fertiliser can contribute to some radon enhancement 4. There is a well developed transfer factor for 226 Ra from all materials involved into plants • Aluminium industry: 1. In dependence from the geological origin, the used raw materials can contain enhanced initial activity concentrations 2. 226 Ra is the relevant radionuclide and can be easily mobilised from the raw materials and the waste as well 3. Highly contaminated raw materials can result in strongly enhanced radon emanation rates, 4. Transfer factors are established for 226 Ra into water from both types of bauxites • Refractory industry: 1. Enhanced initial activity concentrations occur in the additive zircon sand and the fused zirconia mullite products 2. 226 Ra is the relevant radionuclide being present in all materials but not really leachable, 210 Pb can be easily mobilised from the filter dust waste in some extent 3. The radon emanation rates are generally low 4. 228 Th is transferable into water and plants • Crude oil exploitation: 1. Enhanced initial activity concentrations especially of 210 Pb occur in the sludge and scale wastes 2. 210 Pb is the relevant radionuclide being present in all materials and is mostly bound to organo-sulphur compounds, relatively few amounts are easily mobilisable 3. The sludge can cause really high radon emanation rates 4. The sludge releases both radium isotopes and 228 Th as well for water • Hard coal extraction: 1. Enhanced initial activity concentrations of 226 Ra can occur close to the mining <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>point</b> and along the riverbanks 2. 226 Ra is the relevant radionuclide being enhanced present in all materials, but is not mobilisable, 228 Th is found under easily available, reducible and oxidisable conditions • Thorium compounds industry: 1. Strongly enhanced initial activity concentrations of 228 Ra and 228 Th can occur in soils being influenced by former thorium processing 2. 228 Ra and 228 Th are proven to be available especially for plants 3. The resulting transfer factors for the pathway “solid-plant” concern all radionuclides • Uranium industry: 1. Strongly enhanced initial activity concentrations occur in the uranium ores and the tailing wastes, unwanted by-products can be contaminated partly 2. All uranium radionuclides are not preferably bound in the raw materials, especially 226 Ra and 210 Pb can be easily leached from the tailings, the unwanted by-products dead rocks mainly contain the uranium radionuclides bound to sulphides, sediments show uranium radionuclides being bound to oxides, the most of them is strongly fixed 3. The uranium ores and tailing wastes cause really high radon emanation rates, in case of dead rocks they are lower, contaminated sediments can show enhanced emanation rates 4. Important transfer factors are set from tailings into water for 226 Ra and into plants for uranium and lead, from sediments 226 Ra can be transferred into plants • Investigation procedure: 1. The developed investigation procedure as presented in this study to determine simultaneously many radionuclides in extraction liquids by gamma-spectrometry is more applicable and reliable for highly contaminated samples 2. The influence of different grain sizes on the radionuclides’ mobilisation potential is rather low 3. Uranium oxides can not be cracked by scientific extraction procedures 4. Some limitation of the investigation procedure seems to be given by the low amounts of starting material for the extraction procedures as proposed in their instructions and the resulting small extraction liquid volumes For all those reasons, TENORM must be controlled not only for their initial activity concentrations, radon releases and the resulting radiological hazard, but for their radionuclide mobilisation potential and environmental influences, too...|$|E

In order to explore the source apportionment and historic record of lead pollution in the marine sediments, concentration of lead was determined from the Botany Bay and Port Hacking estuaries, south of Sydney, Australia. Areas with the highest concentrations of lead in the sediment samples were analysed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for lead isotopes to effectively identify the metal contamination source. In addition, other sediment samples were collected from cores at 40 cm depth to represent the natural background composition. The {{study found that the}} total lead in the tested marine sediments varied from 75. 6 mg/kg to 582. 2 mg/kg. The 206 Pb/ 204 Pb showed a decline towards the current surface sediment. Assuming that the natural background source of lead remains the same in terms of both isotopic signature and accumulation rate, the decline in 206 Pb/ 204 Pb indicated a rise in the contribution of old lead to the sediment, mainly from gasoline fumes (car and boat exhausts) and paint.

The study was designed to monitor bio-accumulation and biomarker responses in organisms held in cages {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>point(s).</b> The study design was identical to that carried out at Ekofisk in 2006 and 2008 with only minor modifications where necessary. The implementation of a produced water treatment system (C-Tour), operational in 2008, aimed to reduce the output of potentially toxic chemicals into the surrounding water column. The monitoring surveys performed pre and post implementation of C-Tour, were designed to assess whether changes in animal health status between the different years have occurred. The results of the 2009 survey have shown that caged organisms were exposed to low levels of produced water components with highest tissue concentrations in mussels Mytilus edulis, located closest to the produced <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> Mussels located approximately 1 - 2 km away showed only background concentrations of the organic compounds measured. Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and alkyl phenol (AP) -metabolites in bile of caged cod Gadus morhua, were slightly elevated suggesting exposure at the Ekofisk stations. There was a signal of exposure with proximity to the discharge for some of the biomarkers measured including CYP 1 A in fish and micronuclei in mussels. However, all other fish and mussel biomarkers showed no significant exposure effects. The bioaccumulation data and biomarker responses indicated a lower exposure to the produced water effluent than seen previously in 2008 and 2006. The volume of produced <b>water</b> <b>discharged</b> to the investigated area increased in 2009 from 2008 and 2006. However, the amount of oil discharged with the produced water was less, resulting in an overall reduction of oil to the local area. This reduction in oil discharge was reflected in the bioaccumulation and biomarker data, resulting in a general improvement in the health of caged mussels and fish in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2006.

40|$|Natural {{remediation}} is {{a general}} term that includes any technology or strategy that takes advantage of natural processes to remediate a contaminated media to a condition that is protective of {{human health and the}} environment. Natural remediation techniques are often passive and minimally disruptive to the environment. They are generally implemented in conjunction with traditional remedial solutions for source control (i. e., capping, stabilization, removal, soil vapor extraction, etc.). Natural remediation techniques being employed at Savannah River Site (SRS) include enhanced bio-remediation, monitored natural attenuation, and phytoremediation. Enhanced bio-remediation involves making nutrients available and conditions favorable for microbial growth. With proper precautions and feeding, the naturally existing microbes flourish and consume the contaminants. Case studies of enhanced bio-remediation include surface soils contaminated with PCBs and pesticides, and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) contamination in both the vadose zone and groundwater. Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has been selected as the preferred alternative for groundwater clean up at several SRS waste units. Successful implementation of MNA has been based on demonstration that sources have been controlled, groundwater modeling that indicates that plumes will not expand or reach surface <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>points</b> at levels that exceed regulatory limits, and continued monitoring. Phytoremediation is being successfully utilized at several SRS waste units. Phytoremediation involves using plants and vegetation to uptake, break down, or manage contaminants in groundwater or soils.

Significant decreases in tritium discharge to a site stream have been realized in one phytoremediation project.

Ideal scenarios to reduce target pollutants were determined based on their seasonal characteristics and correlations between the concentrations at a <b>water</b> intake and <b>discharge</b> <b>point,</b> where we suggested an increase of environmental flow and wetland as pollutants reduction drawing for BOD 5 and FIB, respectively. The scenarios were separately examined by the Qual 2 E model and hypothetically (but planned) constructed wetland, respectively. The results revealed that while controlling of the water quality at the intake point guaranteed the lower pollution level of BOD 5 in the GJ Stream, a wetland constructed at the <b>discharge</b> <b>point</b> may be a promising strategy to mitigate mass loads of FIB. Overall, {{this study suggests that}} {{a combination of the two}} can be plausible scenarios not only to support sustainable urban water resources management, but to enhance a quality of urban stream restoration assignment. ope...|$|R
5000|$|The public side {{is known}} as the [...] "cold" [...] side because it {{provides}} water to cool the generators at the power plant; the private or [...] "hot" [...] side receives warm <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> from the power plant. The private side can be substantially warmer than the public side, especially near the <b>discharge</b> <b>point,</b> where it can be too hot for swimming. The private side has an extended water sports season. Some water circulates back out of the private side into the public side through underground channels; consequently, the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish migrate to these warmer waters.|$|R

To determine the characteristics of abrupt changes and multi-scale periods of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load, data from Lijin station were analyzed, and the resonance periods were then calculated. The Mann-Kendall test, order clustering, power-spectrum, and wavelet analysis were used to observe <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load into the sea over the last 62 years. The most significant abrupt change in <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> into the sea occurred in 1985, and an abrupt change in sediment load happened in the same year. Significant decreases of 64. 6 % and 73. 8 % were observed in <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load, respectively, before 1985. More significant abrupt changes in <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load were observed in 1968 and 1996. The characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load into the Bohai Sea show periodic oscillation at inter-annual and decadal scales. The main periods of <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> are 9. 14 years and 3. 05 years, whereas the main periods of sediment load are 10. 67 years, 4. 27 years, and 2. 78 years. The significant resonance periods between <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load are observed at the following temporal scales: 2. 86 years, 4. 44 years, and 13. 33 years. <b>Water</b> <b>discharge</b> and sediment load started to decrease after 1970 and has decreased significantly since 1985 for several reasons. Firstly, the precipitation of the Yellow River drainage area has educed since 1970. Secondly, large-scale human activities, such as the building of reservoirs and floodgates, have increased. Thirdly, water and soil conservation have taken effect since 1985...|$|R

The fire control effect of the <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> equipment was investigated using a CFD field model. The computational results were compared with a full-scale compartment fire experiment in which the <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> equipment was installed. When the <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> equipment was not used, the computational results of the temperature distribution in the compartment were in agreement with the experimental results. When the <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> equipment was used, the numerical simulation could not predict the experimental value with sufficient accuracy. One of the causes for decrease in prediction accuracy is the condensation heat transfer mechanism generated on the wet wall. In this study, the prediction accuracy of the numerical simulation could improve by taking into consideration the condensation heat transfer...|$|R

Enzyme activity was measured fluorometrically and CYP 1 gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A mean EROD baseline was established at 0. 03 nmol/min/µg of protein. The overall mean field effluent (TF) EROD had a significant 5 -fold increase over field upstream (UF) exposed catfish; and overall mean laboratory effluent (TL) exposed catfish EROD had a significant 1. 8 -fold increase over laboratory upstream (UL) exposed catfish. Field exposures generally showed more robust enzyme induction over laboratory exposures on all sampling days. Ex- pression of the CYP 1 B gene following TF exposure was 6 -fold over UF. Results suggested that in situ exposure to wastewater pollutants using caged test organisms provided a much more sensitive local monitor of pollutant exposure and biological impact than ex situ toxicological studies...|$|R

Results are also presented on the Jamuna River accretion and <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> Landsat images from 1977 to 2014 and <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> data were analysed to find out a relationship between dynamics of erosion and accretion for different time intervals with average annual <b>water</b> <b>discharge.</b> It is clearly established that total amount of erosion and accretion rates varies with different times. The highest erosion rate 21. 15 km 2 year - 1 was observed in the period of 1989 - 1992 and the highest accretion rate 13. 57 km 2 year - 1 was observed in the period of 1980 - 1989. The erosion and accretion values fluctuated with increasing average annual maximum <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> but the difference between erosion and accretion had remained low before <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> reached to 67000 m 3 s - 1 and it is estimated higher after crossing annual average maximum <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> of 67000 m 3 s - 1. This discharge value also plays an important role on bar development and active channel. It is also observed that unvegetated bar areas remained higher than active channel areas before average annual maximum <b>water</b> <b>discharge</b> reached to 67000 m 3 s - 1. Finally, all the erosional hazards and accretion values are compared and evaluated to see their influence on the annual discharge...|$|R
