5|$|Impossible {{to ignore}} was Day's {{disparity}} to his rival, Paige. Historians {{have noted that}} Paige had a boisterous approach compared to Day's reserved demeanor; Paige <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and Day was short and slender; and Paige worked hard to promote his name while Day shied away from attention. The pitchers' infrequent head-to-head matchups led to remarkable pitching duels, three of which Day won.|$|E
5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann. The new unit could be fitted with five or six gears and <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and narrow, allowing a clearer airflow from under {{the car to the}} rear, with the intent of improving the ground effect. An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E
5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E
50|$|Transitivity—The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} logical relationships among elements in a serial order, and perform 'transitive inferences' (for example, If A <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than B, and B <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than C, then A must <b>be</b> <b>taller</b> than C).|$|R

5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, which had to be thick and longer than she <b>was</b> <b>tall.</b> The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} fought at the {{location}} of the modern city of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe which is next to the Paraná River, at the point of its widest flow. The west bank of the river <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and steep, forming a natural obstacle, and ships could only land troops and materials {{on that side of the}} river using man-made paths cut into the side. The battlefield was near one of these paths, shaped like a ladder, after which the terrain was a big plain with scattered bushes. The San Carlos Convent, the main nearby building, was a short distance away from the river.|$|E

40|$|Subjects {{learned and}} {{answered}} questions about four-or six-term linear orderings (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Dick, who <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam, mho <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Pete). Such an ordering {{is comprised of}} some adjacent pairwise relations {{that are necessary to}} the establishment of the ordering (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Dick, Dick <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam), and some remote relations that are deducible (e. g., Tom <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Sam). Except for unusually fast responses to test sentences beginning with an end term, reaction time was a monotonic decreasing function of remoteness; the more remote the shorter the reaction time. This result contradicts several current models of how meaningful information is stored. First, it contranicts any model which argues that subjects do not store deducible information. Information pertaining to the deducible remote pairs is stored along with the information that was actually presented. Second, it contradicts any model which describes the form of the stored information in terms of inter-item associations. A model which can account for the result is presented. (Author...|$|R

25|$|The {{family owned}} and resided in a villa suburbana on the Caelian Hill, {{fronting}} the same street (now the Via di San Gregorio) {{as the former}} palaces of the Roman emperors on the Palatine Hill opposite. The north of the street runs into the Colosseum; the south, the Circus Maximus. In Gregory's day the ancient buildings were in ruins and were privately owned. Villas covered the area. Gregory's family also owned working estates in Sicily and around Rome. Gregory later had portraits done in fresco in their former home on the Caelian and these were described 300 years later by John the Deacon. Gordianus <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> with a long face and light eyes. He wore a beard. Silvia <b>was</b> <b>tall,</b> had a round face, blue eyes and a cheerful look.

40|$|What <b>is</b> <b>tall?</b> Like many words, <b>tall</b> <b>is</b> {{fundamentally}} compositional {{in meaning}} — whether an item <b>is</b> <b>tall</b> {{depends on the}} statistical properties of the set of items it is being compared to. Despite preliminary evidence to this effect, no mathematical models of how tall operates in a given context have ever been empirically evaluated. We compare a number of statistical models to adults and children in judging which items <b>are</b> <b>tall</b> in various contexts, including both threshold-based and categorization-based models. We find that non-parametric statistical models of gradable adjectives best describes the judgments of people across {{a wide variety of}} contexts...|$|R

La Salette is many hundreds of kilometres from Lourdes, and the events at La Salette predate those in Lourdes by 12 years. However, Virgin Mary's appearance of La Salette <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> and maternal (not petite and gentle like her Lourdes apparition) and had a darker, more threatening series of messages.

40|$|Implicit {{transitive}} inference {{in humans}} When told that John <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Bill, who <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Fred, one would logically infer that John <b>is</b> <b>taller</b> than Fred.

It is obvious from the above example that people have the capacity to explicitly encode these statements (“premises”), make the logical inference, and declare the basis of their conclusion.

They had studios in the same building, and {{although}} 21-year-old Anna was recently married, they began an affair. Anna <b>was</b> <b>tall</b> (as Modigliani was only 5 foot 5inches) with dark hair (like Modigliani's), pale skin and grey-green eyes, she embodied Modigliani's aesthetic ideal and the pair became engrossed in each other.
