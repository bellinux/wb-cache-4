The girls first attend a Catholic school in New York and later boarding school, and assimilate fairly well to their new environments, although meeting with a few set-backs along the way. Their time in the US begins with the opening chapter, [...] "A Regular Revolution", and delivers the girls' (collective) opinion that [...] "We didn't feel we had the best the United States had to offer. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> second-hand stuff, rental houses in one redneck Catholic neighborhood after another". While during their first few months in New York they regularly pray to God that they will soon be able to return to their homeland, they quickly start appreciating the advantages of living in a [...] "free country" [...] so that even being sent back to the Dominican Republic for the summer becomes a form of punishment for them.|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of El Alamein, lasting from July to November 1942, was {{the turning}} point of the war for the Italian and British Army. As Churchill wrote in his Memories: [...] "...before El Alamein <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> defeats, after El Alamein <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> victories...". [...] The Italian Royal Army fought this battle {{in a way that}} can be {{summarized}} by the sacrifice of the Division Folgore: the historian Renzo De Felice wrote that [...] "...of the 5.000 [...] "Folgore" [...] paratroopers sent to Africa 4 months before, the survived were only 32 officers and 262 soldiers, most of them wounded. Before the surrender, they shot until the last ammo and the last hand-grenade...".|$|E

2500|$|In June 2009, Russian General Vyacheslav Borisov told Echo of Moscow in an interview: [...] "You know, we even {{regularly}} hold {{exercises in}} those areas. And our troops had full practice by holding exercises {{one week before}} {{right there in the}} same place. And <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> concluded and went. Therefore, marching toward Tskhinvali, we performed much better than those units under central command and the units of the district that were dusted off, did you know?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{published}} an obituary on Theodore Lukens on July 5, 1918, which stated in part, [...] "There is a new, growing forest of neglected pine {{trees on the}} slopes of the Sierras [...] above Pasadena that stand as a living proof that Lukens could have reforested our mountains if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> given him the help he asked. [...] He would have restored to us the lost beauty of the hills and he would have, at the same time, saved us from a disaster which may one day overtake us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hugh Pope {{enumerated}} {{the accounts}} {{of each of these}} three persons (the unnamed [...] "sinner", Mary Magdalene, and Mary of Bethany) in the Gospel of Luke and concluded that, based on these accounts, “there is no suggestion of an identification of the three persons, and if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> Luke to guide us we should certainly have no grounds for so identifying them [...]” [...] He then explains first the position, at that time general among Catholics, equating Mary of Bethany with the sinful woman of Luke by referring to , where Mary is identified as the woman who anointed Jesus, and noting that this reference is given before John's account of the anointing in Bethany: ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 14, {{advancing}} Union skirmishers found that the entrenchments were empty. Cavalry under Buford and Kilpatrick attacked the rearguard of Lee's army, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, which was still on a ridge about [...] from Falling Waters. The initial attack caught the Confederates by surprise after a long night with little sleep, and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Kilpatrick attacked again and Buford struck them in their right and rear. Heth's and Pender's divisions lost numerous prisoners. Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, who had survived Pickett's Charge with a minor hand wound, was mortally wounded at Falling Waters. This minor success against Heth did not {{make up for the}} extreme frustration in the Lincoln administration about allowing Lee to escape. The president was quoted as saying, [...] "We had them within our grasp. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> to stretch forth our hands and they were ours.

2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Teen Kings went to Sun Studio in Memphis, where Phillips {{wanted to}} record [...] "Ooby Dooby" [...] again, in his {{superior}} studio. Orbison had grown {{weary of the}} song and rankled quietly as Phillips dictated what the band would play {{and how he was}} to sing it. With Phillips's production, however, the record broke into the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies. The Teen Kings toured with Sonny James, Johnny Horton, Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing [...] "everything we could to get applause because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> one hit record". The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including [...] "Go! Go! Go!" [...] and [...] "Rockhouse". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there. They stayed in Phillips's home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice. A ballad Orbison wrote—"The Clown"—met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer Jack Clement told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{run up to}} the 15th {{anniversary of}} Within Temptation, the band was asked by Belgian radio station Q-Music to choose and perform an {{existing}} track in a [...] "Within Temptation style" [...] once a week during fifteen weeks during their special program Within Temptation Friday. The covers consist most part of pop songs in which the band transformed into a more symphonic oriented form. Lead vocalist Sharon den Adel stated that:“Our approach was to really make the cover a new Within Temptation song. So not going the easy way by using only a piano or an acoustic guitar for example, but really trying to put {{all the elements of}} a Within Temptation track in this new version. It was quite a challenge because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>only</b> one week to get it right, while recording an original Within Temptation song can sometimes takes up half a year! But this pressure also gave us an creative boost and it was very rewarding to get it done in time each week. Also, we learned a lot from the in-depth analysis we needed to make on these hits, written by others, in combination with implementing our own sound and style in each new cover. We are glad that we’ve taken up this challenge and are very proud of the result." [...] They covered artists such as Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, Lana del Rey, The Who among others. On [...] April 19, 2013, 11 of the 15 covers made by the band were them released in a cover album entitled The Q-Music Sessions. On the same day, the band released the official music video of their cover of Titanium.|$|E
