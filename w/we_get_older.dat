So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way we are as <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E

And I think that my father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E

We no longer approximate in our behavior to the mere impulsiveness of the lower animals, but conduct ourselves in every respect like members of a highly civilized society. Maggie and Tom were still very much like young animals, and so she could rub her cheek against his, and kiss his ear in a random sobbing way; and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been used to answer to Maggie's fondling, so that he behaved with a weakness quite inconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved.

50|$|Issues of {{emotional}} regulations affect us especially in our later life. When people get older their motivation increases {{to take out}} the emotional meaning in life, instead of expanding their emotional boundaries. Things such as social losses and health changes increase as <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older.</b> However, people tend to increase their emotional regulation skills as they age, which can lead to certain other emotional problems. As we age, our autonomic nervous system decreases, yet emotional experiences do not change. Adults have several motivations for regulating emotions—including hedonic motivation (pain/pleasure), conforming to social roles, facilitating task or role performance, managing self-presentation, and regulating the feelings of others.|$|E

40|$|Why do <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>old?</b> ” and “How {{long will}} we live? ” are {{questions}} that have been posed and answered in a myriad of ways since ancient times. Despite this legacy of attention, {{there has been little}} agreement as to what are the most meaningful answers to these questions. In the scientific realm, this lack of resolution has spurred on many to work ever harder, and in {{the last decade or so}} there has been a veritable explosion of new claims and studies about aging and life span. These dwarf past efforts, so much so as almost to obscure them. What sense is one to make of this explosion of new information? In this chapter, I provide an overview of recent claims about aging and life span so as to order the conceptual landscape and to provide a context for understanding what we have and have not learned. My primary aim is to encourage new directions for research. Aging was recently defined by Kirkwood and Austad (2000 : 233) as “the progressive loss of function accompanied by decreasing fertility an...|$|R

What she means is that much of what we experience as <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> is not the ineluctable consequence of biological ageing [...] [...] [...] but is socially and culturally contingent. American society, she contends, has become a rich terrain on which the social and cultural exclusion of people as they age can take place and where the ideology of ageing can flourish" [...] (Tulle 2006: 127). Age studies tries to understand age and aging as complex, intersectional social and psychological constructions, and also as a set of mediated relationships among people located at different phases of the life course.|$|E

Directed by Jonathan Demme, it was shot {{over the course}} of three nights at Hollywood's Pantages Theater in December 1983, as the group was touring to promote their new album Speaking in Tongues. The movie is notable for being the first made entirely using digital audio techniques. The band raised the budget of $1.2 million themselves. The title comes from the lyrics of the song [...] "Girlfriend Is Better": [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> and stop making sense...".

5000|$|Reed's {{most famous}} poetry is in Lessons of the War, a {{collection}} of three poems which are witty parodies of British army basic training during World War II, which suffered {{from a lack of}} equipment at that time. Originally published in New Statesman and Nation (August 1942), the series was later published in A Map of Verona in 1946, and was his only collection to be published within his lifetime. Three further poems have subsequently been added to the collection. Another anthologised poem is [...] "Chard Whitlow: Mr. Eliot's Sunday evening postscript", a satire of T. S. Eliot's Burnt Norton. Eliot himself was amused by [...] "Chard Whitlow"'s mournful imitations of his poetic style ("As <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>older</b> we do not get any younger ...").|$|E
