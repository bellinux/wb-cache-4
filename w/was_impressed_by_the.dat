5|$|As {{a student}} holidaying in coastal towns, Hesketh had {{become aware of}} the lack of resorts in Lancashire. He was {{concerned}} that the working classes of Lancashire could not afford to travel south for their holidays as wealthy people like him could.

As High Sheriff of Lancashire, he attended the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway on 15 December 1830. The event filled him with great excitement at the idea of bringing the railway to the coast and enabling Lancashire mill workers to take day-trips to the seaside.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} Ivy League pitcher focus, Krichell also {{unearthed}} several position players. He signed Charlie Keller, a highly touted prospect {{playing for the}} University of Maryland. To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, who had tried out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and <b>was</b> <b>impressed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players.

Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E
