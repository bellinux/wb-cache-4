To provide the necessary data base, the parametric study included variation in the pylon pitch and yaw stiffnesses, flapping hinge offset, and blade kinematic pitch-flap coupling over a large range of advance ratios.

Tiltrotors are {{susceptible}} to <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter,</b> an aeroelastic instability characterized by a coupling of rotor-generated aerodynamic forces and elastic wing modes in high speed airplane-mode flight.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> {{stability}} of the NASA experimental electric propulsion aircraft designated the X- 57 Maxwell. <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> stability is studied at two flight conditions: sea level at 2700 RPM to represent take-off and landing and 8000 feet at 2250 RPM to represent cruise. Two multibody dynamics analyses are used: CAMRAD II and Dymore. The CAMRAD II model is a semi-span X- 57 model with a modal representation for the wing/pylon system. The Dymore model is a semi-span wing with a propeller composed of beam elements for the wing/pylon system that airloads can be applied to.

For <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter,</b> three design revisions of the wing and pylon mount system are studied. The predicted frequencies and damping ratio of the wing modes show good agreements between the two analyses.

40|$|Summary. Results of {{propeller}} whirl analyses in four {{degrees of}} freedom are presented for a typical turbo-prop aircraft power-plant installation consisting of a rigid engine supported with elastically restrained freedoms in pitch and yaw {{at the end of}} a flexible nacelle cantilevered from a rigid support structure. Calculations were made for a range of structural and aerodynamic parameters. Only one of the four modes was found to become unstable within the airspeed range covered, the critical whirl airspeed being very sensitive to engine-mount damping and to the nacelle and engine-mount stiffnesses. The interaction between power-plant <b>whirl</b> and wing <b>flutter</b> was investigated by extending the calculations to include twelve {{degrees of freedom}}, four normal modes of vibration of the half wing plus four modes for each of two power-plant installations on the half wing. The results suggest that the stability of the power-plant whirl modes is not adversely affected by motion of the wing, but that in certain circumstances the critical airspeed for wing flutter may be reduced slightly by a coupling with an unstable power-plant whirl mode of comparable frequency. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> is {{a dynamic}} {{instability}} known mostly from tilt-rotors and prop-airplanes. For a tilt-rotor or prop- airplane, from one side the gyroscopic effect of the rotating rotor/propeller causes the coupling of the elastic modes of the propeller-nacelle system and produces the so-called whirl modes and {{from the other side}} the unsteady aerodynamic forces/moments generated due to the whirl modes change the damping of the system. With the reduction of the damping, the whole system can reach a zero or negative damping resulting in an oscillation of the system with constant or increasing amplitude, respectively. Classical analysis of <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> is limited to a system with reduced degrees of freedom. However, going beyond this classical approach allows considering more physical effects. In this work a multidisciplinary simulation of the <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> phenomenon is introduced. Different simulation codes are used to create the model and to simulate the physical effects. A FEM code is used to model the elasticity of the wing and nacelle. A propeller comprehensive code is utilized to consider the propeller induced velocity field for the calculation of the propeller aerodynamics. The full model is then implemented within a multibody simulation tool, which allows performing the dynamic stability analysis. The method introduced in this paper can be used for the <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> investigation of any configuration. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{tiltrotor}} {{offers the}} best mix of hovering and cruise flight {{of any of the}} current V/STOL configurations. One possible improvement on the tiltrotors of today designs would be using a soft-inplane hingeless hub. The advantages to a soft-inplane hingeless hub range from reduced weight and maintenance to reduced vibration and loads. However, soft-inplane rotor systems are inherently in danger of the aeromechanical instabilities of ground and air resonance. Furthermore tiltrotors can be subject to <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter.</b> At least {{in part because of the}} potential for air and ground resonance in a soft-inplane rotor, the Bell XV- 15, the Bell-Boeing V- 22 Osprey, and the new Bell Augusta 609 have stiff-inplane, gimballed rotors which do not experience these instabilities. In order to design soft-inplane V/STOL aircraft that do not experience ground or air resonance, it is important to be able to predict these instabilities accurately. Much of the research studying the stability of tiltrotors has been focused on the understanding and prediction of <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter.</b> As this instability is increasingly well understood, air and ground resonance for a tiltrotor need to be investigated. Once we understand the problems of air and ground resonance in a tiltrotor, we must look for solutions to these instabilities.

The interaction of rigid-body and deformable degrees of freedom alters the aeroelastic behavior of the system compared with that of the clamped wing rotor, discussed in a previous work. The flutter mechanism, originally consisting in <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter,</b> changes after considering rigid-body degrees of freedom; the short-period flight mechanics mode now dominates high-speed stability. This issue is mainly addressed by the stability augmentation system, whereas the generalized predictive control is mainly used to reduce gustinduced wing loads, although its intervention for whirl-flutter suppression is still needed to extend the flight envelope at very high speed. The capability of the adaptive regulator to reduce wing loads is assessed in hover and in highspeed forward flight.

Based on a 1 / 5 scale semi-span aeroelastic wind tunnel model of a generic tiltrotor concept, a numerical simulation is set up using a general purpose multibody simulation tool. The model possesses a gimballed stiff-in-plane rotor with a constant velocity drive system. Three different control algorithms are presented and evaluated.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} parametric variation in individual rotor/wing design variables on <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> stability improvements of a soft in-plane tiltrotor. This {{is followed by the}} use of formal gradient-based design optimization. The simulations are based on a full-scale soft in-plane Boeing model 222 rotor on a semispan wing. For this baseline configuration, the flatwise flexibility and chordwise flexibility are both outboard of the pitch bearing and produce destabilizing pitch-flap and pitch-lag couplings. The most influential rotor parameter in improving flutter stability characteristics is the distribution of flatwise flexibility vis-à-vis the pitch bearing, and large improvements are observed when flatwise flexibility is moved inboard. However, this can result in a large increase in lag frequency and turn the design into a stiff in-plane configuration. Using frequency constraints during optimization of rotor parameters and carefully selecting the airspeed range over which optimization is conducted results in improvement in subcritical wing mode damping and increase in critical flutter speed. Other rotor parameters changes that have some benefit are reduction in overall chordwise stiffness, positive increase in pitch-flap and pitch-lag coupling, and increase in control system stiffness. Wing design parameters are unable to increase the critical flutter speed but can improve the subcritical damping, primarily through an increase in wing torsion frequency and a simultaneous reduction in wing beam mode frequency. Optimization using a combination of rotor/wing design parameters yields a 35 kt increase in <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> speed (from 390 to 425 kt) and an increase in subcritical damping from less than 1 % t...|$|E

With focus on the structural design, the wing's aerodynamic shape and the rotor-pylon system are held fixed. The initial design requirement on drag reduction set the airfoil maximum thickness-to-chord ratio to 18 percent. The airfoil section is the scaled down version of the 23 percent-thick airfoil used in V- 22 's wing. With the project goal in mind, the research activities began with an investigation of the structural dynamic and aeroelastic characteristics of the tiltrotor configuration, and the identification of proper procedures to analyze and account for these characteristics in the wing design. This investigation led to a collection of more than thirty technical papers on the subject, some of which have been referenced here. The review of literature on the tiltrotor revealed the complexity of the system in terms of wing-rotor-pylon interactions. The aeroelastic instability or <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> stemming from wing-rotor-pylon interactions is found to be the most critical mode of instability demanding careful consideration in the preliminary wing design.

Small rearward offsets of the aerodynamic-center locus with respect to the blade elastic axis created large increases in the stability boundary. The effect was strongest for offsets at the outboard part of the blade, where an offset of the aerodynamic center by 10 % of tip chord improved the stability margin by over 100 knots. Forward offsets of the blade center of gravity had similar but less pronounced effects. Equivalent results were seen for swept-tip blades. Appropriate combinations of sweep and pitch stiffness completely eliminated <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> within the speed range examined; alternatively, they allowed large increases in pitch-flap coupling (delta-three) for a given stability margin.

A baseline analytical model {{similar to the}} XV- 15 was established, and then a thinner, composite wing {{was designed to be}} representative of a high-speed tiltrotor. While the thinner wing has lower drag, it also has lower stiffness, reducing whirl-flutter stability. The rotor blade design was modified to increase the stability speed margin for the thin-wing design. Modest amounts of blade sweep starting at 80 % radius created large increases in the stability boundary. Increased control-system pitch stiff-ness also improved stability.

40|$|The {{research}} project “Bürgernahes Flugzeug” {{deals with the}} configuration of a future airplane with the properties of short take-off and landing and with reduced noise from the acoustic aspect. These properties should permit flight from a smaller airport closer to a city. In this project, under {{the cooperation of the}} main research partners: University of Braunschweig, German Aerospace Center (DLR) and University of Hannover, a wind tunnel model for the mainly aerodynamic and acoustic investigations was designed. In 2012, this model will be utilized in low speed German-Dutch wind tunnel (DNW-NWB) in Braunschweig for different research activities and measurements. Occurrence of any kind of dynamic instability during the wind tunnel test will cause lots of cost and loss of time. Even it is possible to have the situation that the model is stable and no dynamic instability occurs but the oscillation of the model is not desirable. An undesirable oscillation of the model would have cross effects on the aerodynamics and acoustics of the model and therefore would have effect on measurements. To prevent all the well known dynamic problems during the wind tunnel test, performing dynamic stability analysis in both design stage and after the construction the model is an inevitable task. This paper gives a review of aeroelastic analysis of the designed wind tunnel model under the predefined wind tunnel test conditions. Wing flutter is one of the dynamic instability phenomena that should be prevented from occurring. In general, movement/oscillation of a wing due to its elasticity induces aerodynamic forces/moments. Depending on the structure of the wing, these originated forces and moments could make the wing to oscillate with increasing amplitude (Flutter). For a propeller-wing system with rotating propeller, gyroscopic effect of the propeller could change the dynamic behavior of the whole system (comparing to a model with non rotating propeller). This effect should be also considered for the flutter analysis. Another dynamic instability, which can happen for this model is “whirl flutter”. <b>Whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> is a self induced dynamic instability, which originates from the propeller. In general, gyroscopic and aerodynamic coupling effects of the propeller create a so called whirl mode on the propeller. Again, depending on the structure of the model, wind and rotor rotation velocity an unstable whirl movement of the propeller head (hub) can occur. In this work, the occurrence of two aforementioned dynamic instabilities of the wind tunnel model with the usage of different simulation tools was investigated. Analysis performed includes: (a) - wing flutter analysis with the consideration of the propeller gyroscopic effect and its motion induced forces/moments (b) - propeller-nacelle-wing <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> analysis with the consideration of the wing elasticity and aerodynamics. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> is a {{specific}} type of flutter instability, relevant for turboprop aircraft, caused by the effect of rotating parts as a propeller or a gas-turbine engine rotor. The proposed optimisation-based analytical procedure is used to determine the critical values of the engine attachment stiffness parameters for the preselected flutter speed. For the half-span model, two design variables are used. The objective function is defined as the minimization of the engine vibration mode frequency sum. Design constraints keep the engine frequency ratio and the flutter stability at the selected velocity. However, application of a full-span model is necessary in some cases. In this case, special models of both symmetric and antisymmetric engine vibrations and four design variables must be used. Design constraints maintain the pitch mode frequency ratio, the yaw mode frequency ratio and the critical mode frequency ratio. Critical modes are dependent on the relation between the rotational direction of both propellers (identical or inverse). A flutter design constraint is applied as well. The described methodology is demonstrated on the application example of a twin-engine commuter aircraft. Demonstrated cases include symmetrical revolutions of propellers for both identical and inverse directions of rotation, cases of single engine failure and single propeller feathering, and finally, cases of unsymmetrical revolutions including the reduced and increased revolutions of a single propeller, for both identical and inverse directions of rotation...|$|E
40|$|The Wing and Rotor Aeroelastic Test System (WRATS) data {{acquisition}} system (DAS) is a 64 -channel {{data acquisition}} display and analysis system specifically designed for use with the WRATS 1 / 5 -scale V- 22 tiltrotor model of the Bell Osprey. It is the primary {{data acquisition system}} for experimental aeroelastic testing of the WRATS model {{for the purpose of}} characterizing the aeromechanical and aeroelastic stability of prototype tiltrotor configurations. The WRATS DAS was also used during aeroelastic testing of Bell Helicopter Textron s Quad-Tiltrotor (QTR) design concept, a test which received international attention. The LabVIEW-based design is portable and capable of powering and conditioning over 64 channels of dynamic data at sampling rates up to 1, 000 Hz. The system includes a 60 -second circular data archive, an integrated model swashplate excitation system, a moving block damping application for calculation of <b>whirl</b> <b>flutter</b> mode subcritical damping, a loads and safety monitor, a pilot-control console display, data analysis capabilities, and instrumentation calibration functions. Three networked computers running custom-designed LabVIEW software acquire data through National Instruments data acquisition hardware. The aeroelastic model (see figure) was tested with the DAS at two facilities at NASA Langley, the Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) and the Rotorcraft Hover Test Facility (RHTF). Because of the need for seamless transition between testing at these facilities, DAS is portable. The software is capable of harmonic analysis of periodic time history data, Fast Fourier Transform calculations, power spectral density calculations, and on-line calibration of test instrumentation. DAS has a circular buffer archive to ensure critical data is not lost in event of model failure/incident, as well as a sample-and-hold capability for phase-correct time history data...|$|E
