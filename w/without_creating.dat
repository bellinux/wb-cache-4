5|$|This {{proposed}} recognition {{meant more}} to Floyd even than trade advantages and justice; {{it was another}} step in the disenthrallment of America. It would afford relief from that political plexus which had {{made it impossible for}} one European nation to move, even in matters relating to America, <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> a corresponding movement in each of the others. He was tired of negotiating the things which related exclusively to America in London, Paris, and Madrid.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|The passenger-only ferry service, {{approved}} by voters in 2016, {{was preceded by}} one operated by Washington State Ferries between 1986 and 2003. This state-run system ceased operations after a class-action lawsuit forced its vessels to slow down when traveling through Rich Passage to reduce wake damage. Kitsap Transit briefly operated its own passenger ferries from 2004 to 2007, but failed to receive voter approval for two sales tax funding measures. The agency commissioned a low-wake vessel, Rich Passage 1, which was used from 2011 to 2012 for research and trial runs that determined it could operate at high speeds <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> a damaging wake.|$|E

5|$|Those who remained, {{such as the}} lame, {{the blind}} and the aged, {{employed}} themselves in cultivating the land and doing other manual work. Many were made to carry baskets filled with gobra (cowdung) for three days as a public warning to others. The stubborn Christians were given the most menial tasks, and made {{to work in the}} paddy fields. They were underfed, and immediately imprisoned for fighting. Completely isolated from any women, the idea was for the captive men to die of old age <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> any progeny.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the {{original}} release, a patch was available for the PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, which contained over 200 quest and scripting-related fixes. The update released on December 14, 2010, has fixed further glitches and save game problems, including companion-related bugs. Subsequent updates were released in February and April that corrected numerous bugs and gameplay issues. A patch was released on July 5, 2011, that included a provision that automatically creates a save prior to the endgame sequence. After credits, the user is prompted to load this save game, allowing single save players to play DLC <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> a new game.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{miniature}} {{is an art}} form, {{which can}} be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes. The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was {{different from that of the}} nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to organotin toxins, there has been renewed interest in copper as the active agent in ablative or self polishing paints, with reported service lives up to 5 years.

25|$|Further, the use {{of cloning}} to produce organs with a {{genotype}} identical to the recipient is a controversial topic, especially considering the possibility for an entire person to be brought into being {{for the express purpose}} of being destroyed for organ procurement.

However, it may be possible in the future to use cloned stem-cells to grow a new organ <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> a new human being.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} use of more freely available credit changed the American economy, but not <b>without</b> <b>creating</b> some backlash. Consumer advocates complained that some issuers were using late fees of $5 or $10, charged if a single month's payment was even one day overdue, to gouge extra profits from customers who might otherwise be borrowing and spending responsibly. Laws in some states limited those fees, yet companies and banks continued to charge above those limits, claiming the late fees were a form of interest and thus {{not subject to the}} laws of those states {{as long as they were}} headquartered elsewhere.|$|E
