Here is a warrant for a high crime against a poor creature, who is little fit to be removed from one house to another, much more dragged to a prison.

From you, dear Marguerite, I conceal nothing. I made no appointment with you to-night {{because it was}} my intention to speak with that person, and I could not tell where he would be. All has happened fortunately. We spend our evening together, after all. See <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help me. Go and talk to your friend, Mademoiselle Soupelles.

When one hates romance heroines as heartily as I do, one dreads those 'virtues' of {{the ferocious}} type [LES VERTUS FAROUCHES, so terribly {{aware that they}} are virtuous]; and I had rather marry the greatest--[unnamable]--in Berlin, than a devotee with half a dozen ghastly hypocrites (CAGOTS) at her beck. If it were still MOGLICH [possible, in German] to make her Calvinist [REFORMEE; our Court-Creed, which might have an allaying tendency, and at least would make her go with the stream]?

My wife's maid knocked at her door early in the morning, with the customary cup of tea. Getting no answer, she went round to the dressing-room--found the door on that side unlocked--and discovered Agnes {{on the bed in}} a fainting fit. With my wife's help, they brought her to herself again; and she told the extraordinary story which I have just repeated to you. You must have seen for yourself that she has been over-fatigued, poor thing, by our long railway journeys: her nerves are out of order--and she is just the person to be easily terrified by a dream. She obstinately refuses, however, to accept this rational view. Don't suppose that I have been severe with her! All that a man can do to humour her I have done. I have written to the Countess (in her assumed name) offering to restore the room to her. She writes back, positively declining to return to it. I have accordingly arranged (so as not to have the thing known in the hotel) to occupy the room for one or two nights, and to leave Agnes to recover her spirits under my wife's care. Is there anything more that I can do? Whatever questions Agnes has asked of me I have answered {{to the best of my}} ability; she knows all that you told me about Francis and the Countess last night. But try as I may I can't quiet her mind. I have given up the attempt in despair, and left her in the drawing-room. Go, like a good fellow, and try <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> compose her.' ...|$|E
