5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales for the type. British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Property Trust {{hoped to}} get the One Pennsylvania Plaza site {{designated}} a Keystone Opportunity Improvement Zone (KOZ). KOZ designation was intended to encourage development in poor, blighted areas by exempting the tenants of the building from all state and local taxes. Designating One Pennsylvania Plaza a KOZ was supported by then Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who said {{it was important to}} keep corporations within the city. At the time, many of Philadelphia's big employers' leases, including Comcast's, were due to expire, and the employers were considering the possibility of moving out of the city and state. Rendell also said allowing Comcast to enlarge its headquarters by moving into One Pennsylvania Plaza could attract other corporate headquarters to the city. However, other Center City building owners, including Comcast's landlord at Centre Square, HRPT Properties Trust, were opposed to the plan. They said giving the tower the KOZ designation <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> an unfair advantage because Liberty Property Trust could charge above-market rents since the tax breaks would offset the cost for tenants. The group believed tenants attracted to One Pennsylvania Plaza because of the tax breaks would cause more vacancies in other Center City skyscrapers, rather than attracting more business to blighted areas as intended under the law. In early 2004, Center City had a vacancy rate of 12.8%.|$|E

5|$|On 10 October, the High Court {{ruled that}} the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory two {{senators}} each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July but the territorial senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once. The ruling meant {{that it was possible}} for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33–31 margin, would be able to pass supply if that was still an issue, and also could pass electoral redistribution laws (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> an advantage at the next election.|$|E

25|$|Monoceros {{contains}} two super-Earth exoplanets in one planetary system: COROT-7b {{was detected by}} the COROT satellite and COROT-7c was detected by HARPS from ground-based telescopes. Until the announcement of Kepler-10b in January 2011, COROT-7b was the smallest exoplanet to have its diameter measured, at 1.58 {{times that of the}} Earth (which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a volume 3.95 times Earth's).

25|$|COROT-7b (previously named COROT-Exo-7b) is an {{exoplanet}} orbiting {{around the}} star COROT-7, {{in the constellation}} Monoceros, at 489 light years from Earth. It was first detected photometrically by the French-led COROT mission and reported in February 2009.

The planet is also notable for its very short orbital period, revolving around its host star in about 20 hours.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, {{there was a}} {{significant}} movement in favor of this U.S. territory becoming a commonwealth, which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a level of self-government similar to Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. However, the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of Guam proposed, because its clauses were incompatible with the Territorial Clause (Art. IV, Sec. 3, cl. 2) of the U.S. Constitution. Other movements advocate U.S. statehood for Guam, union with the state of Hawaii, or union with the Northern Mariana Islands as a single territory, or independence.|$|E

25|$|England {{lost three}} early wickets {{in their second}} innings, but their middle order rallied, and they reached 138, despite both Schwarz and Vogler {{getting a lot of}} {{movement}} with their bowling. South Africa needed 256 runs in two hours and forty minutes to secure an unlikely victory. Their captain, Sherwell, announced that they <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a go, and the opening batsmen, Sinclair and Faulkner began well, moving the score to 61 runs after 35 minutes. Three wickets from Hirst restricted the South Africans, but further attacking batting from the South Africans entertained the crowds until the match was stopped due to poor light, resulting in a draw.|$|E
25|$|Johnstone was {{appointed}} colonial governor of West Florida in November 1763 by the Prime Minister, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. Johnstone was {{friends at the}} time with the dramatist and fellow Scot John Home, who {{was at this point}} Bute's secretary. Johnstone was one of several Scots appointed by Bute to govern all four of the new British colonies, which provoked much criticism from the opposition. Johnstone became notorious for cudgelling a writer for The North Briton over his comments on Bute's appointments. Johnstone took up his position eagerly, feeling that his new province's strategic location <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a profitable future, and envisaging West Florida as ‘The Emporium of the New World’.|$|E
25|$|The Nets {{were in the}} mix {{prior to}} the season to be contenders in the Eastern Conference {{alongside}} the Miami Heat. Pierce and Garnett were set to be the 'supporting cast' to Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Brook Lopez. However, with Lopez going down with a season-ending injury in December, Pierce was entrusted with the starting power forward spot. As the season moved along and the Nets continued to struggle, doubt began to creep around the locker room, front office, and fan base. That's when the Nets saw revitalization in Pierce's game and his never-say-die attitude. After scrapping past the Toronto Raptors {{in the first round}} of the playoffs thanks to a last-second block from Pierce in Game 7, their attempt to get past the Heat and win a championship fell short. They lost to Miami in five games in the second round, and questions began to linger about whether Pierce <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> another year in Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E
25|$|The species, {{as it is}} {{currently}} accepted, was first described and classified by the Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in 1934 based upon a sample taken from Port Hedland in Western Australia, which was designated to be the holotype. Whitley named the species Olistus hedlandensis, placing the fish in what {{was at the time}} a valid genus of jacks. When Olistus was synonymised with Carangoides, the fish was placed either in Caranx or Carangoides, and {{is currently}} accepted as belonging in the latter. The specific epithet refers to the type location of the species, Port Hedland. This {{was not the first time}} the fish had been described though, with Georges Cuvier applying the name Olistus malabaricus to the species in 1833, which <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> priority over Whitley's name. However, when Olistus was merged into Carangoides, a taxonomic homonym was created with Carangoides malabaricus, thus Whitley's name has been accepted to overcome this problem. The bumpnose trevally is very similar to Carangoides armatus, and appears to have been misidentified as such many times, with 1980 review of the two species finding many misidentified fish in museum collections.|$|E
25|$|These volumes, {{traditional}} British comic {{and story}} annuals, were published {{each year in}} time for Christmas shopping. They are cloth bound with full-color painted covers and probably came with dust jackets that duplicated the illustrations on the board covers. These dust jackets, however, are seldom found. Interior contents are a mix of original British material (often by McLoughlin) and reprints from American comics, usually Quality. Primary distribution came through the Woolworth's chain where toys matching characters and vehicles from the stories were also on sale. Little {{is known about the}} original pricing of the volumes although some are thought to have been priced at 7/6. No issues were numbered or dated and the order given here may not be entirely accurate. It is clear, however, that the order of issues presented in several British fanzines and publications is hopelessly wrong. It seems likely that the three Supercoloured Comic Annuals and the New Spaceways Comic Annual should be considered part of this series. This <b>would</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> an unbroken run of one annual a year from 1949 to 1959 which would nearly correspond with the Buffalo Bill series. Copies of each of these annuals with dated gift inscriptions confirm that the estimate of dates is fairly accurate. British collector Paul Annis' research confirms most of these dates.|$|E
