60|$|It {{would win}} back her former worshippers, she felt sure of that. The theatre <b>would</b> fill <b>again</b> with men whose palates {{required}} the highly seasoned, the far-fetched. The critics would rejoice in their victory, and welcome Helen Merival to her rightful place with added fervor. The bill-boards <b>would</b> glow <b>again</b> with magnificent posters of Helen Merival, as Alessandra, stooping with wild eyes and streaming hair over her slain paramour {{on the marble}} stairway, a dagger in her hand. People <b>would</b> crowd <b>again</b> behind the scenes {{at the close of}} the play. The magazines would add their chorus of praise.|$|R
5|$|During the 2005, 2006, and 2007 seasons, the {{championship}} game was held at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2008 and 2009, {{the championship}} was held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. In 2010 and 2011, the venue switched to Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina, and on December 2, 2011 the ACC announced that the 2012 and 2013 ACC Championship Games <b>would</b> <b>again</b> be played in Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} tackle {{financial}} burdens {{resulting from the}} Hussite wars and military campaigns against the Ottoman Empire, Sigismund of Luxemburg put lower value silver coins into circulation in 1432. The new pennies were known as quarting because they contained {{only a quarter of}} the silver content of the old currency. Bishop Lépes, who knew that pennies of higher value <b>would</b> <b>again</b> be minted in a few years, suspended the collection of the tithe in 1434.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski and his {{supporters}} in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.

5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow up the entire universe. This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen <b>would</b> <b>again</b> fight Mortimer.|$|E
5|$|After the 1992–93 season, Bridgman {{was fired}} and {{replaced}} by Senators Vice-President Randy Sexton. In the 1993–94 season, the club added prospects Daigle and Yashin. Yashin would have an outstanding rookie season and become {{a finalist for the}} Calder Memorial Trophy. Yashin led the team in points with 30 goals and 79 points, while Daigle had 51 points. The Senators would make some progress, improving their record to 14 wins and 37 points, but <b>would</b> <b>again</b> finish last in the League. The Senators would select Radek Bonk with their pick, third overall, in the 1994 Draft.|$|E
5|$|Aldfrith ruled both Bernicia and Deira {{throughout}} his reign, {{but the two}} parts remained distinct, and <b>would</b> <b>again</b> be divided by the Vikings in the late 9th century. The centre of Bernicia lay in the region around the later Anglo-Scottish border, with Lindisfarne, Hexham, Bamburgh, and Yeavering being important religious and royal centres. Even after Ecgfrith's death, Bernicia included much of modern southeast Scotland, with a presumed royal centre at Dunbar, and religious centres at Coldingham and Melrose. The details of the early Middle Ages in northwest England and southwest Scotland are more obscure, but a Bishop of Whithorn is known from shortly after Aldfrith's reign. York, Catterick, Ripon, and Whitby {{appear to have been}} important sites in Deira.|$|E

5|$|Although the Chinese {{were unable}} to exploit the {{breakthrough}} in the UN lines, {{the weakness of the}} ROK II Corps on the Eighth Army's right flank was exposed to the Chinese commanders. During the planning of the Chinese Second Phase Campaign, Peng <b>would</b> <b>again</b> focus his attention towards the ROK II Corps at the Eighth Army's right flank, resulting in a disastrous defeat for the UN forces at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, October 25 is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.|$|E
5|$|For a {{month in}} August–September 1956, Bennett hosted a NBC Saturday night {{television}} variety show, The Tony Bennett Show, as a summer replacement for The Perry Como Show. Patti Page and Julius La Rosa had in turn hosted the two previous months, and they all shared the same singers, dancers, and orchestra. In 1959, Bennett <b>would</b> <b>again</b> fill in for The Perry Como Show, this time alongside Teresa Brewer and Jaye P. Morgan as co-hosts of the summer-long Perry Presents.|$|E
5|$|From 800 onwards, {{a series}} of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr's (r. 844–77) {{inheritance}} of Gwynedd and Powys. His sons in turn would found three principal dynasties (Aberffraw for Gwynedd, Dinefwr for Deheubarth and Mathrafal for Powys). Rhodri's grandson Hywel Dda (r. 900–50) founded Deheubarth out of his maternal and paternal inheritances of Dyfed and Seisyllwg in 930, ousted the Aberffraw dynasty from Gwynedd and Powys and then codified Welsh law in the 940s. Maredudd ab Owain (r. 986–99) of Deheubarth (Hywel's grandson) <b>would,</b> (<b>again)</b> temporarily oust the Aberffraw line from control of Gwynedd and Powys.|$|E

5|$|On 3 September 2007, Odex {{director}} Stephen Sing {{announced on}} his company's Internet forum that Odex {{would no longer}} send letters of demand to Internet users who had stopped their illegal downloading {{since the beginning of}} the enforcement drive. Two weeks later, Odex installed an online warning system developed by BayTSP that generated cease and desist emails intended for the alleged downloaders. The company did not obtain subscribers' information directly from ISPs, but relied on ISPs to forward such emails to their subscribers. Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP to continue its anti-piracy drive, and that it <b>would</b> <b>again</b> resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|E
5|$|Proponents of the Act, {{including}} Trumbull and Wilson, {{argued that}} Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment authorized {{the federal government}} to legislate civil rights for the States. Others disagreed, maintaining that inequality conditions were distinct from slavery. Seeking more substantial justification, and fearing that future opponents <b>would</b> <b>again</b> seek to overturn the legislation, Congress and the states added additional protections to the Constitution: the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) defining citizenship and mandating equal protection under the law, and the Fifteenth Amendment (1870) banning racial voting restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{the line}} {{have been made}} since the {{extension}} to Østerås. The current municipal master plan calls for the line to be extended to Bekkestua Station, where it <b>would</b> <b>again</b> intersect with the Kolsås Line. One possibility is also that the service be continued along the Kolsås Line and a new branch be built to Sandvika, the municipal center of Bærum. However, an extension {{has not been a}} priority for the municipal politicians, although the right-of-way has been secured, which will simplify construction.|$|E

5|$|The Hoots {{decision}} <b>would</b> <b>again</b> affect Burger King as {{it moved}} into the state of Texas. When Burger King expanded into the San Antonio area, it was prevented from utilizing the name of its signature product, the Whopper, in its local advertising and stores due to a prior state registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger. The chain, owned by Frank and Barbara Bates, prevented the company from using the name in Bexar County for several years until Mrs. Bates, the CEO of Whopper Burger {{after the death of}} her husband in 1983, retired and sold the chain with its related trademarks to then-corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|The Second Coming was {{controversial}} {{from its}} conception. When {{it was a}} Channel 4 project, it {{was the subject of}} a Sunday Express article a year before its original projected transmission date of late 2001. The series <b>would</b> <b>again</b> receive criticism when it was rumoured it would be broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2003. The series was eventually broadcast over consecutive nights on 9–10 February 2003 to 6.3million and 5.4million viewers respectively, and received mixed reactions from the audience: Davies reportedly received death threats for its atheistic message and criticism for its anticlimactic ending, as well as two nominations for Television Awards and one for a Royal Television Society Award.|$|E
