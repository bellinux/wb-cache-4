[...] The song is seen as representing the emotion of his campaign effort. David Weigel described Branch as the [...] "muse of the insurgent conservative candidate" [...] due to her songs being used by Cain and Santorum in their primary campaigns.|$|E

[...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> intellectually honest as possible."

500|$|After {{discovering}} and journeying through {{islands of}} different characteristics, the tribe, {{with the help}} of The Breath, have overcome numerous natural disasters including tsunami and volcanic eruption. The tribe follows the path of The Ancients, yet their lands are nowhere to be found. By the last island, the players are given the chance to place the totem around the island and create and form their own island. After placing the final totem, the tribe reaches the place for the final ritual. After the ritual is completed, the entire island collapses and reshapes and sinks into the sea, leaving only the passageway above sea level. After the tribespeople pass the gateway, they realize that they have returned to the first island where they began their journey.

500|$|Discussing the {{increasing}} popularity of unreliable narrators in television, Hawley {{said that he}} did not want the audience thinking that the series is a puzzle that needs to be solved, saying, [...] "We're going to take a character out of confusion into clarity and an audience out of mystery into clarity"; this is seen in the season's latter episodes, which are more narratively straightforward after Haller becomes [...] "clear on what’s going on [...] <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> well." [...] A noted sequence in the season's penultimate episode sees Haller explain the series' backstory and events to himself (and the audience)—Haller was institutionalized not because of his abilities, but because his mind had been infected by the Shadow King. Hawley wanted to indicate to the audience that this would be the only sequence in the series so exposition heavy, and so it features Haller creating a class room environment within his mind to make the teaching purpose of the scene explicit.|$|E

NCAI Executive Director Jacqueline Pata stated [...] "The survey doesn't recognize the psychological impacts these racist names and imagery have on American Indian and Alaska Natives. It is not respectful to who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> Native people. This poll still doesn't make it right." [...] The Native American Journalists Association issued a statement calling {{the publication of the}} poll, and the reporting of its significance, as not only inaccurate and misleading but unethical. [...] "The reporters and editors behind this story must have known that it would be used as justification for the continued use of these harmful, racist mascots.

500|$|The NCAN {{joined with}} the National Assembly of Religious Women (NARW) to issue a joint statement: [...] "The Roman Congregation for Religious in their fear of losing 'authority' has ignored the {{principle}} of freedom of conscience." [...] The NCAN and NARW requested sympathetic religious women {{to take part in}} a protest on Pentecost Sunday, May 22, 1983, [...] "as a visible witness to the arrogant use of power in a male dominated church." [...] Small protests were organized at cathedrals in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Ms. magazine reported that Sister Donna Quinn, president of NCAN, said that the Pope's demand for obedience [...] "tramples on who <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> women religious in the United States". Ms. writer Mary Kay Blakely added that she thought Mansour was correct in saying that [...] "the Pope doesn't understand the American people, and he doesn't understand the American nun". Divided over the Mansour affair, the Catholic Theological Society of America passed an unsuccessful resolution asking for dialog rather than simple administrative decisions which [...] "violate both the theological meaning of authority in the church and the sacredness of conscience of church members".|$|E
500|$|The {{years after}} World War II saw {{a number of}} notable {{performances}} of the Eighth Symphony, including Sir Adrian Boult's broadcast from the Royal Albert Hall on 10February 1948, the Japanese premiere under Kazuo Yamada in Tokyo in December 1949, and the Australian premiere under Sir Eugene Goossens in 1951. A Carnegie Hall performance under Stokowski in 1950 became the first complete recording of the symphony to be issued. After 1950 the increasing numbers of performances and recordings of the work signified its growing popularity, but not all critics were won over. Theodor W. Adorno found the piece weak, [...] "a giant symbolic shell"; this most affirmative work of Mahler's is, in Adorno's view, his least successful, musically and artistically inferior to his other symphonies. The composer-critic Robert Simpson, usually a champion of Mahler, referred to PartII as [...] "an ocean of shameless kitsch." [...] Mahler biographer Jonathan Carr finds much of the symphony [...] "bland", lacking the tension and resolution present in the composer's other symphonies. Deryck Cooke, on the other hand, compares Mahler's Eighth to Beethoven's Choral (Ninth) Symphony. To Cooke, Mahler's is [...] "the Choral Symphony of the twentieth century: like Beethoven's, but in a different way, it sets before us an ideal [...] which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> yet far from realising—even perhaps moving away from—but which we can hardly abandon without perishing".|$|E

500|$|Development officially {{began in}} 2009, when TNT {{announced}} that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project. Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who {{is best known for}} writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. [...] "I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [...] spirit of '76. I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies, which is basically what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world," [...] he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. [...] "I've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?" [...] he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, [...] "It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [...] They say write what you know, and with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{an early}} age, she was {{introduced}} by her parents to blues music, jazz and art rock, which, she told Rolling Stone in 1995, would later influence her: [...] "I was brought up listening to John Lee Hooker, to Howlin' Wolf, to Robert Johnson, {{and a lot of}} Jimi Hendrix and Captain Beefheart. So I was exposed to all these very compassionate musicians at a very young age, and that's always remained in me and seems to surface more as I get older. I think the way <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> we get older is a result of what we knew when we were children." [...] During her teenage years, she began listening to new wave and synthpop bands such as Soft Cell, Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, although later stated that it was a phase when she was [...] "having a bit of a rebellion against my parents' record collection." [...] In her later teenage years, she became a fan of American indie rock bands including Pixies, Television and Slint (whom she reached out to when the band included a message in the inside sleeve of Spiderland saying [...] "interested female vocalists write 1864 Douglas Blvd., Louisville, KY 40205"). [...] Though not as many critics have suspected, Patti Smith; a frequent comparison that Harvey dismisses as [...] "lazy journalism." [...] However, recently Harvey has said that Smith is [...] "so energising to see and so passionate with what she's doing". Harvey has also cited Siouxsie Sioux in terms of live performance, stating : [...] "She is so exciting to watch, so full of energy and human raw quality". She has also drawn inspiration from Russian folk music, Italian soundtrack composer Ennio Morricone, classical composers like Arvo Pärt, Samuel Barber and Henryk Górecki; and Neil Young. As a lyricist, Harvey has cited numerous poets, authors and lyricists as influences on her work including Harold Pinter, T. S. Eliot, William Butler Yeats, James Joyce, Ted Hughes and contemporaries such as Shane MacGowan and Jez Butterworth.|$|E
