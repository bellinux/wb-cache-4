5|$|Much circumstantial {{evidence}} points to the participation of Germanic people from Polish lands in the events {{that took place in}} the first half of the 1st century BC and found their culmination in Gaul in 58 BC, as related in Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico. At the time of the Suebi tribal confederation led by Ariovistus arrival in Gaul, a rapid decrease of settlement density can be observed in the areas of the upper and middle Oder River basin. In fact the Gubin group of the Jastorf culture disappeared then entirely, which may indicate this group's identity with one of the Suebi tribes. The western regions of the Przeworsk culture were also vacated (Lower Silesia, Lubusz Land and western Greater Poland), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> tribes accompanying the Suebi tribes must have come from. Burial sites and artifacts characteristic of the Przeworsk culture have been found in Saxony, Thuringia and Hesse, on the route of the Suebi offensive. The above-mentioned regions of western Poland had not become repopulated and economically developed again until in the 2nd century AD.|$|E
5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having been bitten by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E

In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth. A series of fortifications were built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596; it was the site of the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).|$|E

5|$|Mireille was {{the strongest}} typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures. It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks. Damage was {{heaviest}} on Kyushu where the storm made landfall. Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed {{over much of the}} country, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located. The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs, and left record power outages, affecting 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes. The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058were destroyed, and another 22,965were flooded. Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production. Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930ships, with dozens sunk or blown ashore. Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests. Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies. Crop damage amounted to $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10years to regrow. Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage. There were 62deaths in Japan and 2,862injuries, including the deaths on the South Korean freighter, making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10years. About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, falling due to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects. The $6billion in insured losses and $10billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of May 2014, according to Munich Re.|$|E
