5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{informed}} by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals <b>what</b> <b>Dr.</b> Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E
25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not {{need to know how to}} read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know <b>what</b> <b>Dr.</b> Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E

Beginning with the idea of characters as grotesques whose [...] "...grotesqueness is not merely a shield of deformity; it is also a remnant of misshapen feelings, <b>what</b> <b>Dr.</b> Reefy in the sketch 'Paper Pills' calls 'the sweetness of the twisted apples'". The irony of the sweet, but twisted (meaning, in the sentimental Victorian tradition, internally inferior), apples is that they are compared to Dr. Reefy's own knuckles that make a habit of stuffing crumpled notes bearing his thoughts unread into his pockets (itself a symbol of the [...] "ineffectuality of human thought"). Wing Biddlebaum, the subject of the story [...] "Hands", likewise was [...] "...forever striving to conceal [...] in his pockets or behind his back". [...] For Wing, his hands were [...] "...the very index of his humanity", with the potential to symbolize a continuum going from a general fear of sexuality to sublimated homosexuality. Wing Biddlebaum and Dr. Reefy are just two examples of how throughout Winesburg, Ohio, Anderson builds myriad themes by adding symbolic significance to gestures, weather conditions and time of day, and events, among other features of the stories.|$|E
500|$|The {{surviving}} group regroups on {{the highway}} {{which they had been}} taking to reach Fort Benning {{at the start of the}} season, and assume Andrea is dead. With their remaining vehicles, they travel on back roads to avoid hordes, until one runs out of gas. They camp for the night, where Daryl pressures Rick on how Randall's body had reanimated without a walker bite. Rick reveals <b>what</b> <b>Dr.</b> Edwin Jenner whispered in his ear: they are all infected carriers of the walker pathogen, and become walkers if they die for any reason. Rick also reveals that he had been forced to kill Shane, and Carl had shot his reanimated form, shocking Lori. As they continue to debate, the others, save for Daryl and Hershel, start to lose their faith in Rick as a leader. A noise echoing in the distance places the group on high alert, but Rick does not allow anyone to investigate. Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) urges Rick to take action, causing Rick to snap, saying that he never asked that he be put in charge, and blurting out that he had killed Shane for their sake. He dares anyone to leave the safety of the camp. When nobody leaves he issues a final warning: [...] "If you're staying, this isn't a democracy anymore," [...] establishing his position as leader of the group. Afterwards it is shown that the group is unknowingly camped near a prison.|$|E
