5|$|The {{influence}} of this old constellation of iconographic elements {{can still be}} seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer {{in a gesture of}} protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra). The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular theme.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, 2017, McCain {{underwent}} a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, {{in order to}} remove a blood clot above his left eye. His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay {{a vote on the}} Better Care Reconciliation Act. Five days later, Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> aggressive brain tumor. Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation, although even with treatment, average survival time is approximately 14 months. McCain is a survivor of previous cancers, including melanoma.|$|E
25|$|Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) are {{frequently}} used in plant molecular biology. Of special {{interest is the}} CaMV 35S promoter, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong promoter most frequently used in plant transformations.|$|E
50|$|At {{full speed}} a troika can reach 45 - 50 km/h, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high speed on land for {{vehicles}} in the 17th-19th centuries, making the troika {{closely associated with the}} fast ride.|$|R
50|$|At the {{entrance}} of the monument <b>is</b> <b>a</b> life size replica of the prehistoric Mylodon, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large herbivore, somewhat resembling a large bear. It became extinct {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene Epoch.|$|R
25|$|He first {{played for}} Tamil Nadu, but later {{returned}} to his original state, the Delhi cricket team. He represented Delhi Daredevils in the inaugural IPL. In 2010 IPL, he took nine wickets to 9 matches, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> impressive display.|$|R
25|$|Drugs {{that depend}} on an acidic stomach {{environment}} (such as ketoconazole or atazanavir) may be poorly absorbed, whereas acid-labile antibiotics (such as erythromycin <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) may be absorbed {{to a greater extent}} than normal due to the more alkaline environment of the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Mughal cannon making skills {{advanced}} {{during the}} 17th century. One {{of the most}} impressive Mughal cannons is known as the Zafarbaksh, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare composite cannon, that required skills in both wrought-iron forge welding and bronze-casting technologies and the in-depth knowledge of the qualities of both metals.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{legislative}} method, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> lengthy process, the General Assembly must pass a resolution, {{calling for an}} amendment and stating its wording, and it must do so in three separate readings on three separate days, with an absolute majority on all readings. The resolution {{does not require the}} governor's approval.|$|E
50|$|Holy Cross High School, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular girls convent in Goa, {{was founded}} by the Congregation of the Daughters of the Cross in 1933. However since 1977 it has <b>been</b> {{converted}} into <b>a</b> co-ed school, with only the boarding for girls.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> road <b>was</b> {{named after}} him during his lifetime, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> rare {{instance}} of expressing immense love, honour and respect imparted ever by the citizen of any town. This road, A P Sen Road, still runs in Charbag area of Lucknow.|$|R
50|$|A fire in 1739 {{resulted}} {{in the destruction of}} the interior, some ceilings and coffered. During the War of Independence the city regained its strategic position and the French proceeded to <b>an</b> ephemeral conditioning <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> significant transformation of the enclosure.|$|R
25|$|For {{additional}} warmth, some {{dry suit}} users inflate their suits with argon, an inert gas which has superior thermal insulating properties compared to air. The argon is {{carried in a}} small cylinder, separate from the diver's breathing gas. This arrangement is frequently used when the breathing gas contains helium, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> poor insulator in comparison with other breathing gases.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} way of spotting {{land mines}} through nuclear reactions {{with the help}} of neutrons is that of measuring the thermalization of neutrons. In this technique the soil is irradiated by fast neutrons and the flux of thermal neutrons scattering back is measured. The motivation for this technique is that explosives contain much higher concentrations of hydrogen, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective moderator of neutrons.|$|E
25|$|The {{biotransformation}} {{process can}} activate the PAH compound and {{transform it into}} a diol epoxide, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> reactive intermediate. These diol-epoxides covalently bind with DNA base pairs, most often with guanine and adenine to form stable adducts within the DNA structure. The binding of diol epoxides and DNA base pairs blocks polymerase replication activity. This blockage ultimately contributes {{to an increase in}} DNA damage by reducing repair activity.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon longiceps {{would have}} shared {{the sky with}} the giant-crested {{pterosaur}} Nyctosaurus. Compared to P. longiceps, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> common species, Nyctosaurus was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early toothed bird, Ichthyornis.|$|R
50|$|In 1893 Allen {{moved to}} New York City, {{where he lived}} until his death. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{contributor}} to Harper's Magazine, The Atlantic Monthly, and other popular magazines of the time. His novels include The Choir Invisible, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular best seller in 1897.|$|R
50|$|According to Polybius, Scipio made generous {{provisions}} for his widow {{to ensure that}} she would retain the same lifestyle she had grown accustomed to as his wife. He also promised his daughters fifty talents of silver each, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large dowry by that era's standards.|$|R
25|$|The {{molecular}} dynamics approach takes multiple random conformations {{at a time}} and subjects all of them to experimental data. Here the experimental data is serving as limitations to be placed on the conformations (e.g. known distances between atoms). Only conformations that manage to remain within the limits set by the experimental data are accepted. This approach often applies large amounts of experimental data to the conformations <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> computationally demanding task.|$|E
25|$|NET is {{a potent}} {{progestogen}} and a weak androgen and estrogen. That is, it {{is a potent}} agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR) and a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and the estrogen receptor (ER). NET itself has insignificant affinity for the ER; its estrogenic activity is from an active metabolite that is formed in very small amounts, ethinylestradiol (EE), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> potent estrogen. NET and its metabolites have negligible affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and hence have no glucocorticoid, antiglucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity.|$|E
25|$|Units {{such as the}} Ohio State Highway Patrol's Special Response Team (SRT) used {{a vehicle}} called a B.E.A.R., made by Lenco Engineering, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large armored vehicle with a ladder on top to make entry into {{the second and third}} floors of buildings. Numerous other {{agencies}} such as the LAPD, LASD and NYPD use both the B.E.A.R. and the smaller Lenco BearCat variant. The Anaheim Police Department has a customized B.E.A.R. fitted with a ladder for assaulting multi-story buildings. Many SWAT teams in the states and around the world, including the LAPD, fit their armored and non-armored vehicles with the Patriot3 Liberator and 'MARS' (Mobile Adjustable Ramp System) Elevated Tactics Systems for gaining entry to 2nd- and 3rd-story buildings, airplane assault, sniper positioning, ship access, etc.|$|E
50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{friend and}} patron of Abraham Cowley and Sir William Davenant. Although {{accused of having}} 'dissolute morals', he was really no more or less 'moral' than most other men of his time. He was much {{addicted}} to gambling, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular pastime in his era.|$|R
50|$|At Valenzana Venezia {{became an}} {{integral}} part of the team and brought experience despite his young age. The team played in Serie C <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> competitive league and allowed for overseas teams to scout him. This was the start of interest from various clubs from Switzerland, England and Germany.|$|R
50|$|Finally, he {{made the}} act of taking a case to court free, however inadequately, {{replacing}} the old system of the sportula, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> heavy judicial fee, calculated {{on the basis of}} the seriousness of the case, which provided the judges' pay, with a regular system of salaries paid by the state.|$|R
25|$|The {{color of}} {{red blood cells}} {{is due to the}} heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color {{depending}} {{on the state of the}} hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin. Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} crafts made in the state, which are often distinguished by the use of certain materials and of certain designs. The best known of these is the carving of figures from ironwood (palo fierro in Spanish), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> dense, almost black wood that sinks in water. This wood was often used in braziers in the past because it would burn for a very long time. This carving is the specialty of the Yaquis and the Seris. Before it can be carved, this wood must be dried thoroughly, a process that can take up to five years. If this is not done, the wood takes on an ochre color, rather than its characteristic shiny near black. Objects made from this wood are almost always decorative in nature {{in a wide variety of}} shapes such as sahuaro and other cacti, eagles, turtles, dolphins and other flora and fauna of the state, along with crosses. The last is popular among indigenous groups as it is believed that such guard against the envy of others and other ills. Objects made of this wood are very much in demand on the international market, but indigenous craftsmen cannot compete with factory made pieces.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all. The katanas gentle curvature is attained by a process of differential hardening or differential quenching: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel. When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750°C, it enters the austenite phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into martensite, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite which is softer than martensite. This process also creates the distinct line {{down the sides of}} the blade called the hamon, which is made distinct by polishing. Each hamon and each smith's style of hamon is distinct.|$|E
25|$|O'Reilly {{went from}} college {{to work as}} a {{management}} consultant for Weston-Evans in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, he earned £200 annually, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good salary by the then Irish standards. While there, he continued his rugby career, with Leicester. His work included cost accounting and time-and-motion studies, in industries ranging from shoe-making to pottery.|$|R
50|$|For Dammers, the group’s {{founder and}} {{keyboard}} player, Brad was “highly intelligent, had a mischievous sense of humour <b>which</b> could <b>be</b> very funny, {{and he played}} the drums with {{an incredible amount of}} energy <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> important part of the Specials’ sound and live shows”. For the singer Terry Hall, he was simply “a great drummer”.|$|R
50|$|He fought {{during the}} Battle of Gully Ravine (28 June - 3 July 1915), <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> bloody battle that {{resulted}} in a large number of Ottoman. The casualties of the 3rd Battalion, 70th Regiment, on 2 July 1915, amounted to six officers killed, four wounded and 158 personnel killed. In addition, <b>a</b> further 285 <b>were</b> wounded.|$|R
25|$|Akin {{arrives in}} Owerri {{and asks for}} the ticket to Abuja, but he is told there's no flight {{scheduled}} for Abuja {{for the rest of}} the day. Mary also arrives in Abuja and calls her number through the phone in her hand. She tells Akin she is in Abuja and they both decide to find a way out. Akin asks Mary to go to his mother's house in Abuja, Akin also finds himself in Mary's Father's house <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> ancient house. Mary's sister, Cynthia (Ada Ameh) introduces Akin to their father (Chika Okpala) as Mary's boyfriend. Mary is also received happily by Akin's mother, Kike (Joke Silva) and she believed Mary is Akin's girlfriend. Mary tries to explain to her what happened, but she is too overjoyed to listen. Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes to sleep on the veranda. He finds it hard to sleep on the Veranda again due to mosquitoes. He gets up and calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many things like the fact that her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around. Mary asks Akin to speak to Cynthia on her behalf because she thinks Cynthia will listen to him as Cynthia seems to like him. Akin also asks Mary to go to the company's retreat on his behalf. He tells her that all she needs to do is give the chairman the information on the memory card of his phone. Akin talks to Cynthia and she accepts to behave responsibly at the family meeting and to start behaving responsibly at home in order to preserve the future of her kids. At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century, {{the writer}} Samuel Lewis {{said that it}} was [...] "small and of rude workmanship", but had [...] "several curious features" [...] such as the font that made it [...] "valuable". The {{antiquarian}} Angharad Llwyd, writing in 1833, described it as [...] "a small cruciform structure, situated in a little barren valley", with the south transept [...] "bearing evidence of very great antiquity." [...] She stated that there were some windows [...] "in the later English style, of good design, especially the east window of the chancel, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> superior composition." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{research}} facility at [...] "Taskerlands", Kneale {{was influenced by}} a visit he had paid to the BBC's research and development facility which was based at an old country house at Kingswood Warren in Kingswood, Surrey. Similarly, {{the research}}ers working at Kingswood Warren influenced the portrayal {{of the members of}} the Ryan research team in The Stone Tape. Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, [...] "The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. [...] They were very cheerful. It was all rather fun for them, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> clever way to go about doing that sort of heavy research... They were nice chaps– and so we got some very nice chaps for the TV version".|$|E
50|$|Dunn {{was educated}} at St. Theresa's School, Liverpool and the London School of Economics and became <b>an</b> engineer. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{councillor}} on Liverpool City Council {{and served as}} secretary of Liverpool Co-operative Party. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> counicllor for the ward of Kirkdale <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> working class area that was moving from voting Conservative to voting for the Labour Party.|$|R
25|$|The TDC {{needed to}} be {{positioned}} near other fire control equipment to minimize the amount of electromechanical interconnect. Because submarine space within the pressure hull was limited, the TDC {{needed to be}} as small as possible. On World War II submarines, the TDC and other fire control equipment was mounted in the conning tower, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small space.|$|R
50|$|During {{those first}} years of {{football}} in Argentina, Lobos was runner-up in 1898 and 1899, following Lomas A.C., <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong team by then. In July 30, 1899, Lobos {{was also the first}} Argentine football team to go on a tour outside Argentina, playing some friendly matches in Uruguay where the squad achieved a notable 2-0 victory over CURCC (current Peñarol).|$|R
