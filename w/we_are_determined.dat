500|$|Throughout his writings, Du Bois {{supported}} women's rights,Donaldson, Shawn, [...] "Women's Rights", in Young, pp. 219–221. but {{he found}} it difficult to publicly endorse the women's right-to-vote movement because leaders of the suffragism movement refused to support his fight against racial injustice. A Crisis editorial from 1913 broached the taboo subject of interracial marriage: although Du Bois generally expected persons to marry within their race, he viewed the problem as a women's rights issue, because laws prohibited white men from marrying black women. Du Bois wrote [...] " [...] laws leave the colored girls absolutely helpless for the lust of white men. It reduces colored women {{in the eyes of the}} law to the position of dogs. As low as the white girl falls, she can compel her seducer to marry her... We must kill [...] not because we are anxious to marry the white men's sisters, but because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> that white men will leave our sisters alone."Du Bois quoted in Lubin, Alex (2005), Romance and Rights: The Politics of Interracial Intimacy, 1945–1954, University Press of Mississippi, pp. 71–72.|$|E

40|$|Our goal is {{to develop}} a {{quantitative}} and mechanistic understanding of amorphous silica, SiO 2 (am), dissolution kinetics in aqueous solutions. A knowledge of fundamental controls on the reactivity of simple Si-O bonded phases is the baseline of behavior for understanding highly complex silica phases. In the Earth, silicate minerals comprise > 70 % of the crust and dominate virtually every subsurface system. More importantly for the objectives of this EMSP project, the silicates are important because compositionally complex glasses will become the front line of defense in containing radioactive wastes in the nation's long term and interim storage strategies. To date, the behavior of SiO 2 (am) is largely inferred from studies of the better known crystalline polymorphs (e. g. alpha-quartz).

The two All-Black players each lifted one of O'Driscoll's legs before driving him towards the ground; O'Driscoll's shoulder was dislocated upon landing. While O'Driscoll was being lifted, the touch judge was heard telling Mealamu and Umaga to let O'Driscoll go, but he took no further action regarding the incident. Opinions differed on the incident. Many British and Irish commentators and fans claimed {{that it was an}} illegal [...] "spear tackle" [...] and Lions coach Clive Woodward reported the pair to the IRB-appointed citing commissioner, William Venter, who decided, {{on the basis of the}} video footage available to him at the time, not to refer the matter to a disciplinary tribunal. New Zealand commentators and fans were largely of the view that the two All Blacks were merely clearing out the ruck and that there had been no intention to injure O'Driscoll.

2500|$|Throughout the war, the Confederacy sent armies out of Virginia {{through the}} Shenandoah Valley to invade Maryland and Pennsylvania and {{threaten}} Washington, D.C. Lt. Gen. Jubal Early, {{following the same}} pattern in the Valley Campaigns of 1864, and hoping to distract Grant from the Siege of Petersburg, attacked Union forces near Washington and raided several towns in Pennsylvania. Grant, reacting to the political commotion caused by the invasion, organized the Middle Military Division, whose field troops were known as the Army of the Shenandoah. He considered various candidates for command, including George Meade, William B. Franklin, and David Hunter, with the latter two intended for the military division while Sheridan would command the army. All of these choices were rejected by either Grant or the War Department and, over the objection of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who believed him to be too young for such a high post, Sheridan took command in both roles at Harpers Ferry on August 7, 1864. His mission was not only to defeat Early's army and to close off the Northern invasion route, but to deny the Shenandoah Valley as a productive agricultural region to the Confederacy. Grant told Sheridan, [...] "The people should be informed that so long as an army can subsist among them recurrences of these raids must be expected, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> to stop them at all hazards. ...

2500|$|In early March 1935, talks {{intended}} {{to discuss the}} scale and extent of German rearmament in Berlin between Hitler and Simon were postponed when Hitler took offence at a British government White Paper that justified a higher defence budget under the grounds that Germany was violating the Versailles Treaty, and {{he claimed to have}} contracted a [...] "cold". In the interval between Hitler [...] "recovering" [...] and Simon's visit, the German government took the chance for formally rejecting all the clauses of Versailles relating to disarmament on the land and air. In the 1930s, the British government was obsessed {{with the idea of a}} German bombing attack destroying London and so placed a great deal of value on reaching an air pact outlawing bombing. The idea of a naval agreement was felt to be a useful stepping stone to an air pact. On 26 March 1935, during one of his meetings with Simon, and his deputy Anthony Eden, Hitler stated his intention to reject the naval disarmament section of Versailles but was prepared to discuss a treaty regulating the scale of German naval rearmament. On 21 May 1935, Hitler in a speech in Berlin formally offered to discuss a treaty offering a German Navy that was to operate forever on a 35:100 naval ratio. During his [...] "peace speech" [...] of 21 May, Hitler disavowed any intention of engaging in a pre-1914 style naval race with Britain, and he stated: [...] "The German Reich government recognises of itself the overwhelming importance for existence and thereby the justification of dominance at sea to protect the British Empire, just as, on the other hand, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> to do everything necessary in protection of our own continental existence and freedom".
