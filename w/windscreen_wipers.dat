25|$|Items {{such as the}} <b>windscreen,</b> <b>wipers</b> and {{exhaust systems}} are tested for {{condition}} and operation. <b>Windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> will fail the test {{if they do not}} adequately clear the windscreen when used in conjunction with the washers. The exhaust system, in addition to checks on its condition and security, is tested to ascertain whether it is obviously louder than another vehicle of the same make and model with a standard exhaust system fitted. Dismantling of any part of the vehicle during the MOT test is strictly against test regulations, making the assessment of corrosion or worn components in certain areas on certain car models very difficult to determine accurately. As the MOT is only an inspection for road-worthiness at the time of test, the inspection of most accessories is not included. One exception is tow bars: their condition and their attachment to the vehicle is now included in the MOT.|$|E
40|$|As modern {{passenger}} cars become increasingly quieter and comfort, automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> {{noise and vibration}} become more noticeable. As {{a result of the}} market information survey, most complaints about the wiper concern operation noise. Wiper vibration and noise is classified into three main categories namely, squeal noise, chattering, and reversal noise. Squeal noise is a high-frequency vibration of about 1000 Hz. Chattering noise is a lowfrequency vibration of 100 Hz or less and reversal noise is an impact sound with a frequency of 500 Hz or less produced when the wiper reverses. Typically, noise and vibration study of the automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> has been carried out by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. This report describes evaluation of noise and vibration that generated by an automotive <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> using numerical approach via finite element method. In doing so, two types of test are conducted i. e. modal testing for individual wiper components and noise and vibration test to identify noise category for a selected passenger car <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> Later, a 3 -dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) model of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> assembly is developed. This FE model is then validated at the component level using modal analysis {{in order to ensure that}} dynamic characteristics of the FE model close to a real <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> In order to evaluate characteristics of noise and vibration of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper,</b> complex eigenvalue analysis that made available in ABAQUS is employed. It is found that the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> generates noise at frequency around 11 Hz which is identified as chatter and the predicted frequency is fairly close with measured frequency obtained in the experiment. This chatter noise is dominated by bending mode of the wiper blade. Having found the characteristics of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> noise, several structural modifications are proposed to the rubber blade and simulated once again. There are three modifications that capable of preventing noise and vibration in the <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> This finding could help car makers to design quiet and effective <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> and in turn to produce quieter and comfort {{passenger cars}}...|$|R

25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and rear glass. SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps.

40|$|Today both car {{drivers and}} car {{passengers}} cannot imagine {{this kind of}} vehicle without a <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper.</b> There {{are only a few}} who know its history and evolution. A <b>windscreen</b> <b>wiper</b> is a device used to remove rain and debris from a windscreen or windshield. A wiper generally consists of an arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other. The blade is swung {{back and forth over the}} glass, pushing water from its surface...|$|R
25|$|The <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> were {{powered by}} a purely {{mechanical}} system: a cable connected to the transmission; to reduce cost, this cable also powered the speedometer. The wipers' speed was therefore dependent on car speed. When the car was waiting at a crossroad, the wipers were not powered; thus, a handle under the speedometer allowed them to be operated by hand. From 1962, the wipers were {{powered by a}} single-speed electric motor. The car came with only a speedometer and an ammeter.|$|E
25|$|Both four-door {{sedan and}} five-door station wagon {{variants}} were available as before, although trim levels {{were limited to}} SLX and GS. The SLX was aimed at fleet markets, fitted with power steering, a radio cassette player, a remote boot and fuel cap release, and electric side-view mirrors. The sedan-only SLX V6 added four-wheel disc brakes over the 2.2 model's front-disc, rear-drum layout, with anti-lock brakes (ABS) on the V6 available as an option. Wagons without ABS fitted made do with a load-sensing valve mechanism to control rear brake lock-up. The higher GS trim built on the SLX level, adding 60/40 split-fold rear seats, variable intermittent <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers,</b> a four-speaker stereo, tachometer, central locking and a more luxurious interior upholstery style.|$|E
25|$|The list {{of items}} tested has been {{continually}} expanded over the years, including in 1968 – a tyre check; 1977 – checks of <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> and washers, direction indicators, brakelights, horns, exhaust system and condition of the body structure and chassis; 1991 – checks of the emissions test for petrol engine vehicles, together with checks on the anti-lock braking system, rear wheel bearings, rear wheel steering (where appropriate) and rear seat belts; 1992 – a stricter tyre tread depth requirement for most vehicles; 1994 – a check of emissions for diesel engine vehicles; 2005 – introduction of a computerised administration system for issuing non-secure test certificates.

500|$|Nathan Cocks of PC PowerPlay complained {{the need}} for {{secondary}} weapons proves frustrating: [...] "It {{is not uncommon to}} run out of the weapons needed for the job, forcing the player to engage in a tedious game of hide and seek as they scour the map in the hopes of finding another cache." [...] He wrote: [...] "In fact, tedium is a frequent bedfellow in Cannon Fodder 3", {{due to the lack of}} variety in the gameplay and mission objectives. He felt the player's vehicles to be of limited effectiveness as is the ability to split the squad. Cocks complained of the game's [...] "bargain basement production" [...] ruining the tone of the game due to low quality translations and voice acting, as well as numerous bugs causing problems with running the game, crashes, spawning and using vehicles. The reviewer acknowledged the [...] "wonderfully cartoony" [...] graphics, found the gory <b>windscreen</b> <b>wipers</b> [...] "amusing" [...] and wrote [...] "It’s all over-the-top explosive goodness and contributes a great deal to what little appeal is present."

[...] He said the [...] "biggest issue" [...] is that a [...] "gung-ho" [...] approach to play is infeasible and that the [...] "precise and tactical" [...] approach faithful to earlier games in the series [...] "turns {{out to be a}} very different experience from before. Far less satisfying". This is due to the [...] "key problem" [...] of the ease with which enemy weapons such as rocket launcher-armed turrets can destroy the player's soldiers. The player is thus forced [...] "to play with aching, paranoid care, picking away at base defences from as far away as possible, and rubbing up against the save points like a lovely cat finally reunited with its owner. This is not fun." [...] He also complained about the arbitrary death inflicted by exploding barrels [...] "raining down over the entire screen." [...] Cobbet summarised that the departure from the original game meant that Cannon Fodder 3 did not evoke nostalgia and was a [...] "poor substitute" [...] for other action or strategy games. On the other hand, he found the game [...] "admittedly nowhere near as frustrating" [...] as the original. He reflected that it [...] "does have a solid crack at updating the action for a new age, and it's far from as bad as expected" [...] given its obscure development.|$|E
