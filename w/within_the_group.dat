5|$|Other {{analyses}} {{have found}} Paranthodon {{closely related to}} Tuojiangosaurus, Loricatosaurus, and Kentrosaurus within Stegosaurinae.

5|$|After the band's acrimonious {{split with}} their second manager, Allen Klein, in 1971, Jagger {{took control of}} their {{business}} affairs after speaking with an up-and-coming frontman, J. B.

Mick Taylor, Jones' replacement, left the band in December 1974 {{and was replaced by}} Faces guitarist Ronnie Wood in 1975, who also operated as a mediator <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> and between Jagger and Richards in particular.|$|E
5|$|Banksia dentata {{is one of}} four Banksia species {{collected}} by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of Banksia. Within the genus, it is classified in the series Salicinae, a group of species from Australia's eastern states. Genetic studies show it is a basal member (early offshoot) <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna, associated with Pandanus and Melaleuca. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a lignotuber.|$|E

5|$|During the {{recording}} of Henry Cow's sixth album in January 1978, musical differences arose <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> over the prevalence of song-oriented material on the album. Some wanted purely instrumental compositions, while others, including Frith, favoured songs. As a compromise Frith and the band's drummer, Chris Cutler released the songs on an album Hopes and Fears (1978) under the name Art Bears, while the instrumental tracks, plus others recorded later were released on Henry Cow's last album, Western Culture (1979). Art Bears went on to make two more albums of songs.|$|E
5|$|House of Music was {{released}} on November 19, 1996, by Mercury Records. It charted for 31 weeks on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 32, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record also received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised Tony! Toni! Toné!'s musicianship and songwriting. An expected international tour to promote the album did not materialize amid growing tensions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> stemming from creative differences, and they disbanded shortly after its release to pursue separate music careers.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Evans {{acknowledged}} that membership levels had declined but predicted a dramatic turnaround would soon occur. His prediction was inaccurate. This loss of members {{resulted in a}} Klan that was a skeleton of its former self. Historians have attributed this loss of membership to ineptness and hypocrisy {{on the part of}} Klan leadership. McVeigh argues that the Klan's inability to form alliances with other political groups led to the sharp loss of political power and solidarity <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{researchers}} from six different orangutan field sites {{who used the}} same behavioural coding scheme compared the behaviours of the animals from the different sites. They found the different orangutan populations behaved differently. The evidence suggested the differences were cultural: first, {{the extent of the}} differences increased with distance, suggesting cultural diffusion was occurring, and second, the size of the orangutans' cultural repertoire increased according to the amount of social contact present <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> Social contact facilitates cultural transmission.|$|E

5|$|The Samba was not {{the only}} Talbot model to see {{customer}} interest waning; as the 1980s progressed, all Talbots began to sell rather poorly and the range was gradually phased out. Peugeot had been working on developing a replacement for the Samba as late as 1984, which would have been based on the forthcoming Citroen AX, but this project was abandoned as Peugeot took the decision to phase out the Talbot brand, and the Peugeot 205 was proving so popular that Peugeot felt little need for a third car of this size <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

5|$|The band {{unanimously}} {{decided to}} carry on and arrange auditions for new bassists, with a renewed fervor and determination. Several bassists auditioned, but the band picked Lamar Williams, {{an old friend of}} drummer Jai Johanny Johanson's from Gulfport, Mississippi. The band immediately recognized that Williams represented the best of both Oakley's style and his own style, and they were pleased with his easygoing demeanor. The addition of Leavell and Williams to the band brought about renewed passion and uplifted spirits <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is {{not clearly}} understood {{and a number}} of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> and on nuclear markers.|$|E

5|$|The social {{structure}} of the golden-crowned sifaka {{is very similar to}} that of Verreaux's sifaka, both averaging between five and six individuals per group, with a range between three and ten. Unlike the Verreaux's sifaka, group sex ratios are more evenly balanced, consisting of two or more members of both sexes.

5|$|Around this time, {{tensions}} {{began to}} arise between what {{was perceived as}} president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, Boixos Nois. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads, who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from liberalism to fascism, which caused division <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency. Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.|$|E
5|$|As the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist, Reznor was {{considered}} the only constant member and creative force <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> through much of its history. However, this changed in 2016 when Atticus Ross was introduced as a permanent member of Nine Inch Nails, alongside {{the announcement of the}} Not the Actual Events EP. Furthermore, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him onstage. These touring bands comprise a revolving lineup, and often rearrange songs to fit a live setting. Nine Inch Nails often employs thematic visual elements to accompany on stage performances as well, which frequently include elaborate light shows.|$|E
