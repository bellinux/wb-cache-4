500|$|Paul McCartney said {{he came up}} {{with the}} title [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] during one of his first visits to his {{property}} High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road [...] "stretching up into the hills" [...] in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction his personal life was taking in the autumn of 1968, after he had separated from his fiancée Jane Asher, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: [...] "I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining {{it was going to be}} done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> inspiration." ...|$|E

500|$|Under his {{new stage}} name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James), Smith {{was signed by}} Def Jam, {{which led to the}} release of his first {{official}} record, the 12-inch single [...] "I Need a Beat" [...] (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This is what I want to do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E

[...] Unfortunately the plaque seems to be based on a misinterpretation; the following sentence is [...] "But after I was convinced it was the way of God, I submitted to it and joined to the church at Boston."

2500|$|One day {{he asked}} me to do his portrait. I agreed with joy, all the more so because his head and his whole {{personality}} [...] {{seemed to me to be}} perfect models for emphasising the plastic elements I was trying to develop. His face with clearly demarcated surfaces that made up a passionate interplay of facets, his hair in dark masses projecting lightly in waves over his temples, his solidly constructed body - straightaway suggested to me equivalences, echoes , interpenetrations, rhythmic correspondences with the surrounding elements, fields, trees, houses. So I suggested painting him in my garden, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> easily to hand an environment that was highly suitable for my model.|$|E

2500|$|The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an {{important}} one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his Certificat d'études primaires which dispensed him of military servitude {{by order of}} a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father. Not only did his son avoid his fate just like his other sons, {{but he was also}} permitted to pursue his education in the Sadiki College, receiving financial coverage for his studies, which included [...] "shelter, food, clothing, school supplies and even free hammam every 15 days for six years" [...] until he graduated. However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but {{during the first week of}} November 1913, [...] "the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the death of my mother", Bourguiba stated in 1973. [...] "I immediately returned to Monastir <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> my whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] The death of my mother had deeply shaken me. I was indelibly marked". As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le Bœuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo. He stated that he had at least made her proud by obtaining his certificat d'étude primaire.|$|E

60|$|At sunrise I heard {{a cannon}} fired; and shortly {{afterwards}} {{the men in}} the next room gave over snoring for good, and began to rustle over their toilettes.

The inspiration in my work is a blend of design, architecture and textiles.

Those patterns became swatch-like designs for wooden canvases that I imagined on a larger scale. This show is an accumulation of possible interior spaces. Through my work I intend to heighten awareness of our lived environments. I do this by seeking a synthesis between the concerns of studio fine art and those of interior design. [URL]...|$|R
