40|$|<b>Window</b> <b>regulator</b> {{system is}} {{becoming}} a complicated mechatronic system. To obtain and improve understandings of system behaviors, this work developed models and simulations. To realize the target, system simulation with uniformed modeling language, VHDL-AMS, is chosen as tool. At first, dynamic behavior of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> system is studied with method of averaging by a highly abstracted model. As next, main components, e. g. electrical drive, lifting mechanism, door frame and electronic system, are studied and modelled. Parametrization achieves with information from suppliers, existing data bank and measurements. Component models are verified and validated against their measurements. Afterwards, system simulation is built up by assembling component models. As verification and validation, system simulations are compared to measurements. As applications, simulations are used to investigate anti-pinch processes, influence of drum diameter and so on. Depending on the purpose of usage, they can be further improved. As summary, simulation provides support in development of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> systems.

We present the notion of a constraint-based design system as one that explicitlyrepresents and operates upon these constraints. A key feature of constraint-based systems is the separation of problem statement from problem solution techniques. Constraint systems are distinguished from parametric design systems, which do not separate problem statement and solution. Current constraint-based systems are examined, and their strengths and weaknesses discussed. We describe DOC (Design Objects and Constraints), an object-oriented constraint-based design system, and WoRM (<b>Window</b> <b>Regulator</b> Mechanism design), a mechanical design system built upon DOC. Issues requiring further research are discussed, and a description of our own research directions is presented. 2 ̆...|$|R

The {{swinging}} doors which {{are the most common}} are almost the most complicated parts in a car since they not only determine the general guidelines of car style, but also are vital for passenger's safety by protecting humans from side crashes. Comparison between FEA results and targets led to the necessity to split lower opening of front door into two parts to increase stiffness. Also, thickness of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> engine fixing in both front and rear doors are increased. Predetermined values from previous works conducted on a similar existing SUV vehicle were used as targets to be achieved by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of car doors.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to measure the}} effect on financial markets of two important regulatory events in the British telecommunications and gas industries namely the 1991 Duopoly Review and the 1996 Transco Price Review. These events were chosen because {{it is widely believed}} that the individual industry <b>regulators</b> <b>handled</b> them very differently. The expected volatility of the share returns for these two companies is modelled as an ARCH representaion and it is found that the conditional variance of share returns in British Gas was higher after the Transco Price Review. The share returns of British Telecommunications exhibit a lower expected volatility. It is concluded that these results support the contention that the high level of discretion accorded to British regulators may increase the cost of capital for regulated firms. ...|$|R

50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.|$|R

40|$|In {{this report}} a new {{architecture}} of an NMOS Low Drop Out (LDO) Regulator is proposed. It features a new frequency compensation technique to enable better regulation.

The quiescent current of the LDO is 50 μA, with a load capacitor of 470 nF. The LDO is scalable for different maximum load currents without impact on stability.

40|$|Power <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> is a {{mechanism}} for raising and lowering door glass. It consists {{of a set of}} gear, electric motor and door sash channels. For this project, power window design of the Proton Gen- 2 was selected, where the improvement had been made at main arm and slider. The main arm and slider was designed using CAD software. Then, the design was analyzed using FMEA method and FEA (ALGOR) software. These analyses were done to find the best design that can optimize the operation for the stress analysis. There is one design for main arm and two designs for slider had been done. The analysis showed that both of the new designs are better compared to current design. For the both designs, the result showed that when force are applied, the displacement of improvement design that occur is lowest than current design. In conclusion, this improvement can reduce the cost of repairing because the improvement made can hopefully reduce the failure occurrence for that specific power window mechanism...|$|R
40|$|As third {{generation}} (3 G) wireless networks with {{high data rate}} get widely deployed, optimizing TCP performance over these networks would have a broad and significant impact on data application performance.

40|$|In {{industrial}} product development, adaptive mechatronic systems play a rapidly increasing role. Historically, mechatronic systems {{are characterized by}} a coupling of the physical domains software engineering, mechanical engineering, and electronic engineering. But nowadays, also hydraulic, pneumatic and thermal subsystems {{have to be taken}} into account. Such heterogeneous systems provide a large variety of interactions between their subsystems. Hence, a holistic approach to modelling and simulation would be desirable when dealing with development of such systems. In the case of existence of adaptive components, the challenge becomes much more complex. Now, one has not only to deal with different physical domains but also with variable model structures. Figure 1 shows an example of a <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> (left) and a driving motor (right) belonging to it. Because of environmental influences, functional restrictions or disorders may occur. Hence, it is worth to consider an adaptive system to increase robustness of functionality (adaptive controller, additional drive, heating system etc.). This may illustrate that a holistic approach is essential for design of adaptive mechatronic systems...|$|R

40|$|A self {{regulating}} profession, such as nursing, {{has to have}} {{in place}} systems which deal with practitioners considered unfit to practise. In addition, students studying to enter the profession may also be subject to systems to address concerns about their professional suitability. While the NMC have left it up to each Higher Education Institution (HEI) to identify the systems which should be in place for students, there is a body of case law and statutory legislation which governs how the NMC deals with fitness to practise amongst qualified nurses and midwives. This paper examines the content of fitness to practise policies in place across HEIs and compares this with how the <b>regulator</b> <b>handles</b> fitness to practise cases. Data was collected using unobtrusive methods and was analysed using content analysis. The results suggest that many HEI's policies have significant gaps which may result in challenges to decision making.
