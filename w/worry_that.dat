5|$|Considerable debate exists {{about the}} size of the rebound in energy {{efficiency}} and the relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation. Some dismiss the paradox, while others <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> it may be self-defeating to pursue sustainability by increasing energy efficiency. Environmental economists have proposed that efficiency gains be coupled with conservation policies that keep the cost of use the same (or higher) to avoid the Jevons paradox. Conservation policies (such as cap and trade) do not display the paradox, and can be used to control the rebound effect.|$|E

5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about whether}} the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, and of {{the relevance of the}} Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E

5|$|Kristin Lemmerman of CNN {{said that}} it is not great literature: 'Her prose has more in common with your typical beach-blanket fare and the {{beginning}} contained too much recap to introduce characters to new readers, although Rowling quickly gets back on track, introducing readers to a host of well-drawn new characters.' Writing for Salon.com, Charles Taylor was generally positive about the change of mood and development of characters.
