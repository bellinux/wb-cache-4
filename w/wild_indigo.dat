6000|$|The valley, winding {{through the}} red and green hills, was dull and warm till the cool morning easter, which usually set about eight a.m., began to blow. The effect of {{increasing}} altitude showed itself in the vegetation. We now saw {{for the first time}} the Kidád (Astragalus), with horrid thorns and a flower resembling from afar the gooseberry: it is common on the Hismá and in the South Country. The Kahlá (Echium), a bugloss, a borage-like plant, with viscous leaves and flowers of two colours,--the young light-pink and the old dark-blue,--everywhere beautified the sands, and reminded me of the Istrian hills, where it is plentiful as in the Nile Valley. The Jarad-thorn was not in bloom; and the same was the case with the hyacinth (Dipcadi erythraeum), so abundant in the Hisma', which some of us mistook for a [...] "wild onion." [...] The Zayti (Lavandula) had just donned its pretty azure bloom. There were Reseda, <b>wild</b> <b>indigo,</b> Tribulus (terrestris), the blue Aristida, the pale Stipa, and the Bromus grass, red and yellow. The Ratam (spartium), with delicate white and pink blossoms, was a reminiscence of Tenerife and its glorious crater; whilst a little higher up, the amene Cytisus, flowering with gold, carried our thoughts back to the far past.|$|E

50|$|Baptisia australis, {{commonly}} known as blue <b>wild</b> <b>indigo</b> or blue false indigo, is a flowering plant in the family Fabaceae (legumes). It is toxic. It is native to much {{of central and eastern}} North America and is particularly common in the Midwest, but it has also been introduced well beyond its natural range. Naturally it can be found growing wild at the borders of woods, along streams or in open meadows. It often has difficulty seeding itself in its native areas due to parasitic weevils that enter the seed pods, making the number of viable seeds very low.|$|E
50|$|This plant grows {{only in the}} tallgrass prairie, {{mainly in}} dry areas. The soils may be gravelly, sandy, and/or calcareous, and are {{generally}} well-drained. Other plants in the area include big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), yellow Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis), porcupine grass (Stipa spartea), Penn sedge (Carex pennsylvanica), copper-shouldered sedge (Carex bicknellii), sand-bracted sedge (Carex muhlenbergii), flowering spurge (Euphorbia corollata), prairie phlox (Phlox pilosa), lead plant (Amorpha canescens), rough blazing star (Liatris aspera), purple prairie clover (Dalea purpurea), showy goldenrod (Solidago speciosa), grass-leaved goldenrod (S. graminifolia), prairie gentian (Gentiana puberulenta), hoary puccoon (Lithospermum canescens), blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium albidum), cream <b>wild</b> <b>indigo</b> (Baptisia leucophaea), flax-leaved aster (Ionactis linariifolius), silky aster (Symphyotrichum sericeum), pale prairie coneflower (Echinacea pallida), milkwort (Polygona polygama), prairie violet (Viola pedatifida), and bird's foot violet (Viola pedata). It can be found alongside its relative, Lespedeza capitata, {{and it has been}} known to hybridize with it, though this is rare.|$|E
40|$|Historically {{the natural}} habitat for this species was grassy {{openings}} dominated by Andropogon spp. and burned areas in oak barrens and savannas with sandy/rocky soils. Today, the species occurs mostly in open habitats created and maintained by human {{activities such as}} powerline and railroad right of ways, along sand or gravel roads in dry woods and barrens habitats, and around rock outcrops and old gravel pits. Active roadways with host plants are not good habitat because annual spring mowing will kill the larvae, and vehicle traffic will drive off adults. Nearby tree cover is an important habitat component, because it provides shelter from the wind and sun. Adult males tend to congregate in open grassy areas with food plants in cool to moderate weather where they defend grass clumps, but they often move to shady woodland edges at about 82 °F. Frosted elfins occur in two population types, one with caterpillars that feed on lupine (Lupinus perennis), {{and the other with}} caterpillars that feed on <b>wild</b> <b>indigo</b> (Baptisia tinctoria). All populations in Pennsylvania are thought to be <b>wild</b> <b>indigo</b> feeders, even if lupine is also available. Adults are usually found very close to <b>wild</b> <b>indigo</b> plants (e. g. ...|$|E
40|$|Leguminous {{seeds are}} a {{concentrated}} source of nutrition (Brashier 2000). In a nutrient-poor habitat, these seeds are important resources {{for many of}} the animal species residing there. Several insect predators are known to feed on Baptisia seeds.

The common name ""wild indigo"" specifies Indigofera will L., I. suffruticosa Mill. (legitimate name) and I. truxillensis Kunth (legitimate name) that are very similar due to their external morphology. This work analyzed diagnostic characteristics of {{seeds and seedlings}} of these species since such features are widely used in taxonomic approaches within Leguminosae. We studied surface features and morpho-anatomy of seeds and cotyledons with scanning electronic microscopy and light microscopy, and described seedling phases. Although seedlings are similar, seed characteristics (size, shape, surface ornamentation, shape of the hilum and embryo size) and cotyledon characteristics (shape, trichome ornamentation, organization of spongy parenchyma along central veins and metabolite distribution in the tissues) have diagnostic features for the species. I. anil differs from I. suffruticosa in its larger seeds and acuminate-margined cotyledons. I. truxillensis is recognized by its cylindrical seeds and kidney-shaped cotyledons with large oil drops. We assume that the characteristics examined, plus fruit morphology and foliar anatomy suggest that I. anil, I. suffruticosa and I. truxillensis should not be synonymized...|$|E
40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>Indigo</b> or Purple Tephrosia or fish poison occurs {{throughout}} the Indian subcontinent. It {{is widely used}} {{in the treatment of}} inflammation, diabetes, rheumatism, asthma, diarrhoea and many other ailments. But so far the pharmacognostic standardization has not been reported for its proper identification. Hence the present study is a pharmacognosy work carried out for the root part. This may help in the identification of the plant species. A thin transverse section, powder microscopy, measurement of the dimensions of cell structures, fluorescence analysis and physico chemical parameters were conducted for the root. From the TS, the secondary xylem fibres and vessels were found to be the tissues of diagnostic importance. The xylem vessels were of two types: narrow and long; broad and short. The important characters in the powdered microscopy were vessel elements, fibres and xylem parenchyma cells. The different fluorescent light shades were obtained under short and long UV light for both powder as well as the extracts of the root. The proximate analysis values were also obtained in a satisfactory way. Combining all these data a suitable root profile for plant can be constructed which may help in the identification of quality of the plant part...|$|E
40|$|Advisor: Keith SummervilleCollaborative {{efforts are}} often {{important}} in achieving ecological goals. We partnered with SE Polk High School {{to create a}} peer-mentoring research team with two goals: (1) to build environmental education into the high school biology classroom and (2) to ascertain if ecological restoration protects species diversity. In the summer of 2009, we sampled a 77 acre restored prairie easement at Metro Park East. This inventory allowed us to generate a set of baseline data {{to test the hypothesis}} that ecosystem restoration succeeds at protecting native species, even in an urban landscape. To produce our inventory, we created a multi-arrayed sampling methodology, based on non-lethal techniques. We used track identification, Sherman live trapping and drift fencing to collect vertebrates. For invertebrates, we used aerial netting to collect samples. Plants were identified when in bloom. We sampled a total of 68 animal species and 46 plant species. Nine species that are in regional decline were discovered: bobolink, dickcissle, sedge wren, grasshopper sparrow, yellow-billed cuckoo, red-headed woodpecker, bull snake, ring-necked snake and <b>wild</b> <b>indigo</b> duskywing. These represent 6 birds, 2 snakes, and one butterfly. Our results also allowed us to create a set of future erosion and invasive species management strategies for Metro Park East. Future work will attempt to experimentally increase habitat for the nine species of regional conservative concern. Drake University, Environmental Science and Policy Progra...|$|E
