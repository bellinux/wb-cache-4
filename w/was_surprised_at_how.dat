5|$|Lars' {{inclusion}} in Naruto Shipuuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 was initially conceived of by CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama. In 2009, Matsuyama {{read in a}} Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine that Lars' third costume had been designed by Kishimoto and thought he {{should be included in}} Ultimate Ninja Storm 2. As a result, Matsuyama approached Tekken 6 producer Suguru Sasaki and his team and asked them to include Lars in the game using Kishimoto's outfit. Once this was approved, the Tekken staff started assisting CyberConnect2 to adjust Lars' moves to fit the other characters in the Naruto game. When the work was concluded, Matsuyama <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well Lars fitted in with the game's cast.|$|E
5|$|Mauve took Van Gogh on as {{a student}} and {{introduced}} him to watercolour, which he worked on for the next month before returning home for Christmas. He quarrelled with his father, refusing to attend church, and left for The Hague. Within a month Van Gogh and Mauve fell out, possibly over the viability of drawing from plaster casts. Van Gogh could afford to hire only people from the street as models, a practice of which Mauve seems to have disapproved. In June Van Gogh suffered a bout of gonorrhoea and spent three weeks in hospital. Soon after, he first painted in oils, bought with money borrowed from Theo. He liked the medium, and spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. He wrote that he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> good the results were.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> easy it was to get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, {{would be good for the}} country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

500|$|In {{the other}} semi-final Maguire beat Lee 6–4 in an error-strewn match which lasted four hours. After winning {{the first two}} frames Maguire lost the next three, but [...] "kept his cool" [...] to seal the victory. Maguire said the match was a [...] "battle" [...] and that he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> badly his opponents had played in the tournament, while Lee said he [...] "just blew up" [...] and that, [...] "When you’re as poor as that you get into such {{a state of mind}} that you can’t think straight".|$|E
500|$|Mills {{said that}} she liked to cook {{traditional}} vegetarian Christmas dinners for McCartney and as many of his family as possible, and that McCartney had encouraged her {{to give up her}} self-confessed addiction to chocolate and Snickers bars. When asked by chat-show host Larry King in 2003, how life was with McCartney, Mills replied [...] "Great, really great", but also {{said that she}} <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> tidy McCartney was: [...] "He always cleans up before the cleaner comes. So I said for a while that's crazy, but what's good is if I cook the dinner, he'll clean everything up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} and art {{design of the}} game was praised. Brandon Justice from Electronic Gaming Monthly stated that he expected the game to look [...] "bland" [...] due to its setting, but he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> much variety and color there was. The game's level design and vibrant colors were also praised. Critics agreed that the game's setting, Dubai, was excellent and well-realized; some critics praised Yager for adding different details to the game's world. The terrain and landscape was praised for being interesting, unique, and creating [...] "fantastic set piece battles". Some commented that the sand mechanic sometimes became gimmicky. Many criticized the game's poor textures and the poor rendering of cutscenes.|$|E

She is still afraid to tell anyone, even Hannah, about her birth, though.|$|R
500|$|While {{briefing}} Saswata Chatterjee {{about his}} character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh {{used the phrase}} [...] "Binito Bob" [...] (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of rubbing his nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers. Ghosh <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them {{at any time and}} any place.|$|E
500|$|That convention, in May 1776, {{unanimously}} instructed Jefferson {{and other}} Virginia delegates to Congress to seek [...] "a clear and full Declaration of Independency". At the same time, the convention resolved {{to pass a}} declaration of rights. Due to ill-health, Mason did not arrive until May 18, 1776, after the vote, but was appointed to a committee led by Archibald Cary, which was to compose a declaration of rights and constitution. Mason was skeptical that the thirty-person Cary Committee could collectively compose anything worthwhile, but <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> quickly it moved—though his membership {{had a role in}} that speed. On May 24, convention president Edmund Pendleton wrote to Jefferson about the committee's deliberations, [...] "as Colo. Mason seems to have the ascendancy in the great work, I have Sanguine hopes it will be framed so as to Answer it's [...] end, Prosperity to the Community and Security to Individuals".|$|E
500|$|During the {{development}} of the series' pilot chapter, Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin's speech patterns, settling for a [...] "slangy" [...] one. For {{the final version of the}} first Romantic Story, Watsuki adjusted the dialogue; in his view, he made Kenshin sound [...] "more as I prefer him now". Nevertheless, Kenshin was concerned about how Kenshin's manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent. Watsuki added Kenshin's trademark [...] as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency [...] "huh". Watsuki notes that he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> well it caught on, and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series. Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin more 30 years old; his editor commented that it was strange that the main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age, so he instead made him 28 years old.|$|E
5000|$|The overall {{marketing}} {{theme is}} that parents can feed their children [...] "fun" [...] processed {{foods that are}} based on real fruit. [...] Studies of American mothers have shown that the mothers <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> sweet Fruit Roll-Ups are and how little fruit is present in them. For example, the strawberry flavor contains no strawberries, and the only ingredient derived from fruit is the sugar present in concentrated pear juice.|$|R

500|$|Leon {{was created}} by Hideki Kamiya as a {{contrast}} to Chris Redfield from the original Resident Evil, who he felt was the [...] "blunt, tough-guy type". Though Kamiya admitted {{that while he was}} a fan of characters like Chris, as it had already been done, he opted to take Leon's development in a different direction. He <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> popular Leon had become, praising his later evolution into a [...] "cool looking guy" [...] for Resident Evil 4 and adding that he [...] "fell in love all over again". Leon was created for Resident Evil 2 as the staff wanted to use a character who had no experience with terrifying situations in contrast to using returning protagonists. While he was originally designed as a veteran police officer, he was changed to a rookie after the original version of Resident Evil 2 (popularly known as [...] "Resident Evil 1.5") had been scrapped. Leon's design was inspired by the bloodhound of Capcom artist Isao Ohishi.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher broke into tears when asked if matching Ayrton Senna's number of victories {{meant a lot to}} him. He later regained his composure and spoke about how important it was to maintain the life of the engine at the circuit. Michael Schumacher revealed that the cause of his emotion was of him thinking about Senna's death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and said that he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> the media reacted to the moment which said that Schumacher [...] "was human after all". Häkkinen revealed that his team made modifications to his car at his pit stop which contributed to him setting the fastest lap of the race. He also admitted that he was unable to catch Michael Schumacher due to the presence of the two Minardis which cost him time. Ralf Schumacher said he was not worried from being challenged by Verstappen and Zonta during the event because of the Williams's quick pace. He also was confident that Williams had confirmed itself as the third strongest team in Formula One.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{intended}} for the character to make only two guest appearances in the third season, which left Ferris [...] "a bit surprised and [...] " [...] at Ellen's lack of involvement. However, her initial return was scrapped due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and the actress declined a guest appearance in the finale because the lackluster offer [...] "could cost [...] money and work". The opportunity to return for the fifth season surprised her due to the large time span since her previous appearance. Though she expected her character to eventually die, a devastated Ferris <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> quickly it occurred. However, after speaking to director Phil Sgricciahe told her that Ellen was the [...] "perfect fodder" [...] for the [...] "kick" [...] that the series needed, and would [...] "go out {{in a blaze of}} glory"the actress came to realize that the character's death made sense. Ellen's last words to Dean"Kick it in the ass."was an improvised homage to the late Supernatural executive producer and director Kim Manners, who had died the year before and would often recite the phrase before filming a scene.|$|E

500|$|The Australia Council's {{decision}} to fund Escape from Woomera was poorly received. The game received heavy criticism before development even began. Australia's Minister for Immigration, Philip Ruddock, {{released a statement}} saying that the [...] "decision reflects poorly upon the Australia Council and its judgement, that the organisation should lend its name to the promotion of unlawful behaviour". Kate Wild, in a 2013 interview, recalled that she <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> strongly Ruddock attacked the game, a reaction she attributed to the government being sensitive over the issue of detainee treatment. The leader of the Australian Human Rights Commission, Dr. Sev Ozdowski, released a strongly worded statement accusing the game of misconstruing asylum seekers as criminals, and saying that [...] "The idea of using issues in detention for entertainment is simply sick." [...] Chairman Michael Snelling of the New Media Arts Board, the branch of the Australia Council that granted the development money, defended the {{decision to}} fund Escape from Woomera, stating that the game's purpose was not to promote crime. He characterised the team's application for funding as both strong and closely aligned with the New Media Arts Board's goal of promoting cross-disciplinary media.|$|E
500|$|The band's lead guitarist, Roger Garcia, {{had gotten}} married and parted Selena y Los Dinos after they {{released}} their second studio album, Ven Conmigo, in September 1990. Principal record producer and bass guitarist of the group, A.B. Quintanilla, discovered then 17-year old Chris Pérez, {{who at the}} time was the guitarist for Tejano music singer Shelly Lares. Pérez auditioned {{to be part of the}} group, finding A.B.'s music production style to be his original inspiration in wanting to become part of Selena y Los Dinos. At first, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.—the manager of the group, and the father of A.B., Suzette Quintanilla, and Selena—dismissed Pérez, seeing him as more of a rocker and found him to be unequipped for a Tejano band. Betty Cortina, editor-at-large for People magazine, stated that Pérez was the antithesis of Abraham's [...] "clean cut good kids" [...] image. A.B persuaded Abraham that Pérez was capable of performing Tejano music, adding that Pérez's rocker image was harmless. Pérez was then hired as the band's guitarist after the band finished recording Ven Conmigo. Pérez <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> the group worked during the entire production of Entre a Mi Mundo. During pre-production, keyboardist Ricky Vela would sequence the music—Pérez was surprised by how much importance the group put on this—while A.B. would work alongside Vela with any technical problems they faced, as well as choosing the compositions that would be recorded by Selena.|$|E

Christina Lee of website Idolator wrote {{that there are two}} songs on the album which show [...] "how ubiquitous she's [...] become", [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary" [...] and [...] "Half of Me". A reviewer for Billboard <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> many [...] "heartfelt ballads" [...] are included on the album, and listed [...] "Half of Me" [...] as one of the examples. Michael Gallucci for PopCrush wrote that [...] "Half of Me", along with [...] "Pour It Up", are songs for the [...] "haters". He further wrote that the singer pushes the track as she has an [...] "agenda", but criticised the use of [...] "fuck", which he points out as being used in the majority of Unapologetics tracks. Upon the release of Unapologetic, [...] "Half of Me" [...] charted in several territories due to strong digital downloads. It debuted on the Irish Singles Chart at number 84 on November 22, 2012.

500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here because so much of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|E
