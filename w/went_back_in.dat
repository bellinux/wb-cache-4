5|$|In the 1961–62 NBA season, {{the aging}} Cousy {{slowly began to}} fade statistically, {{averaging}} 15.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists, and was voted into the All-NBA Second Team after ten consecutive First Team nominations. Still, he enjoyed a satisfying postseason, winning the 1962 NBA Finals after 4–3 battles against two upcoming teams, the Philadelphia Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers. The Finals series against the Lakers was especially dramatic, because Lakers guard Frank Selvy failed to make a last-second buzzer beater in Game 7 which would have won the title. Finally, in the 1962–63 NBA season, {{the last of his}} career, Cousy averaged 13.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 6.8 assists, and collected one last All-Star and All-NBA Second Team nomination. In the 1963 NBA Finals, the Celtics again won 4–2 against the Lakers, and Cousy finished his career on a high note: {{in the fourth quarter of}} Game 6, Cousy sprained an ankle and had to be helped to the bench. He <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> with Boston up 1. Although he did not score again, his was credited with providing an emotional lift that carried the Celtics to victory, 112–109. The game ended with Cousy throwing the ball into the rafters.|$|E

25|$|However, he did {{obtain a}} year-long {{position}} for the 1825/26 season at the Teatro Carolino in Palermo, where he became musical director (as well teaching at the Conservatory). There, he staged his 1824 version of L'ajo nell'imbarazzo {{as well as his}} new opera Alahor in Granata. But overall, his experience in Palermo {{does not appear to have}} been pleasant, mainly because of the poorly managed theatre, the continual indisposition of singers, or their failure to appear on time. These issues caused a delay until January 1827 for the premiere of Alahor, after which he <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Naples in February, but with no specific commitments until midsummer.|$|E
