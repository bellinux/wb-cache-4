40|$|We {{present the}} WebTeach system, {{currently}} {{used at the}} Engineering Faculty, University of Florence, Italy. The system is composed by three parts: WebCheck, a web database interface for test management; WebTest, a multiple-choice quiz generation system and <b>WebWrite,</b> a collaborative web publishing tool. WebCheck is used for managing subscriptions to tests and publication of results. It allows teachers to organize exam sessions and students to consult {{the results of their}} tests by a web interface. Most of tests are generated using WebTest, which is a suite of perl libraries and front-end applications for the generation and automatic evaluation of multiple-choice quizzes. <b>WebWrite</b> is an implementation of the TWiki system, which appears as a web site where all pages can be edited using a simple syntax, resembling e-mail text. <b>WebWrite</b> is used for publishing didactic material and will become the generic interface-managing tool of the WebTeach system...|$|R

40|$|The WebTeach {{project has}} been started in 1999 as a {{prototype}} to handle our exams. At this moment it consists of three main components: WebCheck, handling exam sessions through a web interface, <b>WebWrite,</b> web based tool for teaching on-line, and WebTest, for the generation and correction of multiple-choice quizzes. The system, described in the following pages, is now used by more than 70 teachers and handles 180 subjects, 800 exams and 5500 students. Despite these ﬁgures, the project keeps its prototypical ﬂavor and it’s improved every day following teachers’ and students’ suggestions. The system is developed using only free software. It’s possible to cooperate to its development, adapt it to special needs and use it in other frameworks. The following extensions are planned: • Usage of SMS messages for teacher-student communication, {{to be added to}} the e-mail messages already used. • Development of a system to collect tests’ results through optical reader/SMS/email/web and development of a graphic interface for quiz generation. • Management of class reservation/usage. • Development of a system which will generate/conﬁgure automatically a course, given a simple speciﬁcation of: - pre/post requisites of each lesson, - the target knowledge produced by the course, - the initial/current knowledge of the single student. The <b>WebWrite</b> system has been chosen also to teach on-line to jailed students through the “Polo Universitario Penitenziario”...|$|R
