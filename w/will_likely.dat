5|$|As the Sun expands, it will {{swallow the}} planets Mercury and Venus. Earth's fate is less clear; {{although}} the Sun will envelop Earth's current orbit, the star's loss of mass (and thus weaker gravity) {{will cause the}} planets' orbits to move farther out. If it were only for this, Venus and Earth would probably escape incineration, but a 2008 study suggests that Earth <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> be swallowed up {{as a result of}} tidal interactions with the Sun's weakly bound outer envelope.|$|E

The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire.

It {{should also be noted}} that they appear to be sensitive to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} of the storm, a high surf advisory and a tropical storm watch were issued for the Hawaiian Islands. Officials urged residents {{to stock up on}} supplies and they closed beaches. Even though the Central Pacific Hurricane Center remarked that that watch <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> be upgraded into a hurricane warning, this failed to occur; instead, the watch was discontinued on July 20 because meteorologists were now expecting the storm to pass south of the island chain.|$|E

5|$|Although {{increasing}} {{echelons of}} the scale correspond to stronger winds, the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects. Lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms, depending on factors such as local terrain, population density and total rainfall. For instance, a Category2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area <b>will</b> <b>likely</b> do more damage than a large Category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region. In fact, tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties, especially from flooding and landslides.|$|E

Temperatures {{have increased in}} the last century while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
