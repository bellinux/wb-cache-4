500|$|The Coens decided {{early in}} the writing process to include the picture as a key element in the room. [...] "Our intention," [...] Joel {{explained}} later, [...] "was that the room would have very little decoration, that the walls would be bare and that the windows would offer no view of any particular interest. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> only opening on the exterior world to be this picture. It seemed important to us to create a feeling of isolation." ...|$|E
500|$|Starbreeze {{intended}} for Escape from Butcher Bay to feature more complex role-playing game systems, but feedback from Diesel and game testers dissuaded them. Starbreeze senior producer Peter Wanat said, [...] "We tried {{to limit the}} number of really hard or really intricate RPG elements, and that was a choice because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> game to be playable." [...] Other removed features include an electric bullwhip for the guard Abbott, and a 25-minute final boss fight. A PlayStation 2 version that was in development was cancelled so the company could focus on the Xbox version.|$|E
500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of those pieces and inspirations. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E

500|$|First-time {{director}} Conran incorporated many {{references to}} classic genre films {{into his own}} movie: [...] "The work of those artists and writers from the pulps and Golden Age of Comic Books like Airboy was really the template for us. To some extent we stole from it, to some extent we expanded on it [...] hopefully we added enough of our own sensibility. We tried to approach it almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work [...] those pieces and inspirations. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> film to feel like a lost film of that era." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Elsa is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} child {{at the beginning of the}} film, animators wanted the first glimpse of her powers to reflect her innocent and fanciful state of mind at the time. This included giving her first snowflakes a simple design. Her snow and ice patterns later become more intricate and complex when she is an adult. Co-effects supervisor Marlon West elaborated, [...] "When Elsa finally lets go and really starts owning her cryokinetic abilities, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> ice and snow that she make to get across the idea that Elsa has now grown up and become this beautiful, elegant, confident and powerful young woman." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{deviation}} from the previous films, the Spinosaurus is considered the primary antagonist: Johnston stated, [...] "A lot of dinosaurs have a very similar silhouette to the T-Rex ... and <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> audience to instantly recognize this as something else." [...] The silhouette of the Spinosaurus {{is also on the}} poster behind the Pteranodon, taking the place of the Tyrannosaurus which had been used in the previous films' posters. Baryonyx was originally considered to be the [...] "big bad" [...] before Spinosaurus was chosen, and early concept posters reflected this. Within film dialogue, Billy interprets the animal encountered as a Baryonyx or Suchomimus, but Dr. Grant corrects his analysis based on its size and its sail.|$|E

500|$|Orci also said, [...] "The comic has {{the themes}} of enemies uniting to fight a common enemy and has the setting of that {{specific}} time period, so we kept the inspiration from all of that. In terms of {{the specifics of the}} story and who these characters are, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> audience to be surprised and to not feel like they've already seen everything if they were fans of the comic. So, while the themes and the setting and many of the elements are a great inspiration, the story is completely adapted and translated for live action." [...] The aliens were loosely based on the Anunnaki gods of Zecharia Sitchin's interpretation of the Babylonian religion, who have a distinct interest in gold.|$|E
500|$|<b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> {{video to}} show her without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not have done in the past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever <b>we</b> <b>wanted...</b> <b>the</b> emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, Stapleton and Paul Tassi of Forbes both {{took issue}} to Rocksteady's {{marketing}} of the Arkham Knight as an original character, as the moniker was original but the {{character in the}} role was not. Stapleton felt {{the problem was that}} the marketing for the character indicated it was a [...] "big mystery" [...] to his identity, but any [...] "moderately knowledgeable Batman fan could reasonably" [...] deduce the identity: [...] "We all already knew who the Arkham Knight was; we were just hoping it wasn’t true because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> original story we’d been promised." [...] Tassi criticized Rocksteady for promising a new character and insisting the identity [...] "would shock and amaze us all" [...] when it turned out to essentially be [...] "a renamed and recostumed version of a character that has already existed for years." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1975, punk {{was being}} used to {{describe}} acts {{as diverse as the}} Patti Smith Group, the Bay City Rollers, and Bruce Springsteen. As the scene at New York's CBGB club attracted notice, a name was sought for the developing sound. Club owner Hilly Kristal called the movement [...] "street rock"; John Holmstrom credits Aquarian magazine with using punk [...] "to describe what was going on at CBGBs". Holmstrom, McNeil, and Ged Dunn's magazine Punk, which debuted at the end of 1975, was crucial in codifying the term. [...] "It was pretty obvious that the word was getting very popular", Holmstrom later remarked. [...] "We figured we'd take the name before anyone else claimed it. We {{wanted to get rid of}} the bullshit, strip it down to rock 'n' roll. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> fun and liveliness back." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 5, 2012, Kristen Bell {{was cast}} to voice the adult Anna.

[...] musical sequence. Additionally, Agatha Lee Monn, daughter of the film's director Jennifer Lee, portrayed teenage Anna in this song. Lee explained about these casting decisions, [...] "We really {{wanted to use the}} first two verses of this song to show you Anna's personality. And <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> singing to be done by real-sounding kids, not necessarily Broadway kids." [...] Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel (who voiced Elsa in the film) had both auditioned for Rapunzel in Tangled and had already known each other, but they did not get the part.|$|E

Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule.

500|$|The {{other members}} of Blaster Masters {{development}} team created the system of alternating between the 2D platforming and top-down modes. During the game's planning, the team {{came up with the}} idea that SOPHIA would eventually be able to go anywhere in the game, including navigating on the ceilings and walls. The team created the top-down portions to allow Jason to shoot in all directions and to enable them to [...] "express large bosses that really had an impact". They did not want to design the gameplay in a linear progression; instead they drew inspiration from and were influenced by Nintendo's Metroid to create a game that allowed players to freely move between levels. According to Iwata: [...] "We wanted the player to experience the feeling of excitement that comes from discovering something after endeavoring through a difficult search, which is why we composed a map that allowed the player to move freely between different areas. We really put a great deal of thought into that element of the game design and, I mean this in the best possible way, but <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> player to have to struggle." ...|$|E
500|$|Nava praised Beyoncé's {{acting in}} the commercial, stating: [...] "She's so scorchingly hot that even when she touches the floor with her {{dangerous}} high-heels, she kind of sets her world on fire." [...] In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Beyoncé described the sexual tone of the video stating: [...] "'It's called Heat, so <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> ads to be really steamy and dewy. My sexiest moments are when I'm just {{getting out of the}} tub or the shower and I'm clean, so I wanted to incorporate that in the ads. The dress was this liquid-y satin. The song Fever I did years ago and always loved it. [...] I got to sing it a bit more whispery, more natural." [...] "Fever" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé on two different occasions. Knowles first recorded her version of [...] "Fever" [...] on September 9, 2003 for her film The Fighting Temptations. Before the release of Heat, she recorded [...] "Fever" [...] again for the fragrance's television commercial. After the launch of Heat, the latter version of the song was officially released as a promotional single to the US iTunes Store through Columbia Records on February 8, 2010, to promote the fragrance. It was made available digitally in the United Kingdom the following day.|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} the group running, singing, dancing, and creating mischief at an eccentric bohemian party. Among their antics is Chisholm's back handspring {{on one of}} the tables. Because the video needed to be taken in one shot, the group rehearsed the routine several times through the night, while a steadycam operator followed them. About the experience, Halliwell wrote: [...] "The video I remember as being very chaotic and cold. It wasn't very controlled—we didn't want it to be. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> camera to capture the madness of the Spice Girls". Virgin's executives were horrified with the final result: [...] "the girls were freezing cold, which showed itself in various different ways", Ashley Newton recalled. The video was later banned in some parts of Asia because of Brown's erect nipples. Additionally, the lighting was considered too dark and gloomy; the best takes showed the girls bumping with the furniture and looking behind them. Virgin was concerned that old people appeared on the video, the part when they jump up on the table, and Halliwell's showgirl outfit would be considered too threatening by music channels. Virgin immediately opened discussions about a re-shoot of the video or creating an alternate one for the US, but the group refused. The video was sent for trial airing in its original form.|$|E
500|$|Kramer Morgenthau, {{who worked}} with Taylor on Game of Thrones, was brought in as the {{director}} of photography. Morgenthau said, [...] "We wanted a grittier, boots-on-the-ground feeling, inspired by what Alan and I had done on Game of Thrones. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> realms to feel grounded, like a real place, {{while at the same time}} respecting the magical 'planet of the Gods' feeling and theme." [...] Thor: The Dark World was Morgenthau's first time shooting a feature film digitally. For the film, Morgenthau chose the Arri Alexa Plus, although he tested with the Sony F65 but found the Alexa to be more pleasing. In addition to the Alexa, Red Epic and Canon EOS 5D Mark II cameras were used for second unit filming. With the Alexa, Morgenthau used Panavision anamorphic lenses. Morgenthau said, [...] "The lenses brought some of the magic and mystery of photochemical back to digital, that big-movie look." [...] Morgenthau also stated that Thor: The Dark World was easily the most technically complex project that he has worked but said, [...] "It's all the same concept and the same principles as in a smaller film. You just scale it up. You do a lot more prep. We had three months of prep and loads of time to pre-rig stages. Part of it is having a really good crew—it's definitely not a one-man show." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} Monday, December 11, 1989, and lasted for seven days. The episode was {{directed}} by David Carson, who had only filmed one other Next Generation episode before [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped {{because he had no}} preconceptions about how episodes should be directed. Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe, Carson wanted to emphasize the toll that decades of war had taken on the crew and the bridge. [...] "Picard really looked tired and worn and like a battle-weary commander, and that's what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> bridge to look like—a battle weary bridge. I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights, a lot of dark blues, making it very much more moody", he said. To heighten the impact of the physical set changes, Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots. [...] "It was my intention to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low-angle lighting; basically, to do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot." [...] The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual {{in order to reduce the}} depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel. The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified to prevent the scene from, in Carson's words, looking [...] "like a hotel lobby".|$|E
