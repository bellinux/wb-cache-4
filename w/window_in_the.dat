5|$|Nearly all {{structures}} {{within an}} 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including {{the entire community}} of Richmond, were obliterated.

Hardly a <b>window</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city proper survived the blast. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of Mi'kmaq First Nations people {{who had lived in}} the Tufts Cove area for generations.|$|E

5|$|The first prior was Aldwyn, {{who founded}} the monastery on his bishop's advice, and by 1135 the monastery {{included}} thirty monks.
