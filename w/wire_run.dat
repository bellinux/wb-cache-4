25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper. In its {{simplest}} manifestation, it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can for example, be made of a chain with a metal <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> through it. Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} years of its existence, prior to the opening of the fourth canal, {{navigation}} was only possible to {{the east side of the}} bridge. Electrical power to operate the bridge was supplied via an overhead cable from the west shore. [...] With the opening of the fourth canal, there was navigable water on both sides making an overhead wire impossible. [...] Since the bridge was designed to have the power fed from overhead and not beneath, an underwater cable was run from the shore to the more northerly concrete fender (which protected the ends of the bridge from ships when it swung). [...] A pole was erected on each [...] fender, and a guy <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> between them directly over the bridge. [...] The power cable was suspended from this guy wire to reach the top-hat-shaped device in the middle of the bridge which transferred the power to the rotating bridge. [...] This top-hat, and the two poles on the fenders, are still visible today. [...] This is a relatively unusual method of providing power to a swing bridge.|$|E

50|$|To {{protect the}} engine inlets, another <b>wire</b> <b>ran</b> diagonally from the {{nose to the}} slipper tank on each wing.|$|R
50|$|Nearly all biplane {{aircraft}} {{have their}} {{upper and lower}} planes connected by interplane struts, with the upper wing running across above the fuselage and connected to it by shorter cabane struts. These struts divide the wings into bays which are braced by diagonal wires. The flying <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> upwards and outwards from the lower wing, while the landing <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> downwards and outwards from the upper wing. The resulting combination of struts and wires is a rigid box girder-like structure independent of its fuselage mountings.|$|R
50|$|In Milan, most tram lines cross its {{circular}} trolleybus line once or twice. Trolleybus and tram <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> {{parallel in}} streets such as viale Stelvio and viale Tibaldi.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had great}} fun with some Dervishes this morning,' said the Guebre. 'I met one asking alms with a <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> through his cheek,[58] so I caught another, bored his nose, and tied them both together!' ...|$|E
60|$|Down {{the turret}} stair she ran quickly, letting the <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> from the wheel which she carried carefully, and, passing {{out of the}} hall door, hurried down the avenue with all her speed. She soon reached her own gate, ran down the avenue, and with her key opened the iron door leading to the well-hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "Private wire from New York," [...] said Mr. Merrick, as {{the girls}} hesitated how to meet this problem. [...] "I'll arrange with the {{telegraph}} company to-morrow to have {{an extension of the}} <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> over from Chazy Junction. Then we'll hire an operator--a girl, of course--to receive the news {{in the office of the}} paper." ...|$|E
50|$|For short <b>wiring</b> <b>runs</b> {{limited by}} {{conductor}} ampacity, this allows three half-sized conductors to {{be substituted for}} two full-sized ones, using 75% of the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.|$|R
2500|$|Note this {{is if the}} <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> {{from the}} {{location}} of the armature e.g. from x = 0 back to [...] and [...] is measured relative to the axis of the wire.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> in {{conduits}} or underground cannot dissipate heat {{as easily}} as in open air, and since adjacent circuits contribute induced currents, wiring regulations give rules to establish the current capacity (ampacity).|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} I found that I was within {{a kind of}} <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> which smelt foully, as though {{hundreds}} of things had lived in it for years. There was a hutch {{at the end of}} the run in which sat an enormous she-rabbit, quite as big as my mother, a fierce-looking brute with long yellow teeth. I was afraid of that rabbit and got as far from it as I could. Presently it hopped out and looked at me.|$|E
50|$|According to the 2010 census, the {{township}} has a total area of 23.7 sq mi, all land. The streams of Bit Run, Corrode Run, Cowboy Run, Crooked Creek, Harris Creek, Holster Creek, Mud Creek, Oak Run, Oval Run, Phillips Run, Rustic Run and <b>Wire</b> <b>Run</b> run through this township.|$|E
50|$|Wire wrap {{was invented}} to wire {{telephone}} crossbar switches, and later adapted to construct electronic circuit boards. Electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> between their terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns around a component lead or a socket pin.|$|E
50|$|The first {{telephone}} {{was installed}} in 1885 by H.V. Dalling, a homemade telephone whose <b>wires</b> <b>ran</b> between his home and shop. The Bell Telephone Company later opened a small telephone exchange in his store.|$|R
50|$|Erik T. W. Addyman {{designed}} and built his STG single seat primary glider for low cost basic training. As such, it was a simple, wooden, aerodynamically unrefined aircraft with a relatively low aspect ratio wing, a cockpit nacelle under it and a flat open truss girder fuselage aft. The unswept wing had parallel chord with blunt tips and was built around two spars. There were no flaps or airbrakes. Above the wing landing <b>wires</b> <b>ran</b> from about mid-span on each wing from the spars {{to the top of}} a centrally mounted inverted V-strut; below, similarly arranged flying <b>wires</b> <b>ran</b> to the lower nacelle longerons.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, <b>Wired</b> <b>ran</b> another {{article about}} GTD and Allen, quoting him as saying [...] "the {{workings}} of an automatic transmission are {{more complicated than}} a manual transmission... to simplify a complex event, you need a complex system".|$|R
50|$|Electric cattle guards use {{electricity}} to deter animals from crossing the fence line. There are different designs. One uses high-tensile <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> across the roadway, about 3 to 4 {{in off the}} ground, attached to a power source on one side. The primary advantage is cost and ease of installation. Drawbacks include the necessity of spraying vegetation with herbicides to keep weeds from shorting out the grid {{if there is no}} barrier between the wires and the ground. Also, some low-riding vehicles can catch the wires and tear them out.|$|E
50|$|It was in {{the academy}} {{building}} that, a dozen years later, one of the school's professors, Joseph Henry, conducted experiments with electricity that proved the existence of inductance and created the first functional electromagnet. For several years in the early 1830s he demonstrated the practical effects of this discovery to his classes by using a magnet to ring a bell {{at the end of}} a <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> around the room. Not only was this the prototype for the electric doorbell, it has been considered an important step on the road to the invention of the telegraph two decades later.|$|E
50|$|Safety wire tabs are washers {{that are}} used to secure {{fasteners}} by transferring the force of the safety wire {{to the head of the}} fastener to be secured. They are installed just like any other washer, after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which safety wire is threaded. Once the Safety Wire is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the safety wire to the fastener, as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the safety <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> though it.|$|E
2500|$|Initially the Telefon Hírmondó used {{telephone}} lines {{provided by the}} local telephone company to distribute its programmes. It later received permission to string its own lines, and, {{under the guidance of}} its technical director, Nándor Szmazsenka, constructed a network that divided Budapest into twenty-seven districts. Starting with [...] of wire, the systems expanded to 372 miles (599km) in 1901, and [...] in 1907. Twenty-seven copper <b>wires</b> <b>ran</b> from microphone receivers in the Opera House to the central office, where the current would pass through a patented device that increased the sound. A main <b>wire</b> <b>ran</b> to each district, with branch wires to individual houses. The distribution to subscribers was regulated by another patented device.|$|R
50|$|Longer <b>wiring</b> <b>runs</b> {{are more}} limited by voltage {{drop in the}} conductors. Because the supply voltage is doubled, a {{balanced}} load can tolerate double the voltage drop, allowing quarter-sized conductors to be used; this uses 3/8 the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.|$|R
50|$|Baqa al-Gharbiyye is {{separated}} from its West Bank sister city, Baqa ash-Sharqiyya (or Baqa East), by the Israeli West Bank barrier which in this section coincides with the Green Line. As a result, a concrete wall topped with barbed <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> through one neighbourhood.|$|R

5000|$|... 10BASE2 {{systems do}} {{have a number of}} {{advantages}} over 10BASE-T. No hub is required as with 10BASE-T, so the hardware cost is minimal, and wiring can be particularly easy since only a single <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> is needed, which can be sourced from the nearest computer. These characteristics mean that 10BASE2 is ideal for a small network of two or three machines, perhaps in a home where easily concealed wiring may be an advantage. For a larger complex office network, the difficulties of tracing poor connections make it impractical. Unfortunately for 10BASE2, by the time multiple home computer networks became common, the format had already been practically superseded. It is very difficult to find 10BASE2-compatible network cards as distinct pieces of equipment, and integrated LAN controllers on motherboards don't have the connector.|$|E
