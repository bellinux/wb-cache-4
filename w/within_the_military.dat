5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Duigan desired command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), which was to be raised for service in Europe. Lack of command experience and his performance as CGS meant that he was not a popular choice <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> or the New Zealand Government. Major General Bernard Freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2NZEF, and Duigan's term as CGS was extended. Throughout 1940, Duigan worked to ensure the continued support and reinforcement of 2NZEF, and oversaw the reintroduction of conscription. He also attended defence conferences in Singapore and India, and made tours of the 2NZEF while it was in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964, General Khánh ousted General Dương Văn Minh as {{the leader}} of South Vietnam's {{military}} junta in a bloodless coup. Although Khánh had made considerable efforts to consolidate his power, opposition to his rule began to grow as he tightened censorship laws, banned protests and allowed police arbitrary search and imprisonment powers. Khánh drafted a new constitution, which would have expanded his power <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> junta. In response to General Khánh's political manoeuvres the South Vietnamese people, predominately Buddhists, held large demonstrations in the cities calling {{for an end to the}} draconian laws which had limited the people’s political freedom. Fearing that his power could be weakened by those demonstrations, General Khánh immediately repealed his constitution and new police powers. He promised to reinstate civilian rule and remove members of the Catholic-based Cần lao from power.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, a group working <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> Department, which {{approved}} of nuclear tests in Switzerland, presented a secret plan for the attainment of nuclear weapons to the Federal Council. In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' predecessor, Caracalla, {{was murdered}} by a disaffected soldier during a {{campaign}} against Parthia on 8 April 217. Macrinus himself {{may have had a}} hand in the murder of Caracalla. Within days of Caracalla's death, Macrinus was proclaimed emperor {{with the support of the}} army. At the time of his accession he inherited all of the problems that Caracalla had left for Rome—war against Parthia, threats from Armenia and Dacia, and extensive fiscal expenditures. Macrinus successfully concluded a peace with Parthia, but it came at considerable cost to Rome. Finally, his policies to reduce monetary expenditures only stoked discontent <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Sea Harrier was {{withdrawn}} from service in 2006 {{and the last}} remaining aircraft from 801 Naval Air Squadron were decommissioned on 29 March 2006. The plans for retirement were announced in 2002 by the Ministry of Defence. The aircraft's replacement, the F-35 Lightning II, was originally due in 2012, the MoD arguing that significant expenditure {{would be required to}} upgrade the fleet for only six years of service. By March 2010, the F-35's introduction had been pushed back to 2016 at the earliest, with the price doubled. The decision to retire the Sea Harrier early has been criticised by some officers <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to Australia, Graham was subsequently appointed Chief of Staff, Northern Command in December 1967. By 1969 {{a large percentage}} of Australian casualties in Vietnam were being caused by mines, including significant quantities of M16 anti-personnel devices removed by the Viet Cong from the barrier minefield at Dat Do. Total Australian casualties from such mines were later estimated as 55 killed and 250 wounded, a figure which constituted approximately 11 percent of those killed during the war. These losses increasingly became a political issue as support for the war in Australia waned, and the efficacy of the decision was later criticised, both <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> and in the media. As the controversy surrounding the minefield grew, in February 1969 Graham was promoted to major general and appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff (DCGS) and Fifth Military Member of the Military Board, positions he held until 1972. Meanwhile, after visiting Phuoc Tuy Province respected journalist Denis Warner concluded that although the original concept in laying the minefield had been sound, it was ultimately one of the greatest Australian mistakes of the war. By August 1969 work had begun to remove the minefield.|$|E
5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. The Casualty Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arévalo's anti-communism, the U.S. was {{suspicious}} of him, and {{worried that he}} was under Soviet influence. The communist movement did grow stronger during Arévalo's presidency, partly because he released its imprisoned leaders, and also through {{the strength of its}} teachers' union. Another cause for U.S. worry was Arévalo's support of the Caribbean Legion. The Legion was a group of progressive exiles and revolutionaries, whose members included Fidel Castro, that aimed to overthrow U.S.-backed dictatorships across Central America. The government also faced opposition from within the country; Arévalo survived at least 25 coup attempts during his presidency. A notable example was an attempt in 1949 led by Francisco Arana, which was foiled in an armed shootout between Arana's supporters and a force led by Arévalo's defense minister Jacobo Árbenz. Arana was among those killed, but details of the coup attempt were never made public. Other sources of opposition to Arévalo's government were the right-wing politicians and conservatives <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> who had grown powerful during Ubico's dictatorship, as well as the clergy of the Catholic Church.|$|E

5|$|Fenix is a praetor <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> of the Khalai. Bill Roper voices Fenix in both StarCraft and Brood War. A templar and an {{old friend}} of Tassadar's, Fenix is a {{powerful}} and cunning leader, but remains distrustful towards the motives of the ruling judicator caste. Under the command of Aldaris, Fenix helps defend Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but eventually falls in the battle of Antioch when his position is overwhelmed by Zerg and his psi-blades lose power. Nevertheless, Fenix is retrieved and integrated into a dragoon, a mechanical fire support unit designed to allow incapacitated warriors to continue military service. Fenix allies his templar forces with Tassadar's upon the schism between Tassadar and the Protoss government, later leading a task force against the Overmind's outer defenses, facilitating Zeratul's assassination of a number of cerebrates and ultimately the death of the Overmind itself. Over this time, Fenix develops a strong friendship with Tassadar's Terran companion Jim Raynor.|$|E
5|$|On 24 May, Abu Nuwar was {{appointed}} as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff following Annab's retirement. Glubb's dismissal {{was met with}} great enthusiasm among Jordan's inhabitants and Arab nationalists in {{and outside of the}} country. However, Abu Nuwar's ascendancy as head of the army was resented by its veteran Bedouin units; he was generally regarded as a competent staff officer, but did not have experience as a commander. As part of his efforts to modernize the army, he mandated that education was a prerequisite for advancement, an act which disproportionately affected Bedouin officers, many of whom lacked formal education. As a result of Abu Nuwar's measure, several senior Bedouin officers were retired or reassigned to non-command posts. To counterbalance opposition to him within the army's ranks, Abu Nuwar established the Fourth Infantry Brigade, which mostly consisted of Palestinians, who he believed would form an integral part of his power base <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> Abu Nuwar's appointment also contributed to the increasing deterioration of ties between Jordan and the British government.|$|E
5|$|The February 1852 {{death of}} Prime Minister Rainiharo left the queen without her consort, long-time {{political}} adviser and military Commander-in-Chief. She consequently awarded Rainilaiarivony a double promotion to Twelfth Honor ten days afterward, {{in preparation for}} an increase in military and political responsibilities. Shortly thereafter the queen expressed romantic interest in Rainilaiarivony and proposed that he assume the former role of his father as prince consort and Prime Minister. The young man refused on the double basis of their age difference, the queen being forty years his senior, as well as the perceived impropriety of becoming intimate with his father's former lover. Ranavalona continued to harbor feelings for him throughout her lifetime but she did not express resentment over his refusal to reciprocate them and went on to take another high-ranking official as consort: Rainijohary, who was jointly awarded the role of Prime Minister along with the new Commander-in-Chief, Rainivoninahitriniony. Within a year the queen had assigned the 24-year-old Rainilaiarivony to his first position of responsibility <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military,</b> and promoted him to Royal Secretary, keeper of the Royal Seal, and supervisor to the Royal Treasurer.|$|E

5|$|Three {{weeks after}} Cao Qin's failed uprising, the Mongol leader Bolai, {{who had been}} staging raids into {{northern}} China, sent an embassy into China to request formal tribute relations and {{to serve as a}} vassal to the Ming. News of this rebellion reached the Joseon court of Korea by September 9, while the Korean official in charge of the report perhaps embellished the level of gore and violence by stating that tens of thousands had died and the three days of pouring rain following the rebellion flooded even the Forbidden City with streams of blood and rain. A native rebellion would not threaten the capital city again until the fall of Beijing to the army of Li Zicheng in 1644, marking the end of the dynasty and, shortly after, the beginning of Manchu conquest. Until the conquest of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, Chinese officials continued to show a large degree of apprehension over Mongols in military service to the Ming, and still favored relocation schemes. However, Cao's rebellion marked the last event when Ming Mongols were of great importance to court affairs; although many Mongol officers retained hereditary titles of noble lineage, the nobility <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> command structure declined as a whole while men from more humble origins eventually displaced them.|$|E
5|$|When {{he became}} president, {{he sent a}} bill to the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. He established the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons to investigate the crimes committed by the military, {{which led to the}} Trial of the Juntas and resulted in the sentencing of the heads of the former regime. Discontent <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> led to the mutinies of the Carapintadas, leading Alfonsín to appease them with the full stop law and the law of Due Obedience. He also had conflicts with the unions, which were controlled by the opposing Justicialist Party. He resolved the Beagle conflict, increased trade with Brazil, and proposed the creation of the Contadora support group to mediate between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. He passed the first divorce law of Argentina. He initiated the Austral plan to improve the national economy, but that plan, as well as the Spring plan, failed. The resulting hyperinflation and riots led to his party's defeat in the 1989 presidential elections, which was won by Peronist Carlos Menem.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their ancient}} history, all living Andalusians trace {{to a small}} number of horses bred by {{religious}} orders in the 18th and 19thcenturies. An influx of heavy horse blood beginning in the 16th century, resulted in the dilution of many of the bloodlines; only those protected by selective breeding remained intact to become the modern Andalusian. During the 19th century, the Andalusian breed was threatened because many horses were stolen or requisitioned in wartime, including the War of the Oranges, the Peninsular War and the three Carlist Wars. Napoleon's invading army also stole many horses. One herd of Andalusians was hidden from the invaders however, and subsequently used to renew the breed. In 1822, breeders began to add Norman blood into Spanish bloodlines, as well as further infusions of Arabian blood. This was partially because increasing mechanization and changing needs <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> called for horses with more speed in cavalry charges as well as horses with more bulk for pulling gun carriages. In 1832, an epidemic seriously affected Spain's horse population, from which only one small herd survived in a stud at the monastery in Cartuja. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, European breeders, especially the Germans, changed from an emphasis on Andalusian and Neapolitan horses (an emphasis that had been in place since the decline of chivalry), to an emphasis on the breeding of Thoroughbreds and warmbloods, further depleting the stock of Andalusians. Despite this change in focus, Andalusian breeding slowly recovered, and in 1869, the Seville Horse Fair (originally begun by the Romans), played host to between ten and twelve thousand Spanish horses. In the early 20th century, Spanish horse breeding began to focus on other breeds, particularly draft breeds, Arabians, Thoroughbreds and crosses between these breeds, as well as crosses between these breeds and the Andalusian. The purebred Andalusian was not viewed favorably by breeders or the military, and their numbers decreased significantly.|$|E
