40|$|Class of 2014 AbstractSpecific Aims: To {{determine}} what the general public understands about sunscreen and to see if specific groups need more targeted marketing and education about sunscreen. Methods: Questionnaires administered to eligible participants that rated the participants’ knowledge of general sun safety, sunscreen application, and FDA labeling on sunscreen products compared to demographic data. Demographic data were collected on age, gender, years resided in Arizona, whether participants has or known anyone {{with a history of}} skin cancer and ethnicity. Main Results: Questionnaires were completed by 62 participants. <b>When</b> <b>comparing</b> skin cancer versus no skin cancer using student’s t-test, {{there was no significant difference}} (P= 0. 09). <b>When</b> <b>comparing</b> gender versus total using student’s t-test, there was no significant difference (P= 0. 62). <b>When</b> <b>comparing</b> ethnicity versus total using ANOVA, F < Fcritical indicating there was no difference. <b>When</b> <b>comparing</b> age versus total using ANOVA, F < Fcritical indicating there was no difference. <b>When</b> <b>comparing</b> years residing in Arizona versus total using ANOVA, F < Fcritical indicating there was no difference.

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent {{in the opposite direction}} (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly <b>when</b> <b>compared</b> with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E
