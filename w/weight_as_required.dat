50|$|Porsche {{decided to}} end its 20 year history of factory sports car racing and sold the 908/03 cars to customers. Besides {{developing}} the 917/10 turbo for the Can Am series, the Zuffenhausen-based company focused {{on the development of}} the already aging Porsche 911, testing the 911 flat-6 with turbochargers. Yet a 3 year old Porsche 908LH Coupé was entered by Reinhold Joest in the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing a strong 3rd. Customers continued to race several 908/3, fitted with extra <b>weight</b> <b>as</b> <b>required</b> by the rules. In 1975, some 908s were fitted with turbocharged engines, similar to those used in the Porsche 934 GT car. Even with 2.1-litre and a turbo factor of 1.4, the turbos by now outpowered normally aspirated 3-litre engines. Taking advantage of that, in 1976 the factory developed the Porsche 936 to compete in the new Group 6 Two-Seater Racing Car category that replaced the Group 5 Sports Car class. Unlike the 934 and 935, Porsche did not offer the 936 for sale, entering it in a few races only, mostly at Le Mans. Several customer-908s were upgraded with 936-style bodywork. The Porsche 908/80 Turbo of Joest and Jacky Ickx which finished 2nd in the 1980 24 Hours of Le Mans turned out later to have a real Porsche 936 chassis, though.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a Veiling Luminance estimation system based {{on the use of}} a CMOS image sensor, fully implemented on FPGA. The system is composed of the CMOS Image sensor, FPGA, DDR SDRAM, USB controller and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Flash. The FPGA is used to build a system-on-chip integrating a soft processor (Xilinx MicroBlaze) and all the hardware blocks needed to handle the external peripherals and memory. The soft processor is used to handle image acquisition and all computational tasks need to compute the Veiling Luminance value. The advantages of this single chip FPGA implementation include the reduction of the hardware requirements, power consumption, and system complexity. The problem of the high dynamic range images have been addressed with multiple acquisitions at different exposure times. Vignetting, radial distortion and angular <b>weighting,</b> <b>as</b> <b>required</b> by veiling luminance definition, are handled by a single integer look-up table (LUT) access.

40|$|Band {{broadening}} in size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) {{is always}} present to some extent. Broadening effects on averages {{such as the}} weight- and number average molecular weights (M- and M- respectively) are minimal with modern SEC systems. However, broadening distorts {{the shape of the}} true molecular weight distribution (MWD), which causes problems if one wants to compare the detailed form of the MWD to a model. An addition to current methods for overcoming this problem is presented. One starts with a sufficiently wide range of samples whose exact values of M- and. M- have been measured by non-SEC methods (e. g. by fluorimetry and light scattering, respectively, of the sample without size separation). A true (unbroadened) molecular weight distribution for a sample can be obtained by deconvolution (here using a maximum-entropy algorithm) by fitting SEC data for these samples to these exact M- and M- values to find the values of the parameters in a sufficiently flexible assumed broadening function. This was modelled using simulated band broadening and subsequent deconvolution, with the broadening parameters least-squares fitted to the "exact" sets of values of M- and M- The results show that if these M- and M- values are for a series of broad (not narrow) standards covering a sufficient range of molecular weight, then after deconvolution, a good representation of the original molecular weight distribution used in the simulation is obtained. The method should prove useful for water-soluble polymers, for which {{it is often difficult to}} obtain narrow standards of a wide range of molecular <b>weight,</b> <b>as</b> <b>required</b> in a number of well-established methods for correcting for band broadening...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A new {{practical}} {{modal balancing}} technique, which uses the modal ratio among mea-surement points (MRMP coeYcient), has been developed. This new method is an improvement upon traditional modal balancing when the rotor {{to be balanced}} operates at the speed between the ®rst and second critical speeds. The concept of the MRMP coeYcient is introduced for the ®rst time in this paper, {{on the basis of}} which the rotor±bearing system can be balanced at any one rotational speed between the ®rst and second critical speeds by decomposing the modal components of unbalance and response simultaneously. Moreover, only one test run is required in three of the four balancing schemes provided in this paper to balance the rotor. In the new method, the test weights need not be orthogonal, so prior modal function knowledge is not necessary for calculation of the test <b>weights,</b> <b>as</b> <b>required</b> in the traditional modal balancing method. To verify the validity of the new technique, a balancing experiment using a rotating cantilever rotor is carried out. The results show that the new method can be applied eVectively in ®eld balancing...|$|R

40|$|The {{article by}} Daelemans et al. bears on an {{important}} question about {{the adequacy of the}} &quot;Principles and Parameters &quot; framework as the basis of a process account of language learning (exemplified, for instance, by the work of Dresher and Kaye 1990). As Gupta and Touretzky (1991, 1994) have pointed out, a learning system based on a particular linguistic description (of metrical phenomena, for example) can at best learn whatever is describable within that linguistic formalism; however, important aspects of real-world stress data do not appear amenable to parameter-based description, and are therefore unlearnable for a parameter-based system. In the present work, the authors make a careful examination of main stress as-signment in Dutch, showing that the consensus (parameterized) linguistic analysis for Dutch yields correct stress for only 81. 1 % of the words in a representative corpus. The problem is that when words are represented only by their syllable <b>weights</b> (<b>as</b> <b>required</b> by metrical theory), they can be ambiguous with respect to stress assignment. A parameter-based procedure therefore can at best learn only the &quot;regular &quot; 81. 1 % of the data. By assuming certain lexically specified exception markings, the framewor...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of an algorithm for safely and optimally managing the routing of aircraft on an airport surface in future airport operations. This tool is intended to support air traffic controllers’ decision-making in selecting the paths of all aircraft and the engine startup approval time for departing ones. Optimal routes are sought for minimizing the time both arriving and departing aircraft spend on an airport surface with engines on, with benefits in terms of safety, efficiency and costs. The proposed algorithm first computes a standalone, shortest path solution from runway to apron or vice versa, depending on the aircraft being inbound or outbound, respectively. For taking into account the constraints due to other traffic on an airport surface, this solution is amended by a conflict detection and resolution task that attempts to reduce and possibly nullify the number of conflicts generated in the first phase. An example application on a simple Italian airport exemplifies how the algorithm can be applied to true-world applications. Emphasis is given on how to model an airport surface as a weighted and directed graph with non-negative <b>weights,</b> <b>as</b> <b>required</b> for the input to the algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The world’s water {{resources}} are rapidly deteriorating {{due to the}} combined effects of global warming, climate change, population growth and fast development, posing new challenges to {{water resources}} managers. Conflicting objectives and expectations of various stakeholders have led to increasing interests in the consideration and resolution of multiple social, economic, environmental and supply sustainability objectives {{in the management of}} water supply systems, especially during extended dry periods. This study attempted to develop and assess the potential of a generic decision support framework to assist in evaluating alternative operating rules for multi-purpose, multireservoir urban water supply systems. The multi-objective outranking approach which facilitated the incorporation of stakeholder preferences in the decision making process is a main focus area in this research. The main elements of the framework are illustrated on a case study of the Melbourne water supply system, demonstrating its capabilities for evaluating alternative operating rules under single or group decision-making situations. Eight performance measures (PMs) were identified under four main objectives to evaluate the system performance related to sixteen pre-selected alternative operating rules. Three major stakeholder groups, namely, resource managers, water users and environmental interest groups were represented in hypothetical decision making situations. An interviewerassisted questionnaire survey was used to derive stakeholder preferences on PMs in terms of preference functions and <b>weights</b> <b>as</b> <b>required</b> by the PROMETHEE/GAIA method and its computer software tool Decision Lab 2000. A total of 97 personnel selected from Melbourne Water and Victoria University participated in the survey expressing their preferences on the eight PMs. Finally, an overall ranking for alternative operating rules is obtained together with other output results, which focused on the best compromises between the objectives considered. The method yields reliable and robust results in terms of varying group compositions considered in the case study. The major innovation of this project is the development of a transparent and intuitive multi-objective decision support framework that has potential to be developed for evaluating alternative operating rules for urban water supply systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{alternatives}} to the GMM estimators proposed by Hansen (1982) and others. These estimators are shown to {{have a number of}} advantages. First of all, {{there is no need to}} estimate in an initial step a <b>weight</b> matrix <b>as</b> <b>required</b> in the conventional estimation procedure. Second, it is straightforward to derive the distribution of the estimator under general misspecifi-cation. Third, some of the alternative estimators have appealing information-theoretic interpreta-tions. In particular, one of the estimators is an empirical likelihood estimator with an interpretation as a discrete support maximum likelihood estimator. Fourth, in an empirical example one of the new estimators is shown to perform better than the conventional estimators. Finally, the new estimators make it easier for the researcher to get better approximations to their distributions using saddlepoint approximations. The main cost is computational: the system of equations that has to be solved is of greater dimension than the number of parameters of interest. In practice this mayor may not be a problem in particular applications. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, were studied in seven {{patients}} with spastic paresis of spinal origin. Six patients {{were included in}} a double blind crossover trial (maximal dose 24 mg/day). The patients were evaluated on both their spasticity and locomotor function. Four of the patients also participated in an open trial in which cyproheptadine was administered {{for a minimum of}} six months at optimal dose. Patients walked on a treadmill at full weight bearing when possible, or with 40 % of their body <b>weight</b> externally supported, <b>as</b> <b>required,</b> by an overhead harness system. Cyproheptadine considerably decreased the sustained ankle clonus and episodes of spontaneous spasms observed in all the patients who previously presented these manifestations of spasticity. Two patients who required body weight support (BWS) during locomotion could walk at full weight bearing during cyproheptadine therapy. A more normal timing of EMG patterns in these patients during cyproheptadine therapy was associated with temporal distance changes and marked improvement of joint angular displacement. In contrast, the other patients showed marginal changes in the EMG and the kinematic pattern but eventually managed to walk at a higher speed. These preliminary results suggest that cyproheptadine can reduce spasticity and enhance locomotor function in spinal cord injured patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{widely used}} {{acoustic}} modeling approach of phonetic decision-tree based context clustering {{does not take}} full advantage of limited training data, and therefore fails to produce robust acoustic models. Two problems are identified: (1) all states clustered in a leaf node must share the same set of Gaussian components and mixture weights; no distinction is provided among those states; (2) rarely seen triphones in the training data might be poorly estimated and cause an adverse effect on decision-tree clustering. We propose a number of approaches to address these problems by more efficient use of training data. Specifically, (1) a two-level decision-tree approach for the first problem that ties Gaussian components and mixture <b>weights</b> separately, <b>as</b> they <b>require</b> different amounts of data to obtain robust estimation of their parameters; and (2) a two-stage decisiontree based clustering approach and a MAP-based approach for the second problem. Each approach gives a statistical significant reduction of the word error rate (WER) over the traditional approach. The systems combining all new approaches achieve the best performance, which reduce the WERs of the baseline systems by 14 – 17 % and reduce the model sizes by 8 – 11 % on the WSJ tasks.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{usefulness}} of life events measures for understanding patients’ experience following weight loss surgery. This study investigated patient perceptions of how much accommodation was involved in their adjustment to life after weight loss surgery. Findings indicated that the participants perceived <b>weight</b> loss surgery <b>as</b> <b>requiring</b> more adjustment than would be expected following a variety of significant life events, including the death of a spouse and being fired. These results suggested that the coping resources that patients used to manage such demands may be high after undergoing weight loss surgery. No significant relationships were identified between adjustment after surgery with time since surgery and satisfaction with surgery. These findings suggested the following: (a) participants reported a fairly consistent perception of the amount of adjustment involved with surgery regardless of when or if they had surgery, and (b) although surgery involved considerable adjustment, the transitioning required after surgery was not related to how satisfied they felt. Limitations of this study included a small sample size and the use of a modified life events measure to examine overall adjustment. Increasing sample size and investigating other mediating factors and methods of examining patients’ experiences, expectations, outcome, and/or satisfaction with weight loss surgery may be useful in furthering this research. Despite limitations, medical and mental health providers can use the findings from this study to quickly convey the high level of adjustment commonly reported by patients, thereby unifying the treatment team message in an efficient and realistic way...|$|R
