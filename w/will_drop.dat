5|$|In January 2016, Boeing {{confirmed}} {{plans to}} reduce the production rate of the 777 family from 8.3 per month to 7 per month in 2017 to help close the production gap between the 777 and 777X created {{by a lack of}} new orders. In 2018, assembling test 777-9 aircraft is expected to lower output to an effective rate of 5.5 per month. Boeing <b>will</b> <b>drop</b> 777 production to five per month in August 2017.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your morale <b>will</b> <b>drop.</b> If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to beat in the duel.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and <b>will</b> <b>drop</b> to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E

5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, and she thinks of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he <b>will</b> <b>drop</b> the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E
5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet <b>will</b> <b>drop</b> the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more. As she leaves the apartment, she will let Corky in, who will steal the money from a briefcase and leave. Violet will then return with the Scotch and tell Caesar that she just saw Johnnie leaving, but that Gino was not with him. Suspicious, Caesar will check the briefcase, find the money gone, and assume Johnnie has taken it. Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E
5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he <b>will</b> <b>drop</b> a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E

5|$|Virgin queens {{and males}} appear in colonies during January, before their nuptial flight. 20 females or fewer {{are found in}} a single colony, while males are much more common. The nuptial flight begins at {{different}} times for each species; they have been recorded in mid-summer to autumn (January to early April), {{but there is one}} case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30km/h (18mi/h) and temperatures reaching 30°C (86°F), and elevations of 91 metres (300ft). Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly, although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time. Species are both polygynous and polyandrous, with queens mating with one to ten males. Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest, but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous. For example, nearly 80% of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous. Nuptial flight takes place during the morning and can last until late afternoon. When the alates leave the nest, most species launch themselves into the air from trees and shrubs, although others launch themselves off the ground. Queens discharge a glandular secretion from the tergal gland, which males are strongly attracted to. As many as 1,000 alates will gather to mate. A queen was once found to have five or six males attempting to copulate with her. The queen is unable to bear the weight of the large number of males trying to mate with her, and <b>will</b> <b>drop</b> to the ground, with the ants dispersing later on. M. pulchra queens are ergatoid and cannot fly; the males meet the queen out in an open area away from the nest and mate, and these queens do not return to their nest after mating.|$|E
5|$|After VJ Patterson (Felix Dean) is bullied by Riley Radcliffe (Tani Edgecombe) {{he goes to}} see {{his father}} Ian (Ben Simpson) but he laughs it off. Miles is {{attacked}} and beaten and presumes it was Ian. He later finds out {{it was in fact}} Riley and his friends. He tries to drag Riley to the police station but he breaks his wrist. Miles is arrested for assault. Ian blackmails him saying he <b>will</b> <b>drop</b> the charges for money, the police find out Ian was responsible for the injuries. However the newspapers published an article on Miles branding him a thug. Miles destroys a classroom and Gina Austin (Sonia Todd) forces him to take leave. He starts drinking heavily again, makes a pass at Leah and sleeps on the beach. Miles begins having visions of a girl called Rabbit, who tells him about future events. She convinces him to do good deeds. Miles becomes good friends with Elijah Johnson (Jay Laga'aia) and he goes to Africa with him. On his return he is assaulted by Heath Braxton (Daniel Ewing). He then gets drunk and kisses Roo Stewart (Georgie Parker) and wakes up next to her in the morning. He later confesses his love to Leah and they start a relationship. Elijah is initially annoyed, but they repair their friendship. Leah learns she is pregnant, which delights Miles. Leah is initially hesitant about going ahead with the pregnancy, but she and Miles talk and she decides to keep the baby. Miles proposes to Leah, but she turns him down, saying they are not ready. She later asks him to move in with her and VJ. Leah suffers a miscarriage, which devastates Miles. The couple struggle with their grief and Miles moves out. He and Leah later break up. Miles learns Elijah is still in love with Leah. Miles tells Marilyn that Sally has got him a teaching job in Thailand and he leaves the Summer Bay.|$|E

25|$|Heart rate reserve (HRreserve) is the {{difference}} between a person's measured or predicted maximum heart rate and resting heart rate. Some methods of measurement of exercise intensity measure percentage of heart rate reserve. Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest <b>will</b> <b>drop,</b> and the heart rate reserve will increase. Percentage of HRreserve is equivalent to percentage of VO2 reserve.|$|E
