2500|$|Following {{the legal}} {{developments}} in the UK, the test for apparent bias in Singapore was extensively reconsidered by the High Court in the 2005 case Tang Kin Hwa v. Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Board. On {{the facts of the}} case, it was unnecessary for Judicial Commissioner Andrew Phang to have decided definitively whether the correct test was the reasonable suspicion or the real likelihood test. Nonetheless, he expressed the obiter view that the [...] "reasonable suspicion of bias" [...] test established in Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin and Tang Liang Hong was not significantly different from the English [...] "real likelihood of bias" [...] test (also known as [...] "real possibility of bias" [...] test). According to him, [...] "he common substance of both tests appears, in a nutshell, to be this: The key {{question is whether or not}} there was a perception on the part of a reasonable person that there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> likelihood of bias". The concept of [...] "likelihood" [...] entails [...] "possibility" [...] and not [...] "probability". Phang opined that this is simply another way of stating that there is a [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] on the part of the person concerned, meaning that although the concept of [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] is supposed to be of a less stringent standard, this standard is reflected in the concept of [...] "possibility" [...] and thus there is essentially no substantial difference in the two tests. In addition, the word real in the term real likelihood of bias cannot mean [...] "actual", as the test after all pertains to apparent bias and not actual bias.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs' {{letter was}} met with mixed reactions. Bloomberg {{highlighted}} several viewpoints. David Pakman, President of non-DRM music retailer eMusic, agreed with Jobs, stating that [...] "consumers prefer {{a world where the}} media they purchase is playable on any device, regardless of its manufacturer, and is not burdened by arbitrary usage restrictions. DRM only serves to restrict consumer choice, prevents a larger digital music market from emerging, and often makes consumers unwitting accomplices to the ambitions of technology companies". Mike Bebel, CEO of music subscription service Ruckus, explained his view that the letter was an effort to shift focus, saying that [...] "This is a way for Steve Jobs to take the heat off the fact that he won't open up his proprietary DRM. ... The labels have every right to protect their content, and I don't see it as a vow of good partnership to turn the tables on the labels and tell them they should just get rid of all DRM... He is trying to spin the controversy." [...] An anonymous music label executive said that [...] "it's ironic that the guy who has the most successful example of DRM at every step of the process, the one where people bought boatloads of music last Christmas, is suddenly changing his tune". In an article from The New York Times, Ted Cohen, managing partner at TAG Strategic, commented that the change could be [...] "a clear win for the consumer electronics device world, but a potential disaster for the content companies". The Recording Industry Association of America put particular emphasis on Jobs' self-rejected idea about licensing its FairPlay technology to other companies, saying that such licensing would be [...] "a welcome breakthrough and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> victory for fans, artists and labels".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The SOSEMANUK {{stream cipher}} {{is one of}} the finalists of the eSTREAM project. In this paper, we improve the linear {{cryptanalysis}} of SOSEMANUK presented in Asiacrypt 2008. We apply the generalized linear masking technique to SOSEMANUK and derive many linear approximations holding with the correlations of up to 2 − 25. 5. We show that the data complexity of the linear attack on SOSEMANUK can <b>be</b> reduced by <b>a</b> factor of 2 10 if multiple linear approximations are used. Since SOSEMANUK claims 128 -bit security, our attack <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> threat on the security of SOSEMANUK.

2500|$|Also {{significant}} was {{the theme}} of isolation and disconnection between the commuters.

5000|$|Bull also {{continued}} {{working with the}} GC-45 design, and soon secured work with The People's Republic of China, and then Iraq.

Although it appears the Al-Fao was not put into production, the Al-Majnoonan started replacing Soviet designs as quickly as they could be delivered. When deliveries could not be made quickly enough, additional barrels were ordered from South Africa. The guns were built and sold through an Austrian intermediary.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} boom-bust cycles {{in emerging}} market economies triggered by missperception about future productivity. Using a small open economy DSGE model {{we show that}} non-materialized news about future productivity improvements (i. e. overoptimism) generate boom-bust cycles that replicate the stylized facts of several emerging economies during the 1990 s. We report simulation results for a boom-bust cycle under alternative monetary policy rules. In this context, we show that if the central bank tries to stabilize output, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> large <b>real</b> appreciation of the currency and a deep contraction in the tradable goods sector. When the central bank follows a more strict inflation targeting regime, the boom-bust pattern in major aggregate variables <b>would</b> <b>be</b> exacerbated. Finally, if the central bank attempts to sustain the real exchange rate, the perverse effects on the domestic tradable goods sector are only prevented in the short-run, but the boom-bust cycle in other variables is amplified. ...|$|R
