50|$|The {{blistering}} {{of painted}} surfaces {{may be caused}} in several ways. If on iron, {{it may be the}} result of a particle of rust which, not having been removed in the process of cleaning, has increased in size and loosened the paint. If on plaster, a particle of unslaked lime may have blown, with a similar result. On wood, blistering is usually caused by painting upon a wet surface or upon unseasoned wood. Blisters may also be caused by the use of too much oil in paint exposed to heat, or the application of one coat upon another before the latter is properly dry. To prevent blistering a method that has been tried with good results is to apply two coats of <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> (washable distemper) and follow by two coats of oil color or varnish. Cracking is caused by the use of too much oil in the under coats and too little in the topcoats.|$|E
50|$|Today San Pedro {{is known}} for various {{different}} festivals, {{one of the most}} famous being El Gran Carnaval de San Pedro.El Gran Carnaval de San Pedro goes back to the 1870s, a tradition that is centered around “ Juan Carnaval”. A legend states “Juan was an island goddess,that had sex with over a thousand women from eight different countries and had several children. It is said that he was stabbed to death by his hurt and jealous wife leaving behind nothing but a will that is traditionally read on Ash Wednesday. A stuffed doll like idol of Juan Carnaval is burnt every year as symbol of cleansing the community's sins.This tradition started out with use of power and has now expanded into <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> and the breaking of eggs. However there are rules to this festival; they include: first day restricted for only children between the time of 6 pm and 7 pm from Ruby’s Hotel beachfront to the cemetery area and also the Barrier Reef Drive, they are not allowed to paint individuals that are not participating as well as public signs, buildings and the Comparsa participants and lastly they are not allowed to use rotten eggs,, spray paint or oil paints.|$|E

In {{order to}} solve the {{problems}} of the pavement delamination or slip caused by the failures of waterproof adhesive layer or anti-corrosion coating, the epoxy zinc-rich paint, the epoxy clear <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> and epoxy asphalt adhesive material with good performance was selected for the roughness-adhesive force test, tensile test under different temperatures and corrosion resistance test. The optimal anti-corrosion layer and adhesive layer were selected to increase the service life of the steel deck pavement. The test results show that: When the steel roughness is 60 µm, the anti-corrosion material has the highest adhesive strength with the steel plate. Both the epoxy zinc-rich paint and the epoxy <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> have high adhesive strengths with the steel plate at room temperature. But at low temperature, the adhesion performance of the epoxy <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> is significantly better than that of the epoxy zinc-rich paint. At 70 °C, the adhesive strengths of both the epoxy <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> and epoxy zinc-rich paint adhesive system greatly decrease.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of an {{inventory}} of 20 major painting plants an analysis of wastes resulting from varnish and paint solvents has been effected. Based on these findings, technical solutions have been developped on a laboratory and pilot plant scale {{in order to avoid}} and exploit paint sludges containing paint solvents, <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> sludges, two-component varnish sludges and polluted solvents. Concerning paint sludges, it was necessary to apply separate processes for both flotating and sedimentary coagulates. In order to recycle polyols, a method has been developped for two-component varnishes. Considering water paints, practicabilities of ultrafiltration in dependence on paint formulation, types of membrans and modulus have been tested. Finally, a process has been found leading to depigmentation of water paints, on which the ultrafiltration and microfiltration are applied in combination. (orig.)

40|$|Although formal {{hypothesis}} tests {{provide a}} convenient framework for displaying the statistical results of empirical comparisons, standard tests {{should not be}} used without consideration of underlying measurement error structure. As part of the validation process, predictions of individual blood lead concentrations from models with site-specific input parameters are often compared with blood lead concentrations measured in field studies that also report lead concentrations in environmental media (soil, dust, <b>water,</b> <b>paint)</b> as surrogates for exposure. Measurements of these environmental media are subject to several sources of variability, including temporal and spatial sampling, sample preparation and chemical analysis, and data entry or recording. Adjustments for measurement error must be made before statistical tests can be used to empirically compare environmental data with model predictions. This report illustrates the effect of measurement error correction using a real dataset of child blood lead concentrations for an undisclosed midwestern community. We illustrate both the apparent failure of some standard regression tests and the success of adjustment of such tests for measurement error using the SIMEX (simulation-extrapolation) procedure. This procedure adds simulated measurement error to model predictions and then subtracts the total measurement error, analogous to the method of standard additions used by analytical chemists.

40|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) {{of households}} with insecticide {{is a principal}} malaria vector control intervention in Zanzibar. In 2006, IRS using the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrine was introduced in Zanzibar. Following detection of pyrethroid resistance in 2010, an insecticide resistance management plan was proposed, and IRS using bendiocarb was started in 2011. In 2014, bendiocarb was replaced by pirimiphos methyl. This study investigated the residual efficacy of pirimiphos methyl (Actellic® 300 CS) sprayed on common surfaces of human dwellings in Zanzibar. The residual activity of Actellic 300 CS was determined over 9  months through bioassay tests that measured the mortality of female Anopheles mosquitoes, exposed to sprayed surfaces under a WHO cone. The wall surfaces included; mud wall, oil or water painted walls, lime washed wall, un-plastered cement block wall and stone blocks. Insecticide susceptibility testing was done to investigate the resistance status of local malaria vectors against Actellic 300 CS using WHO protocols; Anopheline species were identified using PCR methods. Baseline tests conducted one-day post-IRS revealed 100  % mortality on all sprayed surfaces. The residual efficacy of Actellic 300 CS was maintained on all sprayed surfaces up to 8  months post-IRS. However, the bioassay test conducted 9  months post-IRS showed the 24  h mortality rate to be ≤ 80  % for lime wash, mud wall, <b>water</b> <b>paint</b> and stone block surfaces. Only oil paint surface retained the recommended residual efficacy beyond 9  months post-IRS, with mortality maintained at ≥ 97  %. Results of susceptibility tests showed that malaria vectors in Zanzibar were fully (100  %) susceptible to Actellic 300 CS. The predominant mosquito vector species was An. arabiensis (76. 0  %) in Pemba and An. gambiae (83. 5  %) in Unguja. The microencapsulated formulation of pirimiphos methyl (Actellic 300 CS) is a highly effective and appropriate insecticide for IRS use in Zanzibar as it showed a relatively prolonged residual activity compared to other products used for the same purpose. The insecticide extends the residual effect of IRS thereby {{making it possible to}} effectively protect communities with a single annual spray round reducing overall costs. The insecticide proved to be a useful alternative in insecticide resistance management plans...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: pages 284 - 306. Risk {{factors for}} lead {{exposure}} among children in South Africa {{have not been}} well documented. This study elucidated important factors which co-vary with lead in increasing children's risk of exposure. Two study designs were used. First, a cross-sectional analytical study involving first grade school children was executed. Venous blood samples from children were analysed for lead using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. In addition other haematological and anthropometric measurements were conducted. A pre-tested questionnaire administered to parents identified risk factors for lead exposure. Statistical analyses, including log-linear models, {{were used to determine}} the relationships between biological, environmental, social factors and blood lead. In an environmental study, daily air and dust samples were collected over a year from several sites in the study area, contemporaneously with the blood and questionnaire surveys. Spatial and temporal variations in atmospheric lead were determined. In stage two a case control study was carried out to determine whether risk factors for lead exposure differed among cases (blood lead ≥ 24 ug/dl) and controls (blood lead ≤ 14 ug/dl). Levels of lead in air, <b>water,</b> <b>paint</b> and dust samples from children's homes were determined and the state of housing evaluated. Home interviews were conducted with parents to assess the role of economic, demographic, cultural, and behavioural factors in increasing children's risk. 13 % of coloured children, but no white children were identified with blood lead levels ≥ 25 ug/dl. Air lead levels ranged from 1. 5 ug/m³ and dust lead levels from 3 000 ppm. Environmental lead levels were significantly elevated near heavy traffic, particularly during winter months. Baseline exposure was of significance in influencing blood lead levels of children attending schools in direct proximity to heavy traffic, where blood lead levels were elevated. In cases, direct inhalation of aerosols, and ingestion of lead in water were not found to be important risk factors. Hand contamination and mouthing were associated with increased risk. Sources of elevated lead were found in the homes of both cases and controls, but were not accessible in the homes of controls. A conceptual framework for lead exposure in children is proposed, to illustrate how social and environmental factors may act to increase risk. The results have implications for primary and secondary prevention strategies aimed at the community...|$|E
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{continually}} seeks {{safer and}} more cost effective technologies for the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of nuclear facilities. The Deactivation and Decommissioning Focus Area (DDFA) of the DOE's Office of Science and Technology (OST) sponsored large-scale demonstration and deployment projects (LSDDPs) to help bring new technologies into the D&D programs. The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) LSDDP generated a list of needs defining specific problems where improved technologies could be incorporated into ongoing D&D tasks. The needs fell into 5 major categories [...] characterization, dismantlement, safety, material dispositioning, and decontamination. Technologies were carefully selected that provide a large benefit for a small investment. The technologies must provide significant improvements in cost, safety, radiation exposure, waste volume reduction, or schedule savings and widely applicable throughout the DOE complex. The LSDDP project provided training for the new technologies and worked with technology suppliers to resolve any questions that arose. Since 1998, 26 technologies have been demonstrated or deployed through the LSDDP for the D&D program at the INEEL. Of the 26 demonstrated and deployed technologies, 14 were in characterization, 3 were in decontamination, 4 were in dismantlement, 3 were in safety, and 2 were in material dispositioning. To promote {{the use of these}} technologies at other sites within the DOE complex, the LSDDP team published fact sheets, videos, technology summary reports, articles in INEEL star newspaper, posters, and maintained an internet home page on the project. As a result, additional deployments have taken place at the Hanford, Mound, Fernald, Oak Ridge, Ashtabula, and West Valley. Eight of the 26 technologies evaluated were developed in foreign countries. The technologies demonstrated {{have been shown to be}} faster, less expensive, and/or safer. The technologies evaluated through the LSDDP have provided improvements in the following D&D areas: robotic underwater characterization of fuel storage pools, characterization of scrap metal for recycle, PCB and RCRA metals analysis in soil, <b>water,</b> <b>paint,</b> or sludge, subsurface characterization, personnel safety, waste disposal, scaffolding use, and remote radiation characterization of buildings and soil. It is estimated that the technologies demonstrated and deployed through this program will save more than $ 50 million dollars over the next 10 years at the INEEL alone. Of the $ 50 million estimated dollars saved, about 75 % of the savings will come from characterization technologies, 11 % from technologies associated with material dispositioning, 10 % are associated with dismantlement technologies and the balance split between safety and decontamination...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the pathway of leaded dust from a lead-zinc-copper mine to houses of employees, {{and the impact}} on blood lead concentrations (PbB) of children. METHODS: High precision lead isotope and lead concentration data were obtained on venous blood and environmental samples (vacuum cleaner dust, interior dustfall accumulation, <b>water,</b> <b>paint)</b> for eight children of six employees (and the employees) from a lead-zinc-copper mine. These data were compared with results for 11 children from occupationally unexposed control families {{living in the same}} city. RESULTS: The median (range) concentrations of lead in vacuum cleaner dust was 470 (21 - 1300) ppm. In the houses of the mine employees, vacuum cleaner dust contained varying higher proportions of mine lead than did airborne particulate matter measured as dustfall accumulated over a three month period. The median (range) concentrations of lead in soil were 30 (5 - 407) ppm and these showed no evidence of any mine lead. Lead in blood of the mine employees varied from 7 to 25 micrograms/dl and was generally dominated by mine lead (> 60 %). The mean (SD) PbB in the children of the mine employees was 5. 7 (1. 7) micrograms/dl compared with 4. 1 (1. 4) micrograms/dl for the control children (P = 0. 02). The PbB of all children was always 50 years old. In five of the eight children of mine employees > 20 % of PbB was from the lead mine. However, in the other three cases of children of mine employees, their PbB was from sources other than mine lead (paint, petrol, background sources). CONCLUSIONS: Houses of employees from a lead mine can be contaminated by mine lead even if they are not situated in the same place as the mine. Delineation of the mine to house pathway indicates that lead is probably transported into the houses on the clothes, shoes, hair, skin, and in some cases, motor vehicles of the workers. In one case, dust shaken from clothes of a mine employee contained 3000 ppm lead which was 100 % mine lead. The variable contamination of the houses was not expected given the precautions taken by mine employees to minimise transportation of lead into their houses. Although five out of the eight children of mine employees had > 20 % mine lead in their blood, in no case did the PbB of a child exceed the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council goal of 10 micrograms/dl. In fact, some children in the control families had higher PbB than children of mine employees. In two cases, this was attributed to a pica habit for paint. The PbB in the children of mine employees and controls was independent of the source of lead. The low PbB in the children of mine employees may reflect the relatively low solubility (bioavailability) of the mine dust in 0. 1 M hydrochloric acid (< 40 %), behaviour [...] for example, limited mouthing activity [...] or diet...|$|E
