40|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} (“CMC”) with {{a strong}} fibre-matrix interface can be made damage-tolerant by introducing a highly porous matrix. Such composites typically have only a low interlaminar shear strength, which can potentially promote damage when preparing specimens or components by cutting. In order to investigate the damage induced by different cutting methods, waterjet cutting with and without abrasives, laser-cutting, wire eroding and cutoff grinding were used to cut plates of two different CMCs with a matrix porosity up to 35 vol. -%. For each combination of cutting method and composite, the flexural and interlaminar shear strength of the resulting specimens was determined. Additionally, {{the integrity of the}} regions near the cut surfaces was investigated by high-resolution x-ray computer tomography. It could be shown that the geometrical quality of the cut is strongly affected by the cutting method employed. Laser cut and <b>waterjet</b> <b>cut</b> specimens showed damage and delaminations near the cut surface leading to a reduced interlaminar shear strength of short bend bars in extreme cases...|$|E

Fiber {{reinforced}} composites have been utilized {{for a number of}} different applications, including aircraft, wind turbine, automobile, construction, manufacturing, and many other industries. During the fabrication, machining (waterjet, diamond and band saws) and assembly of these laminate composites, various edge and hole delamination, fiber pullout and other micro and nanocracks can be formed on the composite panels. The present study mainly focuses on the edge grinding and sealing of the machine damaged fiber reinforced composites, such as fiberglass, plain weave carbon fiber and unidirectional carbon fiber. The MTS tensile test results confirmed that the composite coupons from the grinding process usually produced better and consistent mechanical properties compared to the <b>waterjet</b> <b>cut</b> samples only. In addition to these studies, different types of high strength adhesives, such as EPON 828 and Loctite were applied on the edges of the prepared composite coupons and cured under vacuum.

O corte no sistema cria uma ranhura com características próprias. A largura do sulco é maior na entrada que na saída do corte. No corte do polipropileno podem surgir rebarbas na base da chapa como pequenas fibras. Experiência adquirida na confecção de peneiras mostrou que o número de furos é decisivo no custo da peça. Ensaios preliminares simularam alternativas de corte com e sem abrasivo. A abertura de 900 furos numa área de 967 cm² revelou consumir 126 minutos para corte sem abrasivo, contra 201 no caso mais oneroso. A seguir, novos desenhos foram propostos diminuindo a malha, mas, preservando o índice de vazamento. Assim, 145, 218 ou 362 furos são possíveis. O corte de velocidade constante e com abrasivo mostrou-se o mais eficiente. Por outro lado, o modo de abrir o furo influi na qualidade da peneira. A seleção da alternativa adequada, os problemas surgidos durante a investigação e as soluções adotadas foram detalhadamente descritos no estudo.

The cutting process may lead to kerfs with specific characteristics. The kerf width is larger in the entrance than in the jet exit. In cutting polypropylene, burrs in the base of the plate can appear as small staple fibers. Experience acquired in the confection of sieves showed that the number of punctures is decisive in the cost of the part. Preliminary assays simulated cut alternatives with and without abrasive. The opening of 900 punctures in an area of 967 cm² consumes 126 minutes for cutting without abrasive, in contrast to 201 minutes in the most costly case.

40|$|The use of fiber-reinforced {{composite}} materials {{have increased in}} the last four decades in high technology applications due to their exceptional mechanical properties and low weight. In the automotive industry carbon fiber have become popular exclusively in luxury cars because of its high cost. However, Carbon-glass hybrid composites offer an effective alternative to designers to implement fiber-reinforced composites into several conventional applications without a considerable price increase maintaining most of their mechanical properties. A door latch system is a complex mechanism that is under high loading conditions during car accidents such as side impacts and rollovers. Therefore, the Department of Transportation in The United States developed a series of tests that every door latch system comply in order to be installed in a vehicle. The implementation of fiber-reinforced {{composite materials}} in a door latch system was studied by analyzing the material behavior during the FMVSS No. 206 transverse test using computational efforts and experimental testing. Firstly, a computational model of the current forkbolt and detent structure was developed. Several efforts were conducted in order to create an effective and time efficient model. Two simplified models were implemented with two different contact interaction approaches. 9 composite materials were studied in forkbolt and 5 in detent including woven carbon fiber, unidirectional carbon fiber, woven carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites and unidirectional carbon-glass fiber hybrid composites. The computational model results showed that woven fiber-reinforced composite materials were stiffer than the unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite materials. For instance, a forkbolt made of woven carbon fibers was 20 % stiffer than a forkbolt made of unidirectional fibers symmetrically stacked in 0 ° and 90 ° alternating directions. Furthermore, Hybrid composite materials behaved as expected in forkbolt noticing a decline in the load-displacement slopes while the percentage of glass fiber increased. In the other hand, results showed that a detent made of only glass fiber layers was preferable than a carbon-glass fiber hybrid detent due to the high stresses shown in carbon fiber layers. Ultimately, forkbolt and detent were redesigned according to their functionality and test results. It was observed that the new design was stiffer than the original by showing a steeper load-displacement curve. Subsequently, an experimental procedure was performed in order to correlate computational model results. Fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and detent were <b>waterjet</b> <b>cut</b> from a composite laminate manufactured by Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VART) process. Then, samples were tested according to the computational model. Six testing sample combinations of forkbolt and detent were tested including the top three woven iterations forkbolts from the computational model paired with woven and unidirectional glass fiber detents. Test results showed a stiffness drop of 15 % when the carbon fiber percentage decreases from 100 % to 75 %. Also, it was observed that woven glass fiber detent was superior to the unidirectional glass fiber detent by presenting a forkbolt-detent stiffness 38 % higher. Moreover, the new design of forkbolt and detent were tested showing a stiffness increment of 29 %. Furthermore, it was observed that fiber-reinforced composite forkbolt and detent did not reach the desired load of 5000 N. However, the redesigned forkbolt made of 100 % woven carbon fiber and the redesign detent made of 100 % woven glass fiber were close to reach that load. The design review based on test results performed (DRBTR) showed that components did not fail where the computational model concluded to be the areas with the highest maximum principal stress. In contrast to the computational model, all samples failed at the contact area between forkbolt and detent. ...|$|E
40|$|The University of Missouri-Rolla is carving a new sculpture. This {{involves}} shaping 3 rocks, collectively weighing 100 tons, {{and cutting}} figures {{of a man}} and a woman from two blocks. The three blocks will then be erected to form a Millennium Arch and the Figures will be polished as a second set. A relatively inexpensive X-Y table and cutting head unit were developed. The cutting waterjet was without abrasive at under 100 MPa. One problem in cutting large blocks (5 m x 2 m by 0. 75 m) is that the structure changes. A variety of approaches were taken to solve this problem. The process steps required to cut the rock to shape, and then to carve the rock are described in the paper.

40|$|The use of high {{pressure}} waterjets {{is becoming increasingly}} common in industrial operations {{as a means of}} improving productivity. Although waterjets were initially developed as a mining tool, they have found only a limited use to the present time. Recent developments in the technology, however, promise the creation of relatively small light-weight equipment for use in mines. It is important in considering the applications of this tool, however, that both its advantages and limitations be understood.

40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} capability of replacing the cut-off and gate-removal processes at DePuy Synthes (Ireland) with a single cutting operation. Abrasive <b>WaterJet</b> <b>Cutting</b> (AWJC), laser cutting, Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) and plasma cutting were considered as alternatives to the current system. Custom investment castings were produced for use in A WJC experiments to determine the cutting speeds {{for a range of}} cut thickness (2 to 30 mm) for the Cobalt-Chrominum-Molybdenum (CoCrMo) alloy. Femoral and tray castings, each with different tree designs, were evaluated post knockout (vibratory shell removal). Femoral parts were undamaged by jet deflection or wear when utilising the correct set up of the A WJC nozzle. Using a traverse speed of 130 mm/min, the surface finish {{at the bottom of the}} 16 mm thick femoral gate was visually equivalent to the current surface finish obtained after gate removal (Ra of 9 μm). Thin femoral sections (3. 2 mm) cut at 400 mm/min achieved an acceptable Ra of 7 μm with a cycle time of 6 minutes per tree, which was 70 % lower than the current processing time of 23 minutes. Tray castings cut with a traverse speed of 60 mm/min achieved a surface roughness Ra of 10 μm. However, the process was unsuitable for trays because jet deflection below the cut caused excessive wear to the machined parts. The use of AWJC for femorals has the ergonomic benefit of eliminating all manual grinding in the foundry, as well as labour savings equivalent to a Return-On-Investment (ROI) of two years. Further development of a 3 -dimensional (3 - 0) vision system however is required to automate the AWJC of femoral castings...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} more {{automated}} process for drawing and twisting of graphene fibers than was currently in place. This was implemented by having two chemical baths with variable speed rollers at either end, and intermediate roller to spool fiber between stages, and a twisting cylinder with integral spool to twist the fiber as it is collected. The goal was to have this first iteration deliver a working prototype, however due to manufacturing delays and timing constraints, that will be missed. A second follow-on project would be able to continue the work presented here and fulfil the stated aims of the project. The bulk of the structure is fabricated from PVC pieces <b>waterjet</b> <b>cut</b> from a large sheet. This allowed for quick manufacture of most pieces in the design. From there, some secondary machining was done to add mounting and fastening locations. PVC pieces were attached to one another primarily through the use of # 8 - 32 screws with washers and a brass threaded insert. Due to PVC being a soft material, tapping threads into it directly was avoided. The baths were sealed mostly with an automotive gasket compound to permanently seal one half, while one wall was sealed with a silicon gasket laser cut from a sheet. This makes the bath wall removable for maintenance. Two baths were made to allow multiple stages of drawing or one coagulation stage immediately followed by a drawing stage. From the drawing, the fiber advances to the auxiliary roller. The range of speeds required to get desired properties at all stages did not permit the fiber to go from coagulation to drawing to twisting in one process, therefore following the drawing bath, it is wound on to the auxiliary roller. After the drawing process is finished, the fiber can be pulled from the auxiliary roller into the twisting mechanism, running at a lower speed so as to give the requisite number of turns per length of fiber to yield the optimal fiber twist angle. The twisting mechanism is a PVC cylinder supported on horizontal rods and driven by a motor mounted beneath the cylinder and connected via a plastic belt. The cylinder, motor, and support rods are encased in a box with one face open to allow the fiber into the cylinder. Inside the cylinder is a spinning rod mounted across the diameter that collects the fiber as it is twisted. The aim of the project called for a quick-release mechanism so that the rod can be removed quickly for storage of the fiber or other testing steps. All of the motion is powered by small 5 V DC motors that go through a 20 : 1 worm gear reduction. This increases the torque while decreasing the speed from roughly 10, 000 RPM to more useful ranges. The motors are powered through a NPN power transistor with the logic being controlled by an Arduino Nano that takes in an analog voltage and converts it to a PWM waveform to control the motor duty cycle. In total, the project came in under budget, using 84. 01 % of the $ 1500 allocated for the project. A third of this cost came from the need to expedite the waterjet cutting by going to a third-party outside of the campus community. Had on campus resources been successfully utilized, the total cost would have been closer to the $ 925. 38 estimate first presented...|$|E

This population has more co morbidities such as impaired ventricular function, coronary disease, peripheral vascular disease and renal insufficiency. These co morbid {{factors have been}} described as independent factors of mortality in this older population. Open heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass to replace the aortic valve is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) is a new approach to minimize the morbidity and mortality in selected high risk patients. In this technique, the calcified native valve remains in situ has to be squeezed between the transcatheter valve and the aortic wall. This leads to several problems: implantation of the valve into a non-circular calcified annulus with a risk of severe paravalvular leak, risk of coronary ostia occlusion, embolization of debris, increase the mitral insufficiency, too small effective aortic valve area. For this reason, resection of the native valve before implantation of the new valve makes sense for many surgeons who tried to develop an endovascular tool to remove the native valve. Several resection methods have been published using <b>waterjet,</b> laser <b>cut</b> or foldable cutting edges. In our study we describe a novel resection device designed for use in transapical and transaortic access. We also analyse the risk of cerebral embolisation during TAVI.

In order to enhance waterjet pressure for cutting products, a modified waterjet nozzle was designed. Paramater design of waterjet system was setup on nozzle orifice diameter 0. 5 mm, standoff distance 15 mm, length of nozzle cylindrical tube 2. 5 mm.
