5|$|Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball {{video game}} themed after the Metroid series. The game uses the {{graphical}} style and various story elements from Metroid Prime. It {{was developed by}} Fuse Games for the Nintendo DS handheld game console, and released by Nintendo in North America and Australia in 2005, in Japan in 2006, and in Europe in 2007. Metroid Prime Pinball uses the basic mechanics of pinball, along with typical pinball items. New mechanics are introduced, such as wall jumping {{and the ability to}} fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be nudged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> to alter the pinball's trajectory while in motion.|$|E

(In antiquity, kneeling or squatting was a more common birthing position {{than it is in}} modern times; see di nixi.) The midwife then cut the umbilical cord and presented the newborn to the mother, a scene sometimes depicted on sarcophagi. A grandmother or maternal aunt next cradled the infant in her arms; <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> covered in lustral saliva, she massaged the baby's forehead and lips, a gesture meant to ward off the evil eye.|$|E
25|$|Evans {{made his}} fourth tour to Australia in 1958/59, {{but it was}} a disappointing one for him and the team. England went into the series as favourites, having won the {{previous}} three Ashes series, but lost convincingly 4–0. Evans played three Test matches, missing the third <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> injury and, despite his returning for the fourth, a recurrence of that injury resulted in his missing the fifth. With the bat Evans scored 27 runs in six innings, four of which totalled only four runs. Wisden wrote that Evans was among several established players who showed a 'decline in power'.|$|E

Nine years later, while at a post office, an armed robber {{attempted}} to shoot a pregnant woman, but lost control of the gun after Shino bit his hand. Afterwards, she shot him three times, killing him. Since, she developed a fear of guns, entering panic attacks whenever one is visible. As a result, she is bullied at school by her peers, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> gun being enough to trigger her phobia. To help ease her trauma, her friend Kyōji Shinkawa convinced her to play Gun Gale Online. Known as Sinon ingame, her main weapon is the «PGM Ultima Ratio Hecate II» sniper rifle, which she earned after defeating a monster in a dungeon.|$|E
25|$|After two poor seasons Bell {{was back}} to his best in 2004, he scored 1498 Championship runs which {{included}} six centuries. One of the six was a career-best 262 not out against Sussex; the innings lasting ten minutes short of ten hours made him the county's youngest ever double-centurion. In late July he began an impressive sequence of four centuries in five first-class innings, the other being a score of 96 not out. The centuries in both innings against Lancashire were the first by a Warwickshire batsman against an authentic attack (David Hemp achieved the feat against declaration bowling) since Brian Lara in 1994. This run of form led to him being brought into the England Test squad when Graham Thorpe was left doubtful <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> injury.|$|E
25|$|Warne {{missed the}} entire Australian summer of 2000–01 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> injury, {{and found himself}} battling Stuart MacGill and an in-form Colin Miller to be {{selected}} for Australia's tour of India in early 2001. MacGill was ultimately the spinner left out. Warne took 10 wickets over the three-Test series {{at an average of}} 50.50. His Indian spin counterpart Harbhajan Singh was the man of the series with 32 wickets at an average of 17.03. Australia lost the series 2–1. In the northern summer of 2001, Warne made his third Ashes tour and took 31 wickets in the five-Test series, which Australia won 4–1. He took three five-wicket hauls in the series. In the final Test at The Oval he took 11 wickets across both innings, including the 400th wicket of his Test career (Alec Stewart). He became the sixth person and the first Australian in the history of cricket to reach the milestone.|$|E

25|$|There is less {{research}} on anal sexual activity among {{women who have}} sex with women compared to couples of other sexual orientations. In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last ten sexual encounters, lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> or dildo). While author Tom Boellstorff, when particularly examining anal sex among gay and lesbian individuals in Indonesia, stated that he had not heard of oral-anal contact or anal penetration as recognized forms of lesbian sexuality but assume they take place, author Felice Newman cites anal sex as a part of lesbian sexual practices. A 2014 study of partnered lesbian women in Canada and the U.S. found that 7% engaged in anal stimulation or penetration at least once a week; about 10% did so monthly and 70% did not at all.|$|E
25|$|In reply Australia started strongly, with Ponting {{having to}} wait until 123 runs were scored before walking out to bat on the third day. After {{surviving}} a spell reverse-swing bowling from Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan, Ponting was bowled through the gate from a sharp turning delivery from part-time off-spinner Virender Sehwag. Ponting and out-of-form opener Matthew Hayden partnered for a cautious 79-run compilation, as both looked to survive on a pitch that was becoming lower and slower. Ponting was more cautious against Sharma than usual, scoring only nine from 26 balls from the tall right-armer quick. Nevertheless, he was more aggressive and assured against spinners Amit Mishra and Sehwag, where he scored 35 from 60 and 17 from 32 deliveries respectively. During the early stage of his innings, a swarm of bees interrupted the match when they forced the players and officials to lie on the ground, before they moved on. After surviving four dropped catches, Michael Clarke scored his eight Test century in during Australia's highest Test score in India—577—as Sehwag took a career best five wickets {{in the absence of}} fellow spinners Harbhajan Singh and Kumble who left the field <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> injury. India lost two late Indian wickets on the fourth evening and were reduced to 4/93 on the fifth morning; however the match ended in a tame draw, with the home side declaring on 5/208, setting Australia an unrealistic target of 245 in the final session. They finished on 31 without loss, before the match was declared a draw, resulting in Australia needing victory in the final Test to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Newman's {{score was}} {{recorded}} in Santa Monica, California. He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm, the inspiration for which was provided by Mendes. Newman [...] "favored pulse, rhythm, and color over melody", making for a more minimalist score than he had previously created. He built each cue around [...] "small, endlessly repeating phrases"—often, the only variety through a [...] "thinning of the texture for eight bars". The percussion instruments included tablas, bongos, cymbals, piano, xylophones, and marimbas; also featured were guitars, flute, and world music instruments. Newman also used electronic music and on [...] "quirkier" [...] tracks employed more unorthodox methods, such as tapping metal mixing bowls <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> and using a detuned mandolin. Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the [...] "moral ambiguity" [...] of the script: [...] "It was a real delicate balancing act {{in terms of what}} music worked to preserve [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Nintendo DS {{games that}} use the device's top and bottom screens as one {{continuous}} screen are harder to control because of {{a gap in the}} middle, sometimes called a visual [...] "dead zone"; objects in this area are not visible. The developers of Metroid Prime Pinball, a game which takes advantage of both screens, resolved this problem by placing a second set of pinball flippers {{at the bottom of the}} upper screen to give players a reference to work with. The tabletops in the game use pre-rendered artwork for graphical effects, including Samus's Morph Ball, which uses renderings of images at several different angles to provide a smooth animation. To simulate the appearance of a real pinball game from a player's point of view, the tabletop in Metroid Prime Pinball was tipped back. The game offers players the ability to nudge the table, a technique used in pinball games to influence the ball's movement. This is achieved by touching the Nintendo DS's bottom touchscreen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> and pushing it in the direction that the player wants to nudge the tabletop. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Masaru Tajima, with audio effects from the Metroid Prime series are borrowed by the game to provide a [...] "CD-like" [...] music experience. The voice of the Power Suit was provided by Lorelei King.|$|E
