5|$|According to Herodotus, the Persian commanders were {{concerned}} that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to defeat the Ionian fleet and, therefore, <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to take Miletus. So they sent the exiled Ionian tyrants to Lade, where each tried to persuade his fellow citizens to desert to the Persians. This approach was initially unsuccessful, but in the week-long delay before the battle, divisions arose in the Ionian camp. These divisions led to the Samians secretly agreeing to the terms offered by the Persians, but remained with the other Ionians for the time being.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{claimed that}} Enron was {{planning}} to explain its business practices more fully within the coming days, as a confidence-building gesture. Enron's stock was now trading at around $7, as investors worried that the company <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to find a buyer.|$|E
50|$|Imbibition is {{a special}} type of {{diffusion}} when water is absorbed by solids-colloids causing an enormous increase in volume. Examples include the absorption of water by seeds and dry wood. If it <b>were</b> <b>not</b> for the pressure due to imbibition, seedlings <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to emerge out of soil into the open; they probably <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to establish.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least some}} of the women who worked at Sheik arrived in such a state of poverty that the nightclub or its {{managers}} had to extend credit for the airplane fare, clothes for the women to wear while working, and housing.

50|$|The {{dry heat}} of the Punjab had a bad effect on Alice's health. Two years after she arrived {{it was clear that}} she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to {{maintain}} a good quality of life in India, and so Wellesley resigned from the American Mission and together they returned to Ireland.|$|R
5|$|During the 1960s, {{developments}} {{in the pattern of}} oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economical to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier (ULCC) vessels. These vessels were so large that they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to enter most of the older ports on the Atlantic Ocean, North Sea, and English Channel coasts.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, Summit Entertainment {{scheduled}} a film adaptation of Eclipse, the third novel in the Twilight series, for release on June 30, 2010. Weitz <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to direct the}} third film of The Twilight Saga {{as it would be}} filming while New Moon would be in post-production. David Slade was therefore confirmed as the director of The Twilight Saga: Eclipse on April 22, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Monroe and Fox {{had come}} to an {{agreement}} about a new seven-year contract. It was clear that MMP <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to finance films alone, and the studio was eager to have Monroe working again. The contract required her to make four movies for Fox during the seven years. The studio would pay her $100,000 for each movie, and granted her the right to choose her own projects, directors and cinematographers. She would also be free to make one film with MMP per each completed film for Fox.|$|E

5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been {{troublesome}} for some time, she suffered {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised that she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{concerning}} {{the scope and}} nature of base development in the Admiralty Islands were held in early February between representatives of SWPA and Admiral William Halsey, Jr.'s neighbouring South Pacific Area (SOPAC). The original intention was forces from SWPA would capture the islands and construct the airbase, while SOPAC {{would be responsible for}} the development of the naval base. The SOPAC representatives indicated they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to supply troops or materials in the early stages, so it was resolved SWPA would also undertake the initial stages of naval base development.|$|E
5|$|During peace {{negotiations}} {{after the end}} of the war in 1918, she was interned with other ships of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919 the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to seize the ships. The wreck was raised in 1929 and broken up in Rosyth in 1930.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic {{through the tunnel}} would rise on {{the completion of the}} M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to cope with the full demands of a completed M25.|$|E
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the ball back, indicating that his body <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E
5|$|Even after Suys' {{proposal}} was officially adopted, Anspach faced strong {{opposition to the}} project. This opposition came first from engineers who felt that the covering was incompatible with Brussels’s geology, would accumulate potentially dangerous gases and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to handle enough water to prevent floods. Others opposed to the project complained about the high taxes resulting from its high cost, poor compensation for seized property {{and the lack of}} public input into the project. The press accused Anspach of being responsible for demolishing Brussels' old town, and published numerous caricatures mocking him.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{analysts believe}} that the Italian {{campaign}} failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient resources to the campaign (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men), failed to reckon with the autumn weather, attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support. Elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken. Mussolini had not considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War Production, that Italy <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.|$|E
5|$|On {{its return}} to base, the {{expedition}} {{learned of the}} presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales, 200miles (320km) to their east. Scott conceded that his ponies <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to start early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen's cold-tolerant dog teams for the pole, and also acknowledged that the Norwegian's base was closer to the pole by 60 miles.|$|E
5|$|Roy {{started the}} first month of the season scoring at his normal rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which have bothered him since college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers {{announced}} that he would be out indefinitely. It was widely speculated that Roy <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play at an All-Star level again. This forced the team to start running its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews.|$|E
