5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the National Hurricane Center {{determined}} if the non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas {{developed into a}} tropical or subtropical storm, it would be named Odette. In post-season analysis, the center considered classifying the system as an unnumbered tropical depression, though lack of sufficient characteristics of a tropical depression prevented the classification. If Nicholas had attained hurricane status, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of eight tropical cyclones to reach hurricane status in October in the deep tropical Atlantic since 1900.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work. In reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice {{that has been used}} on a number of unmanned planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the first approaches that everyone within NASA would have considered.|$|E

5|$|The Environmental Assessment Scoping Report for the {{proposed}} station was submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry in 2007, and the application for the development was {{to be made to}} the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform once the Environmental Impact Assessment was completed. A contract had already been signed with the Shaw Group to design and engineer the station. If Npower had been granted permission to build the new station, construction work would have begun in 2010, and the station was expected to be fully commissioned by 2014. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the most efficient coal-fired power stations of its size in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The castle's Norman stone fortifications {{were added}} {{possibly}} {{as early as}} the 1080s onwards, and were finished before 1115, based around what is now the inner bailey of the castle, forming a stone version of a ringwork. It had four towers and a gatehouse tower along the walls, with a ditch dug out of the rock along two sides, the excavated stone being reused for the building works, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the very first masonry castles in England. With its circular design and grand entrance tower, it has been likened to the earlier Anglo-Saxon burgheat designs. In 1096, Roger was stripped of his lands after rebelling against William II and they were reassigned to Roger's brother, Hugh.|$|E
5|$|Fowler's first {{involvement}} with the Liverpool first team came on 13 January 1993, {{when he was an}} unused substitute in an FA Cup third round tie against Bolton Wanderers. In the following close season, Fowler helped the England under-18 team win the 1993 European Championship, before making a scoring first-team debut in Liverpool's 3–1 win in a first round League Cup tie at Fulham on 22 September 1993. Fowler scored all five goals in the second leg at Anfield two weeks later, making him the fourth player in Liverpool's history to score five in a senior fixture. He scored his first league hat-trick against Southampton in only his fifth league game. His very first league goal for the Reds had come on 16 October 1993, when an 87th-minute equaliser at home to struggling Oldham Athletic saved the Reds from what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the biggest Premier League shocks of the season, with a last gasp own goal giving Liverpool a 2–1 win. He scored twice in a thrilling 3–3 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on 18 December.|$|E

5|$|It was {{suggested}} that the stadium <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the venues of a proposed UEFA Euro 2016 championship hosted jointly by Wales and Scotland. However, the bid did not reach the formal UEFA selection stage having been abandoned by the Welsh and Scottish Football Associations for financial reasons. In April 2014, the FAW did submit a formal bid to host three group matches and either a round of 16 match or a quarter-final at Euro 2020, which UEFA planned to host at 13 venues across Europe. When the host venues were voted on in September 2014, the Millennium Stadium lost out by a single vote behind Glasgow's Hampden Park, a decision that FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford put down to UEFA politics. On 30 June 2015, the Millennium Stadium {{was chosen as the}} venue for the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final. The game was played on 3 June 2017 between Italian club Juventus and Spanish club Real Madrid, in a repeat of the 1998 final; Madrid won the match 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{levels were}} lower during the Pleistocene, {{so it was}} {{possible}} for species to colonise the Mascarene Islands from other areas. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Réunion is 3 million years old, which is enough time for new genera to evolve, but many endemics would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano Piton des Neiges between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent and extant species would therefore probably be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event. If the Mascarene parrot had in fact evolved into a distinct genus on Réunion prior to the volcanic eruption, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the few survivors of this extinction event.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological evidence, and {{particularly}} {{the design of the}} gun ports in the gatehouse and St. Margaret's Tower, which together with the curtain wall are the oldest parts of the castle, indicate that the castle was probably built in the late 15th century.

25|$|It is not {{possible}} to determine the number and disposition of parting lines of the fuselage skin.

The average thickness of the skin <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> quarter inch with additional laminations providing attaching points for the internal structure. Given the overall use of Duraloid throughout the airframe components it is reasonable to believe the bonding was accomplished using the Bakelite-based resin.|$|E
25|$|The Giants wasted {{several seconds}} in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and {{took it upon himself}} to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants knelt on the {{subsequent}} play, there still <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E
25|$|Most, but not all, of {{the county}} was covered with the ice sheet during the last Ice age. As the ice retreated, County Wexford <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the first areas to be covered with glacial drift (a mixture of boulders, clay, sand and gravel) that {{blanketed}} the existing bedrock. This has led to high quality soils, suitable {{for a wide range}} of agriculture.

25|$|St Hilda's parish {{church at}} the {{junction}} of Stanwell and Woodthorpe Roads was founded as a daughter church of St Matthew's to serve the rapidly expanding community around the railway station. Construction started in 1912 {{and most of the}} church was built in the first few years, but the chancel and some other parts were not completed until 1928. St Hilda's original design included a spire that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of the most significant landmarks in the area, but it was never built. St Hilda's was initially a conventual district of St Matthew's parish, but is now a separate ecclesiastical parish. The easternmost parts of Ashford Common are in the parish of St Saviour's, Sunbury.|$|E
25|$|The {{station was}} {{proposed}} as a transfer station between the never-built Queens Super-Express Bypass {{as part of}} the 1968 Program for Action, which would have significantly expanded railway and subway service in the five boroughs. Under a 1984 plan, the new express station <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of three stops on the 63rd Street Line extension east of 21st Street–Queensbridge, the other two stops being at Northern Boulevard and Woodside. The bypass station would have had a mezzanine, two platform levels (an upper platform for Jamaica- and Southeast Queens-bound trains; a lower platform for Manhattan-bound trains), a new elevator entrance, and an expanded mezzanine, with escalators and stairs connecting the new platform levels to the existing platforms. The new station would have been built {{on the south side of}} Queens Boulevard, south of the existing station.|$|E
25|$|The Parish Church of St Andrew is {{traditionally}} recognised as 'the oldest church in this town'. The present building was {{begun in the}} 12th Century and the last addition to it, apart from the vestries, was the main porch in 1726. It {{is quite possible that}} there was an earlier church here dating from Saxon times. This older church <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> of several churches along the River Tyne dedicated to St Andrew, including the Priory church at Hexham. The building contains more old stonework than any other church in Newcastle. It is surrounded by the last of the ancient churchyards to retain its original character. Many key names associated with Newcastle's history worshipped and were buried here. The church tower received a battering during the Siege of Newcastle by the Scots who finally breached the Town Wall and forced surrender. Three of the cannonballs remain on site as testament to the siege.|$|E
