5|$|In 1979, Moxon and Carla Smith had a daughter, Stacy Grove Meyer. Meyer died on June 25, 2000 {{after she}} {{fell off a}} ladder and was {{electrocuted}} after touching a 7,200-volt wire while working at Golden Era Productions. Golden Era Productions was cited by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health for improper <b>wiring</b> <b>precautions</b> near a vault where Grove Meyer had been working. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigated the incident, and determined that her death {{was not related to}} the safety violations at the facility. Grove Meyer had worked for two years at Golden Era Productions in landscaping and maintenance.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{the scene}} in which John almost falls to his death while {{restoring}} the mosaic in San Nicol√≤ church was also beset by problems, and resulted in Donald Sutherland's life being put in danger. [...] The scene entailed some of the scaffolding collapsing leaving John dangling by a rope, but the stuntman refused to perform the stunt because the insurance was not in order. Sutherland ended up doing it instead, and was attached to a kirby <b>wire</b> as a <b>precaution</b> in case he should fall. Some time after the film had come out, renowned stunt co-ordinator Vic Armstrong commented to Sutherland that the wire was not designed for that purpose, and the twirling around caused by {{holding on to the}} rope would have damaged the wire to the extent it would have snapped if Sutherland had let go.|$|R
