40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Many people, if asked, <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{are morally}} responsible only for actions we voluntarily and intentionally choose to perform. But {{the phenomenon of}} unintentional omission poses a special problem for this view about the preconditions of moral responsibility. Imagine a lifeguard who carelessly fell asleep while on duty and, as a result, failed (unintentionally) to assist a struggling swimmer as she should have. It seems that what the lifeguard is morally responsible for in this circumstance is not an intentionally chosen action, but an unintentional omission. I argue that unintentional omissions like these can at least sometimes be understood to reflect an agent's judgments {{about the significance of}} normative reasons. This is all that is required for an agent to be morally responsible for an unintentional omission. My argument helps to explain why the view <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are morally responsible only for actions we voluntarily and intentionally choose to perform is mistaken...|$|R

40|$|Cloned {{animals are}} often {{understood}} as 'models' whose embodiments demonstrate {{the viability of}} somatic cell nuclear transfer and its applicability to a species body. In conceptualizing models through the trope of technoscience, Evelyn Fox Keller has argued that scientific models are not simply cognitive representations of something else, but are also embodiments of action and practice that constitute the kinds of scientific questions that can be asked and how those questions can be answered. Drawing on Keller's language, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> while <b>we</b> understand cloned animals as 'models of' somatic cell nuclear transfer, little empirical scholarship has explored what these animals are 'models for'. This article asks what practices cloned animals embody, focusing on endeavours to clone endangered wildlife in the United States. Based on a multi-sited, ethnographic study, I show that these animals are models for conducting science in zoological parks, which entails questions regarding the kinds of knowledge practices that {{should be used to}} reproduce zoos and, in turn, meaningfully reconstitute wildlife. Based on this analysis, I contend that cloned animals not only model technique and scientific practices, but also new assemblages in the reproduction of zoos and, in turn, nature...|$|R

5000|$|I am not {{convinced}} {{at all that}} these motifs, themes, or the intervallic symbology are necessarily so old-fashioned. I <b>would</b> rather <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have been reducing ourselves to a far too primitive use of these conceptions. Of course the contrast between chromaticism and diatonicism does not exist any more; ... I am convinced that musical symbolism does exist, even if only, unfortunately, in a very primitive form. In my opinion most of today's theatrical solutions are just naive attempts to simplify an extremely complex problem—a problem which should not be dealt with as a game—at least not with those means—but rather as a formal problem.Take Pousseur's Votre Faust. Pousseur {{wanted to create a}} symbolic synthesis, but unfortunately he achieved it only by means of quotations: and a theatre of mere quotations reminds one of a school, where {{at the end of the}} lessons the schoolboys mimic their teachers: of course the whole class bursts into laughter, yet the connotative possibilities are obviously limited. Works based on quotations also make one think of advertisements: they may be amusing the first time one sees them, but by the second time they have lost their interest, because they are not stylistically structural, but rather without structure and all alike. I think we ought to try to find a structural correspondence between theatrical and musical semantics, so that symbology is not limited to the motifs and themes of a work, but is included in the theatrical structure itself.|$|R

40|$|Physicalism is {{the claim}} that {{that there is nothing}} in the world but the physical. Philosophers who defend physicalism have to confront a {{well-known}} dilemma, known as Hempel’s dilemma, concerning the definition of “the physical”: if “the physical ” is whatever current physics says there is, then physicalism is most probably false; but if “the physical ” is whatever the true theory of physics <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there is, <b>we</b> have <b>that</b> physicalism is vacuous and runs the risk of becoming trivial. This paper has two parts. The first, negative, part is devoted to developing a criticism of the so-called via negativa response to Hempel’s dilemma. In the second, more substantial, part, I propose to take the first horn of Hempel’s dilemma. However, I argue for a broad construal of “current physics ” and characterize “the physical ” accordingly. The virtues of the broad characterization of “the physical ” are: first, it makes physicalism less likely to be false; and second, it ties our understanding of “the physical ” to the reasons we have for believing in physicalism. That is, it fulfills the desideratum of construing our theses according to the reasons we have to believe in them. 1...|$|R
