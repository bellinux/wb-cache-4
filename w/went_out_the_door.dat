60|$|Sadly I {{dropped them}} back into my pocket, sadly we yearned toward the blessed stove and the arm-chairs, and sadly we <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> into the frosty night.|$|E
60|$|There was no answer, so he {{took his}} basket and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> the cat {{following}} him. In {{the middle of the}} path sat the Patchwork Girl, playing with pebbles she had picked up.|$|E

5000|$|So I {{had those}} things in the basement, higgledy-piggledy, my wife looked there every now and then, flipped through the {{drawings}} and saw many nude studies. She said to me: That I {{do not want to}} have in my house, it must go. I said: you can never know what those things {{may turn out to be}} worth, but my wife said: those things <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> or I <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> In such a case, things <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> So I <b>went</b> into my basement one day, picked up all drawings that were somewhat offensive, put them in a big bag and when that bag was full, I brought it to the paper factory of Tilburg to be ground to paper; I've had a few dimes for it.|$|R

60|$|This sudden request in {{the midst}} of a council on wages of men, wood, and grub {{surprised}} Billebedam. Besides, it was early in the day, and he had never known white men of the calibre of Pentfield and Hutchinson to dice and play till the day's work was done. But his face was impassive as a Yukon Indian's should be, as he pulled on his mittens and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Once more came a swift {{step on the}} stairs, as of one {{stumbling}} up in haste. The key rattled in the wards, {{a yellow}} light shone in, a man-at- arms entered; he held a torch to my face, looked to my bonds, and then gave me a kick, while one cried from below, [...] "Come on, Dickon, your meat is cooling!" [...] So he turned and <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> clanging behind him, and the key rattling in the wards.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. They {{will put}} {{on all the}} {{confidence}} they can, they will trick and trim up their profession, and adorn it with what bravery they can. Thus the foolish virgins sought to enter in; they did trim up their lamps, made themselves as fine as they could. They made shift to make their lamps to shine awhile; but the Son of God discovering himself, their confidence failed, their lamps <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> was shut upon them, and they were kept out.

[...] In 1961, when Weld was 18, she had an {{off-screen}} romance with Elvis Presley, her co-star in Wild in the Country.|$|E
2500|$|... “When we {{get ready}} to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> I {{want to make sure}} that my Soldiers are disciplined and trained, ready for any task that comes our way, When you’re not disciplined, you start to get complacent, start making mistakes, and that’s when you start getting hurt and are unable to perform your mission.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Eudell Jackobson of GM {{engineering}} {{pointed out}} one of the early problems with unexplained scuffing and discovered excessive pressure on the bore hones was causing the silicon to crack. This need to both develop and actually manufacture the engine was a product of the program schedule.
