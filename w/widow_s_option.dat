40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of possibly frivolous litigation by focusing on a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>options</b> to unilaterally abandon a lawsuit. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41 (a) (1) (i) and its various state law counterparts permit, under certain circumstances, a plaintiff to voluntarily dismiss her lawsuit without prejudice. This paper 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>options</b> approach to litigation, including quite possibly, frivolous litigation {{is placed in the}} context of the literature of economic models about litigation in general and frivolous litigation in particular. This paper demonstrates that possibly frivolous lawsuits will be filed and settled when the values of a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>options</b> to unilaterally abandon litigation exceed the costs of purchasing those litigation-abandonment options by continuing the litigation. This paper also addresses some of the limitations of an abandonment options game-theoretic model of litigation. In particular, there is reason to believe that people have cognitive limitations in their abilities to reason backwards in sequential interactions. Empirical and experimental evidence also exists that indicates that emotions affect how people make decisions. Finally, recent psychological experiments indicate that decision makers often overvalue options and over-invest in keeping options alive, even if those options present little intrinsic value. This paper briefly explains how and why many laws and judicial doctrines effectively preclude specific legal options. Appendix A provides an accessible, non-technical, self-contained, and user-friendly primer about options for those unfamiliar with options. Appendix B contains a formal, mathematical game-theoretic analysis of a plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>options</b> to unilaterally abandon a lawsuit...|$|R

When owners delegate the management to managers, contracts must be designed to provide incentive for managers to truthfully reveal private information. Using a contingent claims approach, we demonstrate that an underlying option value of the firm can be decomposed into two components: a managerâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 <b>s</b> <b>option</b> and an ownerâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 <b>s</b> <b>option.</b> The value of a decentralized firm is lower than that of an owner-managed firm.

30|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} RCOT {{representation}} {{to include the}} absence of technological options for a sector (i.e., no capacity to produce), a true generalization of the original case (Duchin and Levine [2011]) of 1 through <b>s</b> technological <b>options</b> for a sector {{to the case of}} 0 through <b>s</b> <b>options.</b> We also fully incorporate the extended RCOT model into the World Trade Model. The extended World Trade Model (WTM/RCOT) representation has the new feature that a region may use identifiable imported inputs that it cannot produce itself, the so-called non-competitive imports, that typically are vital for an economy such as resource commodities or capital goods. While non-competitive imports are often aggregated by money value into a single category in one-region input-output tables, a WTM/RCOT analysis permits them to be explicitly identified. An economy with many non-competitive imports will generally be represented by a rectangular input-output matrix with more rows than columns.|$|R

We demonstrate that collective provision of reductions in supply uncertainty does not necessitate a positive option value, given that uncertainty is influenced by the individual 2 ̆ 7 s ability to adapt through self-protection. We conclude that the total value of reducing the supply uncertainty of a natural resource is reflected in both the individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>option</b> price payments for collective provision and in his willingness-to-pay for adaptation through self-protection. By ignoring adaptive self-protection, traditional benefit-cost analysis has systematically underestimated the total value of environmental resources that are characterized by uncertain supplies...|$|R

In essence, the proposed fee calls for the payment, on a contingent basis, of an amount computed by adding one component tied to hours worked and another component linked to amount recovered.

Although euphausiids were the most common major prey of all three predators, gelatinous zooplankton and fishes were the most commonly consumed prey items during some seasonal quarters.

Anomalous prey items, including the southern euphausiid species Nyctiphanes simplex and juveniles of Pacific whiting (Merluccius productus) frequently appeared in the diets {{in the spring and summer}} of 1998. The results of stomach contents analyses, based on 905 stomach samples from 49 trawl hauls during seven commercial fishing trips and from 56 stations during research surveys, were consistent with the timing of occurrence and the magnitude of change in biomass of some zooplankton species reported from zooplankton studies in the northern California Current during the 1997 – 98 El Niño.
