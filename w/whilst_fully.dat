The quartz material 'hardens' the ReB protecting the nuclear warhead against high-energy neutrons emitted by exo-atmospheric Anti-ballistic missile (ABM) bursts before re-entry.

The present analysis suggests that two saturated impulses can be defined for an elastic, perfectly plastic structure: one is for the maximum deformation {{and the other is}} for the permanent (final) deformation of the structure. In general, the former is smaller than the latter. For the clamped square plates calculated, these two saturated impulses in the high load range lie between the upper and the lower bounds of the saturated impulse obtained from a rigid, perfectly plastic analysis; and finally, a `'saturated duration'' for loading pulse (critical pulse length) is proposed.

50|$|On 14 January 1895, the king, {{after the}} fall of the Kálmán Széll ministry, {{entrusted}} him with the formation of a cabinet. His programme, in brief, was the carrying through of the church reform laws with all due regard to clerical susceptibilities, and the maintenance of the Composition of 1867, <b>whilst</b> <b>fully</b> guaranteeing the predominance of Hungary. He succeeded in carrying the remaining ecclesiastical bills through the Upper House, despite the vehement opposition of the papal nuncio Antonio Agliardi, a triumph which brought about the fall of Gustav Kálnoky, the minister for foreign affairs, but greatly strengthened the ministry in Hungary. In the ensuing elections of 1896 the government won a gigantic majority. The drastic electoral methods of Bánffy had, however, contributed somewhat to this result, and the corrupt practices were the pretext for the fierce opposition in the House which he henceforth had to encounter, though the measures which he now introduced (the Honved Officers' Schools Bill) would, in normal circumstances, have been received with general enthusiasm.|$|E
5000|$|Like Schneider, other anthropologists {{of kinship}} have largely {{rejected}} sociobiological accounts of human social patterns as being both reductionistic and also empirically incompatible with ethnographic data on human kinship. Notably, Marshall Sahlins strongly critiqued the sociobiological approach through reviews of ethnographies in his 1976 The Use and Abuse of Biology noting that for humans [...] "the categories of 'near' and 'distant' kin vary independently of consanguinal distance {{and that these}} categories organize actual social practice" [...] (p. 112). Independently from anthropology, biologists studying organisms' social behaviours and relationships have been interested to understand under what conditions significant social behaviors can evolve to become a typical feature of a species (see inclusive fitness theory). Because complex social relationships and cohesive social groups are common not only to humans, but also to most primates, biologists maintain that these biological theories of sociality should in principle be generally applicable. The more challenging question arises as to how such ideas {{can be applied to}} the human species <b>whilst</b> <b>fully</b> taking account of the extensive ethnographic evidence that has emerged from anthropological research on kinship patterns.|$|E
5000|$|M113A1 Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle (MRV) - Full {{designation}} Carrier, Fire Support, Full Track M113A1 (FS) Scorpion Turret was an Australian variant {{similar to}} the M113 FSV, but using the turret from the FV101 Scorpion light tank, instead of the older turret of the Saladin armoured car, that the FSV had previously used. This turret was equipped with an Image Intensifier sight for the main armament. This II sight was the first effective passive night sight fitted to an Australian AFV, giving the MRVs a night fighting capability exceeding the Leopard AS1 and all other Australian AFVs of the period. <b>Whilst</b> <b>fully</b> amphibious, the MRV was also fitted with a light sheet metal foam filled trim vane and side pods. These pods and the trim vane were intended to provide additional flotation and stability on the water, they provided virtually no additional armour protection. Other changes include a modified driver's hatch which pivoted toward the centre line of the vehicle instead of opening {{to the rear of}} the driver's hatch, this feature preventing the open driver's hatch being caught on the traversing turret, as well as the fitting of the British [...] "boiling vessel" [...] an electric vessel for boiling water and heating rations. As indicated by the designation change, the MRVs were roled as reconnaissance vehicles and issued to the Cavalry (medium reconnaissance) regiments, whereas the FSVs were originally issued to APC squadrons and used to provide infantry fire support.|$|E
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that engaging in resistance exercise can lead to further improvements in endurance performance. <b>Whilst,</b> not <b>fully</b> understood, it is speculated that increased motor unit recruitment, improved muscle coordination and enhanced utilisation of stored elastic energy after resistance-based exercise improves exercise economy. Nevertheless, while prolonged exposure to resistance training improves endurance performance in the long-term, a consequence of such training when unaccustomed is the appearance of exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD). Exercise-induced muscle damage is well known to affect athletic performance requiring muscular strength and power; however, its effects on markers of endurance exercise are unclear. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} thesis was to investigate the effects of EIMD on endurance performance, with an emphasis on the physiological (oxygen uptake;, minute ventilation;), metabolic (blood lactate; [La]), perceptual (rating of perceived exertion; RPE) and kinematic (stride length; SL, stride frequency; SF) responses during sub-maximal endurance exercise...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{a variety}} of sources reveal a warm-core {{anticyclonic}} circulation above the Northwest Georgia Rise (NWGR), an similar to 2000 -m high bathymetric feature north of South Georgia. The sense of the circulation is opposite to the general cyclonic flow in the Georgia Basin. The circulation shows the characteristics of a stratified Taylor column: dimensional analysis shows that the local bathymetry and hydrography are conducive to the formation of such. ERS 2 altimeter data show that the column, <b>whilst</b> not <b>fully</b> permanent, is nonetheless a recurring feature. High concentrations of chlorophyll-a are observed at the centre of the circulation, indicating that the modulation of the physical environment has significant consequences for the local biogeochemical system via enhanced primary production. Enhanced chlorophyll-a extends in a long plume from the NWGR along pathways indicated by drifters; this passive redistribution may have consequences for the larger (basin-) scale ecosystem...|$|R
