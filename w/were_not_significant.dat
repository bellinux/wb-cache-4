5|$|B. bufo {{is part of}} {{a species}} complex, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are {{believed}} to form an ancient group of related taxa from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad (B. spinosus), the Caucasian toad (B. verrucosissimus) and the Japanese common toad (B. japonicus). The European common toad (Bufobufo) seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred {{as a result of the}} development of the Central Asian Deserts during the Middle Miocene. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of Bufoverrucosissimus and Bufospinosus. It found that the differences between the two <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significant</b> and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.|$|E

Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that indicated the depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT.|$|E

5|$|Supporters of the book's basic {{accuracy}} countered on {{the points}} raised by skeptics such as footbinding and the Great Wall of China. Historian Stephen G. Haw {{argued that the}} Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders. They note that the Great Wall familiar to us today is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both {{north and south of}} today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan Dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Batutta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan Dynasty, could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significant</b> or noteworthy at that time.|$|E
5|$|While moving erratically off {{the east}} coast of Florida, Tropical Storm Edouard {{produced}} rough surf conditions and rip currents along many beaches. Beachgoers and visitors were advised to exercise extreme caution. The storm produced water levels about 6inches above normal near Cape Canaveral, though elsewhere wave action and storm tides <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significant.</b> Despite being a tropical storm at landfall, sustained tropical storm force winds were not observed. A rainband ahead of the storm produced a 39mph (63km/h) wind gust at Patrick Air Force Base, and a station in St. Augustine recorded a wind gust of 38mph (61km/h). Sustained winds peaked at 31mph (50km/h) at Patrick Air Force Base. Edouard dropped light to moderate rainfall in eastern Florida, primarily during 2 to 3hour periods. The highest official rainfall total peaked at 2.5inches (64mm) at Orlando Executive Airport, though unofficial totals reached as high as 4.8inches (122mm) in Rockledge. Rainfall was higher in western Florida, peaking at 7.64inches (194mm) in DeSoto County with an area near Tampa reporting over 7inches (175mm).|$|E

500|$|Hurricane Lenny was {{originally}} forecast to strike Puerto Rico, although it remained {{south of the}} island. Beginning on November17, Lenny affected Puerto Rico with gusty winds and heavy rainfall. Rainfall in the days prior to Lenny's approach left areas susceptible to flooding, which caused many rivers in the northeastern portion of the island to overflow their banks following the storm. Such flooding forced towns to evacuate along the rivers, and also resulted in the closure of secondary and primary highways. The heavy rains also caused mudslides and rockslides. The peak rainfall on the island was [...] in Jayuya in central Puerto Rico. Tides in San Juan were about [...] above normal. There, high seas washed a [...] freighter ashore. Winds in the Puerto Rican mainland <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significant,</b> gusting to [...] in Ceiba. The storm left 22,000people without power and 103,000people without water. Because of the heavy rainfall, about 200farmers in southeastern Puerto Rico sustained about $19million in crop damage (1999USD). In the affected region, the heavy rainfall destroyed 80percent of the vegetables and 50percent of the plantains. Damage throughout the island totaled $105million (1999US).|$|E
