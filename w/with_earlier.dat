40|$|PURPOSE: Early knee OA is a {{significant}} problem that can be disabling. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand the symptomatic profile of patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> knee OA when compared to those with end-stage knee OA. METHODS: A cross-sectional case control study design was used to compare those <b>with</b> <b>early</b> structural change to those with advanced structural change. In total, 100 consecutive patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> radiographic knee OA presenting to the knee service outpatient clinic from December 2010 to August 2011 were prospectively identified on the basis of their radiographic changes. All met the symptomatic and radiological diagnostic criteria of early knee OA as defined by Luyten et al. They were compared with 200 knees with full thickness anteromedial knee OA and 200 knees with full thickness tricompartmental knee OA for their demographic, pain and functional profile. RESULTS: Patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> knee OA were younger than those with full thickness disease. However, 78  % of individual patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> radiographic OA had pain and function scores equal to individual patients presenting for UKA, whilst 74  % of individual patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> radiographic OA had pain and function scores that are equal to or worse than individual patients presenting for TKA. CONCLUSIONS: Patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> radiographic knee OA demonstrate considerable overlap in the severity of their symptoms with those demonstrating end-stage structural changes within the knee. Patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> structural changes of arthritis should not be assumed by clinicians to have mild disease. In many cases, their symptoms are as bad as those with end-stage structural changes. This work will help clinicians to identify and categorise those <b>with</b> <b>early</b> arthritis and thereby assist in guiding appropriate treatments...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{specific}} cognitive impairments that may be the cause of the reported increased crash rate in individuals <b>with</b> <b>early</b> dementia. Though, it is widely accepted that attention, visuospatial and perceptual abilities are central in being able to operate a vehicle safely. This study had three objectives. The first was to clarify the neuropsychological profile, with an emphasis on attention, visuospatial and perceptual abilities, of individuals <b>with</b> <b>early</b> dementia <b>with</b> Lewy bodies (DLB), the next was to examine the driving performances of two groups of individuals <b>with</b> <b>early</b> dementia (i. e., early Alzheimer’s disease, AD, and early DLB) and the last was to examine the degree of association between neuropsychological impairments and driving impairments in hopes of predicting poor driving outcomes. Fifty-six participants were recruited from three groups; 20 individuals diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>early</b> AD, 15 individuals diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>early</b> DLB and 21 healthy age-matched controls. All participants were administered the following neuropsychological tests: the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS- 2), the Boston Naming Test (BNT), the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA), the Visual Object and Space Perception Test (VOSP) and the Useful Field of View (UFOV). Additionally, a simulated driving task was completed, with data being collected through primary measures recorded by the simulator as well as an experimenter based driving assessment using a demerit-point test. Results indicated that individuals <b>with</b> <b>early</b> DLB were found to be most impaired in their visuospatial abilities, selective and divided attention abilities, and were found to have significant cognitive fluctuations. Driving performances confirmed that drivers <b>with</b> <b>early</b> dementia were at greater risk for motor vehicle collisions (MVC) and they were found to commit a significant number of driving errors during the driving simulation. Finally, this study was able to demonstrate that in drivers <b>with</b> <b>early</b> AD, attentional impairments were the strongest predictors of driving impairment, whereas in drivers <b>with</b> <b>early</b> DLB, visuospatial impairments were indicative of driving impairment...|$|R
40|$|Background We {{aimed to}} compare the rate of {{cognitive}} decline in patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> and late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to investigate the potentially modifying influence of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype. Method We included 99 patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> onset AD (age 65 years) and 192 patients with late onset AD (age > 65 years) who had at least two scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (range 214) obtained at least 1 year apart. Linear mixed models were performed to investigate the rate of cognitive decline dependent on age at onset (AAO) and APOE genotype. Results The mean (s. d.) age for patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> onset AD was 57. 7 (4. 5) years, and 74. 5 (5. 1) years for patients with late onset AD. AAO {{was not associated with}} baseline MMSE [(s. e.) = 0. 8 (0. 5), p= 0. 14]. However, patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> onset showed a faster decline on the MMSE [(s. e.) = 2. 4 (0. 1) points/year] than those with late onset [(s. e.) = 1. 7 (0. 1) points/year, p= 0. 00]. After stratification according to APOE genotype, APOE 4 non-carriers <b>with</b> <b>early</b> onset showed faster cognitive decline than non-carriers with late onset [2. 4 (0. 3) v. 1. 3 (0. 3) points/year, p= 0. 01]. In APOE 4 carriers, no difference in rate of cognitive decline was found between patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> and late onset [(s. e.) = 0. 2 (0. 2), p= 0. 47]. Conclusion Patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> onset AD show more rapid cognitive decline than patients with late onset, suggesting that early onset AD follows a more aggressive course. Furthermore, this effect seems to be most prominent in patients <b>with</b> <b>early</b> onset who do not carry the genetic APOE 4 risk factor for AD. © 2009 Cambridge University Press...|$|R

Militiamen did not want to set out on a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called for volunteers rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E

Its bloody violence, a stylistic choice following the series' themes, resulted in censorship in Japan and eventual blacklisting in China.

5|$|This form is {{very common}} in castles adapted for guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and {{elsewhere}} in between.
