5|$|Around 2 pm, the British barges {{carrying}} artillery floated {{down the}} La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between {{an island in}} the La Chute and the shore. This brought them <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of the French left and some of the fort's guns. Fire from cannons on the fort's southwest bastion's sank two of the barges, spurring the remaining vessels to retreat.|$|E

5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of Ju 87s were also {{retained}} for anti-shipping operations in the Black Sea, a role it had proved so successful in when operating in the Mediterranean. In October 1943, this became evident again when StG 3 carried out several attacks against the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. On 6 October 1943 the most powerful flotilla in the fleet comprising the Leningrad class destroyers Kharkov, Besposhchadny and Sposobny were caught and sunk by dive -bombing. After the disaster, Josef Stalin decreed that no more ships were to pass <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of German aircraft without his personal permission.|$|E
5|$|As Naiad, Triton and Alcmene {{streamed}} past {{in pursuit}} of Santa Brigida, Young focused his attention on Thetis, coming <b>within</b> <b>range</b> at 11:30. Mendoza, seeing that battle was inevitable, bore up across Ethalions bows {{in an effort to}} rake Young's ship. Young turned in order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which responded in kind. For an hour the frigates exchanged running fire until Mendoza, realising escape was impossible, surrendered. Thetis had lost one man killed and nine wounded in the exchange while Ethalion had suffered no casualties.|$|E

5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of German surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed {{to provide an}} escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of warding off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{from their}} 26-yard line after a kickoff, Clemson {{attempted}} to again cut into Tech's lead. The Tigers, again {{guided by the}} running offense of Spiller and Jamie Harper, advanced to the 37-yard line, where Parker's passing attack took over. Parker completed two passes before Georgia Tech defender Jerrard Tarrant ran {{in front of a}} long throw downfield. He intercepted Parker's pass and returned it 50 yards to the Clemson 28, where Tech's offense began anew. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down but still was <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of a 40-yard field goal from Blair, who extended the Yellow Jackets' lead to 33–20.|$|E

5|$|By 3 March, {{the convoy}} was <b>within</b> <b>range</b> {{of the air}} base at Milne Bay, and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from there. Because of bad weather only two found the convoy, and neither scored any hits, but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula. A force of 90 Allied {{aircraft}} took off from Port Moresby, and headed for Cape Ward Hunt, while 22 A-20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae, reducing the convoy’s air cover. Attacks on the base continued throughout the day.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} {{one of the}} French ships had {{successfully}} escaped, but the other was still under pursuit, Captain Charles Linois of Atalante attempting a number of tactics to drive off his opponent but without success. Eventually, after a chase lasting nearly two days, the French ship came <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of the much larger British 74-gun third rate HMS Swiftsure and despite a brave defence was soon forced to surrender after suffering more than 40 casualties. Although he had surrendered his ship, Linois was widely praised for his actions in defending his ship against such heavy odds.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} that had to be used by the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not <b>within</b> <b>range</b> to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E

During this time, Pennsylvania {{was present at the}} last battle ever between battleships, the Battle of Surigao Strait. The ship did not fire any salvos because the Japanese vessels were turned away or sunk at long range, beyond Pennsylvanias outdated fire control but <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of other, radar-directed battleships.|$|E

5|$|In January 1940, the U-boats opened another offensive. Some 21 Submarines sank 42 ships. All were east of 11°W, {{and thus}} <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of the Command’s aircraft. The {{situation}} worsened, {{although it was}} not disastrous until after the collapse of France. The need for long-range aircraft was identified by the first success of Coastal Command. A No. 228 Squadron Sunderland sighted a U-boat, , enable to submerge after sinking three ships. It directed Destroyers to engage it. U-55 was scuttled. Had {{it not been for the}} Sunderland, the submarine would have escaped.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before 16:00CET, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group {{encountered}} the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, {{under the command}} of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than a half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south in order to draw the British ships towards {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, , the leading German battleship, spotted both the I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming down to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers. Shortly thereafter the order was given to commence firing; the Kaiser-class ships, with the exception of Prinzregent Luitpold, were not yet <b>within</b> <b>range</b> to engage the British battlecruisers. Prinzregent Luitpold managed to fire eight salvos at 22,300–21,300yards (20,400–19,500m) before the range again widened sufficiently to prevent further firing. In the meantime, Kaiser and Friedrich der Grosse, along with the battleships of II Battle Squadron, were <b>within</b> <b>range</b> of the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. However, the massed fire from the ten battleships interfered with accurate spotting, and after only a few salvos fire was largely ceased.|$|E
5|$|The Special Operations Executive were {{approached}} {{to see if}} its agents could destroy the dock gates. They decided that the mission was beyond their capabilities because the weight of explosives required would have needed too many agents to carry them. The Royal Navy was also unable to mount an operation, as St Nazaire is 8km (5 miles) up the Loire estuary. Any naval ships large enough to cause sufficient damage would be detected well before they were <b>within</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E
