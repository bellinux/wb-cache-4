5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} {{recently}} expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the troika. Stalin's power of patronage {{in his capacity as}} general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratization of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normalcy,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> leave behind.|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Warrior for its {{rock music}} influences, despite the album being {{deeply rooted in}} technopop. Applauding the album's rock sound, Rolling Stone called the album Kesha's rock manifesto. Rock icons The Flaming Lips, Iggy Pop, and Alice Cooper have collaborated with Kesha, {{endorsing}} her as a rock singer. Cooper told Billboard, [...] "I immediately {{looked at her and}} went, 'This girl is not a pop diva. She's a rock singer.' She <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> be the female Robert Plant than the next Britney Spears." [...] The A.V. Club noted that Warrior proved Kesha a capable vocalist and songwriter. The Washington Post said that the album is [...] "pure fun", acknowledging her prowess for finding good hooks despite her sometimes vapid lyricism.|$|E
500|$|De Winter was {{immediately}} taken to see Duncan, the Dutch officer {{holding out his}} sword as a token of surrender. Duncan refused the weapon, instead shaking De Winter's hand and insisting [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> take a brave man's hand than his sword". In addition to the losses in the rear, five ships of the Dutch van had been captured {{as well as the}} frigate Ambuscade that had attacked from the second line. The remainder of the Dutch ships had fled, making rapid progress towards the coastal shallows. Duncan did not follow them: the Dutch coast between Kamperduin and Egmond was only [...] away, his ship lay in just 9 fathoms (...) of water and the weather was too fierce and his ships too battered to risk combat in shoal waters. Instead he ordered his ships to ensure control of their prizes and to return to Britain. Many ships were now undermanned due to the terrible casualties they had suffered: surgeon Robert Young of Ardent, the worst hit of the British ships, worked for more than twelve hours without a break and later wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, McCain {{continued}} {{questioning the}} progress of the war in Iraq. In September 2005, he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers' optimistic outlook on the war's progress: [...] "Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected, nor as we were told by you, General Myers." [...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began.|$|E

500|$|... "The Party Song" [...] was {{inspired}} by when Hoppus attended a [...] "jock-infested" [...] party at San Diego State University and met some students who thought highly of themselves. Disinterested in the party, he felt he <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> be at home, which {{found its way into}} the song's lyrics. [...] "Mutt" [...] was written by DeLonge for his friend Benji Weatherly and his appearance in the Taylor Steele surf video The Show. An early version of [...] "Mutt", with Scott Raynor behind the drum kit, was recorded with producer Mark Trombino and appears on the film's 1998 soundtrack. The title of [...] "Wendy Clear" [...] comes from Hoppus' boat, named [...] "Wendy," [...] and how boaters end transmissions by letting other boaters know the channel is open for use, or [...] "clear". Hoppus wrote the song while on tour with MxPx about having a crush on [...] "someone that you are not supposed to like." [...] Lastly, [...] "Anthem," [...] the final song on Enema of the State, is about being trapped in the suburbs, longing for freedom and the age of 21. It is based on when DeLonge was in high school and told his peers that his band would be playing at a friend's house. The party was later busted by the police and a [...] "giant fight broke out." [...] Hoppus felt it a perfect summary of the album's themes: [...] "lots of youthful angst, energy, and suburban unrest." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the book}} Heroism and Gender in War Films (2014), the lyrics of [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] "outline the perfect woman". The phrase [...] "Honor to us all" [...] is {{constantly}} reiterated throughout the song. Its [...] "witty" [...] lyrics are intended to be highly ironic, expressing that a daughter can only honor both herself and her family by marrying, {{as demonstrated by the}} phrase [...] "A girl can bring her family great honor in one way, by striking a good match". Beginning with the line [...] "This is what you give me to work with", the performers then offer an extensive list of examples and qualities required to create an ideal bride, providing both oral and visual examples {{of what it means to}} be a woman, including the lyrics [...] "Wait and see, when we're through, boys will gladly go to war for you" [...] and [...] "With good breeding and a tiny waist you'll bring honor to us all." [...] According to The Criterion: A Journal in English contributor Joshi Aditi, the song also expresses the [...] "inner desire of the male" [...] using the lyrics [...] "Men want girls with good taste, calm, obedient/Who work fast-paced", which is later confirmed in the all-male musical number [...] "A Girl Worth Fighting For". The line [...] "scarier than the undertaker, we are meeting our Matchmaker" [...] appears towards the end of the song. Lyrically, [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] also makes heavy use of the literary device alliteration, as heard during its final verse [...] "Destiny, guard our girls/And our future as it fast unfurls/Please look kindly on these cultured pearls/Each a perfect porcelain doll". Thought Catalog contributor Chelsea Fagan felt that the song's lyrics make it appropriate for single women whose loved ones are constantly pressuring them to pursue romantic relationships despite the fact that they <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> remain single: [...] "the kind of girl who doesn’t need to be put into a tight-waisted outfit to go find herself a husband and pop out a bunch of sword-wielding sons. You’ve got other plans".|$|E
500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that could make her truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

2500|$|Reindeer hunting has {{a special}} status in the populace. Shooting a muskox {{provides}} {{four times as much}} meat as a reindeer, but [...] "Greenlanders <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> have caribou or reindeer meat than musk ox meat," [...] says Josefine Nymand.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of seven days, from February 11 to 17, the House cast a total of 35 ballots, with Jefferson {{receiving}} the votes of eight state delegations each time—one short of the necessary majority of nine. During the contest, Hamilton recommended to Federalists that they support Jefferson because he was [...] "by far not so dangerous a man" [...] as Burr; in short, he <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> have someone with wrong principles than someone devoid of any. Hamilton embarked on a frenzied letter-writing campaign to get delegates to switch votes.|$|E

You must get those fellows in the north in, though; you can't do it by force. There is not, and never was, any bitterness in my heart towards your country."

Laura Brown is {{pregnant}} with her second child and is reading in bed. She does not want to get up despite it being her husband Dan's birthday. She is finding it hard playing the role of wife to Dan, and mother to her son Richie, despite her appreciation for them. She <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> read her book.

2500|$|Although {{the album}} was {{completed}} in August 1981, its release was delayed {{for a whole year}} until the group felt ready to release it. Gartside defended the decision to hold back the album, saying that [...] "we could have released it then, and it would probably have got some nice reviews, sold a few thousand copies and disappeared. But we thought that if we held on to it, put out 'The [...] "Sweetest Girl"', built on that a bit, took some more singles off the album, built up the interest and then put it out, it would do a lot more. Seeing as we were really pleased with it, I <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1463 Fortescue {{accompanied}} Queen Margaret and her {{court in}} their exile on the Continent, {{and returned with}} them to England in 1471. During their exile he wrote for the instruction of the young Prince Edward his celebrated work De laudibus legum Angliæ (Commendation of the Laws of England, first published posthumously around 1543), in which he made the first expression of what would later become known as Blackstone's formulation, stating that [...] "one <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that twenty guilty persons should escape the punishment of death, than that one innocent person should be condemned, and suffer capitally". On {{the defeat of the}} Lancastrian party he made his submission to Edward IV, who reversed his attainder in October 1471.|$|E

2500|$|Carnegie {{was tried}} on 2 August 1728 for premeditated murder, a charge {{supported}} by [...] "long arguments and quotations of authority," [...] as was common at that time.

[...] "If it shall appear," [...] he had said, [...] "that I was the unlucky person who wounded the earl, I protest before God I <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> that a sword had been sheathed in my own bowels." [...] He did not admit his guilt except to say: [...] "I had the misfortune that day to be mortally drunk, for which I beg God’s pardon."

2500|$|Sinn Féin {{said that}} {{legislation}} regarding same-sex marriage {{would be a}} priority for the party in the Assembly elected in May 2016. On 23 June 2016, Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir announced he had requested that officials in the Executive begin drafting legislation to allow same-sex marriage, stating that MLAs <b>would</b> <b>much</b> <b>rather</b> vote on the issue than “be forced to legislate [...] an adverse judgment” in the courts. In October 2016, First Minister Arlene Foster reaffirmed the DUP's opposition to same-sex marriage, saying the party would continue to issue a petition of concern blocking same-sex marriage in the Assembly {{over the next five}} years. The DUP won fewer than 30 seats at the March 2017 elections, meaning it lost the right to individually block a bill using a petition of concern. However, there are enough other elected members to file a petition of concern together, if the power-sharing government is restored.|$|E
2500|$|In the war, Duryodhana {{repeatedly}} eggs on the invincible Bhishma and Drona {{to forward}} his cause, {{even though his}} main hope is Karna.
