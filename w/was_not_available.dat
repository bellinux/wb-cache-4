5|$|As {{plutonium}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>available,</b> it was substituted {{with material}} with similar mechanical properties.

5|$|Multiplayer {{comes in}} two forms in Empire: Total War. As with {{previous}} Total War titles, players {{can engage in}} real-time battles against each other either by composing their armies themselves, or re-enacting battles from history. The full campaign multiplayer mode was unveiled {{one month after the}} initial release, because the technology to create a multiplayer campaign game <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> in previous Total War games, and the time allowed The Creative Assembly to implement this for Empire: Total War. The campaign multiplayer mode was first tested in a two-player beta build which was released on 7 December 2009.|$|E

5|$|An early {{problem was}} whether {{to adopt the}} British or Australian {{organisation}}. In 1939 the British Army {{was in the process}} of re-equipping with new weapons, and a new organisation was required. This new equipment <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> in Australia, so it was decided to organise the first unit to be raised—the 6th Division—with some elements of the old organisation and some of the new. Consequently, the 6th Division was raised as an infantry division of around 18,000 personnel, and initially comprised twelve 900-man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies, a battalion headquarters, regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals, mortars, carriers, pioneers, anti-aircraft and administration. Artillery support was provided by three field regiments, each attached at brigade-level, as well an anti-tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with armoured vehicles. Corps troops included a machine-gun battalion, and various engineer, logistics and communication units.|$|E
5|$|Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear, {{released}} in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, utilized stealth elements within an action-adventure framework, {{and was the}} first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>available</b> in North America, only the NES version was released there. Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a line-of-sight mechanic) and hear gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use his fists to fight enemies.|$|E
