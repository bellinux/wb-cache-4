5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} outside <b>world.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity.

By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for {{major changes in the}} Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E
