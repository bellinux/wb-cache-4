40|$|Drying for {{agricultural}} and marine products {{are one of}} the most attractive and cost-effective application of solar energy. Numerous types of solar dryers have been designed and developed in various parts of the world, yielding varying degrees of technical performance. Basically, there are four types of solar dryers; (1) direct solar dryers, (2) indirect solar dryers, (3) mixed-mode dryers and (4) hybrid solar dryers. This paper is a review of these types of solar dryers with aspect to the product being dried, technical and economical aspects.

40|$|AbstractDürr {{is one of}} the world's leading {{suppliers}} of products, systems and services, mainly for automobile manufacturing. The range of products and services covers important stages of vehicle production. As a systems supplier, Dürr plans and builds complete paint shops and final assembly facilities. Industrial Solar – formerly known as Mirroxx – is the leading manufacturer of Fresnel process heat collectors and can look back on seven years operating experience with its systems. Automotive industry is under considerable strain to make their products more environmentally sound. Not only the cars themselves, but also the whole value chain has to become more sustainable. One production process, which contributes a significant share to the carbon footprint of a car, is the curing of a car's paint. As the temperatures in the convection ovens are up to 200 °C the application of market available flatplate or vacuum tube collectors was not an option, as these collector types cannot provide such high temperatures. Also the thermal power needed for a convection oven is well above the typical power range of solar collectors, which were originally designed for domestic hot water applications. A pilot system of a solar driven convection oven has been installed on the Dürr Campus in Bietigheim-Bissingen near Stuttgart/Germany. An Industrial Solar Fresnel collector consisting of six modules with a total aperture area of 132 m 2 heats pressurized water to an outlet temperature of 180 °C. A fossil fired backup boiler complements the solar thermal system to meet the thermal power demand of the convection oven. Finally the heat is dissipated in the convection oven via a pressurized <b>water</b> – <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger...</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{research for}} the past year on methods to enhance the environmental and economic performance of dry cooling towers. The work has concentrated on dry cooling towers utilizing periodic <b>water</b> to <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> Periodic towers have sheet metal discs partially submerged in hot, power plant condenser effluent. As the discs rotate, the discs alternately absorb heat from the effluent and discharge <b>heat</b> to the <b>air.</b> The means of heat transfer on the air side can be either evaporative and/or convective, depending upon the amount of effluent carried into the air side {{on the surface of the}} plates. An oil layer, floated on the water's surface, has been shown to be effective in eliminating water carry-over to the air side. The advantages of the periodic tower lie in the low cost of the discs and the ability to operate dry. A periodic tower should be significantly less expensive than a conventional dry tower fabricated with finned tubes. Further, since the periodic tower can also operate wet, by removing the oil film, the high capacity losses incurred during warm months by conventional dry towers can be eliminated. In the past year, tests on a 20 inch model of the periodic tower indicated that at operational speeds of the full sized disc, no noticeable churning of the oil layer ocurred. Heat transfer rates measured with the 20 inch model were 20 percent higher than predicted by an approximate analysis. Finally, silicone oils' low vapor pressure make them superior to hydrocarbon oils on the basis of evaporation rates, but their higher costs and possible ecological impact necessitates a closer look at hydrocarbon oils. Construction of the full scale test facility is complete. Shaped, rigid five foot diameter discs have been designed, fabricated, and assembled into an initial test module. Instrumentation for heat transfer tests is also complete; including instrumentation for measuring disc temperatures, and both <b>air</b> and <b>water</b> flow rates and temperatures. A parametric study of the oil film thickness on the air side of the test module has been completed. Measured thicknesses were 20 percent less than that previously predicted. This thinner oil layer means an increase in the disc heat transfer. A test apparatus to study the further enhancement of disc performance by surface roughening has been constructed, instrumented and calibrated. The apparatus has reproduced experimental friction factor and heat transfer coefficient curves for flat plates, and will be used to evaluate enhancement as a function of rib shape, size, spacings and Reynold's number. Visits to several architectural engineers across the country were made with representatives of Air Preheater Company to gage their acceptance of the rotary concept. All felt that if the reliability of the rotary concept could be demonstrated and the costs were less than equivalent conventional dry towers, the rotary desing would be the preferred choice. Based on these findings, Air Preheater is planning to do design and cost studies of the rotary concept for the coming year.

40|$|The latent-heat-storage {{capacity}} in Phase-Change Materials {{can be used}} for storing or releasing energy within a small temperature interval. Upon the phase transition taking place in a narrow temperature span, the material takes up or releases more energy compared to sensible heat storage. For an ideal phase-change material, the transition temperature is a single value, but for the most common phase-change materials on the market, used in building applications, the transition temperature is distributed within a temperature range of several degrees. Integration of phase-change materials in building applications can be effected in several ways, for example by impregnating phase-change materials into porous building materials like concrete, wallboards, bricks or complements of the building structure. Integrating storages filled with phase-change materials makes other implementations, for instance accumulating tanks or envelopes as presented in this thesis, in an <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> An appropriate phasetransition temperature of the supposed application is critical to the functionality of the material. For example, in cooling applications, the transition temperature of the material should be a few degrees lower than the requested comfort temperature in the building, and the opposite for heating applications. In order to assess the thermal properties and the durability of the material, a watercalorimetric equipment was developed and employed in an accelerated testing programme. The heat capacity of the material and in particular possible change in the heat capacity over time, after thermal cycling of the material, were measured. In the thermal cycling of the material from solid to liquid phase, the temperature rise and required energy supply were recorded. The testing programme was undertaken according to control procedures and documents. In {{order to be able to}} utilize the heat-storage {{capacity in}} the best way, it is necessary to gain knowledge about thermal properties of the material, especially the long-term behaviour of the material and the deterioration rates of the thermal properties.
