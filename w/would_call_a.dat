One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was a young Marvin Minsky, then a 24-year-old graduate student. In 1951 (with Dean Edmonds) he built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, {{and told him that}} if he was forced off the ticket, Chotiner <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to either of the two men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{realized}} that Batista {{would lose the}} war, and fearing that Castro would displace U.S. interests with socialist reforms, decided to aid Batista's removal by supporting a rightist military junta, believing that General Cantillo, then commanding most of the country's armed forces, should lead it. After being approached with this proposal, Cantillo secretly met with Castro, agreeing that the two <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> ceasefire, following which Batista would be apprehended and tried as a war criminal. Double-crossing Castro, Cantillo warned Batista of the revolutionary's intentions. Wishing to avoid a tribunal, Batista resigned on 31 December 1958, informing the armed forces that they were now under Cantillo's control. With his family and closest advisers, Batista fled into exile to the Dominican Republic with over US$ 300,000,000. Cantillo then entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra as the new President, and began appointing new members of the government.|$|E

5|$|There was {{speculation}} during September {{and early}} October 2007 about whether Brown <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not Flash, Just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October {{that there would}} be no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that he was capable of winning an election should he call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either.|$|E
25|$|The first Chinese-built Valemax vessel, Vale China, was {{launched}} at the Nantong shipyard on 9 July 2011 and delivered on 25 November 2011.

25|$|The WFM {{asked all}} mines {{not to sell}} ore to the ore mills in Colorado City, with the {{understanding}} that the union <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> strike at any mine not cooperating. The mine owners met on 5 March 1903, and refused to stop selling ore to the struck mills. The businessmen of Victor convinced the WFM to delay the strike one week, to see if the mill strike could be negotiated without the strike spreading to the mines.|$|E

The opposition claimed that the prime minister had given no indication that he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> by-election for Nui, which, in Tuvalu, the PM must do to allow an election to occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{executive}} of NUPPO demanded a pay increase, improved war bonuses, extension of pension rights to include policemen's widows, a shortening {{of the pension}} entitlement period, and an allowance for school-aged children. The most significant issue was that NUPPO be officially recognised as {{the representative of the}} police workers. NUPPO informed the authorities that unless their demands were met by midnight on the 29 August, they <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> strike. The strike of 1918 caught the government off guard at a time of domestic and international labour unrest.|$|E

25|$|During the 1st {{seven minutes}} of the 2nd half, neither team took a lead larger than 2 while Duke would have a 45-43 lead when they called a 30-second timeout. Then, Brian Zoubek would make a basket to give Duke a 47-43 lead. In the next 35 seconds, Gordon Hayward made two free throws to cut the Duke lead to 49-47. In the next minute, Jon Scheyer scored five points to give Duke a 56-51 lead. During the next 35 seconds after Butler called a 30-second timeout, Matt Howard and Gordon Hayward each made a pair of free throws to cut the Duke lead to 56-55 and Duke <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 30-second timeout. Then, Kyle Singler made a basket to give Duke a 58-55 lead and Butler <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 30-second timeout. With 3:16 {{remaining}}, Nolan Smith made a pair of free throws to give Duke a 60-55 lead. Within the next minute after 1:50 was remaining in the game, Matt Howard scored four points to cut the Duke lead to 60-59. With 3 seconds left, Brian Zoubek made one of two free throws to give Duke a 61-59 lead. Gordon Hayward narrowly missed a buzzer-beating half-court shot which would have won the game for Butler and it resulted in a 61-59 win for Duke and the National Championship.|$|E
25|$|At its October 1884 convention, FOTLU {{attempted}} to reinvigorate itself by adopting a resolution again pushing for {{establishment of the}} eight-hour day. Peter J. McGuire, president of the Carpenters union, proposed a resolution—which FOTLU adopted—which required that, if national legislation adopting an eight-hour day was not forthcoming by May 1, 1886, the federation <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> general strike. The leadership of the Knights secretly issued a statement advising its members {{not to participate in}} the fight for the eight-hour day, but members of the Knights of Labor overwhelmingly supported the proposal and made plans to support the federation in its May Day strike. Preparations were most advanced in Chicago.|$|E
25|$|To {{make matters}} worse, at {{a late night}} party and jam session during the {{recording}} of the album, attended by Lennon, McCartney, Danny Kortchmar, and other musicians, Nilsson ruptured a vocal cord, but he hid the injury for fear that Lennon <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> halt to the production. The resulting album was Pussy Cats. In an effort to clean up, Lennon, Nilsson and Ringo Starr first rented a house together, then Lennon and Nilsson left for New York. After the relative failure of his latest two albums, RCA Records considered dropping Nilsson's contract. In a show of friendship, Lennon accompanied Nilsson to negotiations, and both intimated to RCA that Lennon and Starr might want to sign with them, once their Apple Records contracts with EMI expired in 1975, but would not be interested if Nilsson were no longer with the label. RCA took the hint and re-signed Nilsson (adding a bonus clause, to apply to each new album completed), but neither Lennon nor Starr signed with RCA.|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the show}} {{suggests}} that it {{was inspired by the}} classic children's song Old McDonald Had a Farm. Which is quite suitable, as it is not exactly what you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>an</b> olden day farm, but the exact opposite, except for the good old windmill.|$|R

25|$|Nolan Smith got Duke {{off to a}} {{hot start}} scoring four points in the 1st {{two and a half}} minutes to give Duke an early 6-1 lead. Shelvin Mack got Butler back into the game making two three-pointers in the next 3 minutes to give Butler a 12-11 lead. Shelvin Mack kept Butler going as Butler would have a 20-18 lead at the under-8 TV Timeout. Then, Jon Scheyer would score four points in the next three minutes leading Duke to a 8-0 run giving them a 26-20 lead and Butler <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> 30-second timeout. During the next 70 seconds, Avery Jukes would score five points leading Butler to a 7-0 run which would result in a 27-26 Butler lead. While Jukes scored five points in the final two and a half minutes of the 1st half, Jon Scheyer scored four in that same time frame and Duke would lead 33-32 at halftime.|$|E

500|$|Early in the First World War, the Royal Navy {{erected a}} signal station on Hirta, and daily {{communications}} with the mainland were {{established for the}} first time in the history of the islands. In a belated response, the German submarine SM U-90 arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy-two shells were fired, and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were damaged, but there was no loss of life. One eyewitness recalled: [...] "It wasn't what you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> bad submarine because it could have blowed every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted Admiralty property. One lamb was killed... all the cattle ran from one side of the island to the other when they heard the shots." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly's first post-Messengers solo {{release was}} the live double CD Live, May 1992, {{released}} in November 1992. AllMusic's Brett Hartenbach noted that Kelly's band had fleshed out his {{songs in the}} studio, {{but he was still}} able to show [...] "his vignettes of life, love, and the underbelly of both have plenty of power on their own". Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled Lyrics, which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: [...] "I don't have what you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> philosophy or coherent world view so I shall have to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak." ...|$|E

[...] It cited an incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old practice:"The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted him all over the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home club, said he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced that he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding he had received, and that {{he would be able to}} finish the game." ...|$|E
