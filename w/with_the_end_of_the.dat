5|$|After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, the Prussian-dominated North German Confederation {{adopted a}} tricolour of black-white-red as its flag. This flag {{later became the}} flag of the German Empire, formed {{following}} the unification of Germany under the Prussian king who became emperor in 1871, and was used until 1918 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First World War. Black, white, and red were reintroduced as the German national colours with the establishment of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in 1933, replacing German republican colours with imperial colours until the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal container traffic growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E

5|$|Field's {{failure to}} secure {{independence}} concurrently <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federation caused his Cabinet's support {{for him to}} waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction {{with him on the}} grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.|$|E
5|$|Horse remains {{dating to}} the later part of this period– roughly coinciding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last glacial period– have been found at Farndon Fields, Nottinghamshire, dating from around 12,000BC. Mother Grundy's Parlour, also in Creswell Crags, {{contains}} horse remains showing cut marks indicating that hunting of horses occurred there around 10,000BC. A study of Victoria Cave in North Yorkshire produced a horse bone showing cut marks dating from about the same time.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, racial, political, and {{personal}} tensions led to Singapore seceding from Malaysia and becoming an independent country. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> confrontation, the last Vbombers were withdrawn in 1966. The following year, the British government announced {{its intention to}} withdraw its forces from East of Suez. The Singapore Naval Base was {{handed over to the}} government of Singapore on 8 December 1968, and Sembawang Shipyard subsequently became the basis of a successful ship repair industry. The Red Beards were returned to the UK via the US in 1971.|$|E

5|$|In August 1814, British forces {{attacked}} Washington, D.C. {{and burned}} the White House. Congress formed {{a committee to}} investigate the circumstances that allowed Washington to be captured. Johnson chaired this committee, and delivered its final report. After the sacking of Washington, the tide of battle turned against the British, and the Treaty of Ghent ended the war even as Johnson prepared to return to Kentucky to raise another military unit. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, he turned his legislative attention to issues such as securing pensions for widows and orphans and funding internal improvements in the West.|$|E
5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which {{was found to be}} a suicide, roughly coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, war-weariness had set {{in among}} the Venetians, who {{suffered}} from the disruption in trade. Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable to the Republic. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, especially from the French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} April 1916, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, {{the newest}} {{commander-in-chief}} of the German High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.

5|$|One of Len Waters' brothers, Donald Edward (Jimmy) Waters, {{had served}} as an infantryman with the Australian Army during the war. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific War in September 1945, Len {{considered}} volunteering for the Australian component of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan, if his brother did also. Jim declined at the time (he later changed his mind), so Len returned to Australia and left the air force with the rank of warrant officer on 18January 1946.|$|E

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slave {{trade in the}} British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked {{with the members of}} the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E

5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of their leaders escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the federation, Welensky moved to Salisbury, Rhodesia (renamed from Southern Rhodesia after Northern Rhodesia gained independence as Zambia). After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped into recession <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federation).|$|E
