For a time they were running two productions in parallel: at Pitt Street and at their new premises, renamed [...] "The Independent"; by September 1939 the move was complete. The building was owned by North Sydney Coliseum Company, who in 1947 made moves to sell the building. Funds were raised for its purchase.|$|E

Because connection to an electricity grid will be difficult for most island-based systems, electrical energy could be converted into hydrogen (by electrolyzing seawater) and stored for use on the island or shipped to the mainland. To attain the benefits of high-speed wind-turbine systems, several technical and policy issues, dealing with wind resources, specialized wind-turbine equipment, and the political and economic potential of island <b>wind</b> <b>stations,</b> need to be addressed.

40|$|Summary. The article {{presents}} {{one of the}} most advantageous trends of the development in the world power industry: <b>wind</b> power <b>stations.</b> One third of the weight of the installations in the <b>wind</b> power <b>stations</b> consists of castings. Since the year 2006 an increase in the demand for such cast-ings, and, consequently, an increase in the chances of the European and Polish foundries is fore-seen. The Enterprise METALODLEW S. A. (Joint Stock Company) in Kraków as the main element of its development strategy assumed an increase in the production of large-sized, technologically advanced castings made in high quality foundry materials and designed chiefly for export. Among this group of castings are castings of parts for <b>wind</b> power <b>stations.</b> A challenge for META-LODLEW and the scientific circles in Kraków, with whom this enterprise co-operates, was an order for a casting of a platform for the <b>wind</b> power <b>station</b> of the type N- 60 according to the strictly determined acceptance requirements, quality inspection and anticorrosion protection. The authors of the article presented the characteristics of the above-mentioned casting of the platform and the preparatory work connected with the realisation of this order for the <b>wind</b> power <b>station</b> of the type N- 60. Finally, the obtained mechanical properties of this casting which allow its applica-tion under extreme static and dynamic loads and low temperature were given. Key words: wind power plants, ductile cast iro...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe wind {{process is}} {{considered}} an important hydrometeorological process {{and one of the}} basic resources of renewable energy. In this paper, we analyze the double periodicity of wind, i. e., daily and annual, for numerous <b>wind</b> <b>stations</b> with hourly data around the globe and we develop a four-parameter model. Additionally, we apply this model to several stations in Greece and we estimate their marginal characteristics and stochastic structure best described by an extended-Pareto marginal probability function and a Hurst-Kolmogorov process, respectively...|$|R
40|$|AIM: As {{global warming}} is a fact and the {{consumption}} of energy is continuously increasing, alternative sourcing of energy is a must. The use of oil and coal for heating is limited due to it is nature resource which is also limited. Everyone {{will be forced to}} evaluate their own usage of energy and look into the alternatives of how {{to be a part of}} solving this global issue. For many, alternatives such as sun panels and <b>wind</b> power <b>stations</b> could be an alternative power source.   Today, there is only a limited availability in Sweden of small sized <b>wind</b> power <b>stations</b> and only small local producers or importers that sell the equipment – mostly through internet based market communications.   Method: The theoretical approach to this thesis is based on the MIO model in combination with several other models and tools such as, PESTEL, Marketing Mix, SWOT, Porter’s five forces, EVC and STP.   Result & Conclusions: There is a market for small <b>wind</b> power <b>stations</b> between 5 – 50 kW in Sweden. The biggest reason why the market segment exist and will increase is due to continuously increasing energy prices and that <b>wind</b> power <b>stations</b> of this size are permitted to be connected directly to household consumption.   Suggestions for future research: How are other energy complements like solar panels influenced? What governmental decisions affect the business of small <b>wind</b> power <b>stations?</b>   Contributions to the thesis: Success in this segment requires a different approach to product offering than what the current competition is doing...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The diurnal-period fluctuations of winds and surface currents are analyzed for September 1992 {{in and around}} Monterey Bay. Wind records are compared for three coastal stations and two mooring sites. Remotely-sensed surface current observations from two CODAR (HF radar) sites are used to explore the ocean's response to diurnal-period forcing. An average diurnal cycle is formed at each <b>wind</b> <b>station</b> and at all CODAR bins. The earliest sea breeze response is seen at the coastal <b>wind</b> <b>stations</b> where morning <b>winds</b> accelerate toward the coastal mountain ranges. A few hours later, the coastal winds accelerate to the southeast down the Salinas Valley. Offshore afternoon winds rotate from their normal alongshore orientation to also become aligned with the valley. The CODAR-derived surface currents respond in less than the two-hour sampling rate to {{the onset of the}} diurnal onshore winds. Currents accelerate {{in the direction of the}} Salinas Valley. As the day progresses, the more offshore currents rotate clockwise out from under the winds in a possible Ekman or inertial adjustment that continues throughout the night and spreads onshore. In the afternoon, a complicated eddy pattern develops near shore in a possible response to the coastal boundary. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
