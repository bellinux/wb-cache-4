5|$|Prospect Mountain {{originally}} {{had to use}} an incline railway car to access {{the house at the}} top <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> dance and eat. Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $120,000 total. Construction was finished six months later, with the railway opening on June15, 1895. After failing financially, the railway system ceased operation in 1903. The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York. The nearby hiking trail that heads up towards the mountaintop is part of the old railway.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer's deft {{handling}} of the July conference impressed his colleagues; his insight and ability to handle even the most difficult people {{came as a surprise}} even to those who knew him well. In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication of effort. He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E
25|$|From 1989 to 1993 a Flemish {{version was}} {{produced}} by the Belgian commercial TV station VTM. In Belgium many local clubs were founded <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> play the game themselves.|$|E

50|$|The 1757 Enclosure act saw Common land {{enclosed}} thus placing strictures on <b>where</b> local <b>people</b> <b>could</b> graze {{their animals}} and affected Bishopthorpe.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Manuel Fernando Alsina Capó's {{final years}} were {{spent in a}} nursing home <b>where</b> few <b>people</b> <b>could</b> visit him, {{eventually}} dying on February 9, 2008, two days before his next birthday.|$|R
25|$|Redman Park {{is a small}} lawned {{space with}} flower borders, {{opposite}} Ravensworth Terrace. Its centrepiece is a Victorian bandstand sourced from Saltwell Park, where it stood on {{an island in the}} middle of a lake. It represents the recognised need of the time for areas <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> relax away from the growing industrial landscape.|$|E
25|$|The talk {{board is}} {{identical}} to the main message board {{except for the fact that}} it is not possible to post images. It was created in response to the arrival of 4rthur, a (now defunct) talk based offshoot of b3ta which drew a couple of hundred members away, and, more recently, cliqr, Dynafoo (both also defunct now) and c4mbodia. Also, the site owners wanted a place <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> banter without worrying about creating images.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} Greece is maritime, {{with both the}} coldness of winter and the heat of summer {{tempered}} by sea breezes. This led to a lifestyle where many activities took place outdoors. Hence temples were placed on hilltops, their exteriors designed as a visual focus of gatherings and processions, while theatres were often an enhancement of a naturally occurring sloping site <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> sit, rather than a containing structure. Colonnades encircling buildings, or surrounding courtyards provided shelter {{from the sun and}} from sudden winter storms.|$|E
50|$|A {{recent study}} from University of Porto (Portugal) {{highlighted}} Castile and León - particularly {{the province of}} Salamanca - {{as one of the}} European regions <b>where</b> old <b>people</b> <b>could</b> expect to live longer.|$|R
50|$|Ghilbert is {{a similar}} though more {{elaborate}} language based on mmverify.py. Levien would like to implement a system <b>where</b> several <b>people</b> <b>could</b> collaborate and his work is emphasizing modularity and connection between small theories.|$|R
5000|$|In ethics, a [...] "prudential judgment" [...] is {{one where}} the {{circumstances}} must be weighed to determine the correct action. Generally, it applies to situations <b>where</b> two <b>people</b> <b>could</b> weigh the circumstances differently and ethically come to different conclusions.|$|R
25|$|Transportation to {{the area}} was first {{provided}} in 1889 {{with the establishment of}} the 39th Street Ferry, which connected the area to Manhattan. Between 1888 and 1893, a new elevated line was opened along Fifth Avenue. Initially, the line terminated at 27th Street <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> transfer to horse cars. In 1892, the first trolley line was built in Brooklyn, starting at the ferry and running via Second Avenue to 65th Street, and then via Third Avenue. The Fifth Avenue Elevated was then extended to Third Avenue and 65th Street.|$|E
25|$|The Hampton Gardens, the Château, and the Towers {{followed}} in the 1920s. The Château and the Towers, both co-ops on 34th Avenue, had large, airy apartments and were served by elevators. The elegant Château cooperative apartment complex, with twelve buildings surrounding a shared garden, {{was built in the}} French Renaissance style and have slate mansard roofs pierced by dormer windows, and diaperwork brick walls. At first purely decorative, the shared gardens in later developments included paved spaces <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> meet or sit. The Queensboro Corporation started the Ivy Court, Cedar Court, and Spanish Gardens projects, all designed by Thomas, in 1924.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} December 1973 {{municipal}} elections, Kiwan {{and those in}} the movement set up a cultural center in Umm al-Fahm with a small library <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> gather to attend public meetings and discuss the Palestinian cause. Local groups affiliated with Abnaa el-Balad emerged in many Arab towns in the 1970s under different names, such as al-Nahda ("The Rebirth") in Taibeh and al-Bayadir ("The Threshing Floor") in Ar'ara. Abnaa el-Balad was one of many groups to help organize the Land Day (Yom Al Ard) demonstration on 30 March 1976 as a way of defending Palestinian rights to the land and defying and challenging Israeli land confiscation policies.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Morocco {{introduced}} a plan <b>where</b> the Saharwi <b>people</b> <b>could</b> govern themselves, {{as long as}} they were under Moroccan rule. That plan was rejected.|$|R
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the ninth plan, the Government of Kerala took a bold decision to devolve 35% of the state development budget down from a centralized bureaucracy to local governments <b>where</b> local <b>people</b> <b>could</b> determine and implement their own development priorities under the People’s Plan Campaign (PPC).|$|R
50|$|Protectors of Aborigines were {{appointed}} by the Board under the conditions laid down in the various acts. In theory, Protectors of Aborigines were empowered to undertake legal proceedings on behalf of Aboriginal <b>people,</b> dictate <b>where</b> Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>could</b> live or work, and keep all wages earned by employed Aboriginals.|$|R
25|$|Lee {{worked to}} {{transform}} the area around Seoul City Hall from a concrete traffic circle to a lawn <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> gather. The 2002 FIFA World Cup showed how the area {{could be used as}} a cultural space, which came to be known as Seoul Plaza. In May 2004, the tape was cut to open a newly built park in the area, a grassy field where Seoul residents could come to relax and take in cultural performances. A major accomplishment during his term as mayor of Seoul was the restoration of Cheonggyecheon, which now flows through the heart of Seoul and functions as a modern public recreation space.|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters, which {{generally}} are night shelters, make people {{leave in the}} morning to whatever they could manage and return in the evening when the beds in the shelters opened up again for sleeping. There are some daytime shelters <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> go, instead of being stranded on the streets, and they could be helped, get counseling, avail themselves of resources, meals, and otherwise spend their day until returning to their overnight sleeping arrangements. An example of such a day center shelter model is Saint Francis House in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in the early 1980s, which opens for homeless people all year long during the daytime hours and was originally based on the settlement house model.|$|E
25|$|The Communist Party came {{to power}} in the late 1940s and instituted a command economy. In 1958, Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Communist Party of China, created a {{residency}} permit system defining <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> work, and classified workers as rural or urban. In this system, a worker seeking to move from the country to an urban area to take up non-agricultural work would have to apply through the relevant bureaucratic institutions. There is uncertainty, however, over how strictly the system has been enforced. People who worked outside the region in which they were registered would not qualify for grain rations, employer-provided housing, or health care. There were controls over education, employment, marriage and other areas of life. One reason cited for instituting this system was to prevent the possible chaos caused by predictable large-scale urbanization. As a part of the one country, two systems policy proposed by Deng Xiaoping and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau retained separate border control and immigration policies {{with the rest of the}} PRC. Chinese nationals had to gain permission from the government before travelling to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was officially abolished for each SAR after its respective handover. Since then, restrictions imposed by the SAR governments have been the limiting factor on travel.|$|E
60|$|Also {{there were}} other things. At the great {{sacrifice}} before the temple of Jupiter, his place had been set too far back <b>where</b> the <b>people</b> <b>could</b> not see him; at the feast which followed {{the master of the}} ceremonies had neglected, or had forgotten, to pour a libation in his honour.|$|R
5000|$|Kalani {{is built}} on Koob's concept of [...] "social enterprise", where non-profits apply market {{strategies}} to achieve social purpose: [...] "Our goal has never been profit or gain. Our goal {{was to create a}} space <b>where</b> <b>people’s</b> lives <b>could</b> transform, and that has extended into the surrounding district with our community programs." ...|$|R
50|$|Later, in 1880, the new Shari'a Courts Ordinance {{introduced}} the hierarchical judiciary. Through the Ministry of Justice, parties could {{appeal to the}} Cairo Shari'a Court against decisions of provincial qadis and ni'ibs. Here, parties could appeal to the Shari’a Court open to the Shaykh al-Azhar and the Grand Mufti, <b>where</b> other <b>people</b> <b>could</b> be added.|$|R
500|$|Colbert {{teamed up}} with Donorschoose.org again in 2008 by asking {{supporters}} of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to do the same. As a lead-up to the Pennsylvania primary, he created a [...] "straw poll that makes a difference", <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> donate to Pennsylvania classroom projects in honor of their favorite candidate.|$|E
500|$|Delius died at Grez on 10 June 1934, aged 72. He had {{wished to}} be buried in his own garden, but the French {{authorities}} forbade it. His alternative wish, despite his atheism, was to be buried [...] "in some country churchyard in the south of England, <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> place wild flowers". At this time Jelka was too ill to make the journey across the Channel, and Delius was temporarily buried in the local cemetery at Grez.|$|E
500|$|Surrounding Danebury hill fort {{are many}} smaller farmsteads, between [...] and [...] in size. The fort was {{supplied}} with grain {{from the surrounding}} farmsteads, and could hold 20times more food than the average farmstead, indicating Danebury had a higher status than local farmsteads. This is further supported {{by the fact that}} the hill fort was used as a [...] "central place" [...] <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> gather to trade and store commodities. Periods of intensified activity in hill forts such as Danebury coinciding with depopulation of the surrounding landscape could indicate the increasing importance of hill forts in society, or that there were times of unrest when people would retreat to the relative safety of a hill fort's ramparts.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, milk bars had evolved {{to not only}} sell groceries, but also be places <b>where</b> young <b>people</b> <b>could</b> buy {{ready-made}} food and non-alcoholic drinks, and could socialise. Milk bars often used to include jukeboxes and pinball machines (later upgraded to video games), with tables and chairs to encourage patrons to linger and spend more money.|$|R
50|$|The District {{was placed}} on the National Register of Historic Places on March 28, 1973 (No. 73001464). Mount Auburn was founded as a hilltop retreat for Cincinnati's social elite <b>where</b> wealthier <b>people</b> <b>could</b> escape the dirt, heat, smoke and crowded {{conditions}} of the lower city. Ornate historic mansions with incredible panoramic views still reflect this heritage.|$|R
50|$|In ancient Greece and Rome, an asylum {{referred}} to a place <b>where</b> <b>people</b> facing persecution <b>could</b> seek refuge. These locations were largely religious in nature, such as temples and other religious sites.|$|R
500|$|During its 120years of operation, Kew's title changed {{numerous}} times. [...] This {{has been}} in response to society's changing views towards the treatment and care of mentally ill persons; improvements in treatment leading to better health outcomes {{and changes in the}} Victorian Government's various Health Acts. [...] From its establishment until 1905 the institution at Kew was known as an asylum – a title which emphasised its function as a place of detention rather than a place <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> possibly be cured. [...] Kew was also for a short period known as the Metropolitan Lunatic Asylum at Kew, possibly to differentiate it from its sister country asylums at Ararat and Beechworth. During this period, all people committed to the asylum were termed 'inmates' rather than patients – again emphasising detention rather than cure.|$|E
500|$|Guests were {{expected}} to dress to high standards, with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing [...] "gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow". All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage, compliments of the Stork Club. A requirement for all men was a necktie; {{those who were not}} wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance. Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry, there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome. Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests; fighting, drunkenness, or rowdiness were prohibited. He ran the club on the principle of it being a place <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to. Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club. Unescorted women were not allowed to enter the club after 6:00 p.m; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives.|$|E
500|$|Industrial {{development}} had to {{take place}} relatively soon after the new town was established because part of the Corporation's remit was to move people and jobs out of an overcrowded and war-damaged London. Industrial jobs were needed as well as houses and shops to create a balanced community <b>where</b> <b>people</b> <b>could</b> settle. The Development Corporation wanted the new town to support a large and mixed industrial base, with factories and other buildings based in a single zone rather than spread throughout the town. A [...] site in the northeastern part of the development area was chosen. Its advantages included flat land with no existing development; proximity to the London–Brighton railway line, the A23 and the planned M23; space for railway sidings (which were eventually built on a much smaller scale than envisaged); and an adjacent [...] site reserved for future expansion, {{on the other side}} of the railway line (again, not used for this purpose in the end). Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) opened the first part of the industrial area on 25 January 1950; its main road was named Manor Royal, and this name eventually came to refer to the whole estate.|$|E
5000|$|Among other activities, the Columbia Queer Alliance {{has hosted}} [...] "First Friday Dances" [...] for decades, which at their {{inception}} {{were one of}} the few places <b>where</b> college-age LGBT <b>people</b> <b>could</b> socialize with one another.|$|R
50|$|When Esma Redžepova {{settled back}} in Skopje {{with her husband}} in 1989, she started to work on an ambitious project: a Museum of Music and House of Humanity. The couple {{imagined}} it as a place to keep archive of Roma music, and musical and historical artifacts, with a performance room, a studio and a place <b>where</b> poor <b>people</b> <b>could</b> get medical treatment.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} purpose of youth livestock shows was two-fold: 1) {{to provide an}} educational experience <b>where</b> young <b>people</b> <b>could</b> learn animal management practices, as well as personal/character development; and 2) to recognize the best animals in the industry. This NebGuide addresses practices which have developed to enhance {{the appearance of a}} pig that is to be exhibited, but which may be detrimental to the commercial pork industry...|$|R
