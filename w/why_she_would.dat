A nationwide search for her followed, with 100 police officers and helicopters searching fields, streets and rivers around Hersham. Detectives who had investigated the abduction of Sarah Payne were called in to help. Police and the Dowler family made many appeals for information, including a reconstruction on Crimewatch UK. The Crimewatch UK appeal included a direct appeal to Dowler {{in the hope that}} she had run away from home of her own accord. A plea was also made by Pop Idol winner Will Young, whose concert Dowler had attended shortly before her disappearance. Dowler's mother expressed hope that her daughter had run away, but said that she could not think of a reason <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> want to do so.

For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{a series}} of co-starring film roles, Lopez {{received}} her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in Selena, a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was {{aware of the fact that}} she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career." ...|$|E
500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed in a bathing suit [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner in a bathing suit, frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E

He was reluctant to sign the standard contract of six years but did so as he, his agent, and others with whom Stewart consulted, all believed that the new show would quickly fail, and he would return to his London stage career after making some money. [...] While in Hollywood, he briefly took a middle name, [...] "Hewes", to differentiate himself from another Patrick Stewart who was already a member of the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E
2500|$|Josephine wrote {{much later}} that [...] "The {{fear and the}} excitement, the weeks of {{exhausting}} travel, chagrin over my own foolishness, all together proved too much for my strength.

[...] If Josephine, as she said, left San Francisco at age 18, it's unclear <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> still be attending school upon her return two years later. Like cerebral meningitis, St. Vitus Dance is a form of a streptococcus infection. The symptoms of St. Vitus Dance and meningitis are somewhat different, but both can be contracted from the same strain of bacteria through saliva.

2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived with you {{for as long as you}} wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons for a number of years afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
