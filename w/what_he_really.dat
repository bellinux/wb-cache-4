5|$|Peter, Joe and Quagmire drag Cleveland {{to a bar}} {{to get him to}} {{meet some}} women, as he's still reeling from him and Loretta getting a divorce. It doesn’t work so well, so when The Bachelorette comes to Quahog, Peter takes Cleveland to {{audition}} for the show. Cleveland gets nervous at the audition and in an effort to calm him, Peter removes Cleveland’s clothes and then his own. The producers see this and Brian apologizes for what happened with Peter and Cleveland--Brian begins to explain how Cleveland and his wife recently divorced and how Cleveland's confused about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wants in a relationship.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is.|$|E

5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he claims is a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E

As he is 52 years old, it looks increasingly unlikely that he will get another job. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wants is {{to work in a}} gas station, and during {{the first part of the}} film he is seen inquiring after such jobs.|$|E
25|$|Raymond's son, David Belle, {{was born}} in 1973. He experimented with {{gymnastics}} and athletics but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the sports clubs. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wanted was a means to develop skills that {{would be useful to}} him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.|$|E

25|$|It transpires that Husk's {{personality}} {{shifts and}} subsequent mental breakdown and betrayal where {{caused by a}} secondary mutation which means her powers now also affect her mind {{as well as her}} body. Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can hurt them. Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> was.

[...] and dies suddenly, right before he's about to tell Krusty <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> thinks of his comedy. As his father's last words seemed to be dismissive, and believing that nobody finds him funny anymore, Krusty quits his show.|$|E
500|$|The pianist Pascal Rogé commented in 1999 {{that both}} sides of Poulenc's musical nature were equally important: [...] "You must accept him as a whole. If you take away either part, the serious or the non-serious, you destroy him. If one part is erased you get only a pale {{photocopy}} of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is." [...] Poulenc recognised the dichotomy, but in all his works he wanted music that was [...] "healthy, clear and robust – music as frankly French as Stravinsky's is Slav".|$|E

5000|$|... "FYO" [...] was {{released}} as the project's second single, {{with a video}} released to YouTube on 14 April 2016. The track's production was praised by Grant Brydon of RWD as being [...] "beautifully jarring", and by FACT as being [...] "ribcage-quakingly bassy". Avelino told FACT that the video was [...] "minimal ... {{in a sense of}} one location, one setting, one room", as this allows listeners to [...] "focus on <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> <b>really</b> saying on the record." ...|$|R

[...] The character design is reminiscent of those found in American animated shorts from the 1920s and 1930s, such as from Fleischer Studios. Usually he appears in black and white, but when he appears in color his fur is purple.|$|R
500|$|... is {{the leader}} of the aliens and the primary {{antagonist}} of the first series. He came to Earth years before the others and assumed the form of a human boy, Masaya Aoyama, to avoid detection. Deep Blue went to sleep within his new body, leaving Masaya with no memories of who or <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is, but retaining some of Deep Blue's disgust for the way humans were treating the environment. Despite being the primary antagonist, Deep Blue does not actually appear until the end of the sixth volume of the manga. Deep Blue is cold natured, cruel hearted, and will kill anyone who gets in his way. Upon awakening, he attacks and injures Ichigo as he does not share Masaya's love for her, and kills Quiche without any hesitation when challenged to a duel. This allows Masaya to temporarily re-emerge and release Mew Aqua inside his body, killing them both.|$|E
500|$|Anarky's {{introduction}} {{during the}} late 1980s {{was part of a}} larger shift among supervillains in the Batman franchise of the time. While many naive and goofy villains of previous eras were abandoned, and more iconic villains made more violent to cater to tastes of a maturing readership, some were introduced to challenge readers to [...] "question the whole bad/good guy divide." [...] Falling into [...] "the stereotype anarchist bomb-toting image", Anarky's design was countered by his principled stances to create an odd contrast. In a review of the Anarky miniseries, Anarky was dubbed an [...] "anti-villain", as opposed to [...] "antihero", due to his highly principled philosophy, which runs counter to most villains: [...] "In the age of the anti-hero, it only makes sense to have the occasional anti-villain as well. But unlike sociopathic vigilante anti-heroes like the Punisher, an anti-villain like Anarky provides some interesting food for thought. Sure, he breaks the law, but <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wants is to save the world... and maybe he's right." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed to go out for dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, and even though he knew it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also wondering if this is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wants." ...|$|E

[...] Nitin replies. [...] "I've got kids myself, and I know I'd react {{the same way}} if I found out that some other guy had taken my child to somebody's house who the child doesn't even know. Masood is still {{the only person who}} can see Yusef for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of [...] "The Broken Man", series co-creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss spoke {{about some of the}} thought process behind the motivations of the characters that were featured prominently in the episode. David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, he knows how close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> is, which is a killer." ...|$|E
500|$|The cold winters drove Marquis to {{consider}} yet another change of career (Whitehall {{is at an}} elevation of 4360ft); he applied to the United States Veteran's Bureau. Meanwhile, he continued writing. He expanded his Indian diary into {{a book on the}} Cheyenne; he also wrote short stories and an article on [...] "Reviewing the Story of Custer's Last Battle", the first of his many publications on this subject. In April 1923, he moved to Alberton, where he continued to practice medicine, and published a short story [...] "Buffalo Heart, Indian Policeman", printed in The Youth's Companion, a leading literary magazine. In June, this success, and the better climate in Alberton, led him to turn down a job offer from the Veteran's Bureau and put most of his effort into work on his Cheyenne book. In May 1924 he had a second story, [...] "The Guest of the Tribe", published in The Youth's Companion. However, Marquis was never really comfortable writing fiction. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> {{wanted to do was to}} write non-fiction about the Custer battle, and to do that he needed to be nearer to the scene. The opportunity came in June 1925 when the agency physician for the Crow Reservation suggested to him that there was room for another physician to set up practice there. In August, he set up a medical practice in Lodge Grass on the Crow Reservation.|$|E

500|$|Steven Spielberg's 2012 film Lincoln, {{in which}} Stevens was portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, brought new public {{interest}} in Stevens. Jones's character is portrayed as the central figure among the radicals, responsible in large part for {{the passage of the}} Thirteenth Amendment. [...] Historian Matthew Pinsker notes that Stevens is referred to only four times in [...] Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals on which screenwriter Tony Kushner based the film's screenplay; other radicals were folded into the character. [...] Stevens is depicted as unable to moderate his views for the sake of gaining passage of the amendment until after he is urged to do so by the ever-compromising Lincoln. According to Aaron Bady in his article about the film and how it portrays the radicals, [...] "he's the uncle everyone is embarrassed of, even if they love him too much to say so. He's not a leader, he's a liability, one whose shining heroic moment will be when he keeps silent about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> believes." [...] The film depicts a Stevens–Smith sexual relationship; Pinsker comments that [...] "it may well have been true that they were lovers, but by injecting this issue into the movie, the filmmakers risk leaving the impression for some viewers that the 'secret' reason for Stevens's egalitarianism was his desire to legitimize his romance across racial lines." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the story}} side, McMillen {{explained}} that the religious tone is based on his own experiences with his family, split between Catholics and born-again Christians. McMillen noted that while both sides born out faith from the same Bible, their attitudes were different; he found some of the Catholic rituals his family performed inspiring, while other beliefs they had were condemning of several pastimes McMillen had participated in like Dungeons & Dragons. He took inspiration from that duality to create Isaacs narrative, showing how religion can both instill harmful feelings while also bringing about dark creativity. McMillen also considered the scare tactics used by the Christian right to condemn popular media of the 1980s, such as heavy metal and video games. McMillen noted {{how many of the}} propaganda films from this period features satanic cults that would sacrifice children, and he noted how many Biblical stories mirrored these concepts, subsequently building the story around that. He also stated that he also tended to like [...] "really weird stuff" [...] relating to toilet humor and similar types of off-color humor that did not sit well with his family and which he had explored in previous games before Super Meat Boy. While Super Meat Boy helped to make his reputation (including being one of the featured developers in [...] ), he felt it was a [...] "safe" [...] game considering his preferred type of humor, and used Isaac to return to this form, considering that the game could easily be [...] "career suicide" [...] but would make a statement about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>really</b> wanted to do.|$|E
