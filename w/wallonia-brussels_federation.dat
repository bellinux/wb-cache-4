Under the “Pact for Excellence in Education”, a group of experts – the Consortium “Physical Activities, Well-Being and Health” – drawn from the 12 French-speaking institutions training PE teachers (universities and colleges) has been mandated by the Ministry of Education to design devices and tools aiming at implementing the new common core curriculum that is under construction. Good practices have been identified then described in information sheets common to the different consortiums of the PEE and listed in a table that cross-references the 6 dimensions of physical activity at school (Snyers et al., 2014) and the 20 objects of teaching-learning in health education (Turcotte et al., 2011).

40|$|Parenting {{support has}} been placed on the {{political}} agenda in Europe for the last decade (OECD, 2008, 2009; Eurofund, 2011). But a close look to the major discourse can reveal that the interest is very often linked to a compensatory vision of a so-called « deficiency » on behalf of some parents (social control). The symposium has proposed to explore the notion of « meeting places for children and parents » : their characteristics, the driven goals, the values shared by professionals. These places where parents can share « hic et nunc » their own experiences and expertise as parents (not in a preventive purpose) are considered as possible ways of questioning the compensatory approach. Characteristics of meeting places as learning communities have been displayed through a presentation of inspiring practices from different contexts: Italy, Flanders and <b>Federation</b> <b>Wallonia-Brussels.</b> Informal social networks among parents and children are an important source of parental support. Meeting places are settings where such informal networks and social cohesion are facilitated among families with diverse backgrounds. The staff (both professionals and volunteers) {{plays an important role in}} facilitating the informal contacts between parents and children. Their role as a “host” (instead of being pedagogical experts) demands specific individual competences and systemic conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Since {{language}} learning {{and social change}} {{can be considered as}} interdependent on several aspects, we observe that more and more private but also public initiatives now support new teaching and learning methodologies with the learner at the centre of his learning and the teacher who acts as a facilitator in the process (Pérez-Paredes & Sánchez Tornel : 2009). If this learner-centered way of learning was first developed in the private sector, it is nowadays also fostered by public institutions with, for example, the CEFRL (Council of Europe: 2009). The change in methodology corresponds to an evolution of our today collaborative society where critical thinking and autonomy override knowledge (Depover, Quintin & Strebelle : 2013). This social transformation seems clearly linked with the implementation of new technologies that provide our society with adequate tools to fit its evolution. Looking at the growing use of mobile technologies in everyday life, it appears essential to study and develop the use of such technologies in {{language learning}}. Using first CALL then MALL, schools follow the trends and try to adapt to this rapid shift in society. While CALL has been developed for a few decades now, mobile learning is still a young field and before we start evaluating its efficiency in Belgium, {{there is a need to}} discuss the state of the current situation, particularly as we know that Belgium is slightly behind the trends regarding the use of mobiles – in 2013, only 35 % of the Walloon citizens had a smartphone (Agence Wallonne des Télécommunications: 2013). Therefore, our study aims first at listing the different uses of MALL in secondary schools in Belgium, more precisely in the <b>Federation</b> <b>Wallonia-Brussels,</b> and at linking them in our analysis with the level of IT knowledge of the actors in education and their attitudes towards these mobile technologies. These data will be collected thanks to a quantitative survey distributed in secondary schools to directions, teachers and pupils. Our poster intends to present the frame of the survey but also some primary findings on the topic. We intend then to cross the results of the survey with a state-of-the-art review on the topic and to establish an inventory of the official documents integrating technology in education in the <b>Federation</b> <b>Wallonia-Brussels.</b> Davis’s technology acceptance model (1989), which examines the relation between the perceived usefulness, the perceived ease of use and the user acceptance of information technology, will be used to structure our study and analysis, and will prepare for the second stage of our work. This consists in evaluating the efficiency of MALL in its actual use and further developing and improving the use of mobile technologies in EFL learning in our schools.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades several private and public {{initiatives}} have been contributing to the development and the integration of technological tools in secondary education. In Belgium, governmental projects such as ‘les plans Cyberécole et Cyberclasse’ since 1999 and 2005, ‘l’Ecole Numérique’ since 2011 and the recent ‘plan du Numérique (see www. ecolenumerique. be and www. digitalwallonia. be for more details) have been set up to equip schools and educational environments with, among others, computers and tablets. Whilst surveys have regularly been conducted to evaluate the access to technologies in our secondary schools, {{little is known about the}} actual use and integration of these technologies in classrooms in general and in our foreign language learning classrooms in particular. In addition, despite available information about the access to computers in schools, the use of mobile tools has largely been underinvestigated. CALL researchers have shown increasing interest in MALL, as the creation of the EUROCALL MALL SIG and the organization of the related two-day symposium testifies. As a consequence, I have chosen to investigate the use of MALL in Belgium, focusing on language learning in the last 3 years of secondary education in the French-speaking <b>Federation</b> <b>Wallonia-Brussels.</b> My presentation aims to assess the pupils’ ownership, use and knowledge of mobile technologies in and outside the classroom. In order to do so, I designed three online questionnaires for pupils, teachers and school principals. The descriptive analysis of the results will first provide an overview of the current presence of the computer, the tablet and the smartphone in our pupils’ life. The second part will then focus on the use of these tools in the learning of foreign languages. The aim of this investigation is to foster the use of mobile technologies, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively, by providing training to the different stakeholders in education...|$|R
40|$|On the 13 th March 2009, Belgium’s French Community (currently {{named the}} <b>Wallonia-Brussels</b> <b>Federation</b> (WBF)) parliament, adopted the “décret mémoire” (decree of remembrance). This deed shows Belgian public authorities’ will to mark their {{presence}} in the memorial field. The decree organizes the recognition and the financing of multiple actors and institutions by the authorities, through a structure and a hitherto unseen way of functioning. Among its activities, the decree organizes yearly calls for projects, whose recipients are non-profit-making organizations and educational institutions that are either organized or subsidised by the WBF. The organisation set in place by the decree of remembrance appears to be a “political use of the past”. That means that some past events are chosen and promoted to give meaning to the individual memory, in a collective intent. This way of doing comes from the political will to organize the representation of one common past, aiming to bring out themes that carry particular values. Consequently, is it possible to study the power that the decree actually gives to the public authorities? Does it allow them to constrain or to influence other actors of their memory field? If that is the case, how could it be possible to demonstrate it? We suggest trying to find an answer to these interrogations through a case study concerning the 2014 calls for projects of the year...|$|E
40|$|Background: Despite being a {{well-documented}} phenomenon, {{gender differences}} in psychological health complaints in adolescence are poorly understood. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test factors related to well-being as explanatory factors of {{gender differences in}} psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability or bad temper, nervousness, and sleeping difficulties) in adolescence. Methods: This study was based on the 9 th Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study, conducted in 2010 in the <b>Wallonia-Brussels</b> <b>Federation,</b> Belgium, on 9 – 24 year olds. Using logistic regression analyses, we studied gender differences in psychological complaints through well-being factors (life satisfaction, self-confidence, helplessness, and body image), across age categories, and examined the variation of female excess after taking into account each factor. Results: The four well-being factors together explained more than half of the female excess in feeling low. However, there were still significant gender differences in feeling low for children over 13. Among 13 to 15 -year-olds, there were no gender differences in irritability after adjustment. An important decrease in gender differences in nervousness was observed in the multivariate analyses, although there was still significant female excess in nervousness increasing from 13 years old. After full adjustment, only gender differences in sleeping difficulties among 13 – 15 -year-olds remained significant. For all psychological complaints studied, self-confidence caused the most important decrease in gender difference. Conclusions: This study showed that factors related to well-being could mediate the association between gender and psychological complaints, and pointed to the importance of taking into account well-being factors in the analyses of the aetiology of gender differences in psychological complaints. However, our results suggested that future research should explore additional explanations for gender differences in psychological complaints...|$|E

The Spitzer Space Telescope detected a transit of the innermost of these planets, HD 219134 b, whose mass and radius (4. 5 [*]M⊕ and 1. 6 [*]R⊕ respectively) are consistent with a rocky composition 1. Here, we report new high-precision time-series photometry of the star acquired with Spitzer revealing that the second innermost planet of the system, HD 219134 c, is also transiting. A global analysis of the Spitzer transit light curves and the most up-to-date HARPS-N velocity data set yields mass and radius estimations of 4. 74 ± 0. 19 [*]M⊕ and 1. 602 ± 0. 055 [*]R⊕ for HD 219134 b, and of 4. 36 ± 0. 22 [*]M⊕ and 1. 511 ± 0. 047 [*]R⊕ for HD 219134 c.

Thanks to the proximity and the small size of their host star (0. 778 ± 0. 005 R ⊙) 3, these two transiting exoplanets — the nearest to the Earth yet found — are well suited for a detailed characterization (for example, precision of a few per cent on mass and radius, and constraints on the atmospheric properties) that could give important constraints on the nature and formation mechanism of the ubiquitous short-period planets of a few Earth masses.

40|$|Domestic work {{provided}} by migrants in private households, both formally and informally, {{has been on}} the agenda of researchers and policymakers since the early 2000 s. Employment relationships between migrant workers and employers in this sector remain however underexplored, in particular in European contexts. Three aspects deserve further examination: the comparison between formal and informal settings, differences between childcare, elderly care and housework provision, as well as the links between inter-individual relations and policies. The main objective of this International Workshop is to open new perspectives in the study of employment relationships in domestic work, and to promote transnational and cross-disciplinary exchange between scholars studying the topic. This International Workshop featured keynote lectures by confirmed academics with expertise in migrant domestic work, followed by workshops open to early career researchers (PhD student-level and up). Theses workshops allowed selected participants to discuss papers submitted in advance with senior academics investigating domestic work, care and migration. The Workshop aimed {{to make the most of}} new methodological perspectives in the sociology of migration, promoting a transnational approach in the study of domestic work. The objective was also to bring employment relationships in migrant domestic work out of the shadow of the private sphere and allow discussion between academics specializing in this area of investigation. We welcomed researchers investigating both micro and macro aspects of migrant domestic work. Questions of interest included the personalization of the employment relationship between migrant domestic workers and private employers; differences between employment relations in housework, elderly care and childcare; as well as the influence on employment relationships of ‘otherness’ in the private space, of the formalization of employment and/or regularization of migratory status, and of different migratory and care regimes. Transnational perspectives are particularly welcome.

40|$|Bulk superconductors {{can be used}} as {{trapped field}} magnets with {{unprecedented}} performances. Such trapped field magnets find a variety of engineering applications, in particular for brushless rotating machines and levitation devices. Compared to conventional permanent magnets, however, the magnetic field generated by a superconducting trapped field magnet is much more sensitive to the presence of an external field that is not perfectly aligned with the superconductor magnetic moment, i. e. when the external field has a transverse component. A situation where the superconductor experiences a magnetic field with a transverse component is likely to happen several times during running operation of the device. As an example, in a “trapped flux” synchronous machine, any variation of the load of the shaft may lead to a slight misalignment of the magnetic moment of the superconductor (placed in the rotor) with respect to the rotating field (generated by the stator). In such a situation, the superconductor is subjected to a rotating field, and the situation is likely to be different from a situation where the superconductor is subjected to a pure transverse field. In the present work, we aim at examining different scenarios (i. e. transverse or rotating) where the trapped field magnet is subjected to a transverse component. These configurations are examined both experimentally and numerically. The numerical model is used to determine the distribution of currents in the cross-section of the superconductor. We examine the conditions where the rotating field leads to a partial remagnetization of the sample and is therefore less detrimental that the application of a pure transverse field. We also show that the magnetic moment of the sample may behave differently that the field at the surface of the superconductor. Finally, we investigate the behavior of structures where the superconductor is attached to a thin ferromagnetic disk, and show the beneficial effect of such hybrid structures compared to the superconductor alone.
