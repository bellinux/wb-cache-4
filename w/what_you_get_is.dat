500|$|In {{a review}} of Manson's album, his {{rendition}} of [...] "Cease to Exist" [...] was regarded as [...] "one of Manson's signature performances, and has justifiably invited comparison with Jim Croce and Jos√© Feliciano". Critic Michael Little considers Manson's version superior to the Beach Boys', having praise especially for Manson's vocals. Naturally, Little attests, [...] "you expect a tattered, raw, and raggedy voice, {{with a touch of}} lunatic rage, but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> a smooth-voiced folk singer".

2500|$|Chibnall was {{determined}} {{to ensure that the}} identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was obviously commercial, for it kept viewers watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting. [...] "There was a number of reasons for it, one of which was obviously {{that a lot of the}} story was driven from characters in the show not knowing, so it enables those characters to behave truthfully in that situation. And also what I wanted was for every performer to slightly suspect their character, and to really think about that, and to suspect each other. ... So <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> ambiguity, and what it also means is that any of the performer or performers who are responsible for what happened aren't flagging it or signaling it in any way whatsoever." [...] The producers discussed the need for secrecy at length during pre-production and agreed it was essential. Chibnall also discussed secrecy issues with directors James Strong and Euros Lyn, and they both agreed to its necessity before coming aboard the project. As roles were cast, Chibnall also explained to each actor that the killer's identity would be kept from them until near the end of the production.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, with many calling it [...] "safe" [...] and a disappointment.

Eventually <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> a soundtrack that would {{go along with the}} narrative and acts as a good situational ingredient but that's about it." [...] Koimoi also gave three out of five writing that album fall short of expectations. Planet Bollywood gave 5.5 out of 10, feeling [...] "Hai Ye Maaya" [...] was the only song worth listening, and wrote [...] " [...] Don 2 doesn't quite live up to expectations which were sky high after the huge success of the first film- it's a soundtrack that will only work alongside the movie and will take the story forward, but as an audio alone it just doesn't deliver. S-E-L play it safe by continuing on from where they left in the previous venture and there is hardly any innovation." [...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album a rating of two out of five calling it [...] "safe and self-conscious" [...] and wrote [...] "Don 2's music could fare much better if the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-and Loy had tried {{to step out of the}} prequel's shadow." ...|$|E
