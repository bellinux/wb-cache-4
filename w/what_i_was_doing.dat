5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
500|$|The entire {{experience}} {{of working on}} Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways, {{not the least of}} which was that it convinced me that I had overcome all traces of my depression. [...] My only thought was to keep on doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and I saw nothing in the future that could stop me.|$|E
500|$|On 7 May 2009, Hsu {{pleaded guilty}} {{in federal court in}} New York to ten counts of mail and wire fraud in {{connection}} with the Ponzi scheme. Hsu stated that [...] "I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> was illegal" [...] and faced up to 20 years in prison on each count. Hsu was still contesting the charges of campaign finance fraud, however.|$|E

500|$|Hardly knowing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing...</b> I {{sat down}} and started to work out an agonized craving for the sun and a furious revolt against that terrible cheerless, heartless food by writing down {{descriptions}} of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cooking. Even to write words like apricot, olives and butter, rice and lemons, oil and almonds, produced assuagement. Later I {{came to realize that}} in the England of 1947, those were dirty words I was putting down.|$|E
500|$|The first issues Lowndes was {{responsible}} for were the Spring 1941 issue of Science Fiction Quarterly and the April 1941 issue of Future Fiction. [...] Initially Silberkleit kept tighter control on Lowndes' editorial selections than he had over Hornig, vetoing {{five of the seven}} stories Lowndes proposed for the April 1941 Future, but by the August 1941 issue, Lowndes later recalled, Silberkleit [...] "was satisfied that I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and [...] didn't need to oversee any story I had accepted".|$|E
500|$|Midway through Stevens' first season, {{with the}} Bulldogs at 12–1, The New York Times wrote [...] "so far, Stevens {{has made the}} {{transition}} [...] look easy." [...] The Times went on to state that Stevens had the calm and composure of a seasoned veteran. [...] "You’ve {{got a lot of}} people always looking for the next step. And that’s not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I was just trying to figure out a way to win the next game and think like a head coach." [...] Stevens said.|$|E

Her natural poise and dynamism transcended all typical props and accessories. We've made great use here of our easy rapport." [...] Minogue commended the photo shoot at the time, saying [...] "So much of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> at this time had a tiny budget so I {{brought a lot of}} pieces, including the pink glitter stick roll, from home [...] It was a great, simple shoot with a lot of heart." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1912, Moreno {{attended}} one of Sigmund Freud's lectures. [...] In his autobiography, {{he recalled}} the experience: [...] "As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|After the event, Jenner took an American flag from {{a spectator}} {{and carried it}} during the victory lap, {{starting}} a tradition that is now common among winning athletes. Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: [...] "In 1972, I {{made the decision that}} I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the last time I would ever do this." [...] Jenner explained, [...] "It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got {{the rest of my life}} to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep it real, but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E
500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E
500|$|Forbidden Zone {{featured}} Bright's first work on film, and {{his only}} {{work as an}} actor (under the name [...] "Toshiro Baloney"). A {{founding member of the}} Mystic Knights, Bright later became a screenwriter and director in his own right. Bright's credits include Freeway, Ted Bundy, and Tiptoes. Bright and director Richard Elfman's only dispute during the screenwriting process was over a scene in which his character, Squeezit, was originally to have been beaten up for eight minutes and having the walls wiped with his blood. Another scene cut from the script would have had Squeezit being castrated. According to Bright, [...] "I didn't have any sense of limits or balance then, at the time, I... you know, I was just, didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I needed reining in." [...] During filming, Bright was sitting on the set in costume when a lighting stand fell onto his head, cracking his skull, and he had to be rushed to the hospital. When Bright returned to work the next day, he had a mild concussion and whiplash, but he continued with filming.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV upon the album's release, Big Boi explained that most of its material had been finished while at Jive, stating [...] "It's basically the same album. I could have been done, like, a year ago. But being that we were having creative differences — you know, every time they rejected <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> I would {{go back in the}} studio and work on more stuff. The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, but everything else was already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. I realized that it was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|When he {{returned}} to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, [...] "I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing.</b> I think perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] The painting was executed in a ground-floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington in London. A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist John Everett Millais. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.|$|E

500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so I have a good few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E
500|$|Eddie Van Halen, lead guitarist of {{hard rock}} band Van Halen, {{was asked to}} add a guitar solo. When {{initially}} contacted by Jones, Van Halen thought he was receiving a prank call. Having established that the call was genuine, Van Halen borrowed an amplifier from guitarist Allan Holdsworth and recorded his guitar solo free of any charge. [...] "I did it as a favor", the musician later said. [...] "I was a complete fool, according {{to the rest of}} the band, our manager and everyone else. I was not used. I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> – I don't do something unless I want to do it." [...] Van Halen recorded his contribution following Jones and Jackson arriving at the guitarist's house with a [...] "skeleton version" [...] of the song. Fellow guitarist Steve Lukather recalled, [...] "Initially, we rocked it out as Eddie had played a good solo—but Quincy thought it was too tough. So I had to reduce the distorted guitar sound and that is what was released." [...] The song was among the last four completed for Thriller; the others were [...] "Human Nature", [...] "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)" [...] and [...] "The Lady in My Life".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing!</b> The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E
