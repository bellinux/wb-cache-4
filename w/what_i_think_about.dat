In an interview for DJBooth, The-Dream discussed his musical approach to the album, stating [...] "This album's gonna be the same thing– a little more beefed up, I'm just gonna give you more.

This album is just gonna be the first album on some out of this world crack, basically". In an interview for The Village Voice, he discussed his use of melody, repetition, and hooks, relating it to child discipline, saying that [...] "Americans are not the biggest listeners. I didn't listen, which is why my granddaddy beat me half the time. It's only when the belt is swinging at you in the same repetitive manner that you actually start to listen. So it's all about creating a belt on the song that repetitiously swings at you. It doesn't mean that in between the belt swinging, I'm not saying stuff that means something".|$|E

Because the moderates are so nice we all are brought up with the idea that there's something good about religion and faith. That there's something good about bringing children up to have faith.|$|R
