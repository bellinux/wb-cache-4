40|$|When, in 1998, it came {{to light}} that a twenty-one-year-old White House intern named Monica Lewinsky had carried on an affair with U. S. President Bill Clinton {{while he was in}} office, the ensuing {{firestorm}} of media coverage of the story was predictable. So too were the President 2 ̆ 7 s initial denials of an affair, and, eventually, the impeachment proceedings brought against him. What was perhaps less predictable was the variety of ways in which <b>Ms.</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> was characterized in the media. A self-professed feminist writing for The Washington Monthly, which calls itself a 2 ̆ 2 progressive magazine, 2 ̆ 2 wrote about a 2 ̆ 2 painfully sentimental, pathologically vulnerable, sexually available young woman, 2 ̆ 2 noting that if she (the writer) were not 2 ̆ 2 a feminist, I guess I 2 ̆ 7 d call her a pathetic little slut. 2 ̆ 2 In the media, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> was reduced to either a cartoonishly two-dimensional, predatory seeker of validation and attention, or a completely mindless victim. Under either characterization, she was viewed as incapable of existing among thinking adults in a world of constrained, albeit present, agency...|$|R

Saying that [...] "just as Madonna made bras a public garment in the 1980s, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Lewinsky,</b> Paris Hilton and Britney Spears transformed women's panties into a provocative garment intended for public display", the New York Times claimed that the thong, with straps worn high over the hips and exposed by fashionable low-rise jeans and [...] "Juicy Couture" [...] sweat pants, had become a public icon.|$|R

Nevertheless, the show debuted to very high ratings, and Alessandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times: [...] "after {{years of trying to}} cash in on her fame by designing handbags and other self-marketing schemes, <b>Ms.</b> <b>Lewinsky</b> has finally found a fitting niche on television."

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMycobacterium abscessus {{complex is}} the second most common {{organism}} isolated from patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease in South Korea. This study aimed to compare clinical features and treatment outcomes of M. abscessus and Mycobacterium massiliense lung disease. MethodsWe retrospectively identified stored clinical isolates of M. abscessus complex as either M. abscessus or M. massiliense and reviewed medical records to compare clinical characteristics and treatment responses. All patients were treated empirically over several months with multidrug regimens, including a macrolide and one or more parenteral agents. ResultsOf the 249 patient isolates tested, 128 (59 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus and 69 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b>  massiliense) met the American Thoracic Society diagnostic criteria for NTM pulmonary disease, and treatment outcomes were analyzed in 48 patients (26 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus and 22 <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense). The clinical and radiologic findings were similar between the two groups. Although the durations of parenteral and total treatment were significantly shorter in patients <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense than in those <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus (4. 7 months vs 7. 4 months, P = . 006, and 12. 1 months vs 16. 3 months, P = . 043), the treatment success rate was significantly higher in patients <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense (95. 5 %) than in M. abscessus cases (42. 3 %, P < . 001). ConclusionPatients <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> massiliense pulmonary infection responded better to this antibiotic strategy than those <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> abscessus infection. A shortened duration of treatment may be sufficient for M. massiliense pulmonary infection...|$|R
40|$|Immune {{responses}} to Mycobacterium tuberculosis are analyzed in mice {{which have been}} immunized with Mycobacterium vaccae to examine novel ways of altering protective immunity against M. tuberculosis. The spleen cells of mice immunized <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> vaccae proliferate and secrete gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) in response to challenge <b>with</b> live <b>M.</b> tuberculosis in vitro. Immunization <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> vaccae results in the generation of CD 8 + T cells which kill syngeneic macrophages infected <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> tuberculosis. These effector cytotoxic T cells (CTL) are detectable in the spleen at 2 weeks after immunization <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> vaccae but cannot be found in splenocytes 3 to 6 weeks postimmunization. However, M. tuberculosis-specific CTL are revealed following restimulation in vitro <b>with</b> heat-killed <b>M.</b> vaccae or <b>M.</b> tuberculosis, consistent <b>with</b> the activation of memory cells. These CD 8 + T cells secrete IFN-gamma and enhance the production of interleukin 12 when cocultured <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> tuberculosis-infected macrophages. It is suggested that CD 8 + T cells with a cytokine secretion profile of the Tc 1 class may themselves maintain the dominance of a Th 1 -type cytokine response following immunization <b>with</b> <b>M.</b> vaccae.
