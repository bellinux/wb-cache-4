Borden courts and eventually marries Sarah, who {{gives birth to}} their daughter, Jess; but their relationship is shadowed by Sarah's intuition that Borden is keeping secrets and that sometimes he is lying <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> loves her. At his first show, Borden's bullet catch trick is sabotaged by Angier, and Borden loses two fingers. Angier launches his own magic career, hiring Olivia Wenscombe as his assistant and Cutter as his ingénieur. During the finale of Angier's show, a disguised Borden sabotages Angier's bird cage act, which maims an audience member and ruins Angier's reputation.|$|E

60|$|How much better, my friends, {{to let the}} Bible tell its own story; {{not to be so}} {{exceeding}} wise {{above what}} is written, just to believe that St. Paul knew better how to use words than we are likely to do,--just to believe that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> flesh <b>he</b> means flesh. Everybody agrees that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> spirit <b>he</b> means spirit, why, in the name of common sense, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> flesh should <b>he</b> not mean flesh? For my own part I believe that when St. Paul talks of man's flesh, he means by it man's body, man's heart and brain, and all his bodily appetites and powers--what we call a man's constitution; in a word, the ANIMAL part of man, just what a man has in common with the beasts who perish.|$|R

500|$|The story {{also shows}} {{the innocence of}} childhood; Nick Adams {{believes}} he will live forever and be a child forever; he is a character who sees his life [...] "stretching ahead." [...] At {{the end of the}} story, in the boat with his father, Nick denies death <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> will never die. [...] "Indian Camp" [...] shows Hemingway's early fascination with suicide and with the conflict between fathers and sons. Young thinks there is an unavoidable focus {{on the fact that the}} two people the principal characters are based on—the father, Clarence Hemingway, and the boy, Ernest Hemingway—end up committing suicide. Kenneth Lynn writes that the irony to modern readers is that both characters in [...] "that boat on the lake would one day do away with themselves". Hemingway shot himself on July 2, 1961; his father shot himself on December 6, 1928.|$|E

Even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> and his party would go with folded hands to people asking them to leave and only raise hands if they refuse, he treads the ground gingerly without naming any community or party per se". On 3 March, at a party function organised by the MNS at Shivaji Park, after the expiry of the gag order, Raj announced, [...] "I have not given up my mission", thus signalling to his supporters of continuing his stance on the migrant issue.|$|E
500|$|The 1937–1938 film tie-in serial {{comic strip}} [...] "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" [...] written by Merrill De Maris, {{one of the}} writers of the film, is centred {{primarily}} around the relationship between Snow White and the Queen. It further explores {{the source of the}} Queen's descent into a murderous envy, as she learns that the Prince came to her castle seeking {{the most beautiful woman in}} all the world and is shocked <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> meant Snow White. Like in the abandoned film concept, the Queen (here actually named Grimhilde) has the Prince arrested. In her Witch form, she later tells the captive Prince that she is going to get rid of Snow White and make him hers, while the Prince is defiant and calls her a [...] "miserable hag". This scene is followed by his escape from prison, in much less dramatic circumstances than the film's drowning concept. The film was also adapted into an other comics including in 1969, 1983, and 1991.|$|E

2500|$|Evelyn's {{friendship}} with Margaret Blagge, afterwards Mrs Godolphin, is {{recorded in the}} diary, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> designed [...] "to consecrate her worthy life to posterity".

The picture of Mistress Blagge's saintly life at court is heightened in interest when read in connexion with the scandalous memoirs of the comte de Gramont, or contemporary political satires on the court.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{relationship}} with Charlie is somewhat strained. Nancy is angry at Charlie's passivity. Her attempts to encourage Charlie to sink underwater {{as he did}} as a child meet with a negative response. This frustrates her. Over {{the course of the}} first act, it is revealed that she once considered divorcing him because she believed that he was having an affair. Though she readily accepts his word <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> did not, she does not think the [...] "good life" [...] they had together has been all that it could be. Still, Nancy remains loyal to Charlie. While she threatens to have adventures on her own, she does nothing about it.|$|E
2500|$|Myron Taylor, in {{his essay}} [...] "Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and the Irony of History", compares the logic and philosophies of Caesar and Brutus. Caesar is deemed an {{intuitive}} philosopher who is always right when he goes with his instinct, for instance <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> fears Cassius {{as a threat to}} him before he is killed, his intuition is correct. Brutus is portrayed as a man similar to Caesar, but whose passions lead him to the wrong reasoning, which he realises in the end when he says in V.v.50–51, [...] "Caesar, now be still:/ I kill'd not thee with half so good a will".|$|E

[...] On the way home Makoto stops in a field and attempts to rape the semi-conscious Shizuko, but his arousal brings on a hallucination of the black soldier he killed, forcing him to stop. [...] At home, Shizuko awakes to find herself tied up and calls for help, attracting the attention of Miyo. [...] Rather than helping the woman, Miyo seems pleased at her son's actions, and encourages him to rape Shizuko. [...] <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> can't because she is too beautiful, Miyo suggests Makoto give Shizuko an enema to overcome that impression. [...] He does, and after watching her expel it finds {{he is able to}} become aroused without issue. [...] He rapes Shizuko while his mother listens outside his room.|$|E
2500|$|Hippias Minor (...) , or On Lying, {{is thought}} to be one of Plato's early works. Socrates matches wits with an arrogant polymath, who is also a smug {{literary}} critic. Hippias believes that Homer can be taken at face value, and he also thinks that Achilles may be believed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> hates liars, whereas Odysseus' resourceful (...) behavior stems from his ability to lie well (365b). Socrates argues that Achilles is a cunning liar who throws people off the scent of his own deceptions and that cunning liars are actually the [...] "best" [...] liars. Consequently, Odysseus was equally false and true and so was Achilles (369b). Socrates proposes, possibly for the sheer dialectical fun of it, that it is better to do evil voluntarily than involuntarily. His case rests largely on the analogy with athletic skills, such as running and wrestling. [...] He says that a runner or wrestler who deliberately sandbags is better than the one who plods along because he can do no better.|$|E
2500|$|Slim buys a {{house and}} changes her name to Erin Ann Shleeter. Although their future looks bright after a visit from Joe, Mitch's friend tracks them down, passing the {{information}} on to Mitch. Mitch comes to the area, and hides in Slim's house. As she is going about her morning routine, to her horror, Mitch suddenly appears from the shadows in her hallway, saying he wants Slim back, promising [...] "it will be different." [...] When she refuses, he attacks, waking Gracie, who runs to help her mother, and jerks on his hair. [...] Mitch flings Gracie to the floor, which creates a diversion, and allows an opportunity for Slim to retaliate with pepper spray. Snatching up Gracie, as Mitch rolls {{on the floor in}} pain, she is prepared for a fast get-away, having an escape plan. A car chase ensues between Slim and Robbie (Noah Wyle, revealed earlier as Mitch's [...] "wing man" [...] during the encounter at the diner years before) while Gracie screams in the background. Realizing she cannot live her life in fear, Slim goes into hiding in San Francisco, hires a woman who looks like her to keep her cover, and sends Gracie away to Hawaii with her best friend Ginny {{to get her out of}} harm's way. She prepares herself with a self-defense trainer (Bruce A. Young) who teaches her Krav Maga, since self-defense is not murder. During her training, he gives Slim the final lesson - if Mitch knocks her down, she is to hold on to his voice and awaken when he is about to attack or kick her. She returns to Los Angeles, breaks into Mitch's new home and waits for him there to return home from work, after hiding his guns and blocking the phone connections, so he cannot call the police. When he arrives, Slim makes her presence known once he realizes someone's there. She approaches him to begin fighting, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> cannot hit her, she asks him why he could do it before when she was defenseless. She provokes him, and in the ensuing fight, Slim uses her new skills, beating Mitch until he becomes unconscious. After an opportunity to kill him with an object, she cannot bear to do it and throws the object away. She calls Ginny saying she cannot kill him, and while on the phone Mitch hits her from behind with a lamp. Slim puts into practice what she learned in her training and trips, beats and kicks him in the chest and sends him off a balcony to his death. She calls the police, who rule her actions as self-defense.|$|E
