40|$|National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{traceable}} {{standard weights}} {{serve as the}} foundation of mass measurement control programs. These standards are normally recalibrated annually at a cost of approximately $ 100 per weight. The Savannah River Site (SRS) has more than 4, 000 standard weights. Most have recalibration intervals of 1 year. The cost effectiveness of the current practice was questioned. Are these mass standards being calibrated too often, and are all of these standards needed for calibration and QC activities? Statistical analyses of data from the calibration histories were performed on a random sample of eight weight sets. The analyses indicated no time effects or significant trends in the weight masses for periods of from 5 to 8 years. In other words, calibration checks were being performed too frequently. In addition, current electronic balance technology does not require a traditional set of standard weights that cover the entire <b>weighing</b> <b>range</b> of a balance. At the most, only 2 or 3 standards are needed for most weighing systems. Hence, by increasing weight set recalibration frequencies from 1 to 3 years, and by reducing the number standards calibrated by 80 %, annual cost savings of over $ 400, 000 are attainable at SRS. Details of the data analysis, technological advances, and cost savings are included in the paper...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} measure the dynamic axle load of vehicles in motion, the dynamic weighing method of vehicles based on piezoelectric sensor was studied. Firstly, the influencing factors of the measurement accuracy in the dynamic weighing process were analyzed systematically, and {{the impacts of}} road irregularities and dynamic weighing system vibration on measurement error were discussed. On {{the basis of the}} analysis, the arithmetic mean filter method was used in the software algorithm to filter out the periodic interference added in the sensor signal, the most suitable n value was selected to get the better filtering result by simulation comparison. Then, the dynamic axle load calculation model of high speed vehicles was studied deeply, based on the theoretical response curve of the sensor, the dynamic axle load calculation method based on frequency reconstruction was established according to actual measurement signals of sensors and the analysis from time domain and frequency domain, also the least square method was used to realize the identification of temperature correction coefficient. A large amount of data that covered the usual vehicle <b>weighing</b> <b>range</b> was collected by experiment. The results show that the dynamic weighing signal system identification error all controlled within 10 % at the same temperature and 60 % of the vehicle data error can be controlled within 7 %. The temperature correction coefficient and the correction formula at different temperatures ranges are well adapted to ensure that the vehicle temperature error at different temperatures can also be controlled within 10 % and 70 % of the vehicle data error within 7 %. Furthermore, the weighing results remain stable regardless of the speed of the vehicle which meets the requirements for high-speed dynamic weighing...|$|E

Eco-efficiency indicators are calculated by dividing the "weighed", indicators by a value related to production.
