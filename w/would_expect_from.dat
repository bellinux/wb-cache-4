25|$|Moon-landing conspiracists focus {{heavily on}} NASA photos. They point to oddities in photos and films {{taken on the}} Moon. Photography experts (including those {{unrelated}} to NASA) answer that the oddities are what one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a real Moon landing, and not what would happen with tweaked or studio imagery. Some of the main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.|$|E
25|$|Baumeister {{and colleagues}} {{also note that}} volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of {{counterfactual}} thinking. This is worrying because counterfactual thinking ("If I had done something different...") {{is an important part}} of learning from one's choices, including those that harmed others. Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Michael Fitzgerald {{disputes}} {{the claim of}} schizophrenia, saying that Wain more likely had Asperger's syndrome (AS). Of particular note, Fitzgerald indicates that while Wain's art took on a more abstract nature as he grew older, his technique and skill as a painter did not diminish, as one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a person with schizophrenia. Moreover, elements of visual agnosia are demonstrated in his painting. If Wain had visual agnosia, it might have manifested itself merely as an extreme attention to detail.|$|E

25|$|In every control dialect, some syllables with {{different}} spellings will be pronounced the same. However, which these are differs from dialect to dialect. There are some irregular correlations: Often a particular variety {{will have a}} pronunciation for a syllable {{that is not what}} one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> other syllables with similar spellings, due to irregular developments in that variety. This is especially true with the voicing of Japanese consonants, which has evolved idiosyncratically in different compound words. However, except for Japanese voicing, the system is phonetic about 90% of the time.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} methods {{of determining the}} appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the risk-free rate, which is the return that an investor <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a risk premium that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment {{in excess of the}} risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.|$|E
25|$|The American {{historian}} Charles Maier rejected Nolteâ€™s claims {{regarding the}} moral equivalence of the Holocaust and Soviet terror {{on the grounds}} that while the latter was extremely brutal, it did not seek the physical annihilation of an entire people as state policy. The American historian Donald McKale blasted both Nolte and Andreas Hillgruber for their statements that the Allied strategic bombing offensives were just as much acts of genocide as the Holocaust, writing that that was just the sort of nonsense one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> Nazi apologists like Nolte and Hillgruber.|$|E

25|$|While at {{that stage}} not a union, the British Association of Social Workers {{operated}} a professional advice and representation service from the early 1990s. Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations {{provide the kind of}} representation you <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a trade union in the event of grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the good will of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Coastal {{residents}} have opposed offshore wind farms because of fears about impacts on marine life, the environment, electric power rates, aesthetics, and recreation such as fishing and boating. However, residents also cite improved electric power rates, air quality, and job creation as positive impacts they <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> wind farms. Because {{the bases of}} offshore turbines function as artificial reefs, {{studies have shown that}} after the initial disturbance of construction, local fish and shellfish are positively affected. Because wind turbines can be positioned at some distance from shore, impacts to recreation and fishing can be managed by careful planning of wind farm locations.|$|E
25|$|Low level waste (LLW) is {{generated}} from hospitals and industry, {{as well as}} the nuclear fuel cycle. Low-level wastes include paper, rags, tools, clothing, filters, and other materials which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity. Materials that originate from any region of an Active Area are commonly designated as LLW as a precautionary measure even if there is only a remote possibility of being contaminated with radioactive materials. Such LLW typically exhibits no higher radioactivity than one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the same material disposed of in a non-active area, such as a normal office block.|$|E

25|$|According to the Free-radical theory, {{oxidative}} damage initiated by {{reactive oxygen species}} is {{a major contributor to}} the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (as one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in Drosophila do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.|$|E
25|$|Brixtofte made {{headlines}} {{with a highly}} untraditional sale-and-lease-back model where the municipality sold buildings and facilities to private companies and rented them back. Due to various national tax issues this was highly advantageous for both parties. This scheme allowed the municipality {{to have one of}} the lowest tax rates in Denmark {{at the same time as}} spending a huge amount of money on various welfare programs. Every child in school was given a high-end computer and the elderly were offered a free annual trip to a foreign holiday destination. A lot of prestigious building projects were initiated such as a sports arena and marina completely out of proportion to what one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a city of this size.|$|E
25|$|Important {{members of}} the {{scientific}} community were spared from Stalin's usual amount of wrath and their punishments were often lessened from what one usually <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the regime. In the beginning this was mainly because of ideological reasons to not harm the party by punishing someone who had received a major award or had international accreditation. Scientists were given more chances to explain their behavior or prove their innocents than average citizens because they were seen as valuable. Later, though it would be for more practical reasons as scientists became the leaders in the arms race which played a major part in the Cold War. The Soviet Science Academy would become the dominant institute where these scientists were educated and often worked.|$|E

25|$|Counter punchers usually {{wear their}} {{opponent}}s down by {{causing them to}} miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try {{to stay away from}} the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> a defensive style.|$|E
25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of thorium}} are known: {{this is because}} thorium and uranium are the most stable and accessible actinides and are the only actinides that can be studied safely and legally in bulk in a normal laboratory. As such, they have the best-known chemistry of the actinides, along with that of plutonium, as the self-heating and radiation from them {{is not enough to}} cause radiolysis of chemical bonds as it is for the other actinides. While the later actinides from americium onwards are predominantly trivalent and behave more similarly to the corresponding lanthanides, as one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> periodic trends, the early actinides up to plutonium (thus including thorium and uranium) have relativistically destabilised and hence delocalised 5f and 6d electrons that participate in chemistry in a similar way to the early transition metals of group 3 through 8: thus, all their valence electrons can participate in chemical reactions, although this is not common for neptunium and plutonium.|$|E
25|$|David Hemp made 71 as Glamorgan {{made their}} way to a {{relatively}} competitive total of 255 in 77.3 overs on the first day, while Mushtaq Ahmed took five for 89 and James Kirtley four for 42 in response. When Glamorgan bowled, Alex Wharf and Dean Cosker took a wicket each, as Sussex worked their way to 70 for 2, with the match finely poised {{at the end of the}} first day. However, nineteen wickets tumbled on the second day, as Sussex took the victory one <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>from</b> the relative table positions of the two sides. They lost Ian Ward for 48 early on in the day, but fifties from Murray Goodwin and Chris Adams propelled them to a total of 317, a lead of 62. Rana Naved-ul-Hasan then made up for his wicketless first innings effort by having two men caught behind and one bowled, as Glamorgan crashed to 22 for 3, only to see a small rebuilding effort. But a good bowling effort from Mushtaq and Rana saw Glamorgan crash from 73 for 4 to 78 for 9 as four batsmen were out for ducks. Opener David Cherry was last out, for 39, as Glamorgan were bowled out for 96 in just 28 overs - Rana taking five for 41 and Mushtaq five for 29. Sussex chased 35 to win with ease, losing only Ward in a nine-wicket victory.|$|E
