25|$|Hood took Ma Sophie {{into service}} as a tender, {{charging}} her captain, Lieutenant William Donnett, with watching the channel between Diamond Rock and Martinique for enemy vessels. Donnett made frequent visits to the rock to gather the thick, broad-leaved grass to be woven into sailors' hats, and a spinach-like plant called callaloo, that when boiled and served daily, kept the crews of Centaur and Ma Sophie from scurvy and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> addition to a menu too long dominated by salt beef.|$|E
25|$|Oscar James, an {{experienced}} television and theatre actor, {{was chosen to}} play the role. James was physically much bigger than they'd originally had in mind, however they felt that his interpretation of Tony would be expansive and get noticed. They also thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> idea for father and son {{to be not only}} different in ages, but different physical types as well. Storywise it was felt {{it would be possible to}} build on this and also give them different attitudes.|$|E

25|$|Hood {{decided to}} use Sophie as a tender to Centaur. Lieutenant William Donnett became her captain {{with the task of}} {{monitoring}} the channel between Martinique and Diamond Rock, a basalt island south of Fort-de-France, the main port of Martinique, for enemy vessels. Subsequently, Donnett and Sophie frequently visited the Rock to gather both the thick, broad-leaved grass that the crew could weave into sailors' hats, and a spinach-like plant called callaloo. Callaloo, when boiled and served daily, kept the crews of Centaur and Sophie from scurvy and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> addition to a menu too long dominated by salt beef.|$|E
25|$|The Witch {{has raised}} Rapunzel {{as her own}} daughter, keeping her locked away from {{the world in a}} tall tower {{in the middle of the}} woods, {{accessible}} only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair ("Our Little World"). However, on this day a handsome prince spies the beautiful Rapunzel and resolves to climb the tower himself. In another part of the wood, the Baker has tracked down Little Red Ridinghood. Following the Witch's advice, he attempts to simply steal the red cape, but her ensuing temper tantrum guilts him into returning it. When Little Red Ridinghood arrives at her grandmother's house, she is swallowed by the Wolf. The Baker, in pursuit of the cape, slays the Wolf, pulling Little Red Ridinghood and her grandmother from the beast's innards. Little Red Riding hood rewards him with the red cape, reflecting on her new experiences ("I Know Things Now"). Meanwhile, Jack's mother angrily tosses the beans aside, which end up growing into an enormous stalk overnight, and sends her son to bed without supper. As Cinderella flees the Festival, pursued by another handsome prince and his steward, the Wife helps her hide and quizzes Cinderella about the ball. Cinderella explains that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> ball ("A Very Nice Prince") but seems fairly ambivalent about the experience. As a giant beanstalk begins to sprout from the ground next to Jack's cottage, the Baker's Wife spots Cinderella's pure gold slippers. She tries to chase after Cinderella but inadvertently allows Milky White to run off, leaving the Baker's Wife without the slippers or the cow. The characters each state morals and credos as the first midnight chimes ("First Midnight") and they continue their journeys through the woods.|$|E

500|$|Sarsgaard hosted Saturday Night Live (SNL) on January 21, 2006. In his {{introductory}} monologue, {{he tried}} {{to point out that}} he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy despite his sometimes macabre roles. Video clips were then played of Sarsgaard scaring the SNL cast. One sketch featured the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) global scare, which was still fresh in many minds, and one of the skits included a promotion for the Peter Sarsgaard [...] "SARS-Guard", a reference to the mania of facemasks worn in public by those fearing infection.|$|E
500|$|Season Elliot, {{senior editor}} of iF Magazine, gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "The Lizard himself <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> update of the {{original}} Lizard {{and he was still}} in his torn pants, shirt, and lab coat." [...] Elliot praised the design for differentiating itself from that used for Spider-Man or , and that he [...] "can't wait for the action figure of this guy!" [...] Like Goldman and Tanaka, Elliot enjoyed the action style and fight sequences and the callbacks to Lizard's original comic book appearance.|$|E
500|$|After Lennon became famous, she berated him for {{speaking}} in a Liverpudlian accent, but Lennon replied: [...] "That's showbusiness, {{they want me to}} speak more Liverpool". Despite the talk of Lennon being working class—as were Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr—he later refuted the idea by saying, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> clean-cut suburban boy, and in the class system I was about a half an inch in a higher class than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in subsidised government houses. We owned our own house, had our own garden. They didn't have anything like that".|$|E

Also in November, Shinoda stated that Fort Minor would go on an indefinite [...] hiatus, because of his dedication to Linkin Park. In the Billboard One-hit Wonders of the 2000s, Fort Minor (along with Holly Brook and Jonah Matranga) were listed at No.19, due {{to the success of}} [...] "Where'd You Go" [...] (since it was Fort Minor's only single that reached the top 25). In an interview in 2014, Shinoda stated {{that there could be a}} possible Fort Minor album in 2015.|$|E
500|$|Film {{historian}} Steven H. Scheuer graded {{the film}} {{one and a}} half stars, writing [...] "Wife is terrorized by unexplainable happenings. Or is it inexplicable? Both describe the film". VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever by Jim Craddock also gave the film {{one and a half}} stars, and TV Guide gave it two. Webber herself did not like the film, stating that [...] "it didn't impress me" [...] and she [...] "wanted to throw up" [...] after watching it. However, Nicol took a more positive stance, saying: [...] "I liked it; it had some nice dolly shots, a good atmosphere. So I was happy with that; it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> change from the films I'd been doing".|$|E
500|$|The station {{also served}} as the department's {{headquarters}} from 1910–1920, and the home for every fire chief from 1910 to 1928, including chief Ralph J. Scott. [...] Chief Scott's wife, Addie Scott, lived {{with him on the}} third floor and later recalled the station's early days: [...] "I remember the horses. [...] They really knew what to do. [...] When the bell would ring, they would come out and stand there to be hitched up. ... It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> life here for us. ... I remember trying to wax all these floors, and I just couldn't do it. [...] So someone came and helped me. [...] This is a lot of floor space you know." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics had divided {{opinions}} on the game's multiplayer. Camron thought that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> addition to the game, even though he thought it lacked the complexity a multiplayer mode should have, and that it failed to extend the game's longevity. Miller echoed this statement, and thought that the multiplayer mode failed to hook players. Walton thought that players would not return the mode after experiencing it once, and he described the mode as [...] "bland". Albert, in contrast, considered the mode a unique addition to the game, and thought that it had successfully added some strategy elements to the game. Chris Carter from Destructoid thought that the multiplayer mode {{was better than the}} game's main campaign. He described it as a [...] "pleasant surprise".|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, {{during a}} {{broadcast}} of Saturday Night Live, producer Lorne Michaels offered the Beatles $3,000 to reunite on his show. [...] Unbeknownst to him, John Lennon and Paul McCartney {{were watching the}} live broadcast at John's apartment at The Dakota in New York at the time, which was {{within walking distance of}} the studio where the show was being shot. [...] The two men entertained the idea of hailing a cab to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but ultimately declined, for as Paul later said [...] "It would have been work, and we were having a night off, so we elected not to go. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> idea – we nearly did it." ...|$|E
500|$|Clapton, in a {{separate}} interview, was also asked about the meaning and representation of Cersei's crown, saying [...] "I chose {{to make it in}} silver with just wisps of gold to try to show her isolation, her mental disentangling from her family. There is no reference to Baratheon; there is no need anymore. She doesn't have to try and prove a link. The center of the crown is the lion sigil abstracted — its mane represents the Iron Throne, her desire. She has made it her own — she is reborn." [...] Clapton revealed as well that King Tommen Baratheon's costume was intended to show how heavily his responsibilities weigh on him, as he is weighted down with jeweled finery, with Clapton saying [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> boy. Too nice for this." ...|$|E

500|$|Lopez was {{surprised}} by the enormous media coverage, declaring in an interview: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> dress. I had no idea it was going to become such a big deal." [...] Versace later revealed that the dress was the turning point of her career, saying that the media now had confidence in her own work, after the death of Gianni Versace. She declared to the Canadian press, [...] "It was an unexpected success. The next day she [...] was everywhere and people were talking about her in that dress. It was one of those moments like the one that Gianni [...] had with Elizabeth Hurley and clothes-pins." [...] The dress has been referred to many times as [...] "notorious" [...] and [...] "infamous" [...] because of its boldness.|$|E
500|$|Other {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the game's controls and multiplayer mode. Theobald felt {{the lack of an}} analog stick made the controls more difficult than the original game and required a short period of adjustment. He further stated that the digital pad and touchscreen's virtual analog control were [...] "tricky" [...] and required practice. Harris echoed similar comments and noted the touchscreen does not provide physical feedback like an analog stick. He added the game was never intended to be played without proper analog controls. Gerstmann referred to the multiplayer mode as [...] "uneventful" [...] and considered it lacking longevity, but commented {{that it was a good}} extra that demonstrated the system's wireless multiplayer capabilities. Theobald agreed it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> addition, but considered it a [...] "diversion" [...] that players would tire of quickly.|$|E
500|$|Derulo's {{version of}} [...] "Fight for You" [...] was {{recorded}} and engineered by Gelly Kusuma, Slam and Teddy Sky at Serenity West Recording Studio and Jim Henson Studios in Los Angeles, California.

All instruments and programming {{were provided by}} RedOne, BeatGeek and Slam. In a cover story for the Daily Star, Derulo stated that [...] "Fight for You" [...] was the first song he worked on with RedOne, saying [...] "I'm glad it turned out so dope". On working with RedOne, he said: [...] "Red first became hot when he produced the album The Fame with Lady Gaga.
