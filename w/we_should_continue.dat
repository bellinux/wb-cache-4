500|$|The end of {{the legal}} {{disputes}} coincided with the willingness and availability of Cameron, Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton {{to participate in the}} sequel; Schwarzenegger, who portrayed the Terminator in the first film, commented: [...] "I always felt <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> the story of The Terminator, I told Jim that right after we finished the first film." [...] He and Hamilton reprised their respective roles from the first Terminator film. After an extensive casting search, 12-year-old Edward Furlong was selected from hundreds of candidates to portray John Connor; Robert Patrick was chosen to play the T-1000 Terminator because his agility would emphasize the disparity between the advanced T-1000 and Schwarzenegger's older T-800 (Cameron characterized the two as [...] "a Porsche" [...] and [...] "a human Panzer tank" [...] respectively). Patrick had previously appeared in the action feature Die Hard 2, but Furlong had no formal acting experience. Joe Morton was picked to portray Miles Dyson, a Cyberdyne scientist who helped develop the new CPU for the T-800 Terminators.|$|E

After a two-hour phone conversation between DeLonge and Hoppus, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. DeLonge {{was the first to}} approach the subject of reuniting. The trio had, in Hoppus's words, [...] "two gnarly heart-to-hearts," [...] during which the three opened up. [...] "Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day," [...] recalled Hoppus, [...] "I remember he said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?' And I said, 'I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> with what we've been doing for the past 17 years. I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing.'" [...] Eventually, the band appeared {{for the first time on}} stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the 51st Grammy Awards on February 8, 2009. The band's official website was updated with a statement: [...] "To put it simply, We're back. We mean, really back. Picking up where we left off and then some. In the studio writing and recording a new album. Preparing to tour the world yet again. Friendships reformed. 17 years deep in our legacy." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{did not speak}} from their breakup until 2008. That August, Jerry Finn {{suffered}} a cerebral hemorrhage and was taken off life support. On September 19, Barker and Goldstein {{were involved in a}} plane crash that killed four people, leaving the two the only survivors. Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4-8 hour blood transfusions. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of the}} night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight; within minutes, he was crying in his seat. [...] "I thought he was going to die," [...] says DeLonge, who quickly reached out to his former bandmate, mailing him a letter and photograph. [...] "Instantly after the plane crash, I was like, 'Hey, I want to play music with him again. The trio eventually met up in the hospital, laying the grounds for what was going to be the band's reunion. Eventually, an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker's Los Angeles studio in October 2008. The three opened up, discussing the events of the hiatus and their break-up, and DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting. Hoppus remembered: [...] "I remember [...] said, 'So, what do you guys think? Where are your heads at?'

I had my own plan, and was just of an age to think it derogatory to my rank, to ask advice of any one. The proas were strongest ahead and on both bows, where they were collecting to the number of near twenty, evidently with the intention of boarding, should an opportunity offer; while, astern, and on our quarter, they were much fewer, and far more scattered.

A great work of dramatic art should not merely be made expressive of modern passion by means of the actor, but should be presented to us in the form most suitable to the modern spirit. Racine produced his Roman plays in Louis Quatorze dress on a stage crowded with spectators; but we require different conditions for the enjoyment of his art. Perfect accuracy of detail, for the sake of perfect illusion, is necessary for us. What we have to see is that the details are not allowed to usurp the principal place. They must be subordinate always to the general motive of the play. But subordination in art does not mean disregard of truth; it means conversion of fact into effect, and assigning to each detail its proper relative value ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few years}} ago I should be ashamed to {{overload}} a matter so capable of supporting itself by the then unnecessary support of any argument; but this seditious, unconstitutional doctrine is now publicly taught, avowed, and printed. The dislike I feel to revolutions, the signals for which have so often been given from pulpits,--the spirit of change that is gone abroad,--the total contempt which prevails with you, and may come to prevail with us, of all ancient institutions, when set in opposition to a present sense of convenience, or to the bent of a present inclination,--all these considerations make it not unadvisable, in my opinion, to call back {{our attention to the}} true principles of our own domestic laws, that you, my French friend, should begin to know, and that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> to cherish them. We ought not, {{on either side of the}} water, to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by the counterfeit wares which some persons, by a double fraud, export to you in illicit bottoms, as raw commodities of British growth, though wholly alien to our soil, in order afterwards to smuggle them back again into this country, manufactured after the newest Paris fashion of an improved liberty.|$|E
60|$|It is {{said that}} it, is {{possible}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>continue</b> to exist in some mode totally inconceivable to us at present. This is a most unreasonable presumption. It casts on the adherents of annihilation the burthen of proving the negative of a question, the affirmative of which is not supported by a single argument, and which, by its very nature, lies beyond {{the experience of the}} human understanding. It is sufficiently easy, indeed, to form any proposition, concerning which we are ignorant, just not so absurd as not to be contradictory in itself, and defy refutation. The possibility of whatever enters into the wildest imagination to conceive is thus triumphantly vindicated. But it is enough that such assertions should be either contradictory to the known laws of nature, or exceed the limits of our experience, that their fallacy or irrelevancy to our consideration should be demonstrated. They persuade, indeed, only those who desire to be persuaded. This desire to be for ever as we are; the reluctance to a violent and unexperienced change, which is common to all the animated and inanimate combinations of the universe, is, indeed, the secret persuasion which has given birth to the opinions of a future state.|$|E
