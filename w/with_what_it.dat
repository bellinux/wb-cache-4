25|$|On 7 March, Thamesdown {{passed a}} motion declaring its {{inability}} to set a rate. The council's chief executive, David Kent, wrote to all councillors after the meeting telling them that a rate had to be set {{by the end of}} March, and pressure appeared also from the Department of Health and Social Security which warned on 21 March {{that there would be a}} problem paying Housing Benefit to the council if no rate was made. The council felt sufficiently concerned to avoid budget chaos that it set up a special resources sub-committee to agree emergency measures for ordering supplies. On 25 March the Mayor summoned a special council meeting for 28 March, while senior councillors discussed options with the borough solicitor. The meeting on 28 March saw prolonged disruption from the public gallery by those who supported continued defiance, and Mayor Harry Garrett called on the police to keep order. Among the councillors the decision was taken to approve a legal rate of 196.65p; a council spokesman claimed that the council would be going ahead <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was going to do anyway.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Government of Canada told the Harbor Commission {{that it was}} cutting its subsidy of the airport. In {{response}} to the subsidy cut {{and a decline in}} annual traffic, the Harbour Commission board faced <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> saw as only two options: expand or close the airport, chose to expand the airport. In November 1989, the Harbor Commission voted to build a temporary passenger terminal and allow access to four more airlines at the airport: Air Ontario, Simo Air, Intair and Canadian Partner. The Commission planned to increase flights by 120 per day and increase the number of passengers by 500,000. It would also impose a $1.50 per user fee on the carriers to fund the improvements and cover the operating deficit. Toronto City Council voted to approve the expansion, but wanted a 90-flight per day limit. Air Ontario's president William Deluce announced it would start 14 flights a day between the island, Montreal and Ottawa. While the expansion had the approval of the harbour commission and city council, it awoke opposition to the airport from the Toronto Island Residents Association, who felt that there would be too many flights, leading to noise and air pollution and it would contravene the 1983 operating agreement.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, {{the field}} {{continued}} to evolve, although in large measure, {{on a local}} level. In the broader scheme of things the term 'ambulance service' was replaced by 'emergency medical service' to reflect the change from a transportation system to a system that provides actual medical care. The training, knowledge base, and skill sets of both paramedics and emergency medical technicians (both competed for the job title, and 'EMT-Paramedic' was a common compromise) were typically determined by what local medical directors were comfortable <b>with,</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was felt that the community needed, and what could actually be afforded. There were also tremendous local differences in the amount and type of training required, and {{how it would be}} provided. This ranged from in-service training in local systems, through community colleges, and ultimately even to universities. During the evolution of paramedicine, a great deal of both curriculum and skill set {{was in a state of}} constant flux. Permissible skills evolved in many cases at the local level, and were based upon the preferences of physician advisers and medical directors. Treatments would go in and out of fashion, and sometimes, back in again. The use of certain drugs, Bretylium for example, illustrate this. In some respects, the development seemed almost faddish. Technologies also evolved and changed, and as medical equipment manufacturers quickly learned, the pre-hospital environment was not the same as the hospital environment; equipment standards that worked fine in hospitals could not cope well with the less controlled pre-hospital environment.|$|E

500|$|Angelou's {{original}} {{goal was}} {{to write about the}} lives of Black women in America, but her goal evolved in her later volumes to document {{the ups and downs of}} her own life. [...] Angelou's autobiographies had the same structure: a historical overview of the places she was living in at the time and how she coped within the context of a larger white society, as well as the ways that her story played out within that context. [...] Angelou, especially in her third autobiography, Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas, successfully demonstrated the integrity of the African-American character as she experienced more positive interactions with whites. [...] In Angelou's second volume, Gather Together in My Name, Angelou was concerned <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant to be a Black female in the U.S., but she focused upon herself at a certain point in history.

500|$|On May 19, 2005, the Kentucky Supreme Court {{issued a}} 4–3 {{decision}} {{stating that the}} General Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by not passing a budget and that Fletcher had acted outside his constitutional authority by spending money not specifically appropriated by the legislature. The majority opinion rejected the lower court's exception for [...] "specific essential services", saying [...] "If the legislative department fails to appropriate funds deemed sufficient to operate the executive department at a desired level of services, the executive department must serve the citizenry as best it can <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is given. If the citizenry deems those services insufficient, it will exercise its own constitutional power — the ballot." [...] Chief Justice Joseph Lambert dissented, claiming the executive spending plan was necessary. Two other justices, in a separate opinion, disagreed with the majority that federal and state constitutional mandates should still be funded {{in the absence of}} a budget. In their dissent, they argued that the threat of a government shutdown would act as an impetus for the General Assembly to engage in timely budget-making. The decision took no retroactive steps to change the actions it ruled unconstitutional, but it served as a precedent for any future cases of budgetary gridlock.|$|E
500|$|At World's End {{was meant}} to return it tonally to a {{character}} piece. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended solitary confinement in Davy Jones's Locker, and now desires immortality. Sparrow struggles <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{takes to be a}} moral person, after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film. This is mainly shown by his increasingly erratic behaviour and Jack's hallucinations, which appeared to be simply his deranged mind in the beginning where dozens of [...] "Jack Sparrows" [...] appeared to crew the ship in his solitary exile, but later the hallucinations grew more important and there were mainly two [...] "Jacks" [...] constantly arguing about which path to follow: the immortality or the mortality. The last hallucination took place while Jack was imprisoned on the Dutchman, where his honest streak won (possibly due to not liking his sea creature-like [...] "future", which comedically dropped his brain and searched for it around the Brig). By the end of At World's End, Sparrow is sailing to the Fountain of Youth, an early concept for the second film. Rossio said in 2007 that a fourth film was possible, and producer Jerry Bruckheimer expressed interest in a spin-off. Gore Verbinski concurred that [...] "all of the stories set in motion by the first film have been resolved. If there ever were another Pirates of the Caribbean film, I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow." ...|$|E

The solution is to replace morality <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> really trying to describe: patterns in individual behaviour...|$|R

500|$|Valve still recognizes it has {{a problem}} <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> calls [...] "fake games", those that are built around reused assets and little other innovation, {{designed}} only to generate profit from unsuspecting users. To help assist finding and removing these games from the service, {{the company plans to}} add Steam Explorers atop its existing Steam Curator program, according to various YouTube personalities that have spoken out about such games in the past and with Valve directly, including Jim Sterling and TotalBiscuit. Any Steam user is able to sign up to be an Explorer, and are asked to look at under-performing games on the service as to either vouch that the game is truly original and simply lost among other releases, or if it {{is an example of a}} [...] "fake game", at which point Valve can take action to remove the game. Valve also made changes to the trading card system in May 2017 to prevent abuse by [...] "fake games". Valve found that some of the [...] "bad actors" [...] that released these games with trading card support then distributed game codes to thousands of bot-operated accounts that would run the game to earn trading cards that they could then sell for profit; these games would also create false positives that make these titles appear more popular than they really were and would impact games suggested to legitimate players through their store algorithms. Subsequent to this patch, games must reach some type of confidence factor based on actual playtime before they can generate trading cards, with players credited for their time played towards receiving trading cards before this metric is met.|$|E
500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed {{that she had been}} a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs...
