500|$|Minaj's [...] "Monster" [...] verse {{was listed}} by Complex {{as the best}} rap verse of the 2010s. West claimed {{at one point he}} {{considered}} deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of [...] "Monster" [...] because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and people to this day <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse.' So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment… ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{has never}} been proven who {{actually}} fired the final shot into his ear, or determined whether this shot was made during the gunfight {{or as part of}} a possible execution, with wide speculation remaining regarding the subject. Some of Escobar's relatives believe that he had committed suicide. His two brothers, Roberto Escobar and Fernando Sánchez Arellano, believe that he shot himself through the ear. In a statement regarding the topic, the duo would state that Pablo [...] "had committed suicide, he did not get killed. During all the years they went after him, he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> every day that if he was really cornered without a way out, he would 'shoot himself through the ear'." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{got a job}} on Hammerstein's Roof at $140 a {{week for}} myself, my horse, {{and the man who}} looked after it. I {{remained}} on the roof for eight weeks, always getting another two week extension when Willie Hammerstein <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> after the Monday matinee, 'you're good for two weeks more'... Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told him I would think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175. [...] "'What's he carrying?', Scribner asked Shea. 'Himself, a horse, and a man', answered Shea." [...] Scribner replied, [...] "'Give him eight weeks at $250'".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the lead}} role of Julien Davenne, Truffaut first wanted to cast actor Charles Denner, {{but he was not}} available. Because of the {{personal}} nature of the film and the character of Julien Davenne, Truffaut decided to play the part, stating that [...] "this film is like a handwritten letter. If you write by hand, it isn’t perfect, the writing may be shaky, but it is you, your writing." [...] This decision was not simply taken because Truffaut embodied the character, but because Davenne’s obsession, what he does throughout the whole film, what defines him, that is, keeping the memory of the dead alive, refusing to forget them, linked in a way to the activity of the director. Specifically, he felt a closeness to the character of Davenne, due to his own valuations of remembrance of the dead as helping in the [...] "struggle against the transience of life". Despite his strong feeling for the character, Truffaut was hesitant about the role and thought he may be perceived as too old. He had a wig made, but ended up not using it.. It was Truffaut's third and last of his own film in which he played a leading role. According to co-star Nathalie Baye, Truffaut almost shut the film down for fear of a bad performance: [...] "He <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'It's madness; it will never work!' And he came close to wanting to stop everything." ...|$|E

The chambers are reasonably comfortable, and the beds of a good quality--a point which S. and I tested experimentally soon after our arrival. I thought I should like to stay there a week, to be left there alone with Nature, and see what she <b>would</b> have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As {{the tour}} progressed to Australia and the United States in March and April 1973, Anderson pitched his idea to Howe, a {{prolific}} songwriter and arranger {{in the group}} who {{took an interest in}} the concept. In their spare time between performances on the tour, the two proceeded to hold [...] "candlelight writing sessions" [...] in their hotel rooms, sharing musical ideas and motifs that suited the album's themes. Howe recalled: [...] "Jon <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'What have you got that's a bit like that...?' so I'd play him something and he'd go: 'that's great. Have you got anything else?' and I'd play him another tune". One riff that Howe played for Anderson was rejected at first, but it was later incorporated into [...] "The Ancient" [...] as by then, the two sought for a different theme that would suit the track. In one marathon session in Savannah, Georgia, Anderson and Howe completed the outline of the vocals, lyrics, and instrumentation in six hours that ended at 7:00 a.m; by which time, the album took shape {{in the form of a}} double concept album of four side-long tracks. Anderson described the night as [...] "magical" [...] that [...] "left both of us exhilarated for days". When the album was announced to the rest of the group, Howe recalled an agreement to a double album, but one with just four tracks was met with some resistance. [...] "But Jon and I did manage to sell the idea ... sometimes [...] really had to spur the guys on".|$|E
2500|$|Benaderet {{continued}} her Burns & Allen radio {{role of the}} Burns' neighbor Blanche Morton, Gracie's friend and staunchest supporter who plays along in her escapades, {{and she was the}} only secondary cast member who appeared in every episode. The first six shows were shot live in New York, resulting in her commuting to and from Los Angeles, where she worked several radio assignments at the time. Blanche's husband Harry was played by four actors over the show's eight-year run; the last, Larry Keating, was introduced on the October 5, 1953 fourth-season premiere when George Burns entered the set and halted a scene of an angered Blanche preparing to hit Harry with a book. Burns introduced Keating to Benaderet and the audience, and she broke character to exchange pleasantries with Keating. The segment then resumed and Benaderet struck Keating with the book. [...] Benaderet and Gracie Allen regularly shopped for their own on-set wardrobe, and she developed a high-pitched laugh for Blanche that became a staple of the character and was often used for comic effect: [...] "When we had a scene with some silent spots in it, George <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'Laugh there, Bea.'" [...] Benaderet garnered two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1954 and 1955. Following Allen's retirement in 1958 {{at the end of the}} eighth season, the program continued as The George Burns Show in 1958-59 with Blanche repackaged as George's secretary, but it was canceled after one season due to low ratings. Benaderet worked sparsely in 1959, filming one-time appearances on General Electric Theater and The Restless Gun.|$|E
