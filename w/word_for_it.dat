25|$|The 'cuttle' in '{{cuttlefish}}' {{comes from}} the Old English name for the species, cudele, which may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi ('cushion') and the Middle Low German Kudel ('rag'). The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish {{as a source of}} the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it is alarmed. The <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to a brown pigment in English.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the growth}} of glass working in the Hellenistic World and the growing place of glass in {{material}} culture, {{at the beginning of}} the 1st century AD there was still no Latin <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> in the Roman World. However, glass was being produced in Roman contexts using primarily Hellenistic techniques and styles (see glass, history) by the late Republican period. The majority of manufacturing techniques were time-consuming, and the initial product was a thick-walled vessel which required considerable finishing. This, combined with the cost of importing natron for the production of raw glass, contributed to the limited use of glass and its position as an expensive and high-status material.|$|E
25|$|Though beer {{was drunk}} in Ancient Rome, it was {{replaced}} in popularity by wine. Tacitus wrote disparagingly {{of the beer}} brewed by the Germanic peoples of his day. Thracians were also known to consume beer made from rye, even since the 5th century BC, as the ancient Greek logographer Hellanicus of Lesbos says. Their name for beer was brutos, or brytos. The Romans called their brew cerevisia, from the Celtic <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Beer was apparently enjoyed by some Roman legionaries. For instance, among the Vindolanda tablets (from Vindolanda in Roman Britain, dated c. 97-103 AD), the cavalry decurion Masculus {{wrote a letter to}} prefect Flavius Cerialis inquiring about the exact instructions for his men for the following day. This included a polite request for beer to be sent to the garrison (which had entirely consumed its previous stock of beer).|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} the book, John Lennon, My Brother—written with Giuliano, and a foreword by McCartney—Baird travelled to New York during 1989 {{to appear at}} a Beatlefest convention, and was {{asked if she could}} prove she was really Lennon's half-sister. Baird declined, saying {{she was not going to}} produce her passport, and the audience would just have to take her <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> In 2000, Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs, erected on major routes into Liverpool, saying, [...] "Liverpool welcomes you – to the birthplace of THE BEATLES", and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon's birthday.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, the Sihanaka were {{estimated}} to number around 200,000. Families are hierarchical, with parents exercising authoritarian {{control over their}} children. [...] Sihanaka {{men and women have}} significant autonomy in deciding when to marry and whether to divorce. [...] Marriages are disallowed between siblings, cousins, and direct ascendents. To reinforce this forbidden physical intimacy, Sihanaka have historically used a formal term of address when speaking to these particular family members. Mothers are traditionally subject to several fady, such as not being allowed to look at dead infants, eat veal, or eat a particular type of banana once their child had learned to say the <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Parents were traditionally responsible for educating their own children, and while today those who can afford a formal education will study at school, parents and the broader community remain collectively engaged in educating children into social and cultural norms and practices. Male children are circumcised by their families no later than the age of seven.|$|E

500|$|Some {{time after}} the match, Kinnaird {{informed}} the council of the Football Association (FA), {{of which he was}} a member, that in his opinion he had not carried the ball over the line for Oxford's goal. [...] Despite the fact that the referee had awarded the goal and multiple newspaper reports stated that the ball had clearly gone over the line, Kinnaird's fellow council members took his <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and struck the goal from the records, changing the official score to 2–0 (although if Oxford had not scored, {{there would have been no}} reason for the game to go to extra time, so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers' second goal as well). [...] For the next century, all sources reported the score of the match as 2–0. [...] In the 1980s, after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians, the FA reinstated the Oxford goal, and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2–1.|$|E
500|$|The Democratic {{press was}} unimpressed by Harrison's nomination, and {{attacked}} {{him for not}} publishing his views on the main issues of the day, dubbing him [...] "General Mum". The New York Herald mocked the aging general, [...] "Mrs. Harrison of Ohio is undoubtedly a very excellent matron for her time, but if we must take a woman president, let's have youth and beauty, and not age and imbecility." [...] John de Ziska, Washington correspondent for the Baltimore Republican (a Democratic paper) who wrote under the initial Z, alleged that one particularly embittered Clayite had wondered how to [...] "get rid of" [...] Harrison, and the paper printed Z's suggestion: [...] "Give him a barrel of hard cider, and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> he will sit {{the remainder of his}} days in his log cabin by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy."

500|$|Dodd {{contributed to}} several films in which issues facing Indigenous Australians, such as land rights and race relations, were the central subjects. These {{appearances}} included Bitter Springs (mentioned above) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (1978), {{the first of}} two films in which he appeared alongside Jack Thompson. Dodd played the character of Tabidgi, the uncle of the lead character, Aboriginal man Jimmie Blacksmith. In the film, Jimmie Blacksmith marries a white woman named Gilda Marshall (played by Angela Punch McGregor). When they have a baby, Dodd's character, [...] "a tribal elder,... is worried about Jimmie's marriage to a white woman and has brought him a talisman to keep him safe". Pauline Kael, writing in The New Yorker, described the performances of the two black professional actors (Jack Charles and Dodd) as [...] "wonderful as sots:...

500|$|As {{the book}} became {{acclaimed}} {{as a modern}} classic, it began {{to be used in}} the classroom, and Juster corresponded with some teachers. After the book's readers attained adulthood, they wrote of its influence on them. Novelist Cathleen Schine recalled, [...] "it was as if someone had turned on the lights. The concepts of irony, of double entendre, of words as play, of the pleasure and inevitability of intellectual absurdity, were suddenly accessible to me. They made sense to me in an extremely personal way." [...] British fantasy writer Diana Wynne Jones read her copy so often it fell apart: [...] "it didn't occur to us that it might be about something. It struck us as a little like The Wizard of Oz, only better." [...] One reader, signing himself [...] "Milo", wrote to Rolling Stone in 1970, [...] "If you want to get freaked out of your undernourished head, pick up The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster.

Further writing assistance from Astudillo continued with [...] "¿Qué Creias?", which was written in its entirety {{in the back of}} a car while the band was touring in California. Tejano singer David Lee Garza lent his [...] "soulful" [...] accordion style on the track. The song [...] "La Carcacha" [...] was written by A.B. after he and Ojeda saw a broken-down car at a restaurant in Ovalo, Texas; Ojeda told A.B. that the Spanish <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "carcacha". A month later, A.B. bought a BMW, ordered takeout, and overheard a conversation between two women who said that they would date a man because of his car. A.B. said that this was his inspiration to write a comical song with a moral message; it took him six months to write the song, as he was [...] "fiddling around back and forth" [...] to perfect it. The last song that was recorded for the album, [...] "Amame", was written by Astudillo and Selena; this was the first song that Selena had written since [...] "My Love" [...] (1989).|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a C rating, noting that Test the Store' {{was just too}} dumb to build any further momentum; I wish I had a better <b>word</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> but I just can't think of one." [...] However, McNutt appreciated Jim's presentation, noting that [...] "the final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode three out of five stars, noting that the episode fell victim to [...] "the overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued The Office all season." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, noting that [...] "The Office continues to get the comedy boost it needs from the Florida storyline." [...] Hyatt called the scene featuring Dwight and Jim imitating Kelly and Ryan's mom as [...] "one of my favorite moments of the season so far." [...] Despite this, he did call the episode [...] "uneven," [...] noting that the Scranton story-line was [...] "ho-hum." [...] Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and praised Jim's presentation, writing, [...] "Between Jim's outfit and makeup, the fact that he embraced the presentation throughout, and all of the Chuck references, I was speechless {{by the end of that}} thing." ...|$|E
