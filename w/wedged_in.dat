5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Queen's Park {{requested}} more land {{for development of}} the second Hampden Park. This was refused by the landlords, {{which led to the}} club seeking a new site. Henry Erskine Gordon agreed to sell 12 acres of land off Somerville Drive to Queen's Park in November 1899. James Miller designed twin grandstands along {{the south side of the}} ground with a pavilion <b>wedged</b> <b>in</b> between. The natural slopes were shaped to form banks of terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch. Construction of the new ground took over three years to complete; during construction, a disaster occurred at Ibrox in which part of the wooden terraces collapsed. In response, the terraces at Hampden were firmly set in the earthwork and innovative techniques were used to control spectators.|$|E
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} gearing was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when <b>wedged</b> <b>in</b> position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E

30|$|Theories of {{uncertainty}} and labor fluctuations have different predictions for the labor <b>wedge.</b> <b>In</b> Bloom, et al. (2011, see especially their Equation 12), uncertainty does not create any employee wedge. Uncertainty reduces labor in their model by reducing real wages (both wages paid by employers and wages received by employees) and moving households along their labor supply curves. Uncertainty does create an employer <b>wedge</b> <b>in</b> their model, because hiring labor {{up to the}} point where wage equals marginal product ignores the option value of delaying hires in the face {{of uncertainty}}. Uncertainty also creates an employer <b>wedge</b> <b>in</b> Fernandez-Villaverde, et al. (2012)’s model: by increasing the degree to which employers mark up their product prices over marginal cost. In this way, both models predict that labor productivity grows more than compensation per hour whenever the degree of uncertainty increases.|$|R
