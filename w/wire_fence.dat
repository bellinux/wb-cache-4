5|$|In June 2009, the National Trust {{announced}} plans to reclad the monument {{at a cost of}} £4 million. The painted fence was replaced by an open <b>wire</b> <b>fence</b> in 2010, aiding visibility, but still denying public access {{to the base of the}} monument. Survey work in 2010 showed the extent of cracks in the stonework. In 2013 it was announced that further funding would be needed for the restoration project. Sensors recording the movement of the tower are also to be installed.|$|E

40|$|On November 24, 1874, United States Patent No. 157, 124 {{was granted}} to Joseph Glidden of DeKalb, Ill., for {{improved}} barbed <b>wire</b> <b>fencing.</b> Glidden’s patent was {{the culmination of}} a series of nine patents for improvements to <b>wire</b> <b>fencing</b> that were granted by the U. S. Patent Offi ce to American inventors, beginning with Michael Kelly in November 1868 and ending with Glidden’s patent (McCallum and McCallum, 1965), which quickly became dominant. To be sure, <b>wire</b> <b>fencing</b> had been used for a very long time. However, property rights over livestock were less secure, as <b>wire</b> <b>fencing</b> would often break under the impact of heavy livestock pressing against the fencing. This would not happen with barbed wire, so the costs at which property rights to livestock could be protected fell dramatically (Dennen, 1976; Anderson and Hill, 2004) ...|$|R
5|$|The Velepromet {{camp was}} a {{detention}} facility {{established in the}} final days of the Battle of Vukovar during the Croatian War of Independence. The camp was set up by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), which shared control of the facility with Croatian Serb rebels. The facility, originally an industrial storage site, was located on the southern outskirts of the city of Vukovar, in close proximity to the JNA barracks. It consisted of eight warehouses surrounded by a <b>wire</b> <b>fence,</b> and was established on 16 November 1991, when the first detainees were brought there.|$|E

As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed <b>wire</b> <b>fence</b> flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them {{that it would not}} be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to use it for. When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a <b>wire</b> <b>fence.</b> Changes to the site were minimized in order to make it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E

The U.S. defeated France 17 to 3, becoming the only team to win gold twice in the sport. At the final whistle the pitch was invaded and the French team, aided by the police, did their best to protect their opponents. The medal ceremony took place with police protection – gold for the U.S., silver for France, and bronze for Romania.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which {{used it as a}} warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known as building F, and a <b>wire</b> <b>fence.</b> Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of Education that housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.|$|E
5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of being so closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed <b>wire</b> <b>fence</b> around the tower.|$|E

40|$|Detection {{of outdoor}} <b>wire</b> <b>fences</b> in images is an {{important}} and preliminary step in an automated image analysis algorithm {{for the detection of}} wire-fence integrity. The challenge is that not only are the <b>wires</b> of the <b>fences</b> in general very thin, a daytime variation in illumination makes the task even more difficult as this may cause non-uniform illumination across the fences. We address the problem of wire-fence detection by an image processing algorithm that combines the Sobel edge operator with an adaptive thresholding technique to generate a binary image. Simulation results demonstrate that the edges of <b>wire</b> <b>fences</b> can be detected accurately under different illumination conditions.
