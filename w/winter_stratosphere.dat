In spite of the great distance involved, this inter-hemispheric link has been suggested to be the principal reason for both the year-to-year variability and the hemispheric differences {{in the frequency of}} occurrence of these high-altitude clouds. In this study, we investigate the dynamical influence of the <b>winter</b> <b>stratosphere</b> on the summer mesosphere using simulations from the vertically extended version of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM).

Using a composite analysis to isolate the events, it is argued that the mechanism for interhemispheric coupling is a feedback between summer mesosphere gravity-wave drag (GWD) and zonal wind, which is induced by an anomaly in mesospheric cross-equatorial flow, the latter arising from the anomaly in winter hemisphere GWD induced by the anomaly in stratospheric conditions...|$|E

We analyze {{here the}} polar stratospheric temper-atures in an {{ensemble}} of three 150 -year integrations of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM), an interac-tive chemistry-climate model which simulates ozone deple-tion and recovery, {{as well as}} climate change. A key motiva-tion is to understand possible mechanisms for the observed trend in the extent of conditions favourable for polar strato-spheric cloud (PSC) formation in the Arctic <b>winter</b> lower <b>stratosphere.</b> We find that in the Antarctic <b>winter</b> lower <b>stratosphere,</b> the low temperature extremes required for PSC formation in-crease in the model as ozone is depleted, but remain steady through the twenty-first century as the warming from ozone recovery roughly balances the cooling from climate change. Thus, ozone depletion itself {{plays a major role}} in the Antarc-tic trends in low temperature extremes. The model trend in low temperature extremes in the Arc-tic through the latter half of the twentieth century is weaker and less statistically robust than the observed trend. It is not projected to continue into the future. Ozone depletion in the Arctic is weaker in the CMAM than in observations, which may account for the weak past trend in low temperature ex-tremes. In the future, radiative cooling in the Arctic winter due to climate change is more than compensated by an in-crease in dynamically driven downwelling over the pole. ...|$|R
40|$|According to the 'downward control' principle, the extratropical mean {{vertical}} velocity {{on a given}} {{pressure level}} is approximately proportional to the meridional gradient of the vertically integrated zonal force per unit mass exerted by waves above that level. In this paper, a simple numerical model that includes parameterizations of both planetary and gravity wave breaking is used to {{explore the influence of}} gravity wave breaking in the mesosphere on the mean meridional circulation and temperature distribution at lower levels in the polar <b>winter</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> The results of these calculations suggest that gravity wave drag in the mesosphere can affect the state of the polar <b>winter</b> <b>stratosphere</b> down to altitudes below 30 km. The effect is most important when planetary wave driving is relatively weak: that is, during southern winter and in early northern winter. In southern winter, downwelling weakens by a factor of 2 near the stratospause and by 20 % at 30 km when gravity wave drag is not included in the calculations. As a consequence, temperatures decrease considerably throughout the polar <b>winter</b> <b>stratosphere</b> (over 20 K above 40 km and as much as 8 K at 30 km, where the effect is enhanced by the long radiative relaxation timescale).

These modes are approximately nondispersive. Study of realistic analytical jet profiles shows that broader jets, and jets which peak at higher latitudes produce poleward modes that are less dispersive. Jet profiles derived from observational data are studied in detail for three Southern Hemisphere winter months, and the results are compared with quasi-nondispersive features which have been observed in satellite data in the Southern hemisphere <b>winter</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> Characteristics of the barotropically unstable modes agree remarkably well with those of the observed features.

When the wavenumber 1 10 -mb height data are projected onto the phase plane defined by the 10 -mb zonal-mean winds and wavenumber 1 100 -mb heights, three preferred regimes are evident. The small-amplitude mode separates into a strong zonal wind-weak wave regime and a weak zonal wind-weak wave regime. The large-amplitude mode is an intermediate zonal wind-strong wave regime. Transitions between the large-amplitude regime and the weak zonal wind-weak wave regime are found to be associated with major stratospheric warmings.

A principal goal of this work is to investigate the latter problem using a general circulation model with stratospheric resolution that is forced with a very weak surface temperature gradient.

However, it is very challenging to establish such a benchmark because {{it is difficult to}} observe temperatures in the polar region and numerous factors affect the temperature variations. Ground-base lidars are capable of providing high-resolution and long-duration measurements of temperatures in the polar region, which is critical in advancing our understanding of the {{middle atmosphere}} thermal structures and dynamics. In this study, the lidar temperature morphology is formed at Rothera (67. 5 ºS, 68 ºW) and South Pole using the lidar observations from 1999 to 2005. Teleconnection (inter-hemispheric coupling) is one of the new mechanisms causing, e. g., the temperature variations in the southern polar middle and upper atmosphere by regions not physically attached, e. g., the northern polar stratosphere. We study it by deriving the teleconnection patterns over the global latitudes and from the stratosphere to lower thermosphere using 8 -year temperature observations of SABER and 54 -year temperature and wind simulations of WACCM. A main new finding is that the teleconnection extends well into the lower thermosphere, the thermospheric anomalies are consistent with the corresponding changes of the winter-to-summer lower-thermospheric branch of the residual circulation, and the <b>winter</b> <b>stratosphere</b> perturbations influence the stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere globally.
