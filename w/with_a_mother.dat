5|$|Moore {{has written}} one children's book {{separate}} from the Freckleface Strawberry series. Released in 2013, My Mom is a Foreigner, But Not to Me is based on her experiences of growing up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> from another country. The book had a negative reception from Publishers Weekly and Kirkus Reviews; while recognizing it as well-intentioned, Moore's use of verse and rhyme was criticised.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, largely {{recorded}} in Iceland from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, numerous tales {{and information about}} Thor are provided. In these sources, Thor bears at least fourteen names, is the husband of the golden-haired goddess Sif, is the lover of the jötunn Járnsaxa, and is generally described as fierce eyed, red haired and red bearded. With Sif, Thor fathered the goddess (and possible valkyrie) Þrúðr; with Járnsaxa, he fathered Magni; <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> whose name is not recorded, he fathered Móði, {{and he is the}} stepfather of the god Ullr. The same sources list Thor as the son of the god Odin and the personified earth, Jörð, and by way of Odin, Thor has numerous brothers. Thor has two servants, Þjálfi and Röskva, rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr (that he eats and resurrects), and is ascribed three dwellings (Bilskirnir, Þrúðheimr, and Þrúðvangr). Thor wields the mountain-crushing hammer, Mjölnir, wears the belt Megingjörð and the iron gloves Járngreipr, and owns the staff Gríðarvölr. Thor's exploits, including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr—and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnarök—are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology.|$|E

Cosette dreams of a life <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly ("Castle on a Cloud"). The Thénardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and {{live a life of}} criminal depravity ("Master of the House"). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Thénardiers payment to adopt her ("The Bargain"). The Thénardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris ("The Waltz of Treachery").|$|E

500|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{claimed the}} story was born in early 1940, when he left a window open in his studio, and the wind {{fortuitously}} blew a sketch of an elephant {{on top of a}} sketch of a tree. However, according to later biographer Charles Cohen, this account is probably apocryphal. He found elements of Horton in earlier Dr. Seuss works, most notably the 1938 short story [...] "Matilda, the Elephant <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mother</b> Complex".|$|E

In 1917 she became acquainted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> of newborn twins, {{one of whom was}} chronically ill. The child's parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son's condition.

500|$|In 1968, Steiger {{played a}} serial killer {{opposite}} George Segal in Jack Smight's black comedy thriller No Way to Treat a Lady. During {{the course of the}} film, he adopts various disguises, including those of a priest, a policeman, a plumber, and a hairdresser, to avoid being identified, and to put his victims at ease, before strangling them and painting a pair of lips on their foreheads with garish red lipstick. The film and Steiger's performance were critically acclaimed, with Vincent Canby of The New York Times highlighting Steiger's [...] "beautifully uninhibited performance as a hammy", and a writer for Time Out describing him as [...] "brilliant as a sort of Boston strangler, son of a great actress who has left her boy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> fixation". Later in 1968, Steiger played a repressed gay non-commissioned officer opposite John Phillip Law in John Flynn's The Sergeant for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, which earned him the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor. Despite the award win, film critic Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was particularly critical of the casting of Steiger as a homosexual and felt that he was [...] "totally outside his range", to which Steiger concurred that he was ineffective.|$|E

[...] In 775, Zhu Ci was put in charge of the defense post Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), and in 776 was given the de facto chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事). [...] He returned to Chang'an around the new year 778. [...] He was soon given the additional title of military governor of Longyou Circuit (隴右, headquartered in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) -- which had fallen to Tufan and thus was a largely honorary title—and was given the command of the armies originally sent from Hexi (河西, headquartered in modern Wuwei, Gansu, which had also fallen to Tufan since their departure) and Zelu (澤潞, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) Circuits.

2500|$|West's {{relationship}} with her son, Anthony West, was not a happy one. The rancor between them {{came to a head}} when Anthony, himself a gifted writer, his father's biographer (H. G. Wells: Aspects of a Life [...] ), and a novelist, published Heritage (1955), a fictionalized autobiography. West never forgave her son for depicting in Heritage the relationship between an illegitimate son and his two world-famous, unmarried parents, and for portraying the mother in unflattering terms. Essentially, she felt Anthony was airing in public his accusations against her as a bad mother, which stemmed partly from {{the fact that she had}} made a fiction of his provenance. She had asked him to call her Auntie, and his father Wellsie, until he was about four or five. He also felt she had made a habit of leaving him in institutions in his early years while she developed her career in the United States. West countered by claiming that she spent as much time with him as any child could reasonably hope to spend <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> who was a professional. She was exasperated at his focus on her parenting, when he did not accuse his father of abandonment, even though Wells had been even more absent during Anthony's youth. Anthony, in fact, idolized Wells. The depiction of West's alter ego in Heritage as a deceitful, unloving actress (West had trained as an actress in her youth) and poor caregiver so wounded West that she broke off relations with her son and threatened to sue any publisher who would bring out Heritage in England. She successfully suppressed an English edition of the novel, which was only published there after her death, in 1984. Although there were temporary rapprochements between her and Anthony, a state of alienation persisted between them, causing West grief until her dying hour. She fretted about her son's absence from her deathbed, but when asked whether he should be sent for, answered: [...] "perhaps not, if he hates me so much".|$|E
