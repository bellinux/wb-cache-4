When the woman of fashion permitted Strether--as she permitted him at the most--the purchase of a pair of gloves, the terms she made about it, the prohibition of neckties and other items till she should be able to guide him through the Burlington Arcade, were such as to fall upon a sensitive ear as a challenge to just imputations. Miss Gostrey was such a woman of fashion as could make without a symptom of vulgar blinking an appointment for the Burlington Arcade. Mere discriminations about a pair of gloves could thus at any rate represent--always for such sensitive ears as were in question--possibilities of something that Strether could make a mark against only as the peril of apparent wantonness. He had quite the consciousness of his new friend, for their companion, that he might have had of a Jesuit in petticoats, a representative of the recruiting interests of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church, for Waymarsh-that was to say the enemy, the monster of bulging eyes and far-reaching quivering groping tentacles--was exactly society, exactly the multiplication of shibboleths, exactly the discrimination of types and tones, exactly the wicked old Rows of Chester, rank with feudalism; exactly in short Europe.|$|E

Naval historian Dwight Messimer believes that the crew had in fact abandoned ship and that this <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> when Herbert arrived. According to Messimer, U-27 stopped firing on Nicosian when Baralong signalled {{that she was going}} to rescue the crew. Instead, Baralong took advantage of being screened from the submarine by the merchant ship in order to raise the Royal Navy's White Ensign in replacement for the false flag, and then to launch a devastating attack on U-27 as she came into view once more. The German vessel sank within a minute and the only survivors were the 12 men who were manning deck guns and in the conning tower.|$|E

Well, what happened was, we had a meeting with the record company (MCA Records) when we were preparing for that, and then, you know the whole Pearl Jam alternative shit was happening, and the record company said 'Hey look, we know that you guys are talented enough that you can fit in this space as well. So {{we want to have a}} bit of an alternative flare.' So, was it completely different? No, but it definitely had a little alternative feel to it. Yeah, it definitely did.

I and many of my GP colleagues had been closely following the news of the bushfires in New South Wales. We’d had our first warning of high fire danger in late September. As I returned to work in Campbelltown, in southwest Sydney, a grey haze of smoke hung in the air. Each breath I took left a metallic reminder of the bushfires at the back of my throat. My patients were coughing more than usual. Those with asthma were getting through more inhalers. On behalf of patients, I’d been writing letters to the Department of Housing asking for modifications to keep people healthy, and even safe, in the weather extremes they were experiencing. It was what had been predicted. It <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening.</b> So I was surprised to hear my patient say it… Read the full article Photo: Ash Cooper/ Flick...|$|E
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the psychosocial {{experiences}} of elite NFL players. Many athletes dreamed and prepared to make it to the NFL as a starter, and to participate in the Pro Bowl or Super Bowl. Only a very few succeed. For these athletes, their process of preparation and performance delivery, has worked. This study was interested in exploring what were the key factors beyond talent and beyond physical/technical training that impacted their achieving success, and becoming a starter and making it to the Pro Bowl/ Super Bowl. What was it that these athletes thought or did, at the Point of Attack, when the ball was snapped? Three elite NFL professional football players participated in this qualitative study with a narrative research design. The narratives collected from the three players provided rich and intimate personal stories related to each of their lived experiences. Specifically, the intent of this study was to explore the personal experiences of these athletes, their thoughts, motivations, and intentions, at the Point of Attack, when the ball was snapped, to begin each play. The study also sought to identify evidence in the athletes' lived experiences that reflected the principles of Self Determination Theory (SDT), and the Flourish (PERMA) model. This study also explored the importance of team chemistry as an influence in these athletes' experience. But, the primary focus of the study <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> in their psychosocial experience at the Point of Attack. And, what was found was profound. These athletes reported their thinking at the moment, at the Point of Attack, was "It's all about me right now!" and "I play for the name on my back!" Foundations and backgrounds for these understandings were uncovered. Implications for coach's education and field application were presented. There was substantial evidence from the athletes' reports and multiple described experiences that would represent the key components of SDT: relatedness, competence, and autonomy. There were several instances that would represent the key components of Flourish through the PERMA model (Positive emotions, Engagement, positive Relationships, Meaning, and Achievement). Also, reported and described were multiple experiences that would represent the importance of team chemistry achieved through team cohesion and team environment. These athletes reported, "It's all about me right now!" and "I play for the name on my back!...|$|E
