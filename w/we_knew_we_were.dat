500|$|In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two {{tower blocks}} in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only {{involved}} in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege. The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an [...] "anti-hero". The decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation, and a council spokesman said that [...] "There {{is no evidence that}} Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, so <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not naming the block after a murderer.... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street." [...] In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.|$|E

Max Martin, who produced Spears' debut single [...] "...Baby One More Time", produced [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] for the album. The Outsyders, an Atlanta-based production team, produced the album's first single, while Fernando Garibay worked on two bonus songs for Spears. Danja reported that he worked on the tracks at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and Spears recorded them at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank; the Canadian trio Let's Go to War co-wrote and produced the track [...] "Mmm Papi". Lil Jon, Rodney Jerkins, Sean Garrett, and Taio Cruz announced they were working with Spears, though their songs weren't included on the official track listing.|$|E

If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. <b>We</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E

500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E

[...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E
500|$|Kekal has {{acknowledged}} in interviews that the band members, {{at the time}} interviewed, subscribed to Christianity, and {{has been described as}} one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology, and has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. Although Christianity has comprised a part of the band's lyrics, the band has said that from The Painful Experience (3rd album) onward its lyrics have not been associated with religion or ideology at all. Mark Allan Powell commented on this in Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, stating that [...] "on the band's first two albums the songs testified to their Christian faith in an upfront way", but that on their third album, the band pulled back from an overt approach that [...] "Jeff says tended to turn people against the band before they gave the music a chance." [...] According to Powell, [...] "they maintain that three-fourths of their albums are purchased by non-Christians." [...] In an interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: [...] "I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band. But then <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> also accepted within the Christian metal scene as well, that's cool to know, although I think it still less than 50% of our general fan base." ...|$|E

Children {{under the age of}} two are not allowed except for showings on specific days which are designated [...] "Alamo For All" [...] showings where parents are encouraged to bring young children and rules around talking are relaxed. Unaccompanied minors are not allowed in showings, except for members of the Alamo Drafthouse's Victory Vanguard rewards program, which allows 15-17 year olds to attend showings unattended after their application to the rewards program has been submitted and reviewed. The application involves demonstrating an understanding of the theater's policies around talking, texting, arriving to the theater late, and basic tipping etiquette. The cinema also prohibits talking and texting during the film. Anyone who violates this policy is subject to warning and potential removal from the premises. Alamo made national headlines in 2011 when the rantings of one angry customer who was ejected for texting were included in its [...] "Don't Talk or Text" [...] PSA shown before films.

5000|$|A {{standard}} traditional Chinese book on dream-interpretation is the Lofty Principles of Dream Interpretation (夢占逸旨) compiled in the 16th {{century by}} Chen Shiyuan (particularly the [...] "Inner Chapters" [...] of that opus). Chinese thinkers also raised profound ideas about dream interpretation, {{such as the}} question of how <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dreaming and how <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> awake. It is written in the Chuang-tzu: [...] "Once Chuang Chou dreamed that he was a butterfly. He fluttered about happily, quite pleased with the state that he was in, and knew nothing about Chuang Chou. Presently he awoke and found that he was very much Chuang Chou again. Now, did Chou dream that he was a butterfly or was the butterfly now dreaming that he was Chou?" [...] This raises the question of reality monitoring in dreams, a topic of intense interest in modern cognitive neuroscience.|$|R
2500|$|The Buccaneers took {{advantage}} of Minnesota Vikings mistakes to get an upset and their first win of the season. The Buccaneers scored on a 5-yard pass from Doug Williams to Morris Owens, after a live ball that had hit a Viking on a punt return was recovered by Billy Cesare on the Vikings’ 5-yard line. Vikings coach Bud Grant later claimed that returner Kevin Miller never touched the ball, and blamed the loss on the officials. Fran Tarkenton completed 23 of 31 passes for 180 yards, but threw two interceptions {{and was replaced by}} Tommy Kramer in the final two minutes. Kramer promptly threw an interception to Cecil Johnson. Tarkenton also hit Ahmad Rashād for a 4-yard touchdown to finish a 63-yard first-quarter drive. Later, Jeris White's interception of a Tarkenton pass would lead to a 2-yard Ricky Bell touchdown run. The Buccaneers’ defense, still steamed over Tarkenton's comments two years earlier that the Buccaneers would be his preferred AFC opponent in the Super Bowl, held the Vikings to 73 yards rushing and sacked Tarkenton four times. They also came through big by holding the Vikings to a field goal, following a bizarre play in which the Vikings recovered a live ball on a failed field goal attempt and returned it for 80 yards. Grant called the game a defensive contest, saying that there were no good offensive plays in the entire match. John McKay said that [...] "when we shut off their running game, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the game and could get 'em", and that the Buccaneers should have a 3–0 record. The game left the two teams tied with 1–2 records.|$|E
