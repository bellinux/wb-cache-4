And you best believe once you press play, this ride <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the destination of your choice." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up out of nowhere, and the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute. Puzzle over it. Dance to it. All of the above." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{methods of}} {{phishing}} use {{some form of}} technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear {{to belong to the}} spoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers. In the following example URL, http://www.yourbank.example.com/, it appears as though the URL <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the example section of the yourbank website; actually this URL points to the [...] "yourbank" [...] (i.e. phishing) section of the example website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the [...] tags) suggest a reliable destination, when the link actually goes to the phishers' site. Many desktop email clients and web browsers will show a link's target URL in the status bar while hovering the mouse over it. This behavior, however, may in some circumstances be overridden by the phisher. Equivalent mobile apps generally do not have this preview feature.|$|E
2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} Rabbi Simai deduced from the {{similarity}} of the phrases [...] "And I <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> me for a people" [...] and [...] "And I will bring you in to the land" [...] in [...] that the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt occurred under circumstances similar to their entry into the Land of Israel. Rabbi Simai thus deduced that just as only two out of 600,000 (Caleb and Joshua) entered the Promised Land, so only two out of every 600,000 Israelites in Egypt participated in the Exodus, and the rest died in Egypt. Rava taught that {{it will also be}} so when the Messiah comes that {{only a small portion of}} Jews will find redemption, for [...] says, [...] "And she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the days when she came up out of the land of Egypt," [...] implying that circumstances upon the coming of the Messiah will be similar to those upon the Israelites' entry into the Land of Israel.|$|E

2500|$|... "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)" [...] {{was another}} {{emotional}} plea, {{this time to}} the environment. Funk Brother musician Earl Van Dyke once mentioned that Berry Gordy didn't know of the word [...] "ecology" [...] {{and had to be}} told what it was. The song featured a memorable tenor saxophone riff from Detroit music legend Wild Bill Moore. [...] "Right On" [...] was a lengthy seven-minute jam influenced by funk rock and Latin soul rhythms that focused on Gaye's own divided soul in which Gaye later pleaded in falsetto, [...] "if you let me, I <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> live where love is King" [...] after complying that [...] "true love can conquer hate every time". [...] "Wholy Holy" [...] follows [...] "God Is Love" [...] as an emotional gospel plea advising people to [...] "come together" [...] to [...] "proclaim love [...] salvation". The final track, [...] "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)", focuses on urban poverty, backed by a minimalist, dark blues-oriented funk vibe, with its bass riffs composed and performed by Bob Babbitt, who also performed on [...] "Mercy Mercy Me" [...] (Jamerson played {{on the rest of the}} album). The entire album's stylistic use of a song cycle gave it a cohesive feel and was one of R's first concept albums, described as [...] "a groundbreaking experiment in collating a pseudo-classical suite of free-flowing songs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stanford center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd {{been reading}} about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among {{ourselves}} that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." [...] In his first address to the team, Shaughnessy told them, [...] "Boys, I am not to be addressed as 'Clark' or, especially, [...] 'Soup'. To you, I am 'Mr. Shaughnessy' or 'Coach.' Nothing else. I am a professor of football... Now, I have a formation for {{you that if you}} learn it well <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the Rose Bowl." [...] He asserted that one of his plays, a line plunge by a back without a blocker, would score ten to twelve touchdowns alone, which was more than the Indians had scored the entire previous season. The players were understandably skeptical, and they were not alone. Football innovator and single-wing proponent Glenn [...] "Pop" [...] Warner said before the season, [...] "If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew into the Pacific Ocean." [...] Shaughnessy later discovered that the players, who were mostly returners from the 1939 team, were talented, but not suited to the single wing. As a contemporary newspaper noted, [...] "The [...] team looked great in some games and sour in others. The machinery was there but it wasn't running as smoothly as had been hoped for." ...|$|E
