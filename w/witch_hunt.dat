5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century the pursuit of {{witchcraft}} was largely {{taken over by the}} kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the <b>witch</b> <b>hunt</b> in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense <b>witch</b> <b>hunt</b> was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. B. P. Levack suggests that there may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability the economic and social tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.|$|E
5|$|An {{internal}} {{attempt was}} made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing <b>witch</b> <b>hunt</b> which he found to be to his advantage and he tolerated it until the societal damage wrecked by the Moczar movement had become irreversible. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by Leonid Brezhnev, was preoccupied with the crisis in Czechoslovakia and not inclined to support personal changes in the Polish leadership.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Wałęsa quit Solidarity {{in protest}} of the union's support of the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party, and Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński—twin {{brothers}} who had been prominent in Solidarity and were now serving as the country’s president and prime minister, respectively. The main point of disagreement was the Kaczyńskis’ focus on rooting out {{those who had been}} involved in communist rule and their party's attempt to make public all the files of the former communist secret police. Until then only members of the government and parliament had to declare any connection with the former security services. Wałęsa and his supporters argued the so-called transparency legislation advocated by the government might turn into a <b>witch</b> <b>hunt</b> and the more than 500,000 Poles who had possibly collaborated with the communist secret police could face exposure.|$|E
40|$|Chloe Chaplin Dr. Kathy Callahan, Faculty Mentor Dept. of History Witchcraft in Scotland This {{research}} project centered around witchcraft in Scotland and England in Early Modern Europe (roughly late 15 th century to mid 18 th century). The <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> characterized Europe during this time; our research initially looked at how England and Scotland {{compared to the}} European continent {{in the frequency of}} <b>witch</b> <b>hunts,</b> victimhood, and the specific details of the hunt. Scotland and England differed in that Scotland resembled the <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> of the continent whereas England was less prone to <b>witch</b> <b>hunts.</b> England suffered less <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> because they had significantly less religious turmoil than countries on the continent. Since our {{research project}} focused on England and Scotland, we looked into forming a conclusion as to why England differed from Scotland on the frequency of <b>witch</b> <b>hunts.</b> The primary targeting of women characterized the <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> in both Scotland and England, and, while this became more apparent when massive <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> would break loose in communities, there was a clear gender connection even in isolated cases. The stereotypes surrounding witchcraft were commonly associated with women, especially older, isolated members of a community, leaving these women vulnerable to accusations. Often an accusation began between neighbors and once the accused was questioned the risk arose that they could name accomplices when confessing. Confessions were often coerced under torture that left the accused with no choice but to name others. If left to spiral out of control, these small cases turned into large <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> in the hands of church and local officials. Our research project looked closely at the documented witch trials throughout Scotland to look for consistencies and aimed to link individual cases that spiraled into large <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> to draw a conclusion about what types of accusations, victims, demographics, or officials were involved...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{focus on}} the reasons that caused the <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> in Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692. The characters’ motives and {{situation}} in The Crucible by Arthur Miller are examined and comparisons between them and reality are the main issue. Hence, both ecclesiastic and secular factors are taken into account. The Salem <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> was chosen, since this event displays many of the factors involved in making such a hunt possible. To understand how this situation could arise to begin with, the background and situation of this colony is scrutinized. The views on witchcraft, in myth and reality are described, {{as well as what}} categories of people most likely to be accused of witchcraft was. No single reason can be held accountable for the <b>witch</b> <b>hunts,</b> and thus, the aim of this essay has been to explain the most plausible ones. Unlike what is popularly believed, the reasons behind the <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> had nothing or {{very little to do with}} magic, black arts and so on. Although this is a single example of many <b>witch</b> <b>hunts,</b> the reasons given here are applicable in other <b>witch</b> <b>hunts</b> during the era commonly known as The Burning Times.

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Scotland {{probably}} had about {{one quarter of the}} population of England, it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions, at an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 over the entire period. This was about four times the European average. The overwhelming majority were in the Lowlands, where the Kirk had more control, despite the evidence that basic magical beliefs were very widespread in the Highlands. Persecution of witchcraft in Orkney differed from the mainland with most trials taking place before 1650. Large series of trials included those in 1590–91 and the Great Scottish <b>Witch</b> <b>Hunt</b> of 1597, which took place across Scotland from March to October. At least 400 people were put on trial for various forms of diabolism. The exact number of those executed {{as a result of these}} trials is unknown, but is believed to be about 200. Later major trials included hunts in 1628–31 and 1649–50. Probably the most intense witch-hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties.|$|E
5|$|Hansel {{wakes up}} with Mina, who reveals {{herself to be}} a white witch. She heals his wounds again and uses a grimoire to bless Hansel's arsenal of weapons. Hansel, Mina, and Ben head out to disrupt the Blood Moon Sabbath. Mina begins {{slaughtering}} dark witches with a Gatling gun, while Hansel squares off against Muriel's witches and frees the children. Edward defies Muriel's orders and releases Gretel before Muriel throws him off the cliff. Muriel flees on a broomstick, but Ben manages to shoot her and forces her to crash. Hansel goes after Muriel while Gretel stops to revive Edward. Hansel, Ben, and Mina follow Muriel's trail to the original gingerbread house. Muriel wounds Ben and kills Mina before Hansel shoots her several times, knocking her into the house. Gretel arrives and the pair engage Muriel in a brutal fight that ends with Gretel decapitating her with a shovel. They burn Muriel's body on a pyre and collect their reward for rescuing the children. They head out on their next <b>witch</b> <b>hunt</b> accompanied by Ben and Edward.|$|E
