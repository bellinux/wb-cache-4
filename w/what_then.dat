5|$|<b>What</b> <b>then</b> is {{the spirit}} of liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell you}} my own faith.

50|$|I-84 was {{originally}} planned to run concurrently with US 6, but in June 1958, {{due to a}} realignment of I-80, I-84 was redesignated as an interstate.

His sister Nora Thompson Dean (1907–1984) provided valuable information about the language to linguists and other scholars.|$|E

Don Baylor became the first designated hitter to win the American League Most Valuable Player award. Other contributors to the team, which featured a powerful offense, were Bert Campaneris, Rod Carew, Dan Ford and Bobby Grich. However, the Angels lost <b>what</b> <b>then</b> was a best 3-out-of-5 American League Championship Series to the Baltimore Orioles, managed by Earl Weaver, 3 games to 1.

25|$|Transportation {{was used}} {{early on to}} support {{industry}} and commerce in New York State. The Boston Post Road, between <b>what</b> <b>then</b> the relatively small City of New York and Boston, began as a path to deliver the post using post riders (the first ride {{to lay out the}} Upper Post Road starting January 22, 1673), and developed into a wagon, or stage road in later colonial times. During the 19th century, pieces of the road were taken over and improved by turnpike companies. In the 1910s and 1920s, the Lower Post Road alignment (and realignments made to the route) was a National Auto Trail known as the Boston Post Road. Large sections of the various routes are still given the name Boston Post Road, much of it is now U.S. Route 1.|$|E
25|$|Another Sinai icon, of the Crusader {{period and}} painted by a French artist {{working in the}} Holy Land {{in the second half}} of the 12th century, shows <b>what</b> <b>then</b> became the most common depiction. Demetrius, bearded, rather older, and on a dark horse, rides {{together}} with St George, unbearded and on a white horse. Both are dressed as cavalrymen. Also, while St. George is often shown spearing a dragon, St. Demetrios is depicted spearing the gladiator Lyaeos, who according to story was responsible for killing many Christians. Lyaeos is commonly depicted below Demetrios and lying supine, having already been defeated; Lyaeos is traditionally drawn much smaller than Demetrios. In traditional hagiography, Demetrios did not directly kill Lyaeos, but rather through his prayers the gladiator was defeated by Demetrius' disciple, Nestor.|$|E

500|$|The Legend of Korra was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} twelve-episode miniseries. Nickelodeon declined the creators' pitch for an Avatar: The Last Airbender follow-up animated movie based on <b>what</b> <b>then</b> became the three-part comics , [...] and , choosing instead to expand Korra to 26 episodes. The series was expanded further in July 2012 to 52 episodes. These episodes are grouped into four separate seasons ("Books") composed of twelve to fourteen episodes ("Chapters") each, with each season telling a stand-alone story. Beginning with episode 9 of season 3, new episodes were first distributed through the Internet rather than broadcast. The Legend of Korra concluded with the fourth season.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the {{methodology}} used by modern Egyptologists to translate ancient records is unreliable and unstable, and therefore produces flawed and nonsensical translations. Thus, the modern translations of the Joseph Smith Papyri as produced by Egyptologists {{are not to be}} trusted. This line of thinking was used by Nibley in his 1975 book, The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri. He wrote: [...] "To the often asked question, 'Have the Joseph Smith Papyri been translated?' The answer is an emphatic no! <b>What,</b> <b>then,</b> is the foregoing? A mechanical transcription, no more [...] What we have is a transmission rather than a translation of the text [...] Though as correct and literal as we can make it, the translation in the preceding chapter is not a translation. It is nonsense." ...|$|E

500|$|Sages like Asvala, {{the priest}} in Janaka's court, Artabhaga, Bhujyu, Ushasta, and Uddalaka debated {{with him and}} asked {{questions}} philosophical subjects to which Yajnavalkya provided convincing replies and they lost the debate. It was then the turn of Gargi {{to take up the}} challenge. Gargi, as one of the disputants in the debate, questioned Yajnavalkya on his claim of superiority among the scholars. She held repeated arguments with him. Gargi and Yajnavalkya's exchange centered on the ultimate [...] "warp" [...] of reality ("warp" [...] means [...] "the basic foundation or material of a structure or entity). Her initial dialogue with Yajnavalkya tended to be too metaphysical, such as unending status of the soul, away from practical situations. She then changed her approach and asked him pointed questions related to the environment existing in the world, the question of the very origin of all existence. Her question was specific when she asked him [...] "since this whole world is woven back and forth on water, on <b>what</b> <b>then</b> is woven back and forth", a question that related to the commonly known cosmological metaphor that expressed the unity of the world, its essential interconnectedness.

500|$|Iravan first {{appears as}} a minor {{character}} in the Mahabharata {{as the son of}} Arjuna, the chief hero of the epic. The background to the Mahabharata infers a date that is [...] "after the very early Vedic period" [...] and before [...] "the first Indian 'empire' was to rise in the third century B.C.", so [...] "somewhere in the eighth or ninth century". It is generally agreed, however, that [...] "Unlike the Vedas, which have to be preserved letter-perfect, the epic was a popular work whose reciters would inevitably conform to changes in language and style." [...] The earliest surviving components of this dynamic text are believed to be no older than the earliest external references to the epic, which may include an allusion in Panini's 4th-century grammar manual Ashtadhyayi (4:2:56). It is estimated that the Sanskrit text probably reached something of a [...] "final form" [...] by the early Gupta period (about the 4th century CE). The editor of the first great critical edition of the Mahabharata commented: [...] "It is useless to think of reconstructing a fluid text in a literally original shape, on the basis of an archetype and a stemma codicum. <b>What</b> <b>then</b> is possible? Our objective can only be to reconstruct the oldest form of the text which it is possible to reach {{on the basis of the}} manuscript material available." ...|$|E
500|$|After his coronation, John moved {{south into}} France with {{military}} forces and adopted a defensive posture {{along the eastern}} and southern Normandy borders. Both sides paused for desultory negotiations before the war recommenced; John's position was now stronger, thanks to confirmation that the counts Baldwin IX of Flanders and Renaud of Boulogne had renewed the anti-French alliances they had previously agreed to with Richard. The powerful Anjou nobleman William des Roches was persuaded to switch sides from Arthur to John; suddenly the balance seemed to be tipping away from Philip and Arthur in favour of John. Neither side was keen to continue the conflict, and following a papal truce the two leaders met in January 1200 to negotiate possible terms for peace. From John's perspective, <b>what</b> <b>then</b> followed represented an opportunity to stabilise control over his continental possessions and produce a lasting peace with Philip in Paris. John and Philip negotiated the May 1200 Treaty of Le Goulet; by this treaty, Philip recognised John as the rightful heir to Richard in respect to his French possessions, temporarily abandoning the wider claims of his client, Arthur. John, in turn, abandoned Richard's former policy of containing Philip through alliances with Flanders and Boulogne, and accepted Philip's right as the legitimate feudal overlord of John's lands in France. John's policy earned him the disrespectful title of [...] "John Softsword" [...] from some English chroniclers, who contrasted his behaviour with his more aggressive brother, Richard.|$|E
