5|$|When {{parliament}} {{passed the}} building of the Bergen Line in 1894, the Roa–Hønefoss branch line was made part of the plans; but the line was given a separate name indicating that the Bergen Line would continue from Hønefoss to Oslo in a more direct route. But after the finish of the Bergen Line, other important mainline routes, in particular the Dovre Line, Sørland Line and Nordland Line, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to convert narrow gauge line, took precedence. Ideas for the additional construction of the Ringerike Line were pressed by commercial interests in Ringerike in both 1890 and 1906, but failed both times.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} was to proceed in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to capture Lae. As the Japanese garrison there was pressed by the 7th Division advancing from the Markham Valley and the 9th Division advancing {{along the coast}} from beaches east of the town, the Japanese hurriedly sought to reinforce Lae, moving about 6,000 troops from Salamaua to the south. Sensing an opportunity, in early September the 3rd Division began a drive north on Salamaua from Wau. On 31 August, the battalion joined the fighting, advancing around the right flank of the US 162nd Infantry Regiment and attacking the junction between the Lokanu and Scout Ridges. Over the course of 10 days of heavy fighting and hard going up the steep slopes, it gained the position, securing it by 9 September. The battalion had lost 10 men killed and 47 wounded in the process, but had killed 107 Japanese. The following day, the 15th advanced towards Nuk Nuk as Japanese resistance crumbled. Hard-pressed, the Japanese garrison had begun to withdraw from Salamaua, completing the process just before the Allies entered the town on 11 September. The battalion's total casualties in the fighting around Salamaua between April and September numbered 11 killed and 50 wounded.|$|E

5|$|While Noriega {{was out of}} the country, Díaz Herrera {{considered}} {{using the}} uproar around Spadafora to seize power, but despite mobilizing some troops, eventually decided against following through with the coup, realizing he could not count on sufficient support. Furthermore, Noriega had made a deal with his deputy, to the effect that he would step down as military leader in 1987 and allow Díaz Herrera to succeed him. In 1987, however, Noriega went back on this agreement, announced he would be heading the military for the next five years, and assigned Herrera to a diplomatic post. Díaz Herrera retaliated by making public statements accusing Noriega of rigging the 1984 election, murdering Spadafora, and of trafficking in drugs, as well as of assassinating Torrijo with a bomb on his plane. These statements provoked huge protests against Noriega, with 100,000 people, approximately 25% of the population of Panama City, marching in protest on June 26, 1987. Noriega charged Herrera with treason, and cracked down hard on the protesters. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution asking Noriega to step down until Herrera could be tried; in response Noriega sent government workers to protest outside the U.S. embassy, a protest which quickly turned into a riot. As a result, the U.S. suspended all military assistance to Panama, and the CIA stopped paying Noriega a salary. The Senate resolution had the effect of identifying the U.S. <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> to remove Noriega; Noriega exploited the rising anti-American sentiment to strengthen his own position. Without the support of the U.S., Panama defaulted on its international debt, and that year the country's economy shrunk by 20%. However, though the U.S. considered not recognizing the new president, the state department decided not to do so, as that would amount to breaking relations with Noriega.|$|E

25|$|Burges came to {{the front}} rank of leaders on the ecclesiastical {{question}} in 1641, in connection <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> made by the House of Lords for an accommodation of ecclesiastical differences. On 12 March the lords' 'committee for innovations' called in {{the assistance of a}} body of divines {{to take part in a}} sub-committee for examining alleged innovations in doctrine and discipline unlawfully introduced since the Reformation. Of seventeen divines who answered the summons six, headed by William Twisse, and including Burges, Marshall, and Calamy, constituted the section most opposed to the existing ecclesiastical system or its abuses. The four bishops and their friends on the sub-committee agreed to the proposed reformations; while, on the other hand, Twisse and his friends made no proposals antagonistic to episcopacy. The court party was stubborn against all concession; a growing party on the other side was for a more drastic treatment of episcopacy. The lords' attempt to find a modus vivendi was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Despite limited British activity, a few {{operations}} combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> {{of local}} forces led to [...] "a drastic weakening" [...] of Hassan's forces by 1918. Thus, after the armistice ending the First World War, the government sent Major General Arthur Hoskins {{to take control}} of the forces in Somaliland and defeat Hassan conclusively in battle. After Hoskins arrived, his initial plan for dealing with Hassan focussed on the use of the newly formed Royal Air Force, so Ismay and the Camel Corps were consigned to a minor role. Hoskins's plans, however, were found [...] "overscaled and far too costly", so they were shelved throughout most of 1918 and 1919.|$|E
500|$|After {{a six-month}} break, which Dickinson mostly spent practising fencing, Iron Maiden began writing their next album, Somewhere in Time. Dickinson was {{disappointed}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> {{as he felt}} that the band needed a more dramatic stylistic departure from past records to remain relevant, despite its introduction of synthesised bass and guitars. He has no writing credits on the release, as his material, based on his own suggestion that the album should be more acoustic-focused, was rejected {{by the rest of the}} band. Steve Harris, on the other hand, stated that his material was rejected because it was not good enough, and that Dickinson [...] "was probably more burnt out than anyone at the end of the last tour".|$|E

500|$|Japanese gaming {{magazine}} Famitsu {{praised the}} title's gameplay, calling Aya [...] "deeply customizable", finding the Overdive {{system and its}} strategic elements exhilarating and saying that those undaunted by the high difficulty would find much enjoyment in repeated playthroughs. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com called it [...] "an interesting blend of RPG and shooter", praising the working of Overdive. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was less enthusiastic, referring to the conflicts with the Twisted as [...] "relentless and ultimately repetitive", finding the high difficulty off-putting and Aya's movement speed unsuited for battle. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez enjoyed the control layout and gameplay, but cited difficulties with the camera. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot said that the game sometimes succeeded in creating tension, but that other battles were frustrating and the camera was difficult. IGN's Patrick Kolan was pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> put into the game, and generally praised the battle and later levels, despite several cases of repetition during the main campaign. Emily Gera of VideoGamer.com found the basic shooter gameplay repetitive, but felt that the gameplay was saved by the Overdive ability {{and the quality of}} fights.|$|E

The album topped the charts in over 28 countries worldwide, an unprecedented achievement at the time, and became her best-selling studio album of her career with sales of 25 million. In the same year, Madonna starred in the critically panned film Shanghai Surprise, for which she received her first Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress. She made her theatrical debut in a production of David Rabe's Goose and Tom-Tom; the film and play both co-starred Penn. The next year, Madonna was featured in the film Who's That Girl.

500|$|Ferdinand's actions {{constituted}} a definitive de facto break {{both with the}} autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government {{was seen as an}} alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the [...] "ancien régime" [...] did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided {{to wait and see what}} would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ayuntamientos in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society. Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.|$|E

Michael Schumacher, who retired on the first lap, after Fisichella collided with him, accused the latter of causing the incident. [...] "I am out of the race not because of David (Coulthard) but because of Fisichella." [...] he said. Fisichella however said that he was maintaining his racing line and believed that drivers should choose their preferred racing line before he described his Grand Prix as a [...] "waste".

500|$|Anson {{was sent}} back to Britain shortly afterwards, and Lydiard rejoined his ship at Plymouth. After a period {{refitting}} Anson was assigned to the Channel Fleet and ordered to support the blockade of Brest by patrolling off Black Rocks. She sailed from Falmouth on 24 December, and reached Ile de Bas on 28 December. With a gale blowing up from the south west, Lydiard decided to return to port. He made for the Lizard, but in the poor weather, came up on the wrong side and became trapped on a lee shore, with breakers ahead. Anson rolled heavily in [...] rough seas, having retained the spars from her days as a 64-gun ship after she had been razeed. Lydiard's only option was to anchor, but early on the morning of 29 December the rising storm caused the anchor cables to part and she was driven onto the shore. Lydiard ordered the ship to be run onto a beach in the hope of saving as many lives as possible, and resolved to remain aboard to oversee the evacuation. The pounding surf prevented boats from being launched from the ship or the shore, and a number of the crew were swept away. Some managed to clamber along the fallen main-mast to the shore, while Lydiard clung to the wheel to encourage them on. Eyewitnesses recorded that Lydiard had exhausted himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> of organising the evacuation and clinging to the wreck in the violence of the storm. He attempted to leave the ship, but became distracted by trying to help a boy. In doing so Lydiard was washed away and drowned. The Naval Chronicles account of the wreck recorded that ...|$|E
