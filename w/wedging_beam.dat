Due {{to the change}} in photon energy spectrum, the resulting dose values are, however, not very accurate {{in the case of}} <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> if the pixel-to-dose conversion for the situation without wedge is used. A possible solution would be to consider a <b>wedged</b> <b>beam</b> as another photon beam quality requiring separate beam modeling of the dose calculation algorithm. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate a more practical solution: to make aSi EPID-based dosimetry models also applicable for <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> without an extra commissioning effort of the parameters of the model. For this purpose two energy-dependent wedge multiplication factors have been introduced to be applied for portal images taken with and without a patient/phantom in the <b>beam.</b> These <b>wedge</b> multiplication factors were derived from EPID and ionization chamber measurements at the EPID level for <b>wedged</b> and nonwedged <b>beams,</b> both with and without a polystyrene slab phantom in the beam. This method was verified for an EPID dosimetry model used for <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> at three photon beam energies (6, 10, and 18 MV) by comparing dose values reconstructed in a phantom with data provided by a treatment planning system (TPS), as a function of field size, depth, and off-axis distance. Generally good agreement, within 2 %, was observed for depths between dose maximum and 15 cm. Applying the new model to EPID dose measurements performed during ten breast cancer patient treatments with wedged 6 MV photon beams showed that the average isocenter underdosage of 5. 3 % was reduced to 0. 4 %. Gamma-evaluation (global 3 %/ 3 mm) of these in vivo data showed an increase in percentage of points with gamma </= 1 from 60. 2 % to 87. 4 %, while gammamean reduced from 1. 01 to 0. 55.

This paper investigates two different models of diodes for externally <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> and explains a new algorithm for {{the calculation of}} the target dose at various tissue depths in external radiotherapy. The values of off-axis wedge correction factors were determined at two different positions in the wedged (toward the thick and thin edges) and in the non-wedged directions on entrance and exit surfaces of a polystyrene phantom in 60 Co and 6 MV photon beams. Depth transmission was defined on the entrance and exit surfaces to obtain the off-axis wedge correction factor at any depth. As {{the sensitivity of the}} diodes depends on physical characteristics [field size, source-skin distance (SSD), thickness, backscatter], correction factors were applied to the diode reading when measuring conditions different from calibration situations. The results indicate that needful correction factors for 60 Co wedged photons are usually larger than those for 6 MV <b>wedged</b> photon <b>beams.</b> In vivo dosimetry performed with the proposed algorithms at externally <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> has negligible probable errors (less than 0. 5 %) and is a reliable method for patient dose control...|$|R

The convolution algorithm implemented by the treatment planning system, will over estimate the enhanced-dynamic-wedge (EDW) factors for points further away from the central axis of the <b>wedged</b> <b>beam.</b> This overestimation will result in an inaccurate dose administered to the patient. Quantification of the OA-EDWF’s were then measured by a 2 D-didoe array at 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, and 20 cm using water phantoms. Wedge angles of 15 °, 25 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 ° were examined at each depth using the 21 iX with incident photon energies of 6 MV and 18 MV. The clinically useful range then of the EDW is 26 cm, where the percent difference is in a tolerable range of within a few percent. It can be concluded that any dose calculation calculated by the TPS, involving an EDWF {{on the periphery of}} a <b>wedged</b> <b>beam,</b> must be subjected to scrutiny.

40|$|Introduction Evaluation of the {{delivered}} dose of externally <b>wedged</b> photon <b>beams</b> {{by external}} diode dosimeters during the treatment process requires {{the estimation of}} exit surface dose correction factors in various wedge angles and field sizes. Materials and Methods A system of absorbed dose evaluation, using p-type diode dosimeters placed on the exit surface of a phantom, was characterized for externally wedged photons with the maximum square field size. The values of wedge correction factor on the exit surface of the polystyrene phantom were determined for 60 Co and 6 MV photons. Then, the wedge correction factors were estimated at desirable depths. Results Based on the findings, the deviation of off-axis wedge correction factors of the exit surface wedged fields from the central axis factor may be as large as ± 10 % at the evaluated depths. The {{results showed that the}} absorbed dose at each depth of patient tissue could be estimated by applying an accurate exit wedge correction factor for that particular depth, with negligible probable errors (below 1. 5 %). Conclusion In case positioning a diode dosimeter on the patient’s entrance surface of a phantom of patients is troublesome, the diode dosimeter can be placed on the exit surface in order to evaluate the absorbed dose for externally wedged photons. Based on the findings, exit dose correction factors for <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> cannot be discarded; in fact, these factors are variable at different directions of externally <b>wedged</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to study dose {{non-linearity}} in medical linear accelerators used in conventional radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Open fields, {{as well as the}} enhanced dynamic wedge ones, were used to collect data for 6 MV and 15 MV photon beams obtained from the VARIAN linear accelerator. Beam stability was checked and confirmed for different dose rates, energies, and application of enhanced dynamic wedge by calculating the charge per monitor unit. Monitor unit error was calculated by the two-exposure method for open and enhanced dynamic <b>wedge</b> <b>beams</b> of 6 MV and 15 MV photons. A significant monitor unit error with maximum values of ± 2. 05931 monitor unit and ± 2. 44787 monitor unit for open and enhanced dynamic <b>wedge</b> <b>beams,</b> respectively, both energy and dose rate dependent, was observed both in the open photon beam and enhanced dynamic wedge fields. However, it exhibited certain irregular patterns at enhanced dynamic wedge angles. Dose monitor unit error exists only because of the overshoot phenomena and electronic delay in dose coincident and integrated circuits with a dependency on the dose rate and photon energy. Monitor unit errors are independent of the application of enhanced dynamic wedge. The existence of monitor unit error demands that the dose non-linearity of the linear accelerator dosimetry system be periodically tested, so as to avoid significant dosimetric errors...|$|R

In particular, a generalized procedure for the in vivo reconstruction of the isocenter dose, D iso, has been developed for 3 D conformal radiotherapy treatments with open and <b>wedged</b> X-ray <b>beams</b> supplied by linacs of different manufacturers and equipped with aSi Electronic Portal Imaging Devices (EPIDs). In this way, the commissioning procedure is very simplified and applicable to Elekta, Siemens and Varian linacs. The method here reported is based on measurements in solid-water phantoms of different thicknesses, w, irradiated by square field sizes, L. Generalized mid-plane doses, D 0, and transit signal by EPIDs, st 0, obtained by 19 open and 38 <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> of 8 different linacs, were determined taking into account X-ray beam and EPID calibrations. Generalized ratios F 0 = st 0 /D 0 for open and <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> were fitted by surface equations and used by a dedicated software, for the D iso reconstruction. Moreover, for each beam the software supplied a set of transit signal profiles crossing the beam central axis to test the beam irradiation reproducibility. The tolerance level of the comparison between the D iso and the dose computed by the TPS, D iso,TPS, was estimated 5 %. The generalized in vivo dosimetry procedure was adopted by 3 centers that used different linacs. The results of 480 tests showed that in absence of errors, the comparison between D iso and D iso,TPS resulted well-within the tolerance level. The presence of errors was detected in 10 % of the tests and were due to essentially an incorrect set-up, presence of an attenuator on the beams and patient morphological changes. Moreover, the dedicated software used the information of the Record and Verify system of the centres and consequently the extra-time needed to obtain, for each beam, the D iso reconstruction after the dose delivery, was about 20 s...|$|R

The external audits covered by the network are based on measurements made with mailed thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD). Material and methods: The TLD consist of LiF powder type DTL 937 read with a PCL 3 automatic TLD reader. The participating centres are instructed to deliver to the TLDs absorbed doses of 2 Gy calculated with the Treatment Planning System used in clinical routine. A maximum of three photon energies by participating centre have been checked with 10 on-axis points per beam. The quantities checked include the reference beam output, beam output variation with collimator opening, depth dose data and wedge transmission factor. Results: During the 1998 EQUAL programme 102 centres have been checked corresponding to 235 beams (28 60 Co beams and 207 X-ray beams).

40|$|A {{new method}} of {{generating}} wedge-shaped dose distributions through dynamic multileaf collimator dose delivery rather than computer-controlled jaw motion is presented. The method {{starts with the}} calculation of a wedge-shaped beam profile for the desired wedge angle. The resultant <b>wedge</b> <b>beam</b> profile is then passed to the intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) leaf sequence generation algorithm to create multileaf collimator (MLC) segments for dose delivery. Wedge-shaped dose distributions are achieved through dynamic MLC dose delivery guided with the generated MLC segments. The method has been tested by generating wedgeshaped doses {{for a set of}} conventional wedge angles (i. e., 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, and 60 °). Film dosimetry is used for dose distribution verification. For each dose delivery guided with MLC segments created for the indicated wedge angle, the desired wedge-shaped dose distributions are observed. It is concluded that the dynamic MLC can be used to implement dynamic wedges in the clinic. This technique is different from the virtual wedge or the dynamic wedge developed for a particular type of LINAC. The same method can be applied to any machine equipped with a MLC. Other advantages are that it can generate a wedge field at an arbitrary orientation as the omni wedge does, and it creates wedged and shaped fields using a MLC only. PACS number(s) : 87. 53.

The Elekta Precise linear accelerator supports an internal motorized wedge, which is a single large, physical wedge on a motorized carriage.

40|$|Dose {{calculations}} {{for treatment}} planning of photon beam radiotherapy require {{a model of}} the beam to drive the dose calculation models. The beam shaping process involves scattering and filtering that yield radiation components which vary with collimator settings. The necessity to model these components has motivated the development of multisource beam models. We describe and evaluate clinical photon beam modeling based on multisource models, including lateral beam quality variations. The evaluation is based on user data for a pencil kernel algorithm and a point kernel algorithm (collapsed cone) used in the clinical treatment planning systems Helax-TMS and Nucletron-Oncentra. The pencil kernel implementations treat the beam spectrum as lateral invariant while the collapsed cone involves off axis softening of the spectrum. Both algorithms include modeling of head scatter components. The parameters of the beam model are derived from measured beam data in a semiautomatic process called RDH (radiation data handling) that, in sequential steps, minimizes the deviations in calculated dose versus the measured data. The RDH procedure is reviewed and the results of processing data from a large number of treatment units are analyzed for the two dose calculation algorithms. The results for both algorithms are similar, with slightly better results for the collapsed cone implementations. For open beams, 87 % of the machines have maximum errors less than 2. 5 %. For <b>wedged</b> <b>beams</b> the errors were found to increase with increasing wedge angle. Internal, motorized wedges did yield slightly larger errors than external wedges.

For three-dimensional (3 -D) optimization of the dose distribution using serial CT scan images, suitable volumes have to be delineated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a computer-generated delineation of a plan optimization volume (POV) and an irradiated volume (IV) and to automate their use in a fast dose homogeneity optimization engine. Patients and Methods: Simulation was performed according to our standard procedure which involves the positioning of a lead collar around the palpable breast to facilitate the definition of gantry angle, collimator angle and field aperture for tangential <b>wedged</b> photon <b>beams.</b> In a change to the standard procedure an anterolateral radiograph was taken with its axis orthogonal to the central plane of the two tangential half-beams. Images from a serial CT scan were acquired in treatment position, and the geometric data of the three simulated beams were used by a computer program to generate the POV and IV. For each patient, weights of <b>wedged</b> and unwedged <b>beams</b> were optimized by either human heuristics using only the central slice (2 -D), the whole set of CT slices (3 -D), or by a computer algorithm using the POV, IV and Lung volume with constrained matrix inversion (CMI) as optimization method.

Results: The total planning procedure took, on average, 44 min of which < 7 min were needed for human interactions, compared to about 52 min for the standard planning at Ghent University Hospital, Belgium.

To be able to include technical developments, such as the asymmetric collimator, {{it was decided to}} remeasure the AAPM data set on more modern radiotherapy equipment, to extend the test geometries, and to evaluate the use of the new package. Materials and methods: A coherent set of beam data of 6, 10 and 18 MV photon beams was measured on two modern linear accelerators. These data served as input data in seven commercially available treatment planning systems, which were clinically in use in different radiotherapy departments. Next, a test package was measured which included a missing tissue geometry and fields with asymmetrical collimator setting, with and without a wedge. Results: The absolute dose prediction from the different treatment planning systems in which the measured beam data were entered, was compared for all test points with the results of direct measurements. The criteria of acceptability were exceeded by some systems in cases of irregular field geometry and missing tissue geometry. The majority of the systems had difficulties with accurate dose calculation for asymmetrically wedged fields. Conclusions: The application of the new test package did not introduce insuperable difficulties and was highly appreciated by the participating centres.

40|$|In 3 -dimensional (3 D) {{conformal}} radiotherapy of {{parotid gland}} tumors, little effort {{is made to}} avoid the auditory system or the oral cavity. Damage may occur when the ear is located inside the treatment field. The {{purpose of this study}} was to design and evaluate an intensity-modulation radiotherapy (IMRT) class solution, and to compare this technique to a 3 D conformal approach with respect to hearing loss. Twenty patients with parotid gland cancer were retrospectively planned with 2 different techniques using the original planning target volume (PTV). First, a conventional technique using a <b>wedged</b> <b>beam</b> pair was applied, yielding a dose distribution conformal to the shape of the PTV. Next, an IMRT technique using a fluence map optimization with predefined constraints was designed. A dose of 66 Gy in the PTV was given at the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measures (ICRU) dose prescription point. Dose-volume histograms of the PTV and organs at risk (OARs), such as auditory system, oral cavity, and spinal cord, were compared. The dose in the OARs was lower in the IMRT plans. The mean volume of the middle ear receiving a dose higher than 50 Gy decreased from 66. 5 % to 33. 4 %. The mean dose in the oral cavity decreased from 19. 4 Gy to 16. 6 Gy. The auditory system can be spared if the distance between the inner ear and the PTV is 0. 6 cm or larger, and if the overlap between the middle ear and the PTV is smaller than 10 %. The maximum dose in the spinal cord was below 40 Gy in all treatment plans. The mean volume of the PTV receiving less than 95 % of the prescribed dose increased in the IMRT plan slightly from 3. 3 % to 4. 3 % (p = 0. 01). The mean volume receiving more than 107 % increased from 0. 9 % to 2. 5 % (p = 0. 02). It can be concluded that the auditory system, as well as the oral cavity, can be spared with IMRT, but at the cost of a slightly larger dose inhomogeneity in the PTV. The IMRT technique can therefore, in most cases, be recommended as the treatment of choice for the irradiation of parotid tumor...|$|R
40|$|As the {{technology}} {{associated with the}} development of solid-state drivers for inertial fusion energy (IFE) has evolved, increased emphasis has been placed on the development of an efficient approach for managing the waste heat generated in the laser media. This paper addresses the technical issues associated with the gas cooling of large aperture slabs, where the laser beam propagates through the cooling fluid. It is shown that the major consequence of proper thermal management is the introduction of simple <b>wedge,</b> or <b>beam</b> steering, into the system. Achieving proper thermal management requires careful consideration of the geometry, cooling fluid characteristics, cooling flow characteristics, as well as the thermal/mechanical/optical characteristics of the laser media. Particularly important are the effects of cooling rate variation and turbulent scattering on the system optical performance. Helium is shown to have an overwhelming advantage with respect to turbulent scattering losses. To mitigate cooling rate variations, the authors introduce the concept of flow conditioning. Finally, optical path length variations across the aperture are calculated. A comparison of two laser materials (S-FAP and YAG) shows the benefit of a nearly a-thermal material on optical variations in the system...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} field shape {{optimization}} is studied for prostate type geometry. For this study, 76 and 81 Gy plans were generated. Dose distributions for wedged plans and Intensity Modulated (IM) plans {{for three and}} seven fields were compared for a quadratic cost function. For wedged plans, a Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) was used to optimize gantry angles, <b>wedge</b> angles, <b>beam</b> weights and field shapes. Two kinds of wedged plans were generated: 1) field sizes were determined by the requirement of full target coverage in the beam's-eye-view (fixed fields) and 2) the field shape, in particular at the critical organ target overlap region was also among the variables optimized. For IM plans the SAA was used to optimize gantry angles and a conjugate gradient algorithm was used to optimize the IM beam fluences. Both the field shape optimized wedged plans and IM plans had significantly superior dose area histograms of the target, rectum and the bladder and cost function values compared to the fixed field optimized wedged plans.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{evaluates the}} dose {{distribution}} of reversed planned tangential beam intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) compared to standard <b>wedged</b> tangential <b>beam</b> three-dimensionally planned conformal radiotherapy (3 D-CRT) {{of the chest}} wall in unselected postmastectomy breast cancer patients Methods For 20 unselected subsequent postmastectomy breast cancer patients tangential beam IMRT and tangential beam 3 D-CRT plans were generated for the radiotherapy of the chest wall. The prescribed dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Dose-volume histograms were evaluated for the PTV and organs at risk. Parameters of the dose distribution were compared using the Wilcoxon matched pairs test. Results Tangential beam IMRT statistically significantly reduced the ipsilateral mean lung dose {{by an average of}} 21 % (1129 cGy versus 1437 cGy). In all patients treated on the left side, the heart volume encompassed by the 70 % isodose line (V 70 %; 35 Gy) was reduced by an average of 43 % (5. 7 % versus 10. 6 %), and the mean heart dose by an average of 20 % (704 cGy versus 877 cGy). The PTV showed a significantly better conformity index with IMRT; the homogeneity index was not significantly different. Conclusions Tangential beam IMRT significantly reduced the dose-volume of the ipsilateral lung and heart in unselected postmastectomy breast cancer patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|This project {{involved}} {{designing and}} building a radiochromic film (RCF) densitometer using a still digital camera as the light detector and light emitting diode, LED, as the light source. The behaviour of the LED and charged coupled device (CCD) in the still digital camera, under different light exposure settings (by changing LED current and camera shutter speed) were measured and an optimal setting was determined. Additionally, methods were devised and tests were carried out in order to spread the illumination area of the single light source. Uniform spreading of the LED illumination area was possible {{by the use of}} two diffusers placed at an optimum separation distance that was determined in this work. The usefulness of this custom-made RCF densitometer was demonstrated by using this device to image exposed RCF and using the film analysis software, Image J, to determine the film absorbed dose. Two clinical situations were examined: open and virtual <b>wedge</b> radiation <b>beams.</b> It was concluded that still digital cameras can be used in RCF densitometers provided they can capture and store raw images, a single diffused LED can illumination an area large enough for RCF densitometry and appropriate film analysis software is needed to extract and handle the large volume of greyscale data from the RCF...|$|R
40|$|This {{analysis}} {{evaluates the}} feasibility and dosimetric {{results of a}} simplified intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment using a cobalt-therapy unit for post-operative breast cancer. Fourteen patients were included. Three plans per patient were produced by a cobalt- 60 source: A standard plan with two <b>wedged</b> tangential <b>beams,</b> a standard tangential plan optimized {{without the use of}} wedges and a plan based on the forward-planned "field-in-field" IMRT technique (Co-FinF) where the dose on each of the two tangential beams was split into two different segments and the two segments weight was determined with an iterative process. For comparison purposes, a 6 -MV photon standard wedged tangential treatment plan was generated. D mean, D 98 %, D 2 %, V 95 %, V 107 %, homogeneity, and conformity indices were chosen as parameters for comparison. Co-FinF technique improved the planning target volume dose homogeneity compared to other cobalt-based techniques and reduced maximum doses (D 2 %) and high-dose volume (V 110 %). Moreover, it showed a better lung and heart dose sparing with respect to the standard approach. The higher dose homogeneity may encourage the adoption of accelerated-hypofractionated treatments also with the cobalt sources. This approach can promote the spread of breast conservative treatment in developing countries...|$|R
