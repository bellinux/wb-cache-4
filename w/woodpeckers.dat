5|$|The <b>woodpeckers</b> are {{an ancient}} bird family {{consisting}} of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets {{and the true}} <b>woodpeckers,</b> Picinae. The largest of the six tribes within the Picinae is the pied <b>woodpeckers,</b> a group which includes the great spotted woodpecker. Within the large genus Dendrocopus the great spotted woodpecker's closest relatives are the Himalayan, Sind, Syrian and white-winged <b>woodpeckers</b> and possibly the Darjeeling woodpecker. The great spotted woodpecker has been recorded as hybridising with the Syrian woodpecker.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as using}} holes for breeding, great spotted <b>woodpeckers</b> roost at night, and {{sometimes}} during the day, in old nest cavities, excavated by other <b>woodpeckers.</b> They will occasionally {{make a new}} roosting hole or use an artificial site such as a nest box.|$|E
5|$|<b>Woodpeckers</b> {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails and long tongues used for capturing insects. Many <b>woodpeckers</b> have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks. There are about 219 species worldwide, four recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E

5|$|Ecologically, <b>woodpeckers</b> {{help to keep}} trees healthy {{by keeping}} them from {{suffering}} mass infestations. The family is noted {{for its ability to}} acquire wood-boring grubs from the trunks and branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. <b>Woodpeckers</b> consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to breed in the {{chaparral}} region, including several species of wrens, blackbirds, and sparrows. The mixed coniferous forest is home to white-headed <b>woodpeckers,</b> pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The American coot has also been spotted in several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed <b>woodpeckers,</b> gray jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations. The near-threatened olive-sided flycatcher and Cassin's finch also live in this area. Eurasian three-toed <b>woodpeckers</b> and Clark's nutcrackers have been spotted near the tree line. The endangered Townsend's big-eared bat is known {{to live in the}} watershed.|$|E
5|$|Wading and {{woodland}} {{birds are}} year-round residents of Pettigrew State Park. The banks of Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River provide {{an abundance of}} cover and food for sandpipers, great blue herons, great egrets, and green herons. The woods are home to bobwhites, pileated <b>woodpeckers,</b> woodcocks, red-cockaded <b>woodpeckers,</b> and mourning doves. Songbirds found at the park include prairie and prothonotary warblers, common yellowthroats and northern parulas.|$|E

Many <b>woodpeckers</b> have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks. Nine species have been recorded in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|<b>Woodpeckers,</b> piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, <b>woodpeckers</b> have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed <b>woodpeckers,</b> which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all <b>woodpeckers,</b> except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E
50|$|The speckle-throated <b>woodpecker</b> (Campethera scriptoricauda), {{also known}} as Reichenow's <b>woodpecker,</b> is an East African <b>woodpecker</b> often {{considered}} a subspecies of Bennett's <b>woodpecker.</b> The bird is named after the German ornithologist Anton Reichenow.|$|R
50|$|The Abyssinian <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendropicos abyssinicus), {{also known}} as the golden-backed <b>woodpecker</b> or the golden-mantled <b>woodpecker,</b> is a species of bird in the <b>woodpecker</b> family, Picidae. It is native to Africa, where it occurs in Eritrea and Ethiopia. It appears to be a close {{relative}} of the cardinal <b>woodpecker</b> Dendropicos fuscescens.|$|R
50|$|The Iberian green <b>woodpecker</b> (Picus sharpei) is a {{medium-sized}} <b>woodpecker</b> endemic to the Iberian peninsula. It {{is also known}} as the Iberian <b>woodpecker.</b> It is sometimes considered a subspecies of the European green <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Woodpeckers,</b> sapsuckers, and {{flickers}} {{are small}} to medium-sized birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails and long tongues used for capturing insects. Some species have feet with two toes pointing forward and two backward, while several species have only three toes. Many <b>woodpeckers</b> have {{the habit of}} tapping noisily on tree trunks with their beaks.|$|E
5|$|Cavities are {{in great}} demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so <b>woodpeckers</b> face {{competition}} for the nesting sites they excavate {{from the moment the}} hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity nesting birds like swallows and starlings. <b>Woodpeckers</b> may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting site; for example the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted <b>woodpeckers</b> {{have only}} one brood a year. The {{survival}} rates for adults and young are unknown, as is the average lifespan, but the maximum known age for a great spotted woodpecker is just over 11 years.|$|E
50|$|The largest known <b>woodpecker</b> is the {{possibly}} extinct imperial <b>woodpecker</b> (Campephilus imperialis) {{with a total}} length of about 22 inches (50 centimeters). The largest <b>woodpecker</b> confirmed to be extant is the great slaty <b>woodpecker</b> (Mulleripicus pulverulentus).|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, several <b>woodpeckers</b> {{are under}} threat as their {{habitats}} are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at <b>woodpeckers,</b> but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|The park is an {{important}} refuge for other wildlife, including <b>woodpeckers,</b> squirrels, rabbits, snakes, frogs, toads, stag beetles and many other insects plus numerous ancient trees and varieties of fungi. It is particularly notable for its rare beetles.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of <b>woodpeckers</b> {{is still}} being refined and the positions of some genera continue to be unclear and there are conflicting findings from analyses as of 2016.|$|E

50|$|The black-backed <b>woodpecker</b> (Picoides arcticus) {{also known}} as the Arctic three-toed <b>woodpecker</b> is a {{medium-sized}} <b>woodpecker</b> (23 cm long) inhabiting the forests of North America.|$|R
50|$|The grey-headed <b>woodpecker</b> (Picus canus), {{also known}} as the grey-faced <b>woodpecker,</b> is a Eurasian member of the <b>woodpecker</b> family, Picidae. Along with the more {{commonly}} found European green <b>woodpecker</b> and the Iberian green <b>woodpecker,</b> it is one of three closely related sister species found in Europe. Its distribution stretches across large parts of the central and Eastern Palaearctic, {{all the way to the}} Pacific Ocean.|$|R
5|$|The plumage of <b>woodpeckers</b> {{varies from}} drab to conspicuous. The colours of many species {{are based on}} olive and brown and some are pied, {{suggesting}} a need for camouflage; others are boldly patterned in black, white and red, and many have a crest or tufted feathers on the crown. <b>Woodpeckers</b> tend to be sexually dimorphic, but differences between the sexes are generally small; exceptions to this are Williamson's sapsucker and the orange-backed woodpecker, which differ markedly. The plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from the wrynecks, which have an additional partial moult before breeding.|$|E
5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds, brown above and white below. They have thin pointed down-curved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like <b>woodpeckers,</b> which they use to support themselves on vertical trees.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} <b>{{woodpecker}}s</b> in the Americas, the ivory-billed woodpecker and the imperial woodpecker, {{have been considered}} extinct since the mid-to-late 20th century, though there have been possible but disputed sightings of ivory-billed <b>woodpeckers</b> in the United States since 2004, and a small population may survive in Cuba. Another critically endangered species is the Okinawa woodpecker from Japan, with a single declining population {{of a few hundred}} birds. It is threatened by deforestation, golf course, dam and helipad construction, road building and agricultural development.|$|E
