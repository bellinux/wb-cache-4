In the 9th and 10th centuries, Japanese gradually became a <b>written</b> <b>language</b> {{through the development of}} kana, a syllabary based on abbreviations of Chinese characters. In Murasaki's lifetime men continued to write in Chinese, the language of government, but kana became the <b>written</b> <b>language</b> of noblewomen, setting the foundation for unique forms of Japanese literature.|$|E

The sole literary language we know in the 11 th century is the one which Yusuf Has Hacip used in the Kutadgu Bilig. Kaşgarlı Mahmut, as well, indicates that Turkish societies had several dialects besides this common <b>writing</b> <b>language.</b> In the Kutadgu Bilig, a product of common <b>writing</b> <b>language,</b> we can see some factors together that are the distinguishing features of the Turkish dialects today such as menze- / okşa-; kizle- / yaşur- etc. In this article, we have studied these kinds of double usages which we have named as ‘equal pairs...|$|R

Despite the similarities to Chinese characters, the Khitan scripts were functionally different from Chinese.|$|E

The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E

By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks.

5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and <b>written</b> <b>language,</b> ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1590s, his championing of native Scottish {{tradition}} {{was reduced to}} some extent by the increasing likelihood of his succession to the English throne. William Alexander and other courtier poets started to anglicise their <b>written</b> <b>language,</b> and followed the king to London after 1603. James's role as active literary participant and patron made him a defining figure in many respects for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which reached a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage of the high style in the Scottish tradition, which included his ancestor James I of Scotland, became largely sidelined.|$|E
5|$|Celtiberian is {{documented}} as a <b>written</b> <b>language</b> only after {{contact with the}} Romans in the 2nd century BC. Of 103 Celtiberian inscriptions, thirty in Iberian script are hospitality tokens (tesserae hospitales), twenty {{of which are in}} the shape of animals. The social custom of pledging mutual support among families or communities was compatible with hospitium in Roman culture, and the Celtiberians continued to produce the tokens, though switching to Latin, into the 2nd century of the Imperial era. Under Augustus, the territory of the Celtiberians became part of the Tarraconensis province. Written Celtiberian ceases early in the reign of Augustus, if not before.|$|E

5|$|Education in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Britain in the fifth century, until the establishment of the Renaissance late fifteenth century and early sixteenth century. Few sources on Scottish education survived the Medieval era. In the early Middle Ages, Scotland was an oral society, with verbal rather than literary education. Though there are indications of a Gaelic education system similar to that of Ireland, few details are known. The establishment of Christianity from the sixth century brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and <b>written</b> <b>language.</b> Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools.|$|E
5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script.
