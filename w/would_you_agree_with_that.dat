40|$|Alison Broinowski (AB) : A {{connecting}} {{thread of}} fear has been detected in your fi ction. The June 2009 {{special issue of}} Antipodes featured several essays that discussed your work. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>that?</b> Teo Hsu-Ming (THM) : It’s hard to reduce any novel down to one thing, but fear is defi nitely a signifi cant part of Love and Vertigo, and especially in Behind the Moon. The section of the Antipodes article that quoted views about [fear in] Australian society, {{much of that is}} generated by the tabloids, by current affairs television. All of that comes through in the novel but ultimately it goes beyond Australian society. It’s about the human condition, the fear of being alone, the fear of loneliness, {{and not being able to}} connect. Now this I think is the great modernist fear. We have for instance E. M. Forster’s great epigraph in Howard’s End—“only connect”—and the whole history of modernist literature has been about the fear that we are no longer able to connect...|$|E

5000|$|For each exam session the IB prescribes 6 essay titles {{from which}} {{students}} must choose, e.g., [...] "All knowledge claims {{should be open}} to rational criticism. On what grounds {{and to what extent}} <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> this assertion?" [...] Each title raises generic cross-disciplinary questions about knowledge, and the student is expected to consider the issues raised in the title and reach conclusions about them. The essay should put forward claims and counterclaims, linking knowledge issues to areas of knowledge and ways of knowing, and show evidence of original thinking by the student. Essays over the maximum word count of 1,600 are penalised with a one mark reduction, and any content beyond the 1600th word of the essay is not read by the examiner.|$|R

40|$|What {{follows is}} the {{transcript}} of an interview conducted by email between Drucilla Cornell and Ika Willis. Ika Willis: In your work, you are careful {{to attend to the}} fundamental importance of gender identity to individuation in psychoanalytic theory. At the same time, you insist that ‘as a moral and political matter, women must be left free’. It seems that there is both a deep interrelation and a disjunction between the psychoanalytic account of gender identity and the philosophical (moral-political) ideal of freedom in your theory, and that much of the energy and force of your work proceeds from the ways in which each discourse’s account of sex inflects the other’s. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> this, and in what ways have you found the tension between psychoanalytic and legal-political discourse to be itself productive of new ways of thinking about sex and identity...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{will take}} {{permission}} to think, Sir Peregrine," [...] said Mr. Furnival, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Graham {{if you had}} given to the matter much deep consideration." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Montfort sprang {{forward with}} a glance radiant with hope and energy, and kissed her on both cheeks. [...] "Dearest Lady Roehampton," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "dearest Myra! I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me. Yes! it must be done." ...|$|R
60|$|CRAMPTON (subsiding piteously). I didn't mean you, my dear. (Pleading earnestly to Bohun.) But the {{two younger}} ones! {{you have not}} seen them, Mr. Bohun; and indeed I think <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> {{me that there is}} {{something}} very noticeable, something almost gay and frivolous in their style of dressing.|$|R

But then, you see, he wanted to consult his books even more, and he knew very well that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him; and <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>would</b> too. So please don't say {{anything}} more about it, but let Ruth run upstairs and see to our things at once.|$|R

The principle of exclusion on which they are all founded is to me depressing. I require in all things sympathy. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> not <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me in this. The manners of your country are founded on exclusion." ...|$|R
60|$|CYRIL. I {{think that}} view might be questioned. I am rather {{inclined}} to believe in 'the impulse from a vernal wood,' though of course the artistic value of such an impulse depends entirely {{on the kind of}} temperament that receives it, so that the return to Nature would come to mean simply the advance to a great personality. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> that, I fancy. However, proceed with your article.|$|R

I {{was quite}} sure that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> us, {{but at the same}} time I thought it was right before we refused the offer you should know that it was made.

I should be so glad to help you in your difficulties if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me about this." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{gunpowder}} {{is strong}} sometimes: but not always. You may carry it in a flask, {{or in your}} hand, and then it is weak enough. It only becomes strong by being turned into gas and steam. But steam is always strong. And {{if you look at}} a railway engine, still more if you had ever seen--which God forbid you should--a boiler explosion, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, that the strongest thing we know of in the world is steam.|$|R
6000|$|... "I told you, Elizabeth," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{was going}} to see Mr. Torrance. You dissuaded me for some time, but I finally went today, and I am glad that I went. No one except {{yourself}} could have loved your father more than I, or have been more horrified or grieved at his death; but that is no reason why you should aid in the punishment of an innocent man, as I am confident that this man Torrance is, and I tell you Elizabeth if you were not prejudiced <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me.|$|R

But some people take such strange ideas into their heads! To be sure, to be sure, the predominant interest, mine, {{that is to}} say ours, Vivian, is the predominant interest. I have no idea of the predominant interest not being predominant; that would be singular! I knew <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me; we always agree. 'Twas a lucky hour when we met.

40|$|My grade 11 physics text told me {{that middle}} A on the piano is tuned to a {{frequency}} of 440 Hz. This is true. Four hundred and forty hertz is the international orchestral standard tuning for middle A. The text also {{told me that}} the next A above middle A makes an interval of one octave, that is, eight notes. The frequency doubles every time you go up an octave. This is also true. What frequency would a piano tuner use for the A one octave above middle A? If you said 880 Hz, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> my grade 11 physics text. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> also be quite wrong. If you tune a piano using a doubling o...|$|R

If you had seen, as I did, seven or eight {{thousand}} men running like a flock of frightened sheep, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me that it would be hopeless to think of breaking through the Germans with such troops as this. One victory would make all the difference in the world to their morale, but they will never win that one victory, and it will take years before the French soldier regains his old confidence in himself. Have you taken to rats yet, Mary?" [...] he asked, with a flash of his old manner.|$|R
6000|$|But then: 3. This Irish {{party are}} “rebels” whose oath of [...] {{allegiance}} is broken by {{association with the}} enemies of the [...] country. Whether these allegations are true or not, the following [...] questions arise:—(a) Can they be proved; (b) Are they allegations [...] which would be allowed in debate? I suppose <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> [...] me that they cannot be proved; and I doubt whether they would be [...] allowed in debate. The question whether they are a breach of [...] privilege is for the House; but the Speaker would have to say, if [...] called upon, whether they were allowable in debate.

6000|$|... "Because," [...] {{returned}} Selkirk, [...] "I {{find that}} I so seldom do so myself, even although I wish to and often try to; and I hold that every man, {{no matter what}} he is or feels, is one of a class who think and feel as he does; also, because many people, especially Christians, have told me that they have had the same experience to a large extent; also, and chiefly, because, as far as unbelieving man is concerned, the Bible tells me that `God is not in all his thoughts.' But, Ruby, I did not make the remark as a slur upon men in general, I merely spoke of a fact,--an unfortunate fact,--that it is not natural to us, and not easy, to rise from nature to nature's God, and I thought <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Romayne is, as you say, a {{difficult}} subject to deal with," [...] he resumed. [...] "If I commit the slightest imprudence, I shall excite his suspicion--and {{there will be}} an end of my hope of being of service to him. I shall proceed carefully, I can tell you. Luckily, poor dear fellow, he is fond of pictures! It's quite natural that I should ask him to see some recent additions to my gallery--isn't it? There is the trap that I set! I have a sweet girl to tempt him, staying at my house, who is a little out of health and spirits herself. At the right moment, I shall send word upstairs. She may well happen to look in at the gallery (by the merest accident) just at the time when Romayne is looking at my new pictures. The rest depends, of course, on, the effect she produces. If you knew her, I believe <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me that the experiment is worth trying." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rosenbaum {{inquired about}} Goldhagen's [...] "pregnant with murder" [...] metaphor, which {{suggested}} that the Shoah was something inevitable that would have happened without Hitler and Milton Himmelfarb's famous formulation [...] "No Hitler, no Holocaust". Rosenbaum asked [...] "So <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Himmelfarb's argument?" [...] Goldhagen replied: [...] "If the Nazis had never taken power, there {{would not have been}} a Hitler. Had there not been a depression in Germany, then in all likelihood the Nazis wouldn't have come to power. The anti-Semitism would have remained a potential, {{in the sense of the}} killing form. It required a state." [...] Rosenbaum asked Goldhagen about Richard Levy's 1975 book The Downfall of the Anti-Semitic Political Parties in Imperial Germany which traced the decline of the völkisch parties in the early 20th century until they were all but wiped out in the 1912 Reichstag election. Goldhagen replied that voting for or against the wildly antisemitic völkisch parties had nothing to do with antisemitic feeling, and that people could still hate Jews without voting for the völkisch parties.|$|R

You're a sensible and broad-minded girl and can understand. I've done everything for that woman. I got her this job as hostess here--you wouldn't believe what they pay her. I starred her in a show once. Did you see those pearls she was wearing? I gave her those. And she won't speak to me. Just because I didn't like her hat. I wish you could have seen that hat. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me, I know, because you're a sensible, broad-minded girl and understand hats. I don't know what to do. I come here every night." [...] Sally was aware of this. She had seen him often, {{but this was the}} first time that Lee Schoenstein, the gentlemanly master of ceremonies, had inflicted him on her.

6000|$|... "Depend upon it you {{are wrong}} about Beckendorff. That he is a humorist there is no doubt; but it appears to me to be equally clear that his queer habits and {{singular}} mode of life are not of late adoption. What, he is now he must have been these ten, perhaps these twenty years, perhaps more; of this there are a thousand proofs about us. As to the overpowering cause which has made him the character he appears at present, it is needless for us to inquire; probably some incident in his private life in all likelihood connected with the mysterious picture. Let us be satisfied with the effect. If the case be as I state it in his private life and habits, Beckendorff must have been equally incomprehensible and equally singular at the very time that, in his public capacity, he was producing such brilliant results as at the present moment. Now then, can we believe him to be insane? I anticipate your objections. I know you will enlarge upon the evident absurdity of his inviting his political opponent to his house for a grave consultation on the most important affairs, and then treating him as he has done you, when it must be clear to him that you cannot be again duped, and when he must feel that, were he to amuse you for as many weeks as he has days, your plans and your position would not be injuriously affected. Be it so; probably a humorist like Beckendorff cannot, even in the most critical moment, altogether restrain the bent of his capricious inclinations. However, my dear Prince, I will lay no stress upon this point. My opinion, indeed my conviction, is that Beckendorff acts from design. I have considered his conduct well, and I have observed all that you have seen, and more than you have seen, and keenly; depend upon it that since you assented to the interview Beckendorff has been obliged to shift his intended position for negotiation; some of the machinery has gone wrong. Fearful, if he had postponed your visit, you should imagine that he was only again amusing <b>you,</b> and consequently <b>would</b> listen to no future overtures, he has allowed you to attend a conference for which he is not prepared. That he is making desperate exertions to bring the business to a point is my firm opinion; and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> perhaps <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> me were <b>you</b> as convinced as I am that, since we parted last night, our host has been to Reisenburg and back again." ...|$|R
