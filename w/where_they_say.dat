2500|$|Acheson {{told the}} U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee [...] "The French {{have to carry}} [...] in Indochina, and {{we are willing to}} help, but not to {{substitute}} for them....we want to be careful...that we do not press the French to the point <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> 'All right, take over the damned country. We don't want it.' and put their soldiers on ships and send them back to France." ...|$|E

"What I {{worry about}} is kids {{growing up in a}} society <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> 'if I send this email or if I visit this website, then {{somebody}} may think I'm a terrorist. I'm {{not going to talk about}} this issue, I'm not going to read this book, I'm not going to explore this idea.' I don't want anyone thinking about that. It upsets me very much and is not the kind of free society I think we should be living in." ...|$|E

They met the then Pope, St. Miltiades and from him {{received}} a mission. They went to Nice, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> landed, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> after taking advice of the bishops assembled in Arles, in 314. They went and preached the gospel to the inhabitants of Italian side of the Alps, from {{the shores of the}} sea to Vercelli, where Eusebius was chosen as bishop and <b>where</b> <b>they</b> separated.|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a director who polarises audiences like no other" [...] and [...] "the closest thing the British theatre has to an auteur". In 2007, the artistic director of the NT accused the British press of affording Mitchell's productions [...] "misogynistic reviews, <b>where</b> everything <b>they</b> <b>say</b> is predicated on her sex".|$|R
2500|$|Hoyle and Wickramasinghe {{advanced}} {{several instances}} <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the 1918 flu pandemic, and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease. For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesized that cometary dust brought {{the virus to}} Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. In 1982 Hoyle presented Evolution from Space for the Royal Institution's Omni Lecture. After considering {{what he thought of}} as a very remote possibility of Earth-based abiogenesis he concluded: ...|$|E
2500|$|Demonstrating {{early on}} a {{creative}} and quirky bent, in his junior year at Princeton, Kelley submitted a paper for a political science class about John F. Kennedy's plot to kill Fidel Castro, written as a poem. For his senior thesis, he turned the Bill of Rights into a play. [...] "I made each amendment into a character", he said. [...] "The First Amendment is a loudmouth guy who won't shut up. The Second Amendment guy, {{all he wanted to}} talk about was his gun collection. Then the 10th Amendment, the one <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> leave the rest for the states to decide, he was a guy with no self-esteem." [...] Also while at Princeton, {{he was a member of}} the Princeton Triangle Club.|$|E
2500|$|Stylistically and in sentiment, the Tale is undeniably Swift's. Most {{important}} {{in this regard is}} the narrative pose and the creation of narrative parody. The dramatic pretense of writing as a character is in keeping with Jonathan Swift's lifelong practice. Furthermore, Thomas Swift has left few literary remains. Thomas Swift's authorship is examined in the summary of A. C. Guthkelch and D. Nichol Smith's A Tale of a Tub (1920 and 1958), <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "all the evidence for Thomas Swift's participation in the Tale... nothing but rumour and [...] Curll's Key." [...] Indeed, in 1710 Swift had the fifth edition republished by Tooke, and he explained in a letter how the rumour had been started. He said that, when the publication initially took place, Swift was abroad in Ireland and [...] "that little Parson-cousin of mine" [...] "affected to talk suspiciously, as if he had some share in it." [...] In other words, anonymity conspired with Thomas Swift's desire for fame to create the confusion. Afterward, only critical preference seems to account for anyone holding Thomas Swift the author.|$|E

6000|$|... "Serenia?" [...] said Babbalanja; [...] "methinks Serenia is {{that land}} of enthusiasts, {{of which we}} hear, my lord; where Mardians pretend to the unnatural {{conjunction}} of reason with things revealed; <b>where</b> Alma, <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> is restored to his divine original; where, deriving their principles from the same sources whence flow the persecutions of Maramma,--men strive to live together in gentle bonds of peace and charity;--folly! folly!" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Leaving {{this place}} {{we arrived at}} the great river Lixos which comes from Libya. On the banks nomads, the Lixites, were feeding their flocks. We stayed for some time with these people and made friends with them. Upstream from them lived the unfriendly Ethiopians whose land is full of wild beasts and broken up by high {{mountains}} <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> the Lixos flows from. They also say that about these mountains dwell the strange-looking Troglodytes. The Lixites claim that they can run faster than horses. Taking Lixite interpreters with us we sailed alongside the desert in a southerly direction for two days, then towards the rising sun for one more day. We then found {{at the far end of}} an inlet a little island five stades in circumference. We named it Cerne (Some scholars identify Kerne with the Island of Herne (23°50’N) on the coast of the Sahara) and left settlers there. judging by our journey we reckoned that it must be opposite Carthage, since we had to sail the same distance from Carthage to the Pillars of Hercules as from the Pillars of Hercules to Cerne." ...|$|E

I don't {{remember}} it, because ever since I could remember anything we've lived {{right here in}} this lonesome, round house, with a little garden back of it and the thick woods all around. All I've ever seen of the great Land of Oz, Unc dear, is the view of that mountain over at the south, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> the Hammerheads live--who won't let anybody go by them--and that mountain at the north, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> nobody lives." ...|$|E

5000|$|Another factual error: when Paulie tells Tony <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are he <b>says</b> [...] "Exit 12". This {{would imply}} the Garden State Expressway {{which does not}} have an exit at mile 12, and is farther south than the more remote and rural areas of the Pine Barrens.|$|R
5000|$|Authorities at {{the company}} insist that they {{thoroughly}} investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on their television show, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> often <b>say</b> [...] "If you see it on Ripley's, {{you can bet that}} it's real". However, two claims appearing in their books have been dubbed [...] "myths" [...] by MythBusters. One claim which had previously appeared in Ripley's books, concerning an accidental execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners, has had its accuracy called into question by Snopes.|$|R

6000|$|Clare had not {{the least}} {{objection}} to such a farewell formality--which was all that it was to him--and as he passed them he kissed them in succession <b>where</b> <b>they</b> stood, <b>saying</b> [...] "Goodbye" [...] to each as he did so. When they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern the effect of that kiss of charity; there was no triumph in her glance, as there might have been. If there had it would have disappeared when she saw how moved the girls all were. The kiss had obviously done harm by awakening feelings {{they were trying to}} subdue.|$|R

60|$|We {{must begin}} our little {{descriptions}} <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> charity should begin--at home. Mrs. Cammysole, my landlady, will be rather surprised when she reads this, and finds that a good-natured tenant, {{who has never}} complained of her impositions for fifteen years, understands every one of her tricks, and treats them, not with anger, but with scorn--with silent scorn.|$|E

"Angus Macdonald and his sister," [...] he said, [...] "are well, {{and with}} the Ravenshaws, I believe, or at the Little Mountain, their house being {{considered}} in danger; but old Liz Rollin," [...] he added, turning to the anxious half-breed, [...] "has been carried away with her hut, nobody knows <b>where.</b> <b>They</b> <b>say</b> that her old father {{and the mother of}} Winklemann have gone along with her." ...|$|E
60|$|I too picked and ate a few {{berries and}} made the remark that it was late to eat such fruit in November. The Devil in these parts, I told him, flies abroad in October to spit on the bramble bushes and spoil the fruit.
