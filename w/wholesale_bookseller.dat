5000|$|Born at Southampton in March 1793, {{he was the}} son of the Rev. George Whittaker, {{master of}} the grammar school. About 1814 he became a partner of Charles Law, <b>wholesale</b> <b>bookseller,</b> Ave Maria Lane, London, a house {{established}} by W. Bidwell Law (d. 1798). Whittaker brought capital and dynamism into the business. One enterprise was the publication of a translation of Georges Cuvier's ‘Animal Kingdom,’ in sixteen volumes, with many coloured plates.|$|E
5000|$|Gilbert's {{business}} expanded as {{a result}} of his marriage in 1823. On the death of his brother-in-law George Byrom Whittaker, on 13 December 1847, the family acquired a fortune, and his only son, Robert Gilbert, succeeded to his uncle's share in the business as a <b>wholesale</b> <b>bookseller</b> and publisher. In 1830 Gilbert, who had since his brother's death carried on the printing business alone, took into partnership William Rivington, youngest son of Charles Rivington III, the bookseller of Waterloo Place, and as Gilbert & Rivington continued the establishment until his death.|$|E
60|$|He {{would not}} expect the {{machinery}} of retail book-selling {{to meet the needs}} of wholesale buying. So he would go either to <b>wholesale</b> <b>booksellers,</b> or directly to the various publishers of the books and editions he had chosen, and ask for reasonable special prices for the two thousand or seven thousand or fifty thousand of each book he required. And the publishers would, of course, give him very special prices, more especially in the case of the out-of-copyright books. He would probably find it best to buy whole editions in sheets and bind them himself in strong bindings. And he would emerge from these negotiations in possession of a number of complete libraries each of--how many books? Less than twenty thousand ought to do it, I think, though that is a matter for separate discussion, and that should cost him, buying in this wholesale way, under rather than over £2,000 a library.|$|R

50|$|He {{was born}} on July 14, 1852, {{and he had a}} younger brother, Julian Wheeler Curtiss. Edwin {{graduated}} from Columbia University. In 1878 he formed the firm of Cunningham, Curtiss & Welsh of San Francisco, <b>wholesale</b> stationers and <b>booksellers,</b> blank book manufacturers, printers, and lithographers. (Curtiss was based primarily in New York City.) In 1892, together with his brother, Julian Wheeler Curtiss, and others, he started the Fairfield County Golf Club in Greenwich, Connecticut.|$|R
5000|$|Coming {{between the}} {{publisher}} and the retail bookseller {{is the important}} distributing agency of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>bookseller.</b> It is {{to him that the}} retailer and libraries look for supplies, as it is impossible to stock all of the books published. Paternoster Row, London, was for over a hundred years the centre of this industry, where retail booksellers, busily engaged in obtaining the books ordered by the book-buying public. It is where the publisher calls first on showing or [...] "subscribing" [...] a new book, a critical process, for by the number thus ordered the fate of a book is sometimes determined. In the United States, Baker & Taylor is a major distributor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{firm was}} a {{well-established}} printing {{house by the}} time Arthur's son sold Arthur King and Co. in 1872. The firm [...] "did much jobbing work, and for many years had printed the Aberdeen Free Press and produced a great many papers, announcements and notices relating {{to the expansion of}} the railway system into the North and North-East of Scotland." [...] The new owners were: John Thomson, former compositor and later foreman in the case room of the Aberdeen Journal, Alexander Troup, a <b>wholesale</b> <b>bookseller</b> and stationer, and a Mr. Mackenzie. Over the next fifteen years, Thomson bought out his partners, becoming sole owner of the profitable enterprise. Arthur King and Co. grew at strong clip throughout the period; the number of employees increased from 21 in 1872, to 66 in 1887, to 118 by 1894. The firm was sufficiently competitive to undertake work for metropolitan publishers, despite the distance from Aberdeen to the centers of the British publishing world: Glasgow, Edinburgh, and London.|$|E
50|$|For later {{times it}} is {{necessary}} to make a gradual distinction between booksellers, whose trade consists in selling books, either by retail or wholesale, and publishers, whose business involves the production of the books from the author's manuscripts, and who are the intermediaries between author and bookseller, just as the booksellers (in the restricted sense) are intermediaries between the author and publisher and the public. The convenience of this distinction is not impaired by the fact either that a publisher is also a <b>wholesale</b> <b>bookseller,</b> or that a still more recent development in publishing started a reaction to some extent in the way of amalgamating the two functions. The scheme of The Times Book Club (started in 1905) was, again, a combination of a subscription library with the business of bookselling and it brought the organization of a newspaper, with all its means of achieving publicity, into the work of promoting the sale of books, in a way which practically introduced a new factor into the bookselling business.|$|E

During this time he secured significant funding for the institution from local authorities and the Welsh Arts Council, and developed trading practices, introducing a <b>wholesale</b> operation for <b>booksellers</b> and publishers, and introducing services to help publishers improve standards of book production. He was also able to include in Books Council's remit the distribution of grants to improve and extend the variety of books published.|$|R

And I am interested in practically everything pertaining to the book. It is worth remembering that librarians and booksellers are both at the final end of the book distribution system. They are the only ones in the system who face the ultimate reader across a counter. They have problems in common. They each have to choose their stocks from the vast number of available titles, they each have the problem of adequately housing the publisher's product, and they each have to find ways and means of paying for their stocks, either from a budget or from a cash register. Both are directly affected by publishing trends. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|Based {{upon the}} unparalleled {{collection}} of Children 2 ̆ 7 s Literature {{held at the}} American Antiquarian Society, this comprehensive directory contains 2, 600 entries documenting the activity of individuals and firms involved in the manufacture and distribution of childrens books in the United States chiefly between 1821 and 1876. Nationally known firms such as McLoughlin Bros. and non-profit publishers like the American Sunday-School Union are included, as well as prominent educational pioneers such as Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Samuel Griswold Goodrich, and William Bentley Fowle. The directory also reflects the dynamic growth of childrens book production in the major publishing centers of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia [...] {{as well as in}} regional markets such as Rochester, Mobile, Atlanta, Cincinnati, and San Francisco. In short, the Directory documents both a book industry and an American childrens literature that are coming of age in the midst of stunning technological advances, sweeping social change, and great economic upheaval. The main file (accessed through the Download button to the right) includes name, dates of operation, and address. Other files are as indicated. In toto, the files include: Heading (name of person or firm), Street address, City, State (two-digit postal code), Country (countries outside of the United States; used to document people/firms operating in both the United States and another country such as England); Chronological Date Range of Street Addresses; Role, and Notes. “Role” refers to the following terms: Agent Amateur printer Amateur publisher Binder Binding designer Bookseller Copperplate printer Editor Electrotyper Engraver Games publisher Importer Ink maker Lithographer Lithotyper (Stereotyper) Paper dealer Paper manufacturer Printer Publisher Self-publisher Stationer Stereotyper <b>Wholesale</b> <b>bookseller</b> The Note index file contains more information about the entry, such as dates of books issued by the individual/firm that are held at the American Antiquarian Society. This information is particularly useful to track the activity of persons and firms operating in towns and smaller cities for which no published street directory could be located. The Note index also includes citations to published sources about the individual or firm whenever available. As many of these individuals and firms indexed also manufactured and distributed books for adults, the Directory will prove to be a crucial resource for researchers, collectors, book dealers, and virtually anyone seeking a better understanding of American publishing during the nineteenth century.
