5|$|The episode {{has been}} {{credited}} with helping to save at least two lives. During the scene in which Homer chokes on a donut, a poster explaining how the Heimlich maneuver works is on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> In May 1992, Chris Bencze was able to save his brother's life by performing the Heimlich Maneuver on him, having seen it in the episode, and in December 2007, Aiden Bateman was able to save his friend Alex Hardy's life by recalling the same.|$|E
500|$|While {{the plot}} of the episode stands on its own, it also sets up much of the {{continuing}} plot of the series by including Easter eggs for events that do not occur until much later: as Fry falls into the freezer, the scene shows a strange shadow cast on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> It is revealed in [...] "The Why of Fry" [...] that the shadow belongs to Nibbler, who intentionally pushes Fry into the freezer as part of a complex plan to save Earth from the Brainspawn in the future. Executive producer David X. Cohen claims that from the very beginning the creators had plans to show a larger conspiracy behind Fry's journey to the future. In the movie , it is revealed that the spacecraft seen destroying the city while Fry is frozen are piloted by Bender and those chasing him after he steals the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1815 The Pig Faced Lady of Manchester Square and the Spanish Mule of Madrid, a {{coloured}} print by George Cruikshank, was published. Captioned [...] "Ah! Sure a pair {{was never}} seen so justly form'd to meet by nature!", it contrasts the Pig-faced Lady with the unpopular Ferdinand VII of Spain. The Pig-faced Lady wears a transparent veil and plays [...] "Air Swinish Multitude, set to music by Grunt Esq" [...] on a piano. Her silver trough lies on a table behind her, and on her wall {{is a picture of}} [...] "Lord Bacon", also shown with a pig's head. Her image is captioned: Facing her in another panel is Ferdinand VII, shown with a mule's head. Ferdinand sits on a wooden throne, with a chamber pot filled with holy water at his feet. On the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> a painting shows Ferdinand (again with a mule's head) watching a mass execution; a monk says [...] "Here's some more patriots", and Ferdinand replies [...] "O! That's right kill 'em kill 'em". The caption to Ferdinand's image reads: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had raised}} himself wholly upright on the couch, his massive figure, in the {{gorgeous}} crimson tunic, standing out clear and trenchant against the shadowy whiteness of the marble <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> His head, with the ruddy mass of hair {{on which the}} flickering lamps threw brilliant, golden lights, was thrown back, and the eyes, deep, intent, and glowing with unrevealed ardour, looked straight out before him into the shadows.|$|R

2500|$|Rocko's Modern Life {{has been}} noted for its racy humor. Adults made up more than one-fifth of the {{audience}} for the show during its run. The series contained numerous adult innuendos, such as Rocko's brief stint as a telephone operator in the episode [...] "Canned": the instructions on the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> helpfully remind all employees to [...] "Be Hot, Be Naughty, and Be Courteous" [...] while he flatly repeats [...] "Oh baby" [...] into the receiver. Joe Murray noted that the season one segment [...] "Leap Frogs" [...] received [...] "some complaints from some parents" [...] due to its sexual humor, leading to Nickelodeon removing the episode from air {{for the remainder of}} the show's run, although it later aired on the cable channel Nicktoons, and was made available on DVD and video streaming sites such as Netflix. In [...] "The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby", Heffer encounters a milking machine and finds pleasure, although only his reactions are shown onscreen. According to writer/director Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh, the scene was originally supposed to have hearts appearing in Heffer's eyes at the climactic moment. Although it clearly wasn't going to be included, they described the scene to Nickelodeon censors anyway: [...] "We described the scene, and then waited for the axe to fall, but all they said was 'can you change the hearts to stars?', we said sure, and it went in." [...] The scene, as well as a scene showing Heffer's break-up with the machine, were later removed. They are intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode, however. In addition, the uncut version can still be found on the VHS [...] "Rocko's Modern Life: With Friends Like These".|$|E

The video premiered on Sucker Free on November 27, and on 106 & Park on November 28.

During Birdman's verse, he is seen sitting at a table, with YMCMB decorating the <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> The video features cameos from Mack Maine and Cortez Bryant.|$|R

60|$|By this time, {{my sister}} was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe, and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head {{for a little while}} against the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily on.|$|E
60|$|He {{sank back}} {{exhausted}} {{on to the}} pillow.

60|$|The {{policeman}} {{declined to}} waste {{words on a}} man who could ask such a question as that.

'Now, Mr. Sawyer,' {{said the}} little, fierce woman, trying to appear very calm, 'if you'll have the {{kindness}} to settle that little bill of mine I'll thank you, because I've got my rent to pay this afternoon, and my landlord's a-waiting below now.'

60|$|Sir Thomas {{touched the}} {{electric}} button in the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> {{and a man}} in a dark blue uniform appeared. Frederick Power was dismissed.

60|$|The Assistant, in a distraught way--as {{if he had}} {{forgotten}} something--as if he {{had forgotten}} everything, even to his own name and himself--acknowledged the visitor's presence, and stepped further back into {{the shadow of the}} <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> But, he was so pale that his face stood out in relief again the dark wall, and really could not be hidden so.|$|E

60|$|He was {{standing}} with one arm round her, his disengaged hand was searching impatiently over the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> for the bell, {{and his eyes were}} fixed in anguish and in love unutterable on the peaceful face, hushed in its sad repose so close beneath his own. For one moment, I saw him thus, ere I closed the door--the next, I had left the house.|$|E
60|$|Heathcliff {{stood near}} the entrance, in his shirt and trousers; with a candle {{dripping}} over his fingers, and his face as white as the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> The first creak of the oak startled him like an electric shock: the light leaped from his hold to a distance of some feet, and his agitation was so extreme, that he could hardly pick it up.|$|E
60|$|Ere long, however, his {{emotions}} took a sterner and a darker hue. The {{sight of the}} animal wearied him, and he flung it contemptuously aside. It disappeared {{in the direction of}} the ramparts; and almost at the same moment he heard a slight sound, resembling the falling of several minute particles of brick or light stone, which seemed to come from the <b>wall</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

5000|$|At {{about this}} time, pop videos were {{starting}} to be made more frequently by directors like Russell Mulcahy (Duran Duran), David Mallet (David Bowie), and Brian Grant (Olivia Newton-John). Pope decided to turn his hand to this new form. His first attempts at rock video were shot in Carnaby Street and in Putney Bridge's subterranean tunnels on a non-broadcast format for the single [...] "Cut Out the Real" [...] by Jo Broadbery and the Standouts, {{as well as its}} B-side. After unsuccessfully pitching many videos (and with very little to show as his own work), he was finally engaged to make Soft Cell’s first video for Some Bizzare Records, Non-Stop Exotic Video Show, which was a companion release to their debut album, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret. The collection was originally issued on VHS, Betamax, and laserdisc in 1982, and re-issued on DVD in 2004. The video for [...] "Bedsitter" [...] had Pope’s trademark individuality, as it featured the band’s singer, Marc Almond, wearing shirts that matched the <b>walls</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> In many ways, it is considered this video bears all the major hallmarks of a Pope video: individuality, linear progression in terms of story, and a slight psychedelic feel. (Pope has many names for different genres of videos and this type he calls a narrative/atmospheric. He has lectured all over the world on the subject, including at London’s National Film Theatre.) ...|$|R
