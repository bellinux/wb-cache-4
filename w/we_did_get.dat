500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think the way <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely {{different from what they}} do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} a polarized critical reaction. Eric Goldman, writing for IGN, gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He called it [...] "the best so far of season three, as it did a nice job of {{going back and forth}} between the mystery of the week, the ongoing rape storyline, and Veronica's personal issues, with each aspect well-represented. While displeased with Hearst's acting, he called the storyline [...] "good, fun stuff". He also enjoyed the emotional advancement of Veronica and Logan's relationship, writing that he showed genuine emotion in the episode, in contrast to his usual sarcastic demeanor. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching, called it [...] "one of the season's strongest episodes." [...] He elaborated, [...] "With Diane Ruggiero on script, you know there's going to be the funny [...] [...] Plus, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a Veronica/Keith team-up, just on the Mystery of the Week instead of the rape arc." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B".|$|E

I really wanted that European feel of cold mountains, big forests, that sort of spirit was {{important}} to me. Luckily <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> to shoot it in Germany which is the homeland of the fairy tale. Shooting in natural outdoor sets {{is very important to}} me, compared to working on a sound stage." [...] It took place in Germany, at the Babelsberg Studio in Potsdam-Babelsberg, in a filming location at an old forest near Berlin (production designer Stephen Scott said that he searched for and found what he believed looked like a [...] "medieval forest" [...] free of human interference) and in the city of Braunschweig in Lower Saxony. After the film was delayed to 2013, the crew did a [...] "couple" [...] of re-shoots, including [...] "a little bit" [...] in the deserts of California (filming the post-ending scene, an extended version of which was also released in a promotional clip [...] "The Desert Witch").|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology was positive {{and gave the}} episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred [...] "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections." [...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly." [...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in all honesty, it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's just showing its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be." [...] Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in Calgary Herald and concluded that we should [...] "orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime. Based on tonight's sharp-eyed, keen-witted Treehouse of Horror XXII - funnier, faster and more fright-worthy than last year's dud, thankfully - there's a lot of ink left in the old ink pot yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a period}} of heavy media {{criticism}} aimed at EastEnders throughout 2004 and 2005, the character—who was on a hiatus from the show—was reintroduced twice in what was branded by the press as a bid to [...] "boost flagging Enders" [...] and [...] "revive the soap's ailing ratings". His first return in April 2005 was generally well-received, with media comments such as [...] "the excellent, bug-eyed Steve McFadden proves nobody does psychotic thug better than him" [...] and [...] "McFadden's blistering performance on Tuesday defies that old cliché of a soap being bigger than its stars". Of the Mitchell brothers' highly publicised return in October 2005, a reporter from the Daily Mirror commented [...] "Soapville must confess that <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> goosebumps and feel properly excited when we first saw the Mitchell Brothers back on the Square...After all, you associate them with the golden days of Enders".|$|E

[...] Grant's long-awaited return eventually happened in 2005, {{during a period of}} heavy media criticism aimed at EastEnders.

2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
