In Jon Savage's analysis, they [...] "needed a gimmick, some edge to get them attention. Here it was: 'Kinkiness'—something newsy, naughty but just on the borderline of acceptability.

She also warns to the camera for Aniston to [...] "stay away from John Mayer", the musician who previously dated Aniston. In the days prior to the original broadcast of [...] "Galentine's Day", Mayer publicly apologized {{for a number of}} explicit sexual and racial comments he had made in the past months, which prompted news outlets to praise Parks and Recreation for the timeliness of their Mayer joke. Ironically, in May 2011, Jennifer Aniston started dating Justin Theroux, who guest starred in the episode, and they later married.

2500|$|Crime la Elsinore is {{a return}} to prose satire, in this case {{directed}} at the theatrical environment.

He argues: [...] "Whichever <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at it, set free from the contextual interpretations exercised in reading tabloids, the novel stands only to gain." [...] The narrative focus is on the kitschy ambition of a failed theater manager, Cosma, who proceeds to conflate all the violent moments of Shakespearean tragedy into a single show of regular proportions. The project is increasingly confused, and the text used by Cosma mixes Shakespeare's lines with quotes from Pierre Beaumarchais, Euripides and Molière, while adopting the format of a detective novel.|$|E
