40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{describe}} legal {{theories that}} non-smoking residents of multiple occupancy buildings may employ when affected by {{environmental tobacco smoke}} (ETS) from neighbouring units.  DESIGN—Legal research was conducted in several US states. Research was performed among statutes and regulations. State health regulations were examined as well as common law claims <b>of</b> nuisance, <b>warranties</b> <b>of</b> <b>habitability,</b> {{and the right of}} quiet enjoyment.  RESULTS—Through the use of state regulations, such as a sanitary code, several states provide general language for protecting the health of residents in multi-unit buildings. State law also supports more traditional claims <b>of</b> nuisance, <b>warranties</b> <b>of</b> <b>habitability,</b> and the right of quiet enjoyment.  CONCLUSIONS—The use of state regulations has the potential to provide an effective, existing vehicle for resolution of ETS incursion problems. The general health protection language of the regulations, in conjunction with the latest evidence of the harmful effects of ETS, gives state agencies authority to regulate environmental tobacco smoke incursions among apartments in multi-unit dwellings. Where state regulations are not available, other common law legal remedies may be available.    Keywords: environmental tobacco smoke; legal strategies; multiple occupancy dwelling...|$|R

While this article will be concerned with disclaimers only in legal contexts, the range of such legal contexts is broad. This article will refer below to disclaimers by governmental and non-governmental actors in various circumstances. Disclaimers arise, for example, in Establishment Clause cases in general, and of late, in cases involving public school evolution text books. Disclaimers may also {{be thought of as}} a remedy for compelled speech, or as themselves an instance of compelled speech. In addition, commercial speech is a fertile source of disclaimer problems, as in commercial advertising by professionals, the marketing of securities, and the making of health claims regarding dietary food supplements. For further perspective, this article will also refer to disclaimers in specific business and commercial contexts involving employment contract laws, commercial and consumer implied warranty and tort disclaimer cases, and various sorts <b>of</b> implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> residential <b>habitability</b> cases. ...|$|R

50|$|An implied <b>{{warranty}}</b> <b>of</b> <b>habitability,</b> generally, is a warranty {{implied by}} law that by leasing or buying a residential property, the lessor or seller is promising that {{the property is}} suitable to be lived in. The <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> <b>habitability</b> can be breached {{if there is no}} heat, hot water, or other essential services. Also, safety issues like no smoke alarm or other fire code issues can be considered to make a dwelling uninhabitable. Also, if the municipality in which the property is located prohibits habitation without a certificate of occupancy but has not issued such a certificate with respect to the property, the unlawfulness of that habitation renders the property uninhabitable as a matter of law. The breach of the implied warrant of habitability can be used to legally break a lease. If the factors have been created or are controllable by the landlord and he or she has not fixed them despite ample written notification, this situation can also be considered constructive eviction, which allows the tenant to break the lease, but also may allow the tenant to sue for damages in some jurisdictions.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a social demand to reduce the {{environmental}} impact in order to guarantee the human activity sustainability. When this demand is transposed to the construction sector, habitability must be redefined. Any search for efficiency increase must be thought about after reconsidering its social utility. Consequently, habitability must be focused on satisfying the basic necessities through the efficient use of the available resources. Due to this evidence this thesis assumes as a main goal contributing to this redefinition, through the observation of the current perception <b>of</b> <b>habitability</b> and {{from the study of}} its historical normative conformation. The achievement of this objective is developed by means of a threefold approach to the proceeding that defines habitability in each historical moment. The first approach is focused on detecting where the concept <b>of</b> <b>habitability</b> is defined, while showing that it arises fundamentally from the regulations. Research in the normative field <b>of</b> <b>habitability</b> makes clear two key aspects: Firstly, from the compendium of the regulations related to habitability it is obvious that, beyond the self-called habitability regulations, there has existed a large set of regulations that is crucial for the configuration of the material reality <b>of</b> <b>habitability.</b> This set <b>of</b> regulations is made of orders coming from multiple fields ¿hygiene, social housing, urbanism or construction-. Secondly, focusing on the inhabitants reveals the existence of a whole normative field that, from its link to housing, defines the rights and responsibilities of people. The second approach defines how the habitability concept is specified, emphasizing that the regulation of this utility has been evolutionary along time. From the definition of the concepts related to process <b>of</b> providing <b>habitability</b> ¿functions, satisfactors and privacy-, and the observation of the regulation, the set of contributions that allow going in depth in its definition deploy. Regarding the functions, its normative evolution compared with the implications of the right to housing reveals that they are a fundamental element to consider, specify and liken to rights linked to the fact of residing. At the same time, functions must be organized in the territory and its access from the homes must be guaranteed. In relation to privacy, the analysis of the satisfaction scales confirms that the historical trend of increasing individuality. A trend sheltered by a vision based on the negation of relations, and propelled as a vital need of the individual. This fact contradicts a variable conception of privacy that, from the individual¿s will, can become a compromise factor between the personal demands and the material availability. Regarding the satisfactors, it becomes evident that they are the main vehicles <b>of</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>habitability,</b> while including an implicit resource management model. All these factors should be reconsidered due to the demands derived from sustainability, pointing the regulation process towards the results guarantee. The last approach is directed to explore why the habitability concept is formulated, showing that some reasons defined by the regulations have acted as rigidities and making conditional the later evolution <b>of</b> <b>habitability.</b> Observing the objectives, plans and conditionings <b>of</b> <b>habitability</b> regulated in every moment, and the subsequent reconstruction of the normative history, the main motor objectives can be detected, and their effect on the factors that have defined habitability along time as well. Finally, {{as a result of the}} historical prospection <b>of</b> <b>habitability,</b> it is possible to characterize the current conception <b>of</b> <b>habitability</b> from its evolutionary logics, and provide materials for its redefinition towards sustainability.
