A biographical film directed by Martin Scorsese {{has long been}} in production. A 1998 episode of the BBC documentary series Arena, The Voice of the Century, focused on Sinatra. Alex Gibney directed a four-part biographical series on Sinatra, All or Nothing At All, for HBO in 2015. A musical tribute was aired on CBS television in December 2015 to mark Sinatra's centenary.|$|E

We wanted to give the player control of a hero who would adapt to the way they played, who would age, become scarred in battle, who could get tattoos, wear dreadlocks and a dress if the player was so inclined. We wanted each and every person who played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell. And <b>we</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> Thingy.|$|E

500|$|Ferguson's {{sense of}} what was [...] "right" [...] {{became the basis for}} the Beiderbecke Romantic legend, which has {{traditionally}} emphasized the musician's Iowa roots, his often careless dress, his difficulty sight reading, the purity of his tone, his drinking, and his early death. These themes were repeated by Beiderbecke's friends in various memoirs, including The Stardust Road (1946) and Sometimes I Wonder (1965) by Hoagy Carmichael, Really the Blues (1946) by Mezz Mezzrow, and <b>We</b> <b>Called</b> <b>It</b> Music (1947) by Eddie Condon. Beiderbecke was portrayed as a tragic genius along the lines of Ludwig van Beethoven. [...] "For his talent there were no conservatories to get stuffy in, no high-trumpet didoes to be learned doggedly, note-perfect as written," [...] Ferguson wrote, [...] "because in his chosen form the only writing of any account was traced in the close shouting air of Royal Gardens, Grand Pavilions, honkeytonks, etc." [...] He was [...] "this big overgrown kid, who looked like he'd been snatched out of a cradle in the cornfields," [...] Mezzrow wrote. [...] "The guy didn't have an enemy in the world," [...] recalled Beiderbecke's friend Russ Morgan, [...] "ut he was out of this world most of the time." [...] According to Ralph Berton, he was [...] "as usual gazing off into his private astronomy," [...] but his cornet, Condon famously quipped, sounded [...] "like a girl saying yes." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include [...] "Our Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Stardust" [...] in 1940; [...] "Oh! Look at Me Now", [...] "Dolores", [...] "Everything Happens to Me" [...] and [...] "This Love of Mine" [...] in 1941; [...] "Just as Though You Were There", [...] "Take Me" [...] and [...] "There Are Such Things" [...] in 1942; and [...] "It Started All Over Again", [...] "In the Blue of Evening" [...] and [...] "It's Always You" [...] in 1943. As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night <b>We</b> <b>Called</b> <b>It</b> a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".|$|E

2500|$|In February 2007, a crew filming footage for comedian Bill Maher's anti-religious {{documentary}} Religulous {{toured the}} museum, {{and arranged for}} Maher to interview Ken Ham without Ham knowing in advance that Maher would be the interviewer. In an August 2008 interview with Los Angeles Times columnist Patrick Goldstein, Maher said he used similar tactics to secure interviews with other people shown in the film: [...] "It was simple: We never, ever, used my name. (...) We even had a fake title for the film. <b>We</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> 'A Spiritual Journey'." [...] Maher continued: [...] "The hour is getting very late {{to be able to}} indulge in having key decisions made by religious people. By irrationalists, by those who would steer the ship of state not by a compass, but by the equivalent of reading the entrails of a chicken." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Parade {{column and}} its {{response}} received considerable {{attention in the}} press, including a front page story in the New York Times in which Monty Hall himself was interviewed. [...] Hall understood the problem, giving the reporter a demonstration with car keys and explaining how actual game play on Let's Make a Deal differed from {{the rules of the}} puzzle. In the article, Hall pointed out that because he had control over the way the game progressed, playing on the psychology of the contestant, the theoretical solution did not apply to the show's actual gameplay. He said he was not surprised at the experts' insistence that the probability was 1 out of 2. [...] "That's the same assumption contestants would make on the show after I showed them there was nothing behind one door," [...] he said. [...] "They'd think the odds on their door had now gone up to 1 in 2, so they hated to give up the door no matter how much money I offered. By opening that door we were applying pressure. <b>We</b> <b>called</b> <b>it</b> the Henry James treatment. It was 'The Turn of the Screw.'“ Hall clarified that as a game show host {{he did not have to}} follow the rules of the puzzle in the vos Savant column and did not always have to allow a person the opportunity to switch (e.g., he might open their door immediately if it was a losing door, might offer them money to not switch from a losing door to a winning door, or might only allow them the opportunity to switch if they had a winning door). [...] "If the host is required to open a door all the time and offer you a switch, then you should take the switch," [...] he said. [...] "But if he has the choice whether to allow a switch or not, beware. Caveat emptor. It all depends on his mood.” ...|$|E
