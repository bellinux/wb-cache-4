5|$|Even so, churches {{within the}} Assemblies of God have {{experienced}} revivals {{in the last}} two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly of God in Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants. In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's national leadership gave it cautious approval and support.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Confederation in Huldrych Zwingli's time {{consisted}} of thirteen states (cantons) {{as well as}} affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of Switzerland, which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> the Confederation. This relative independence served {{as the basis for}} conflict {{during the time of the}} Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the Old Zurich War of 1440–1446.|$|E

50|$|As {{of around}} 1800, {{the numbers of}} precincts in each ward (and for each {{division}} in brackets) were: Aldersgate 8 (4 <b>Within</b> <b>and</b> 4 <b>Without),</b> Aldgate 7, Bassishaw 2, Billingsgate 12, Bishopsgate 9 (5 <b>Within</b> <b>and</b> 4 <b>Without),</b> Bread Street 13, Bridge Within 14, Broad Street 10, Candlewick 7, Castle Baynard 10, Cheap 9, Coleman Street 6, Cordwainer 8, Cornhill 4, Cripplegate 13 (9 <b>Within</b> <b>and</b> 4 <b>Without),</b> Dowgate 8, Farringdon Within 17, Farringdon Without 16, Langbourn 12, Lime Street 4, Portsoken 5, Queenhithe 6, Tower 12, Vintry 9, and Walbrook 7. This amounted to 228 precincts, making each precinct on average around 3 acre in size. However, {{it should be noted}} that the City of London was very densely populated until the mid-19th century, giving each precinct in the region of 500 residents on average.|$|R

Two {{weeks after}} news {{reports of the}} slaughter, the CIA sent a U-2 to {{photograph}} it; a week later the CIA completed its report on the matter. During Operation Allied Force, the CIA had incorrectly provided the coordinates of the Chinese Embassy as a Yugoslav military target resulting in its bombing.|$|E
25|$|As desired and expected, news of {{a contest}} of such {{distance}} evoked strong enthusiasm both <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> the motorsport community.

Germany has emerged as a power inside Europe and in the world; its role in the European debt crisis and in the European migrant crisis have led to criticism of German authoritarian abuse of its power, especially with regard to the Greek debt crisis, and raised questions <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> Germany as to Germany's role in the world.|$|E

5000|$|In the City of London {{there are}} two Wards for Farringdon — Farringdon <b>Within</b> <b>and</b> Farringdon <b>Without</b> — a {{situation}} caused by the splitting of the original Farringdon Ward in 1394. [...] "Without" [...] and [...] "Within" [...] denote whether the Ward fell outside or within the London Wall — {{this was also the}} case for the Wards of Bridge <b>Within</b> <b>and</b> Bridge <b>Without.</b> These Wards cover a fairly considerable part of the City, though before 2004 these Wards covered an even wider area: Farringdon Without stretched from Chancery Lane including Middle Temple, Inner Temple and across to Smithfield while Farringdon Within covered the area within the Walls across to Cheapside at Wood Street and included New Change and Blackfriars Bridge. Blackfriars and St Bartholomew's Hospital.|$|R
25|$|When Genghis Khan's {{youngest}} brother Temüge threatened Töregene {{to seize}} the throne, Güyük came to Karakorum to try to secure his position. Batu eventually agreed to send his brothers and generals to the kurultai convened by Töregene in 1246. Güyük by this time was ill and alcoholic, but his campaigns in Manchuria and Europe gave him the kind of stature necessary for a great khan. He was duly elected at a ceremony attended by Mongols and foreign dignitaries from both <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> the empire — leaders of vassal nations, representatives from Rome, and other entities {{who came to the}} kurultai to show their respects and negotiate diplomacy.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavad Gita is a {{dialogue}} between Krishna and Arjuna, and presents Bhakti, Jnana and Karma yoga as alternate ways to spiritual liberation, with the choice left to the individual. The text discusses dharma, and its pursuit as duty without craving for fruits of one's actions, {{as a form of}} spiritual path to liberation. The text, state Clooney and Stewart, succinctly summarizes the foundations of Vaishnava theology that the entire universe exists within Vishnu, and all aspects of life and living is not only a divine order but divinity itself. Bhakti, in Bhagavad Gita, is an act of sharing, and a deeply personal awareness of spirituality <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since {{the time}} of Mathers' translation, The Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage has {{remained}} popular among English-speaking ceremonial magicians and occultists interested in Hermetic Qabalah, Christian Kabbalah and grimoires. A paperback reprint during the renewed rise of interest in hermeticism during the 1970s placed the book before {{a new generation of}} readers, and one offshoot of this was that a number of people, both <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> the Thelemic and Golden Dawn communities, claimed to have either undertaken the Abramelin operation in toto or to have successfully experimented with the magic squares and Abramelin oil formula found in the text.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the {{perennial}} issues of Vietnam, {{a country in}} civil war, Helms led as an important institutional player in the political mix of Washington. Yet CIA people were themselves divided on the conflict. As the DCI, Helms' daily duties involved {{the difficult task of}} updating CIA intelligence and reporting on CIA operations to the American executive leadership. Vietnam then dominated the news. Notoriously, the American political consensus eventually broke. The public became sharply divided, with the issues being vociferously contested. About the so-called Vietnamese 'quagmire' it seemed confusion reigned <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without.</b> Helms saw himself as struggling to best serve his view of America and his forceful superior, the President.|$|E
25|$|Pushyavarman (350–374) {{established}} the Varman Dynasty, by fighting many enemies from <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> his kingdom; but his son Samudravarman (374–398), named after Samudragupta, {{was accepted as}} an overlord by many local rulers. Nevertheless, subsequent kings continued their attempts to stabilise and expand the kingdom. The Nagajari Khanikargaon rock inscription of 5th century found in Sarupathar in Golaghat district of Assam adduces {{the fact that the}} kingdom spread to the east very quickly. Kalyanavarman (422-446) occupied Davaka and Mahendravarman (470-494) further eastern areas. Narayanavarma (494–518) and his son Bhutivarman (518–542) offered the ashwamedha (horse sacrifice); and as the Nidhanpur inscription of Bhaskarvarman avers, these expansions included the region of Chandrapuri visaya, identified with present-day Sylhet division. Thus, the small but powerful kingdom that Pushyavarman established grew in fits and starts over many generations of kings and expanded to include adjoining possibly smaller kingdoms and parts of Bangladesh.|$|E
25|$|Wilson envisioned The Open University {{as a major}} marker in the Labour Party's {{commitment}} to modernising British society. He believed that it would help build a more competitive economy while also promoting greater equality of opportunity and social mobility. The planned utilisation of television and radio to broadcast its courses was also supposed to link The Open University to the technological revolution underway, which Wilson saw as a major ally of his modernization schemes. However, from the start Lee encountered widespread scepticism and even opposition from <b>within</b> <b>and</b> <b>without</b> the Labour Party, including senior officials in the DES; her departmental head Anthony Crosland; the Treasury; Ministerial colleagues, such as Richard Crossman; and commercial broadcasters. The Open University was realized due to Lee's unflagging determination and tenacity in 1965–67, the steadfast support from Wilson, {{and the fact that}} the anticipated costs, as reported to Lee and Wilson by Arnold Goodman, seemed very modest. By the time the actual, much higher costs became apparent, it was too late to scrap the fledgling open university.|$|E
