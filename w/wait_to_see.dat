5|$|Although both Malaysia and Singapore {{had agreed}} to respect and accept the ICJ's decision, Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking {{permission}} to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. He noted that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, Leake {{received}} {{the news that}} a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements {{was on its way}} from Lisbon, escorted by four men-of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; three of them had been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies of powder, tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar safe for the moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.|$|E
5|$|Catesby {{waited for}} Percy's {{return from the}} north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to {{constitute}} any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know {{the exact nature of}} the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to <b>wait,</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how events unfolded. On 3November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York's lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king's daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.|$|E

500|$|Another troubling {{aspect of}} the {{production}} was the difficulty in obtaining a director. The producers approached Steven Spielberg, who was in post-production of Jaws, but ultimately decided to <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> [...] "how the fish picture turns out". The first director attached to the film was Guy Hamilton, who directed the previous three Bond films as well as Goldfinger, but he left after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film Superman, although Richard Donner took over the project. Eon Productions later turned to Lewis Gilbert, who had directed the earlier Bond film You Only Live Twice.|$|E

500|$|Some {{critics have}} judged Mega Man 3 to be {{excessively}} difficult. GamePro contributor McKinley Noble comically stated that actions such as [...] "pulling teeth, lifting a car {{over your head}} or performing open-heart surgery" [...] are all significantly easier than beating Mega Man 3. Whitehead noted, [...] "Leaps must be precise, enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately, and there's {{a constant state of}} delicious near-panic as you <b>wait</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what vicious demands the next room will place on your platforming skills." [...] The Lessers additionally saw considerable flicker when too many sprites appear onscreen at once.
