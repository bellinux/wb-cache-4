40|$|Münkler 2005). Although many {{scholars}} {{use it in}} various ways, there are several common characteristics. According to Mary Kaldor, the new <b>wars</b> can <b>be</b> contrasted with earlier wars {{in terms of their}} goals, the methods of warfare and how they are financed (Kaldor, 2006 : 7). The first characteristic of the new <b>wars</b> <b>is</b> its goals. While old <b>wars</b> <b>were</b> about the geo-political or ideological goals, new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> about the identity. Other scholars point out that new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> waged because of greed rather than grievance and that the war itself becomes the purpose (Berdal and Malone, 2000) (F 0 a). The second characteristic of the new <b>wars</b> <b>is</b> the changed mode of warfare. As a breakdown of public authority blurs the distinction between public and private combatants, and between combatants and civilians, civilian casualties are increasing and civilians are sometimes deliberately targeted as an object of wars(F 0 b). The third one is the relation between new wars and global economy. The state failures and the civil <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> usually driven by global war economy. It seems plausible that the new <b>wars</b> <b>are</b> emerging. However if we look at wars in detail, we can find out some facts that refute the new wars hypothesis. First...|$|R
