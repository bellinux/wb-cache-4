[...] Space for a reactor was reserved amidship, {{in and around the}} ship's steam turbine power plant. [...] This made it necessary to locate the dining rooms and galleys one deck higher than usual, and separated from the ship's main <b>working</b> <b>passage.</b> [...] No passenger corridors passed through the area reserved for a reactor, which meant the forward and rear passenger-accessible sections on the lowest decks were entirely separated from each other.|$|E
