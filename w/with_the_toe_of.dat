50|$|Christy Brown (5 June 1932 - 7 September 1981) was an Irish {{writer and}} painter who had {{cerebral}} palsy {{and was able}} to write or type only <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> one foot. His most recognized work is his autobiography, titled My Left Foot (1954). It was later made into a 1989 Academy Award-winning film of the same name, starring Daniel-Day Lewis as Brown.|$|R
2500|$|Originally, he {{was born}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> that foot fused. An {{operation}} was performed to separate <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> {{so that he could}} use them as fingers to grab, turn a page, or perform other functions. He has been able to use his foot to operate an electric wheelchair, a computer and a mobile phone. Vujicic attempted suicide but notes that he had an [...] "amazingly normal childhood".|$|R
60|$|He {{turned and}} grasped the mantel shelf with both hands, {{and touched the}} log <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his boot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mike Delaney!" [...] he cried, kicking on {{the wagon}} wheel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his boot; [...] "Mike Delaney, have you seen my father anywhere?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Call me [...] "brother," [...] Moosu--call me [...] "brother,"' I chided, lifting him to {{his feet}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> my moccasin. 'Wilt thou evermore obey?' ...|$|E
50|$|Done <b>with</b> <b>the</b> board {{straight}} up against your legs, this move uses the skateboard as a pogo stick. One foot {{is on the}} bottom truck, and one or both hands grab the nose to help lift the board up as the rider hops. It can also be done by squeezing the board between both legs in a no-handed variant, or stood with {{one foot on the}} truck and the other crossed over behind it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> that foot pushing against the griptape for a cross-footed pogo.|$|R
50|$|Seisan-dachi (十三立, {{universal}} stance)The {{feet are}} shoulder width apart, as in Heiko-dachi, but one foot is forward {{to where the}} heel is parallel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> big <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sing if ye like, but I'll plug my ears, for one," [...] said {{still another}} sulky varlet, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> out <b>of</b> his sea-boots, while all <b>the</b> rest <b>with</b> one roar of misanthropy joined him.|$|R
60|$|Again, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his moccasin, {{he touched}} the Cossack—a grisly spectacle, no longer conscious—yet in whose dismembered body the pain-racked life clung and was loth to go.|$|E
60|$|His {{awakening}} was a rude one. Somebody {{touched him}} in the side <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> a boot, and {{the light of a}} smoky lantern was flashed into his face.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{short of}} what I expected," [...] said Shark Dodson, kicking softly at the {{packages}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his boot. And then he looked pensively at the wet sides of his tired horse.|$|E
50|$|From Tadasana, {{weight is}} shifted to one leg, for example, {{starting}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> left leg. The entire sole {{of the foot}} remains in contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> floor. The right knee is bent and the right foot placed on the left inner thigh, or in half lotus position. In either foot placement, the hips should be open, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> right knee pointing towards the right, not forward. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right foot pointing directly down, the left foot, center of the pelvis, shoulders and head are all vertically aligned. Hands are typically held above the head either pointed directly upwards and unclasped, or clasped together in anjali mudra.|$|R
50|$|Starting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> right foot, wash {{both feet}} from <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> {{up to and}} {{including}} the ankles thrice. The little finger of the left hand should be passed between <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> feet beginning from <b>the</b> little <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right foot and ending <b>with</b> <b>the</b> little <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left foot.|$|R
5000|$|A {{large number}} of skateboarding tricks are {{achievable}} on a Penny Board. The most common is the Ollie (a jumping trick) or the Manual (rolling on the two back wheels of the board while remaining balance). The Ollie is a fundamental skating trick. Other examples of fundamental tricks {{that can be done}} on a Penny board include the Kickflip, performed primarily <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leading foot, and <b>the</b> Heelflip, performed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heel of the leading foot. Old-school tricks such as the [...] "Boneless" [...] and 'No Comply" [...] are also popular tricks. Below {{are some of the best}} known variants of tricks that can be done on a Penny board.|$|R
60|$|Less {{than sixty}} seconds passed, {{and he was}} {{pounding}} vigorously {{on the front door}} of the heavy log building. Not content with using his fist he banged away <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his cowhide boot.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, I think I should pat my foot," [...] {{answered}} Kitty; and in {{fact the}} charming simpleton on shore, having perfected her attitude, was tapping the ground nervously <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> her adorable slipper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, I {{wonder what}} {{happened}} to this fellow," [...] said Farmer Brown's boy, turning Unc' Billy over <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> one foot. [...] "He certainly is dead enough, whatever killed him. I wonder what he was doing in here." ...|$|E
60|$|Beatrix dug her cerulean parasol {{deep into}} the pine-needles and sighed. The hermit, on the q. t., removed a grass burr from the ankle of one sandalled foot <b>with</b> <b>the</b> big <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his other one. She blued--and almost starched and ironed him--with her cobalt eyes.|$|R
50|$|Nicoladoni {{specialized}} in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery. He was {{particularly interested in}} research and diagnosis of scoliosis, publishing several treatises on the disorder. He also performed the first successful thumb replacement, an operation involving replacement of a boy's lost thumb <b>with</b> <b>the</b> second <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his right foot.|$|R
5000|$|... 14th century poulaine-toed shoes {{found in}} London were {{found only in}} men's sizes, but 15th century art shows them being worn by both men and women, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> men's shoes being the most extravagantly long. They were a {{controversial}} fashion and faced criticism from several quarters. In 1366, Charles V of France issued an edict banning their construction and use in Paris. An English poem from 1388 complained that men were unable to kneel in prayer because their toes were too long. In 1463, Edward IV passed a sumptuary law restricting anyone [...] "under the state of a Lord, Esquire, or Gentleman" [...] from wearing poulaines over the length of two inches. In 1465, they were banned in England altogether, so that all cordwainers and cobblers within the City of London were prohibited from making shoes with pikes more than two inches long.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless," [...] said Cressy, {{assuming}} her old position {{against the}} lintel of the door, and smoothing the worn bear-skin {{that served as}} a mat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> her slipper, [...] "unless you've mixed it up with your other arbitration, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{gave the}} man a violent kick <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his boot. The man groaned, {{stretched}} himself, turned over and rubbed his eyes. The light of the swinging lanthorn showed him the wrathful face of his employer. He struggled to his feet very quickly after that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{striking}} {{the heel of}} her fore-foot <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> her hind-foot. Sometimes it comes from bad shoeing. Some people like it. I don't myself." [...] After a while he added, [...] "If you can get this mare for a hundred and twenty-five, you'd better buy her." ...|$|E
50|$|An organ {{expression}} pedal {{is typically}} a large pedal, resembling an oversized automobile accelerator, either partially or fully recessed within the organ console and located either directly above {{or to the}} right of the organ's pedalboard. As the pedal is pressed forward <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes,</b> <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> the sound is increased; as it is depressed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heel, the volume is decreased. A stand alone expression pedal used with electronic keyboards, amplifiers, and effects is usually a smaller pedal made of metal or plastic that can be placed on the floor and then connected to <b>the</b> device <b>with</b> an instrument cable.|$|R
5000|$|This possum {{looks like}} {{a black and white}} squirrel. It is solitary, mostly nocturnal, arboreal, and builds nests in tree branches. The body length is approx. 263 mm long, tail 325 mm, and weight 423 g. The striped possum's tail is prehensile. [...] Its fourth finger is {{elongated}} relative to the others (like the third finger of the Aye-aye, a placental mammal found in Malagasy rainforests) and is used to take beetles and caterpillars from tree bark, making it a [...] "mammalian woodpecker". The striped possum also eats leaves, fruits, and small vertebrates. Its main diet consists of wood-boring insect larvae which are extracted from rotten branches probing with its elongated fourth finger and its powerful incisor teeth which are used to rip open tree bark to expose insects. It detects the larvae by a rapid drumming along branches <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> its forefoot. <b>The</b> fourth finger has an unusual hooked nail which it uses to extract insects out of cracks.|$|R
60|$|To add to her troubles, {{she was now}} fourteen, and, {{according}} {{to the laws of}} her race, a woman. I do not think the most romantic fancy would have called her pretty. Her complexion defied most of those ambiguous similes through which poets unconsciously apologize for any deviation from the Caucasian standard. It was not wine nor amber colored; if anything, it was smoky. Her face was tattooed with red and white lines on one cheek, as if a duo-toothed comb had been drawn from cheek-bone to jaw, and, but for the good-humor that beamed from her small berry-like eyes and shone in her white teeth, would have been repulsive. She was short and stout. In her scant drapery and unrestrained freedom she was hardly statuesque, and her more unstudied attitudes were marred by a simian habit of softly scratching her left ankle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> her right foot, in moments of contemplation.|$|R
60|$|At 10:30 o'clock old man Ballinger {{came out}} of his house in his {{stocking}} feet and leaned over the gate, smoking his pipe. He looked down the big road, white in the moonshine, and rubbed one ankle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his other foot. It was time for the Fredericksburg mail to come pattering up the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{certainly}} did. There are no tracks besides their own, {{and each}} is powder-burned." [...] Smoke dragged the corpse {{to one side}} and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his moccasin nosed a revolver out of the snow into which it had been pressed by the body. [...] "That's what did the work. I told you we'd find something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{get out of}} here," [...] and {{he grabbed}} Rokoff and Paulvitch each by the scruff of the neck and thrust them {{forcibly}} through the doorway, giving each an added impetus down the corridor <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> his boot. Then {{he turned back to}} the stateroom and the girl. She was looking at him in wide-eyed astonishment.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} {{in order to test}} the possibility wheather a single whole body vibration (WBV) session will produce human skeletal muscle response. In 6 female volleyball players movement velocity, muscle force and power were recorded when they performed maximal leg press exercises with extra load of 70, 90, 110 and 130 kg. The testing took place before and after a 10 -min WBV exposure. During WBV subjects were in <b>the</b> standing position <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> one leg on the vibration platform (E leg) while the other leg (C leg) was risen from the ground. WBV ind ced statistically (P<O. O 5) significant improvement of the movement velocity, muscle force and power. In result-, the velocity-force and power-force curve were shifted to the right. C leg failed to show changes in studied mechanical variables after the WBV session. In conclusion, the acute effect of a short term WBV on neuromuscular apparatus is expressed by improved movement velocity, muscle force and power in performing leg press exercise with external loads. ...|$|R
5000|$|Bell {{boots are}} usually worn to prevent {{overreaching}} (when the horse [...] "grabs" [...] his front heels <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> his back feet, resulting in injury), {{or if the}} horse is wearing shoe studs, {{to protect him from}} accidentally injuring himself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> stud of the opposing hoof. In some cases a horse with corrective or poor shoeing wears shoes that protrude behind the foot, making it easier for a horse to overreach and spring or completely pull off the shoe. This is most commonly seen when the horse is jumping, working in mud or on a slippery surface, running cross-country, or longeing, and bell boots can help prevent this from occurring. Bell boots are occasionally worn when shipping a horse, if the bandages or boots used do not provide protection to the heel region, or if a horse tends to pull his front shoes by stepping on them with his back feet. Bell boots are also sometimes used when the horse is turned out, for extra protection or to help prevent him from accidentally pulling a shoe if he is especially exuberant while playing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{appellation}} [...] "Mafeking Mooch" [...] {{was first}} coined by the journalist Arthur P. Montague in a scathing article about degeneracy and fecklessness {{published in the}} Pall Mall Gazette in June 1905. Montague documented a notable distinction between men of different classes {{as to how the}} Mafeking Mooch was performed. He noted that working class men affected a limp <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right foot pointing inward, whereas middle and upper-class men pointed their toes outward. Montague was outraged at the notion that perfectly healthy men would have the audacity to pretend that they had served His Majesty and pretend that they had been injured to win respect, sympathy and the possible affections of a young woman. The phenomenon of the Mafeking Mooch added to the already considerable national anguish caused by the Boer War. Although Britain ultimately triumphed over the Boer republics, the country's perceived military might {{have been shown to be}} wanting in the face of the nimble and determined Boer fighters. Ironically, Britain’s war effort had been hampered because up to 40 percent of British recruits were unfit for military service, suffering from medical problems such as rickets and other poverty-related illnesses.|$|R
