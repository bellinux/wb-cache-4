2500|$|... "The [...] {{directors}} of Northern Rock were the principal {{authors of the}} difficulties {{that the company has}} faced since August 2007. It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on liquidity support from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding</b> and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Wholesale</b> <b>funding</b> {{providers}} are generally sensitive {{to changes in}} the credit risk profile of the institutions to which they provide these funds and to the interest rate environment. For instance, such providers closely track the institution's financial condition and may be likely to curtail such funding if other investment opportunities offer more attractive interest rates. As a result, an institution may experience liquidity problems due to lack of <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding</b> availability when needed. Academic research suggests that the use of <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding</b> was one of the major determinants of bank vulnerability during the 2007-2010 financial crisis.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} the often-overlooked managed fund fee that is incurred when investors enter and exit managed fund products. The present paper documents that transaction costs for investors, {{measured by the}} application-redemption spread, are above stock market brokerage rates although they have declined since 1995. The study analyses the relationship between this transaction fee and several variables. In summary, retail fund transaction costs are positively related to retail funds' assets under management, whilst this relationship is negative for larger <b>wholesale</b> <b>funds,</b> consistent with economies of scale. Direct entry and exit fees and initial commissions are positively related to transaction costs which {{raises the possibility that}} the commissions are used to levy soft-dollar payments. The paper also documents a relationship between transaction costs and fund flows which differs between retail and <b>wholesale</b> <b>funds.</b> Overall, the findings are consistent with the proposition that the various fees are used by managers as interchangeable and the different fee regimes reflect different products and markets.

40|$|We {{find that}} Australian mutual fund investors should avoid high fee funds as these funds {{generate}} relatively low after-fee risk-adjusted returns both unconditionally and in weak economic conditions. This result {{is different from}} some of the previous findings which showed that US mutual funds with relatively high expense ratios may generate relatively higher risk-adjusted returns during recessions relative to non-recessions, although their unconditional alphas may be negative. We find some support for the Glode hypothesis in surviving Australian <b>wholesale</b> <b>funds.</b> High-fee surviving Australian <b>wholesale</b> <b>funds</b> perform relatively strongly in both weak economic conditions and unconditionally. High-fee funds in other types of Australian mutual funds generally do not perform strongly either in weak economic conditions or unconditionally. Amongst low-fee funds, we commonly find that those that perform well unconditionally and well in weak economic conditions do charge more than those that perform well unconditionally and poorly in weak economic conditions. Amongst low-fee funds, it is often true that those that perform poorly unconditionally but well in weak economic conditions can charge more than those that perform poorly unconditionally and poorly in weak economic conditions.

In December 2012 the European Commission's State Aid Scoreboard revealed a new figure saying the volume of national support to the financial sector between October 2008 and 31 December 2011 amounted to around 1.6 trillion euros (13% of EU GDP), two-thirds of which {{came in the form of}} State guarantees on banks' <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding.</b>|$|E
50|$|During the {{financial}} crisis of 2007-2008, several banks, including the UK's Northern Rock and the U.S. investment banks Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, suffered a liquidity crisis, due to their over-reliance on short-term <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding</b> from the interbank lending market. As a result, the G20 launched an overhaul of banking regulation known as Basel III. In addition to changes in capital requirements, Basel III also contains two entirely new liquidity requirements: the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued its final Net Stable Funding Ratio (it was initially proposed in 2010 and re-proposed in January 2014).|$|E
40|$|The {{announcement}} of BCCI's closure on 5 July 1991 rapidly accelerated {{the withdrawal of}} <b>wholesale</b> <b>funds</b> from small and medium-sized UK banks. Within three years, {{a quarter of the}} banks in this sector had, in some sense, failed. This study employs a logit model to analyse at two points prior to the crisis the distinct characteristics of the banks that failed compared with those that survived. Perhaps not surprisingly, a number of measures of bank weakness - low loan growth, poor profitability and illiquidity - are found to be good short-term predictors of failure, as are a high dependence on net interest income and low leverage. The best longer-term leading indicator of future failure, however, is rapid loan growth {{at the peak of the}} previous boom. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEmploying data on over 100 GCC {{banks for}} 1996 â€“ 2011, we test the {{relation}} between risk and capital. Given the interlinkage between these two variables, the model employs a 3 SLS estimation that takes on board this simultaneity. Consistent with the literature, risk isÂ measured by the Z-score, while capital is computed as the ratio of equity to asset. The findings indicate that banks generally increase capital {{in response to an}} increase in risk, and not vice versa. Second, there is an uneven impact of regulatory pressure and market disciplineÂ on banks attitude towardÂ risk and capital. Additionally, Islamic banks increased their capital as compared to conventional banks.

Hypothesising that fund ratings serve as a proxy for a fund's reputation, this article examines the managed fund inflow effect of the awarding of an initial rating by ASSIRT, Australia's largest fund rating agency. Retail equity funds record significant unexpected size changes at the announcement of the initial rating and over a one-year post-rating analysis period. <b>Wholesale</b> <b>fund</b> sizes take over six months to show the inflow effects of a ratings initiation. Cash and fixed interest funds exhibit volatile size changes whose pattern does not bear a significant relationship to the initial rating phenomenon. Finally, fund management expense ratios remain stable after the rating...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the seizing up of interbank lending is that banks were hoarding liquidity in anticipation of future shortages. Two modern features of the financial industry suggest this hypothesis is not implausible. First, banks have come to rely much less on deposits as a source of funds and more on short-term <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding</b> (brokered CDs, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), interbank repurchase agreements, etc.). Many of these markets came under stress during the early phase of the crisis, particularly the ABCP market. This meant banks had fewer sources of funds to turn to, although an increase in retail deposits over this period provided some offset.|$|E
50|$|DHB Bankâ€™s {{activities}} are anchored in traditional commercial banking, {{based primarily on}} retail funding (and <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding</b> to a certain extent) and mainly wholesale asset generation (again relatively small retail asset generation). DHB Bankâ€™s business model and revenue stream fully rely on real banking transactions, {{and there is no}} reliance on any kind of speculative income. Therefore, the bank tries to minimize the market risk by avoiding FX position or interest rate position, and derivative transactions are mainly done for assets and liabilities hedging purposes. Against the backdrop of its mission statement and vision statement, the bank conducts its activities through the executional authorities and responsibilities of the Managing Board (MB), {{under the supervision of the}} Supervisory Board (SB), and cascades these down throughout the organization founded on different building blocks (i.e. departments and functions).|$|E
50|$|The third {{contributor}} to RBS's problems was its liquidity position. From a position around 2002 where {{the bank was}} essentially 'fully funded' (i.e. was funding its lending positions fully from deposits gathered from customers), the rapid growth in lending within the GBM (Global Banking and Markets) division led to a reliance on external <b>wholesale</b> <b>funding.</b> The combination of this, along with the weak equity capital position, and the massive exposure to losses on CDOs via Greenwich, were the factors that destroyed RBS. The bank experienced severe financial problems, and attempted to shore up its balance sheet with a Â£12 billion share issue in April 2008, {{one of the largest}} in UK corporate history. The attempt to raise an additional Â£7 billion capital by selling off insurers Churchill and Direct Line failed due to lack of interest in the context of the global liquidity crisis. RBS was forced in October 2008 to rely on a UK Government bank rescue package to support a shareholder recapitalisation of the bank, which resulted in the government owning a majority of the shares.
