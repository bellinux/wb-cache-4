60|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> She {{was looking}} fixedly {{into one of}} the corners of the room.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{gradually}} the heaviness {{of her heart}} pressed and pressed into consciousness. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> Was she bearing a child? Bearing a child? To what? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Handsome and young!" [...] The judge's eyes {{took on a}} musing expression. [...] "Well, well! that {{accounts}} for much. But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{up there in the}} company of that old Dutchman?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2009 Writers' Guild Award for Best Book ( [...] <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>She</b> <b>Doing</b> Here) ...|$|R
6000|$|He saw Valentine's smile, {{and broke}} off abruptly. [...] "Anyway, it doesn't {{matter in the}} least to either of us. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here, and who are the others?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes... Dear me! Arabella not in {{the depths}} of London, but down here! It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Something I {{had been}} dimly {{conscious}} {{of at the}} back of my brain came forward and stood before me: the flabby figure of Miss Rosina Sellars. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here? What right had she to step between me and my regeneration? ...|$|E
60|$|But {{who was she}} {{to affirm}} it? And <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> with {{unsatisfied}} desires? She was ashamed. She ignored them and left them out of count as much as possible, her underneath yearnings. They angered her. She {{wanted to be like}} other people, decently satisfied.|$|E
6000|$|To-morrow {{there would}} be several hundred dollars more, {{and the next day}} more, and so on always, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing,</b> or what had she planned to do, to give proper {{direction}} to these tidal waves of wealth? She had bought a new dish-pan and ordered a door repaired! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you know}} the girl? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> now?" [...] asked Miss Ellery, who had lost {{a part of the}} story as she sat in a shadowy nook with the pensive Fred.|$|R
60|$|Before Lemuel knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she</b> {{flew out}} of the door, and {{he could hear her}} flying down the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I want," [...] I replied, [...] "is to {{know how}} Sylvia <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing,</b> all about her. I do not even know that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> still there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have hit}} it!" [...] cried Miserrimus Dexter. [...] "You are a {{wonderful}} woman! <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{on the morning}} of the day when Mrs. Eustace Macallan died poisoned? And where was she during the dark hours of the night? I can tell you where she was not--she was not in her own room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] Hendricks demanded. [...] "What are {{you looking}} for? Is {{something}} coming?" [...] He shook his head, trying to understand. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> What was she waiting for? He could see nothing. Ash lay all around them, ash and ruins. Occasional stark tree trunks, without leaves or branches. [...] "What--" ...|$|E
60|$|Why did she not speak? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> If she had but {{uttered a}} single word of protest, of angry dismissal, Paul would have flown to her side. It could not be the {{paralysis}} of personal fear: the balcony was wide; she could easily pass to the end; she could even see his open window.|$|E
50|$|Elena {{comes home}} and finds Damon {{on his way}} out. The two {{of them have a}} talk with Damon opening up and thanking her for saving him today. They end up kissing when Jenna (Sara Canning) opens the door and sees them. Jenna orders Elena to come inside and she closes the door behind her asking Elena <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> but Elena does not want to talk about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> in Paris--at {{least that}} <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> came to <b>do,</b> but the siege {{put a stop}} to her studies, and she devoted herself to the much more {{practical}} work of nursing the wounded." ...|$|R
6000|$|Which held true for Winifred, too. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{not made}} to endure aloof. Her family tree was a robust {{vegetation}} {{that had to}} be stirring and believing. In one direction or another her life had to go. In her own home she had known nothing of this diffidence which she found in Egbert, and which she could not understand, and which threw her into such dismay. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to <b>do,</b> in face of this terrible diffidence? ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} queer. Old Granny Fox {{sat down to}} think who would dare steal {{anything}} from her. Then she walked in a big circle with her nose to the ground, sniffing and sniffing. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> that for? Why, {{to see if she}} could find the tracks of anyone who might have stolen her chicken.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, you see, {{this woman}} was {{undoubtedly}} in that house {{on the night of}} the fire. She escaped, and in a mighty hurry too, for she had not time to change her slippers for shoes; she escaped on horseback, for that is how she lost them. Now <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there with those rascals, for the face I saw looked as innocent as a saint's." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> now, he wondered, as he {{addressed}} the envelope to his wife. He could not control the telephone. He could not play the spy. She might be making any arrangements she chose. Yet the thought did not disturb him {{so much as the}} strange, unpleasant, illicit atmosphere of the whole scene with the young people the night before. His sense of discomfort was almost physical.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sylvia! <b>What</b> <b>is</b> it? Who <b>is</b> it? <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> to you?" [...] began Mary; {{but before}} the words were out of her mouth, the thing had flown at her neck, and pulled her down too; and the grasp and the {{clinging}} and the kisses told her long before she had room or eyes or voice to know the creature by. A sort of sobbing out of each name between them {{was all that was}} heard at first.|$|R
5000|$|... "“There {{are four}} edifying {{behavioural}} characteristics for women: {{the first is}} womanly virtue (fude), the second is womanly speech (fuyan), the third is womanly manner (fuyong), and the fourth is womanly merit (fugong).What <b>is</b> womanly virtue? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not distinguish herself in talent and intelligence. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> womanly speech? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not sharpen her language and speech. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> womanly manner? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not seek to be outwardly beautiful or ornamented. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> womanly merit? <b>She</b> <b>does</b> not outperform others in her skills and cleverness.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly heard <b>what</b> it <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> say," [...] said Harold Smith; [...] "so I {{could not}} answer her, you know. Something about Sundays, I believe." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{called out}} to him what she had come for, and he {{called out to}} her <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there; but of course neither of them {{understood}} the other's language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this was such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the voice}} ceased, and a woman's figure {{came forward to}} the window, and stood motionless, gazing upward at the {{spangled}} star-world overhead, and seeming to drink in the glory, and the silence, and the rich perfume.... Could it be she? Every pulse in his body throbbed madly.... Could it be? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> He could not distinguish the features; but the full blaze of the eastern moon showed him an upturned brow, between a golden stream of glittering tresses which hid her whole figure, except the white hands clasped upon her bosom.... Was she praying? were these her midnight sorceries?....|$|E
6000|$|The editor {{knew there}} was little doubt of this, {{and for an instant}} {{believed}} it his duty to put the matter {{in the hands of the}} police. Richards was too good and brave a man to be risked in a bar-room fight. But reflecting that this might precipitate the scandal he wished to avoid, he concluded to make some personal investigation. A stronger curiosity than he had felt before was possessing him. It was singular, too, that Richards's description of the girl was that of a different and superior type--the hidalgo, or fair-skinned Spanish settler. If this was true, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there--and what were her relations to the Ramierez? ...|$|E
60|$|As for the shoe, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to <b>do</b> {{with one}} poor little tootsey sandal? The string was still to it, so she hung it round her neck.|$|R
50|$|An {{incident}} occurred after an officer encountered her sitting {{against a tree}} trunk in the backwoods of Marin County drinking wine, eating bread, and reading poetry. When the officer asked <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she</b> gave a sarcastic response {{as a result of}} which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> arrested and imprisoned.|$|R
6000|$|They parted, Farfrae {{returning}} {{into the}} dark Bowling Walk, and Elizabeth-Jane going up the street. Without any consciousness of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>she</b> started running with all her might till she reached her father's door. [...] "O dear me--what am I at?" [...] she thought, as she pulled up breathless.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> at a concert, {{when she}} {{ought to have been}} on her way to her aunt's house? Why, if she must faint when the hot room had not {{overpowered}} anyone else, had she failed to recover in the usual way? There she lay on the sofa, alternately flushing and turning pale when she was spoken to; ill at ease in the most comfortable house in London; timid and confused under the care of her best friends. Making all allowance for a sensitive temperament, could a long journey from Italy, and a childish fright at seeing a dog run over, account for such a state of things as this? ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had reached}} the point where the {{mountain}} track entered the Santa Clara turnpike when his attention was attracted by a handsome but old-fashioned carriage drawn by four white mules, which passed down the road before him and turned suddenly off into a private road. But it was not this picturesque gala equipage of some local Spanish grandee that brought a thrill to his nerves and a flash to his eye; it was the unmistakable, tall, elegant figure and handsome profile of Clementina, reclining in light gauzy wraps against the back seat! It was no fanciful resemblance, the outcome of his reverie,--there never was any one like her!--it WAS she herself! But <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here? ...|$|E
6000|$|The couple {{lay awake}} {{the most of}} the night, Mary happy and busy, Edward busy, but not so happy. Mary was {{planning}} what she would do with the money. Edward was trying to recall that service. At first his conscience was sore on account of the lie he had told Mary--if it was a lie. After much reflection--suppose it WAS a lie? What then? Was it such a great matter? Aren't we always ACTING lies? Then why not tell them? Look at Mary--look what she had done. While he was hurrying off on his honest errand, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> Lamenting because the papers hadn't been destroyed and the money kept. Is theft better than lying? ...|$|E
50|$|In the anime, VesVes {{can appear}} to lack {{a sense of}} reality, rushing into things without realizing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> not as picky about her targets as the other three. She tends to command lemures that are animal-themed. VesVes has the most {{appearances}} in the anime out of the four.|$|R
5000|$|Although <b>she</b> loved <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she</b> {{longed to}} make a bigger impact on the world. To fulfill her dream, she decided to make films that would help people living in {{developing}} countries become educated on various health subjects. She took film-making courses at Stanford but found herself disappointed with the classes.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to <b>do?</b> Drag {{the woman}} {{back to life}} against her will--lead {{her back to him}} to be a chain about his feet until the end? Then leave him to fight the battle alone? ...|$|R
