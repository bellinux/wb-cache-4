500|$|Because of {{his many}} {{absences}} from home, on parliamentary and other business, Richard Cobden was a somewhat remote figure to his daughters, although his letters indicate that he felt warmly towards them and that he wished to direct their political education. In later years they would all acknowledge his influence over their ideas. Both parents impressed on the girls their responsibilities for the poor in the local community; Jane Cobden's 1864 diary records visits to homes and workhouses. She and her younger sister Anne, at the ages of 12 and 10 respectively, taught classes in the local village school. [...] The girls were encouraged by their father to contribute what money they possessed to relieve local poverty: [...] "Do not keep the money... as you have now made up your minds {{to give it to}} poor sufferers, let your own neighbours have it. Your Mama <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to dispose of it, and tell me all about it".|$|E

2500|$|McCarver was {{not immune}} to {{criticism}} from outside sources, either, as Norman Chad wrote a critique of him in Sports Illustrated during the postseason. Chad said that McCarver was someone who [...] "when you ask him the time, <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> a watch works", a reference to McCarver's perceived tendency to overanalyze things. Chad went further by saying [...] "What's the difference between Tim McCarver and appendicitis? Appendicitis is covered by most health plans." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, Histiaeus never {{succeeded in}} {{reaching}} Miletus, either. Reporting first to Sardis, undoubtedly {{still recovering from}} fire, whether {{with or without the}} Great King's complicity (Herodotus does not say), he was interrogated concerning his true loyalties. Histiaeus swore complete ignorance of the events of the revolt and unquestionable loyalty to the Persians. He admitted nothing, but the satrap, Artaphernes, was not in the least deceived. He said, [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>thee</b> <b>how</b> the case stands, Histaeus: this shoe is of thy stitching; Aristagoras has but put it on.|$|R
2500|$|During the Apollo 13 crisis, Greene {{played a}} less major role. Unlike many other flight controllers, most notably Gene Kranz, {{he was not}} {{positive}} about the astronauts' chance of survival. [...] "A lot of them in retrospect <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> macho and cool ," [...] {{he said in an}} interview some years later, [...] "but it was pretty grim." [...] Greene later stated that [...] "when they opened up that capsule, I was sure all they would find would be three dead bodies. I honestly didn't see how we could get them home." ...|$|E
2500|$|This melancholy song has {{fairly simple}} lyrics. Journalist Benoît Cachin {{said in this}} song, [...] "Farmer pays tribute to the words which have enabled her to write her songs, which are also used to express her love". About the song, French {{magazine}} Instant-mag made the following analysis: [...] "On an air melody and worthy flights of Boutonnat, the two voices, paradoxical but complementary, tell us the difficulty communicating and the immense power of words. Where the beautiful voice of Farmer will force up to the break, that of Seal evokes a quiet and sensual strength". One of the verses of [...] "Les Mots" [...] ("And to lives that stoop to notice mine", sung by Seal) resumed the first verse of the Farmer's song [...] "Nous souviendrons-nous" [...] ("Aux vies qui s'abaissent à voir la mienne") which is on her third studio album L'Autre.... The work by Emily Dickinson was also {{a source of inspiration}} for the song. Indeed, the phrase [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> the sun rose", sung by Seal, is the title of her poem No. 318.|$|E
