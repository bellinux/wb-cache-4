5|$|During an 11-month {{period of}} {{blindness}} in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming {{under the influence}} of the Theosophical Society, resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate Runology and the Armanen Futharkh. The popularity of his <b>work</b> <b>among</b> the völkisch and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.|$|E
50|$|Törnquist was {{the longest}} serving missionary of the Swedish Missionary Society in Chinese Turkestan. For long periods {{he was the only}} one in the field working {{specifically}} among the Chinese. The Xinjiang missionaries from Sweden who <b>worked</b> <b>among</b> Chinese weren't very many. Most of them <b>worked</b> <b>among</b> the Uyghurs. Albert Andersson and his wife <b>worked</b> <b>among</b> the Chinese from 1903 to 1912, Carl Persson in the 1920s, Ellen Törnquist from 1905 to 1923, Sigrid Larsson during the late 1920s. John Törnquist served from 1904 to 1937.|$|R

5|$|In 1817, the General Assembly {{joined with}} two other Reformed denominations, the American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church (now the Reformed Church in America) and the Associate Reformed Church, to form the United Foreign Missionary Society. The United Society was {{particularly}} focused on <b>work</b> <b>among</b> Native Americans and inhabitants of Central and South America. These denominations also established a United Domestic Missionary Society to station missionaries within the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} Scots Presbyterian minister, Lang {{abandoned}} {{the prospect of a}} legal and political career to train for the Anglican priesthood. Beginning in 1890, his early ministry was served in slum parishes in Leeds and Portsmouth, except for brief service as an Oxford college chaplain. In 1901 he was appointed suffragan Bishop of Stepney in London, where he continued his <b>work</b> <b>among</b> the poor. He also served as a canon of St Paul's Cathedral, London.|$|E
5|$|While {{blacks were}} {{excluded}} from the AG until the 1960s, the denomination's <b>work</b> <b>among</b> Spanish-speaking people has a long history, first sanctioned explicitly in 1918. Hispanic outreach became independent of the Foreign Missions Department in 1929 when the first Latin American District was established. By the end of World War II, the AG's Latin American constituency formed the largest Protestant presence among Hispanics in the United States. The AG also focused on major European immigrant populations, but as later generations assimilated into American culture, these separate European segments were absorbed into the regular geographic districts.|$|E

5|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} Barbara Metcalf, in TJ women were {{encouraged}} to participate {{since the beginning of}} the movement. Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first jamaat of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi. Accompanied by a close male relative, (محرم), that is husband, brother, father or son, women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and <b>work</b> <b>among</b> other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands. Jamaats of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.|$|E
5|$|Doris {{travelled}} to Egypt {{to visit}} her husband in March 1917. By June, Rupert was becoming increasingly immersed in preparations for the Third Battle of Gaza and Doris, who had become pregnant during her visit, decided to return home. On her return journey to Australia in June 1917, her ship, the P liner Mongolia struck a mine and was sunk in the Indian Ocean {{with the loss of}} 23 lives. Doris spent 11 hours in a crowded lifeboat, before being rescued by a passing steamer, which took her to Bombay. From there she eventually made her way back to Australia via Singapore and Batavia. In 1918 Doris was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for her volunteer <b>work</b> <b>among</b> soldiers' families as secretary of the Friendly Union of Soldiers' Wives and Mothers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Maggie spells EMCSQU with her blocks, a {{reference}} to Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation. A picture of Einstein also appears {{on the wall of}} Dr. Pryor's office. At one point Homer erroneously refers to Einstein as the inventor of the light bulb. Dr. Pryor compares Bart's proposed <b>work</b> <b>among</b> ordinary children to Jane Goodall's study of chimpanzees. Goodall was pleased to be mentioned in the episode, sending the program a letter, and Vitti an autographed copy of her book. The conductor of the opera the family attends is named Boris Csupowski, {{a reference to}} animator Gabor Csupo. The opera attended by the family is Carmen, by French composer Georges Bizet; the song that Bart mocks is a famous aria called the Toreador Song. Students at the gifted school have lunchboxes that feature images of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited and chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.|$|E

5|$|Saint and Elliot {{returned}} to Ecuador to <b>work</b> <b>among</b> the Huaorani (1958-1960), establishing a camp called Tihueno near a former Huaorani settlement. Rachel Saint and Dayuma became bonded in Huaorani eyes through their shared mourning and Rachel's adoption as a sister of Dayuma, taking the name Nemo from the latter's deceased youngest sister. The first Huaorani to settle there were primarily {{women and children}} from a Huaorani group called the Guiquetairi, but in 1968 an enemy Huaorani band known as the Baihuari joined them. Elliot had {{returned to}} the United States in the early 1960s, so Saint and Dayuma worked to alleviate the resulting conflict. They succeeded in securing cohabitation of the two groups by overseeing numerous cross-band weddings, leading to an end of inter-clan warfare but obscuring the cultural identity of each group.|$|E
5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This <b>work,</b> <b>among</b> other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even interpolated Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaders of}} the newly {{organized}} denomination (1863) living in Battle Creek, Michigan, did not consider <b>work</b> <b>among</b> the French in Quebec a high priority. And, the Vermont Conference had limited`financial resources. They couldn't afford to support both brothers in ministry. Thus, Daniel Bourdeau worked in California from 1868 to 1870. Then he went to <b>work</b> <b>among</b> French immigrants in Illinois and Wisconsin until about 1873.|$|E
