25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Royal Canadian Air Force’s {{standard}} elementary training aircraft was the de Havilland DHC-1 Chipmunk.

A decision was made by RCAF HQ to remove the DHC-1s from service and not replace them, as {{it was felt that}} the CT-114 was easy enough to fly that initial training was not needed. The CT-114 quickly developed a <b>wash-out</b> rate of near 95% amongst student jet pilots and it was clear that an elementary trainer was needed. Due to the RCAF’s previous customer relationship with Beechcraft while operating that company's Expeditor twin-engine aircraft, a hasty purchase of twenty-four B23 Musketeers was made in 1971. The first CT-134 arrived at CFB Portage la Prairie on March 23, 1971.|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately for Barnes, {{he broke}} his wrist while exercising on the sea voyage to England for the 1938 tour, keeping the injury secret until the {{tourists}} had departed Gibraltar, {{for fear of being}} sent home. On arrival in England, he therefore did not play an innings until the last day of June, missing exactly half of the 30first-class matches scheduled for the tour, including the first two Tests, both of which were drawn. His first innings was 42 against Derbyshire and he shared in a fourthwicket stand of 176 with Bill Brown, who made an unbeaten 265. The third Test was a <b>wash-out</b> and he was not picked for the fourth, which the Australians won, although in his autobiography he claimed that he was considered as a candidate to be wicketkeeper, having deputised for Ben Barnett in that role in tour matches against Warwickshire and Nottinghamshire. In the event, his Test début came in the final Test, played at The Oval. Barnes had to field for 16 hours as England amassed a total of 903for sevendeclared, then the highest Test score. Barnes bowled 38overs in the innings and took the seventh wicket, that of Arthur Wood, for 84runs. With both Don Bradman and Jack Fingleton injured and unable to bat, Australia struggled – England won by an innings and 579runs – still the largest winning margin in Test cricket history; but Barnes played innings of 41 and 33 and, according to Wisden, [...] "well justified his choice". In all first-class matches on the tour, Barnes scored 720runs, and reached 90 three times, though without going on to a first-class century. He scored 140 in a two-day match against Durham, which was not considered first-class.|$|E

40|$|The {{genetics}} of {{the early}} interferon response of mouse peritoneal cells to infection with herpes implex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) was studied in susceptible BALB/c and more resistant C 57 BL/ 6 mice and in reciprocal crosses between these mice. <b>Wash-outs</b> of the peritoneal cavity of normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice contained significantly more cells than <b>wash-outs</b> from BALB/c mice. Therefore, interferon induction with HSV- 2 was studied under standardized conditions in vitro. Peritoneal cells reacted to HSV- 2 infection by interferon production in a virus dose-dependent manner. Interferon was detected first after 2 h and peaked after 24 h. Cells from C 57 BL/ 6 mice of each sex produced significantly more early interferon than cells from BALB/c mice, and cells from female BALB/c mice produced more interferon than cells from males. This difference was not seen with C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Cultures of highly purified adherent cells yielded approximately 10 times as much interferon as cultures of non-adherent cells. Since treatment of cells with carbonyl iron and silica significantly reduced the amount of interferon produced, whereas 2000 rad of irradiation had no obvious effect, it is concluded that the main interferon-producing cellin the peritoneal cavity of mice i...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in {{inflamed}} synovium is oxidized and taken-up by synoviocytes. In this study, {{we investigate}} whether direct injection of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) into a normal murine knee joint induces joint pathology and whether synovial macrophages {{are involved in}} that process. DESIGN: Synovium was obtained from end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) patients in order to analyze LDL-uptake. Murine knee joints were injected five consecutive days with oxLDL, LDL, or vehicle (phosphate buffered saline (PBS)). This procedure was repeated in mice depleted of synovial macrophages by intra-articular injection of clodronate liposomes 7 days prior to the consecutive injections. Joint pathology was investigated by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry (FCM) and synovial RNA expression and protein production. RESULTS: Synovial tissue of OA patients showed extensive accumulation of apolipoprotein B. Multiple injections of oxLDL in murine knee joints significantly increased TGF-beta activity in synovial <b>wash-outs,</b> but did not induce catabolic or inflammatory processes. In contrast, repeated injections of oxLDL in macrophage-depleted knee joints led to increased synovial thickening in combination with significantly upregulated protein and RNA levels of CCL 2 and CCL 3. FCM-analyses revealed increased presence of monocytes and neutrophils in the synovium, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Also protein levels of S 100 A 8 /A 9 were significantly increased in synovial <b>wash-outs</b> of oxLDL-injected joints, as was expression of aggrecanase-induced neo-epitopes. Interestingly, no raise in TGF-beta concentrations was measured in macrophage-depleted joints. CONCLUSIONS: OxLDL can affect joint pathology, since synovial macrophages promote anabolic processes after oxLDL injections. In absence of synovial macrophages, however, oxLDL induces production of pro-inflammatory mediators and aggrecanase activity combined with increased influx of monocytes and neutrophils...|$|R

There was, however, nothing to be seen but climbing trees, whose ragged spires rose one behind the other far up the steep hillside, and the fragrance the hot noon sun drew out from them mingled with the sharp smell of creosote from the ties.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA) is {{associated}} with the metabolic syndrome, however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated whether low density lipoprotein (LDL) accumulation leads to increased LDL uptake by synovial macrophages and affects synovial activation, cartilage destruction and enthesophyte/osteophyte formation during experimental OA in mice. METHODS: LDL receptor deficient (LDLr-/-) mice and wild type (WT) controls received a cholesterol-rich or control diet for 120 days. Experimental OA was induced by intra-articular injection of collagenase twelve weeks after start of the diet. OA knee joints and synovial <b>wash-outs</b> were analyzed for OA-related changes. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages were stimulated with oxidized LDL (oxLDL), whereupon growth factor presence and gene expression were analyzed. RESULTS: A cholesterol-rich diet increased apolipoprotein B (ApoB) accumulation in synovial macrophages. Although increased LDL levels did not enhance thickening of the synovial lining, S 100 A 8 expression within macrophages was increased in WT mice after receiving a cholesterol-rich diet, reflecting an elevated activation status. Both a cholesterol-rich diet and LDLr deficiency had no effect on cartilage damage; in contrast, ectopic bone formation was increased within joint ligaments (fold increase 6. 7 and 6. 1, respectively). Moreover, increased osteophyte size was found at the margins of the tibial plateau (4. 4 fold increase after a cholesterol-rich diet and 5. 3 fold increase in LDLr-/- mice). Synovial <b>wash-outs</b> of LDLr-/- mice and supernatants of macrophages stimulated with oxLDL led to increased transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: LDL accumulation within synovial lining cells leads to increased activation of synovium and osteophyte formation in experimental OA. OxLDL uptake by macrophages activates growth factors of the TGF-superfamily...|$|R
