6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> work here?" [...] {{and now it}} was the pungy {{that went}} from his mind, leaving there only the great desire to {{accomplish}} the purpose for which he had come.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are modest," [...] {{the latter}} rejoined. [...] "Well, we cannot ask <b>what</b> you think <b>about</b> <b>our</b> fleet. Our gunboat, the Campeador, has stranded, and this only leaves us the tug." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'All these colonials tell you,' said {{an officer}} {{severely}} wounded at Elandslaagte, 'that the Boers only want one good thrashing to satisfy them. Don't you believe it. They mean going {{through with this}} to the end. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> Government?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Iron comes next," [...] Weavel persisted stolidly. [...] "That's {{been settled}} amongst ourselves. And as for your fifty-nine thousand, Borden, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> {{hundred and thirty}} thousand? We shall {{all have to be}} lending up here, too, to work this thing properly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall all {{do better}} in time," [...] said Mr. Jobson. [...] "But what I want to know is, what about the gravy? You can't eat it with a fork, and it don't say nothing about a spoon. Oh, and <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> cold tubs, mother?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Baptist {{supports}} replacing Andrew Jackson with Harriet Tubman on the United States twenty-dollar bill. When Howard Kittell, the CEO of the Andrew Jackson Foundation, {{claimed that}} the Indian Removal Act was [...] "within the mainstream thinking," [...] Baptist refuted that [...] "At the time, there were alternatives, there were congressmen who suggested alternatives. The Indian Removal Act was contested, {{there were lots of}} folks who opposed it." [...] He concluded, [...] "Harriet Tubman is <b>what's</b> good <b>about</b> America...Andrew Jackson is <b>what's</b> problematic <b>about</b> <b>our</b> history." ...|$|R

[...] "I am a loyal subject, and will listen to nothing said in disparagement of the Queen or of her Majesty's forces." ...|$|R
500|$|In June 2013, Paul {{criticized the}} NSA {{surveillance}} program and praised Edward Snowden for having performed a [...] "great {{service to the}} American people by exposing the truth <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> government is doing in secret".|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{long the}} frost {{will come and}} in the {{mountains}} the cold is pretty fierce. On Puget Sound the soft Chinook blows and the white Olympians stand {{between you and the}} winds from the Rockies. The old man's keen for me to bring you back. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> starting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> mines? I {{shall be}} candid with you. I shall [...] express an honest opinion, {{based upon a}} {{thorough}} examination. [...] Humboldt county is the richest mineral region upon God's footstool. [...] Each mountain range is gorged with the precious ores. Humboldt is [...] the true Golconda.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] Norgate assented. [...] "It might be our fair share on paper, {{and yet it}} might not be enough. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> navy if Antwerp, Ostend, Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, and Havre were all German ports, as they {{certainly}} would be in an unassisted conflict between the French and the Germans?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Norway's foreign {{minister}} Jonas Gahr Støre said in 2009, [...] "We {{have to be}} realistic <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> Ministry of Foreign Affairs can do". Representatives of the Ministry, including Thorleif Wangen (embassy secretary), observed the trials.|$|R
40|$|In this, {{the bicentennial}} of the Bill of Rights, {{it is worth}} talking not just <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> Constitution {{constitutes}} (i. e., our structure ofgovernment) but also <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it protects (i. e., the rights ofindividuals {{to be free from}} governmental interference and to be free to pursue self-fulfillment) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oah, it is nothing. Onlee I was at Simla {{when the}} wire came in <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> mutual friend {{said he had}} hidden, and old Creighton--' He looked to see how Kim would take this piece of audacity.|$|R
6000|$|The {{objection}} to this card is that locally {{they are so}} huddled up--three being in New England and two from a single State. I have considered this, and will not shrink from the responsibility. This, being done, leaves but five full missions undisposed of--Rome, China, Brazil, Peru, and Chili. And then what about Carl Schurz; or, in other words, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> German friends? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{we shall}} have had enough of it," [...] agreed Flossie, [...] "by the time we've paid up. There's no doubt of that. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> children? I've just left young Frank {{strutting}} {{all over the house}} and flourishing a paper knife. And the servants have had to bar the kitchen door to prevent his bursting in every five minutes and attacking them. What's he going to say when I tell him, later on, that his father and myself have had all the war we want, and have decided there shall be no more? The old folks have had their fun. Why shouldn't I have mine? That will be his argument." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sewell laughed. [...] "To be sure! We {{never have}} any idea how far our little candle throws its beams! I'm just here for the night, on my way from the {{mountains}} to the sea; I'm to be the 'supply' in a friend's pulpit at New Bedford; and I'm here quite alone in the house, scrambling a sermon together. But I'm so glad to see you! You're well, I hope? You're looking a little thin, but that's no harm. Do you enjoy your life with Mr. Corey? I was sure you would! When you come to know him, you will find him one of the best of men--kindly, thoughtful, and sympathetic. I've felt very comfortable about your being with him whenever I've thought of you, and you may be sure that I've thought of you often. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> friends of the St. Albans? Do you see Mrs. Harmon? You knew the Evanses had gone to Europe." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kenneth Maryboy {{went on to}} state, “With {{proposed}} budgetary cuts, it {{is important}} as tribal leaders that we are clear <b>about</b> <b>what</b> state programs we believe are most important to retain. It is also pertinent we are clear <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>our</b> goals are in terms of strengthening state and tribal relations.” ...|$|R
2500|$|... "What an absolutely, {{incredibly}} ludicrous {{stance and}} a greater example of double standards you'd never find. Everyone is shaking their heads, especially as it's {{in a country where}} they allow the FCUK billboards. ... I mean <b>what</b> is it <b>about</b> <b>our</b> campaign that they find offensive? I just don't understand it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] René exclaimed. [...] "Heaven {{protect me}} from that. Do you come, Cuthbert; {{none of us}} mind <b>what</b> you say <b>about</b> <b>our</b> pictures. Your criticisms do not hurt. One would no more think of being angry with you for using your knife than with a surgeon for {{performing}} an operation." ...|$|R

With such a {{name and}} such a mother to help her, and with all her good looks and accomplishments, sure, she can't fail of finding a man worthy of her. But from <b>what</b> I know <b>about</b> the daughters of this house, and <b>what</b> I imagine <b>about</b> <b>our</b> young cousin, I am certain that no happy match could be made between them." ...|$|R
40|$|What can psychology, {{understood}} as {{a study of the}} nature of mental phenomena, tell us about metaphysics, {{understood as}} an account of the nature of being and of the most general properties of the world?

40|$|A {{transaction}} is {{a control}} abstraction that lets programmers treat {{a sequence of}} operations as an atomic ("all-or-nothing") unit. This paper describes our progress on on-going work to extend SML with transactions. <b>What</b> is novel <b>about</b> <b>our</b> work on transactions is support for multi-threaded concurrent transactions. We use SML's modules facility to reflect explicitly orthogonal concepts heretofore inseparable in other transaction-based programming languages...|$|R

5000|$|Indeed: <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>our</b> Entscheidungsproblem {{algorithm}} itself?

5000|$|Despite the {{somewhat}} special treatment granted to Masarek in Treblinka, survivor accounts reveal Masarek's disturbed emotional health after {{learning of the}} deaths {{of his wife and}} unborn child.

6000|$|... "Reading them?" [...] she said, {{in answer}} to my query. [...] "Of course I'm reading them. I {{want to know what}} these clever people are thinking, even if I don't always agree with them, and you ought to read them too.
