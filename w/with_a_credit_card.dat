5|$|With Max Capricorn dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} highest authority, the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> preloaded with £1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E

25|$|Many of the membership-based {{systems are}} {{operated}} through public-private partnerships. Several European cities, including the French cities of Lyon and Paris {{as well as}} London, Barcelona, Stockholm and Oslo, have signed contracts with private advertising agencies (JCDecaux in Brussels, Lyon, Paris, Seville and Dublin; Clear Channel in Stockholm, Oslo, Barcelona, Antwerp, Perpignan and Zaragoza) which supply the city with thousands of bicycles free of charge (or for a minor fee). In return, the agencies are allowed to advertise both on the bikes themselves and in other select locations in the city. Some other programmes are not linked to an advertising deal (for example Smoove) and are financed {{as a part of}} public transportation scheme. These programmes attempt to reduce losses from theft by requiring users to purchase subscriptions <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> or debit card (this option requiring a large, temporary deposit) and by equipping the bike with complex anti-theft and bike maintenance sensors. If the bike is not returned within the subscription period, or returned with significant damage, the bike sharing operator withdraws money from the user's credit card account.|$|E
25|$|Looking for {{the murder}} site, a detective {{canvassing}} hotels heard about a man driving a blue Cadillac who cruised the area. Trying to track the man down with this information, women were located who led them, not to a hotel, but to a residence where a blue Cadillac was seen. The registration was obtained, and the car was registered to Shulman's brother. Trying to get information about the sleeping bag in which Bunting was found, detectives learned Sears was the only manufacturer. Sears was contacted {{to see if the}} brother had purchased one <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> Sears said the brother had no card, but pointed out that Shulman had a card. This was how police were initially pointed towards Shulman as a possible culprit. Women later identified him as the man cruising in the Cadillac, and cadaver dogs signaled the possibility of dead remains having been present in the Cadillac. Police searched Shulman's work place and found trace evidence matching that found on the body. Shulman was arrested on 6 April 1996. After interrogation, Shulman confessed to the three murders. (Shulman confessed to the earliest two murders at a later date.) A search of his room revealed hundreds of bloodstains scattered over almost every surface.|$|E

2500|$|Apple spent $2.5 million {{purchasing}} all 39 advertising {{pages in}} a special, post-election issue of Newsweek, {{and ran a}} [...] "Test Drive a Macintosh" [...] promotion, in which potential buyers <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card</b> could take home a Macintosh for 24 hours {{and return it to}} a dealer afterwards. While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US$1,995 to US$2,495 (about $5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010). The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year.

2500|$|In the United States, PayPal is {{licensed}} as a money transmitter, on a state-by-state basis. But {{state laws}} vary, as do their definitions of banks, narrow banks, money services businesses and money transmitters. [...] Although PayPal is not {{classified as a}} bank, the company is subject {{to some of the}} rules and regulations governing the financial industry including Regulation E consumer protections and the USA PATRIOT Act. The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from P2P payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card,</b> the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller.|$|E

2500|$|On the Australian Promo Tour, Snow Patrol's {{promoter}} Frontier Touring Co. {{employed a}} strict ticketing policy {{because of the}} shortage of tickets for the one-off show at the 1,350 capacity Metro Theatre. General sale tickets were available through phone, website, or the venue box office one day before the event (18 November) from 9am and could only be purchased <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> <b>card.</b> One card holder could only buy two tickets, and the system was designed such that it'd reject attempts of subsequent bookings that bore the same e-mail, phone number or address. The buyer received a confirmation number {{at the time of}} booking and not the physical ticket itself. There were other ways of obtaining tickets too. Snow Patrol's official website held a small competition for members where ten pairs of tickets were up for grabs. Universal Music Australia also ran a competition for fans where they had to buy the album or the single [...] "Take Back the City" [...] from iTunes or JB Hi-Fi and write in telling a reason why they needed to see the band. Winners received tickets for front row and centre. On 19 November, 12pm (the day of the concert), wristbands were made available at the venue. To obtain the bands, a photo ID, the credit card used for purchase and the confirmation number were required. The ticket purchaser and a friend had to arrive together with all proof to be wristbanded. As the show was for people in the 18+ year old bracket, a photo ID was necessary to ensure the attendee was old enough. The tickets were priced at $66 and were non-exchangeable nor transferable. Anyone with a tampered wristband was refused entry.|$|E
