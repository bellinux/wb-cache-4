5|$|A {{small number}} of copies of Ashen were sent to various people. Marty Rytkonen, of Bindrune Recordings, {{was the only person}} {{attached}} to a record label to receive one, and Celestiial was then taken on by Bindrune. Anderson <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with this, as he had been an avid reader of Worm Gear (a magazine attached to the label) when he was younger. Despite the fact that Anderson had not written Desolate North with the intention of it ever being released, in 2006, it was released by Bindrune Recordings. The CD version released by Bindrune Recordings is now out of print. However, in 2011, the album was rereleased in vinyl LP format by Handmade Birds, and the album remains available in digital format.|$|E

After eight months, BESCO agreed to cut wages by only 18 percent, an agreement neither side <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> with.|$|E
