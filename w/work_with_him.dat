5|$|Ghosh {{went against}} the {{expectations}} of casting a popular actor from Bollywood. He signed Bengali actor Abir Chatterjee to play Vidya's husband. According to Ghosh, popular Bollywood actors were not willing to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> after his two previous flops. He also believed that audience might expect more screen-time from a better-known actor. Several other Bengali film and television actors, such as Indraneil Sengupta and Kharaj Mukherjee, were cast in supporting roles.|$|E
5|$|In this episode, ex-government {{agent and}} FBI Most Wanted {{fugitive}} Raymond Reddington (James Spader) turns himself {{in to the}} FBI and offers to give up information about the criminals he has worked with in exchange for sole communication with FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone).

5|$|Stephen Baldwin as Michael McManus. The actor {{was tired}} of doing {{independent}} films where his expectations were not met; when he met with director Bryan Singer, he went into a 15-minute tirade telling him {{what it was like}} to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> After Baldwin was finished, Singer told him exactly what he expected and wanted, which impressed the actor.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved {{and asked if she}} would ever get the chance to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, they agreed to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production before the show moved to Broadway.|$|E

Wareing joined Gordon Ramsay's Aubergine when it opened in 1993, where he became Sous Chef behind Head Chef Ramsay and would go on to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{over the course of the}} following 15 years, which led to Wareing being called Ramsay's protégé.

5|$|In {{the early}} years of World War II between 1939 and 1941, Wigner led the Princeton group in a series of {{experiments}} involving uranium and two tons of graphite as a neutron moderator. In early 1942, Arthur Compton concentrated the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design, including Wigner's team from Princeton, at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. The name was a codename; Creutz was the first to conduct actual metallurgy research, and he hired its first metallurgist to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Norman was {{introduced}} to his father's trade {{at an early age}} and left school to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> when he was 12.

5|$|Once MC Serch {{assumed the}} role of {{executive}} producer for Nas' debut project, he attempted to connect Nas with various producers. Based on his buzz at the time, numerous New York-based producers were eager to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and went to Power House Studios with Nas. Among those producers was DJ Premier, recognized at the time for his raw, aggressive production with jazz-based samples and heavy scratching, and for his work with rapper Guru as a part of hip-hop duo Gang Starr. After his production on Lord Finesse & DJ Mike Smooth's Funky Technician (1990) and Jeru the Damaja's The Sun Rises in the East (1994), Premier began recording exclusively at D Studios in New York City, before working with Nas on Illmatic.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in New York over 23 days in March 2014. Most of the film was shot in a townhouse on West 162nd Street in Manhattan. Some scenes were filmed in an apartment building in Yonkers and a senior's home in Hastings-on-Hudson. The film was shot by French cinematographer Denis Lenoir, whom Glatzer and Westmoreland had met at a film screening in 1999; they had wanted to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> ever since. During filming, Glatzer and Westmoreland attempted to divide the directing duties equally between themselves, even though Glatzer's physical condition had deteriorated {{to the point that}} he could only communicate by typing on an iPad with a single finger.|$|E
5|$|Roman forces Sullivan to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{in finding}} the treasure. Despite {{numerous}} warnings that the treasure and the island are haunted, Roman continues to use his men {{in search of the}} treasure. Roman captures Fisher, but Drake and Sullivan catch up to him, {{just in time to see}} Roman about to leave with the statue. However, Navarro tells Roman the real treasure is inside the statue. Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman does, he is cursed and zombified. Apparently angered at this betrayal, Roman savagely charges towards Navarro, who shoots Roman in the head and reveals to Drake that he intended to sell the statue as a weapon the whole time.|$|E

5|$|Siva is Nagarjuna's 17th film as an actor. Varma {{found him}} the only actor who could {{understand}} his perspective. Nagarjuna and Varma had discussed astronomy and realised that they shared similar sensibilities. That, and Varma's passion for and dedication to films, prompted Nagarjuna to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Amala, {{who worked with}} Nagarjuna in Prema Yuddham (1990), {{was chosen as the}} female lead. Siva was the first film in her career where the script was explained shot by shot. When Varma approached Rohini to dub Amala's portions, she agreed to dub for Amala only after watching about three reels of footage.|$|E
5|$|The Board of Supervisors met in {{a special}} session {{at the end of}} June 1939 and Middleton was {{directed}} to take over the business management of the university. The school's finances were in a state of chaos, and it would take effort and time to dig out of the mess. The dean of the Law School, Paul M. Hebert, became the acting president, and Middleton became acting vice president and comptroller. Middleton chose two accounting professors, Dr. Daniel Borth and Dr. Mack Hornbeak, to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and a New York firm was hired to come in and establish sound business procedures.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to <b>work</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
