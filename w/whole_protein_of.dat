Instead, our observations point to the formation of a single type of vacuole in cells differentiating both proximally and distally from the root meristem. This is a hybrid-type vacuole containing storage proteins and having both α- and γ-TIPs, but not δ-TIP, in its tonoplast.

40|$|In the {{application}} of saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments {{to the study of}} protein-ligand interactions, the relaxation of the ligand {{is one of the major}} influences on the experimentally observed STD factors, making interpretation of these difficult when attempting to define a group epitope map (GEM). In this paper, we describe a simplification of the relaxation matrix that may be applied under specified experimental conditions, which results in a simplified equation reflecting the directly transferred magnetisation rate from the protein onto the ligand, defined as the summation over the <b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> the protein-ligand cross-relaxation multiplied by with the fractional saturation of the protein protons. In this, the relaxation of the ligand is accounted for implicitly by inclusion of the experimentally determined longitudinal relaxation rates. The conditions under which this "group epitope mapping considering relaxation of the ligand" (GEM-CRL) can be applied were tested on a theoretical model system, which demonstrated only minor deviations from that predicted by the full relaxation matrix calculations (CORCEMA-ST) [7]. Furthermore, CORCEMA-ST calculations of two protein-saccharide complexes (Jacalin and TreR) with known crystal structures were performed and compared with experimental GEM-CRL data. It could be shown that the GEM-CRL methodology is superior to the classical group epitope mapping approach currently used for defining ligand-protein proximities. GEM-CRL is also useful for the interpretation of CORCEMA-ST results, because the transferred magnetisation rate provides an additional parameter for the comparison between measured and calculated values. The independence of this parameter from the above mentioned factors can thereby enhance the value of CORCEMA-ST calculations...|$|E
40|$|Background: In acute illnesses, plasma glucose {{levels are}} often {{increased}} and generally parallel {{the severity of}} stress. Hyperglycemia caused by reduced insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin secretion is associated with increased susceptibility to infections. Maintaining blood glucose levels at or below 110 mg/dl reduces morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Aim: To measure the glucose and insulin responses of four commercially available enteral formulas compared with a standard meal reference product. Material and Methods: The glycemic index (GI) and the insulin index (II) were determined in a randomized, cross over protocol in 38 healthy volunteers between 18 and 46 years of age. Each subject underwent five tests: three with the standard meal (bread) and two with the study products. The enteral formulas were Clinutren HPR (<b>whole</b> <b>protein</b> <b>of</b> high protein value), Crucial® (casein peptide based formula), Peptamen®, (whey peptide based formula), Glytrol® (formula for diabetics with whole protein with fiber). Each study product was evaluated 10 times. Results: The diabetic formula and the high protein energy dense formulas induced a significantly lower GI (p < 0. 02) compared with the standard meal. The GI response {{did not appear to}} be due to enhanced insulin secretion. The other tested formulas had lower GI than the standard meal, but in addition they exhibited increased II The whey based peptide formulation produced the highest insulin response (p < 0. 03). Conclusions: Both GI and II are related to the concentration, form and type of protein contained in the enteral formula. The whey peptide formulation produced a low GI with the highest insulin index.

Secondly, Beard (5) showed that the plastein obtained in the albumin experiments exhibited a striking resemblance to the original albumin in that the plastein possessed a similar nutritional value.

Different {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} were isolated from raw camel milk; respectively Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus strains. 6. 5 % salt resistant coccal isolates were identified with API 20 Strep identification systems to be either enterococcal strains or lactococcal strains. Electrophoretical analysis by SDS-PAGE <b>of</b> <b>whole</b> soluble <b>proteins</b> <b>of</b> these salt resistant lactococcal strains showed {{that all of them}} were Lactococcus lactis species. Lactococcus strains regrouped Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (1. 2 %), Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (4. 9 %) and Lactococcus lactis ssp. diacetylactis (28. 4 %) while all of the enterococcal strains (34. 6 %) belonged to Enterococcus feacalis specie. Leuconostoc strains were either Leuconostoc lactis (7. 4 %) or Leuconostoc dextranicum (4. 9 %). Lactobacillus plantarum (18. 5 %) was the only member of Lactobacillus genera found...|$|R
