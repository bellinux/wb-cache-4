50|$|Sea ice {{deformation}} {{results from}} the interaction between ice floes, as they are driven against each other. The end result may be of three types of features: 1) Rafted ice, when one piece is overriding another; 2) Pressure ridges, a line of broken ice forced downward (to make up the keel) and upward (to make the sail); and 3) Hummock, an hillock of broken ice that forms an uneven surface. A shear ridge is a pressure ridge that formed under shear - {{it tends to be}} more linear than a ridge induced only by compression. A new ridge is a recent feature — it is sharp-crested, with its side sloping at an angle exceeding 40 degrees. In contrast, a <b>weathered</b> <b>ridge</b> is one with a rounded crest and with sides sloping at less than 40 degrees. Stamukhi are yet another type of pile-up but these are grounded and are therefore relatively stationary. They result from the interaction between fast ice and the drifting pack ice.|$|E

40|$|This is {{an attempt}} to measure the {{frequency}} of summer Dry Spells over the Canadian Prairies and to discover their possible causes. Statistical and synoptic climatological techniques are used as tools in the analysis and discussion of the occurrence and causes of Dry Spells and, in addition, make possible the delineation of areas characterized by low or high frequency of Dry Spells. The analysis reveals a higher frequency of Dry Spells and a greater variability of precipitation in the summer months in a zone extending along the Saskatchewan-Alberta boundary. A very significant factor related to Dry Spells is the position of an upper level stationary or quasi-stationary ridge (north-south axis) over the Prairies. The position of the upper level ridge affects the dry conditions in two ways: firstly, because of the blocking action, the upper level ridge dislocates the jet stream, tracks of cyclones and associated moist air masses, so that they lie north of the Prairies; secondly, the anticyclonic circulation under this ridge of high pressure induces divergence and subsidence of air accompanied by inversion of temperature at lower levels. Other significant factors which contribute to Dry Spells are associated with surface synoptic conditions. These latter include: an apparent eastward migration of high and low pressure systems (Aleutian Low, North Pacific High, Hudson Bay Low and North Atlantic High); and the position of the migratory anticyclones over the southern and southeastern Prairies. The dry mPs air mass originating from the Pacific inversion layer also has some influence on the occurrence of Dry Spells. The upper level and surface atmospheric flow patterns (i. e., from surface to 500 millibar levels) are classified into five synoptic Weather Types and is demonstrated that <b>Weather</b> Type WA (<b>ridge</b> dominant over British Columbia), <b>Weather</b> Type WB (<b>ridge</b> dominant over central Prairies) and <b>Weather</b> Type We (<b>ridge</b> dominant over eastern Prairies) correlate with a high probability of dry conditions over the Prairies. When the preceding flow patterns are persistent with a quasi-stationary upper level ridge (north-south axis) over the Prairies, Dry Spells occur. These synoptic and dynamic atmospheric conditions are summarized in three models explaining possible relationships pertaining to the probability of dry conditions and Dry Spells over the Prairies...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 The oldest {{records of}} the Arctic sea ice pack {{illustrate}} a frozen, yet dynamic icescape composed of hummocks and <b>weathered</b> <b>ridges</b> draped in thick snow. In recent decades, the {{effects of climate change}} have transformed this image: the Arctic sea ice pack is younger, thinner, and more dynamic. As a result, the properties of its surface are changing and impacting its ice mass balance. This work investigates the recent geophysical changes of the Arctic sea ice surface, giving emphasis to snow, melt ponds, and sea ice surface topography through the three following papers: (1) interdecadal changes in spring snow depth, (2) seasonal evolution of melt ponds, and (3) the spatial scaling of melt pond distributions. In the first analysis, recent in situ and airborne observations were used to extend the snow climatology to the contemporary period. Through this, we were able to identify the interdecadal change in spring snow depth distributions, and found that snow has thinned by 37 ± 29 % in the western Arctic and 56 ± 33 % in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas. The decrease was attributed to later autumnal sea ice formation. During the peak snowfall period in autumn, snow falls into the ocean and melts due to the absence of sea ice. In the second analysis, an algorithm was developed for identifying melt ponds in high-resolution satellite images of a Lagrangian site. The site was composed mixed sea ice types, allowing for a comparison of seasonal melt pond evolution between first-year and multiyear sea ice undergoing the same forcings. Surprisingly, melt ponds formed three weeks earlier on multiyear sea ice than first-year sea ice. Nearly half of the snow on the multiyear sea ice was optically-thin, which likely contributed to early melt pond formation. The uniformity in melt pond formation, drainage, and distribution was inversely proportional to the level of sea ice deformation; melt pond uniformity increased with decreasing sea ice deformation. The third analysis investigated the spatial scaling of melt pond distributions at two sites with homogenous (undeformed first-year) and heterogeneous (mixed deformation and age) sea ice. The relationship between small-scale variability in melt pond geometries and aggregate-scale estimates of melt pond fractions was examined. The results revealed that: (1) melt pond geometry is most variable before melt pond drainage at the heterogeneous site, but after melt pond drainage at the homogenous site, (2) aggregate-scale estimates of melt pond fractions in homogenous and heterogeneous sea ice sites are larger than previously recognized, ranging from ~ 70 km 2 to ~ 480 km 2, and (3) aggregate-scale estimates of melt pond fractions may be dependent on the composition of sea ice types and stage of melt pond evolution...|$|R

40|$|Rates of {{sedimentation}} of pelagic sediments in the South Atlantic {{have been}} determined using the ionium/thorium methodology. Values {{of the order}} of several millimeters per thousand years for sediments were found in the deposits in the valleys of the mid-Atlantic ridge. The equatorial deposits showed higher rates of accumulation than the corresponding deposits at higher latitudes, probably reflecting the added influx of materials to the sea floor from tropical rivers through the equatorial current systems. The deposits in the ridge valleys showed marked changes in sedimentation rates at about 115, 000 years ago, at which time the present rates changed from higher to lower values. The ridge sediments were composed primarily of continentally derived materials, and there were no indications of solid phases being derived from the <b>weathering</b> of the <b>ridge</b> itself or from volcanic activity.

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, {{positive}} sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) of greater than 2 °C extended across the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and into the eastern Bering Sea (EBS). The SSTA in the EBS are {{at least in part}} due to atmospheric causes. Anomalously high 700 -mb geopotential heights occurred over the region during April through August. This resulted in enhanced warming of the GOA and EBS due to increased insolation. The pattern of positive 700 mb height anomalies for April through August 1997 is similar to its counterpart formed by compositing the April through August anomalies that occurred during previous El Niños. The warming in the Bering Sea and North Pacific during summer 1997 appears to be due to the confluence of three factors: a decadal trend toward higher 700 -mb heights, the El Niño, and a particularly strong blocking <b>ridge</b> <b>weather</b> pattern in May.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{discusses}} the characteristic air mass types over the Carpathian Basin {{in relation to}} plant pollen levels over annual pollination periods. Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts dataset, daily sea-level pressure fields analysed at 00 UTC were prepared for each air mass type (cluster) in order to relate sea-level pressure patterns to pollen levels in Szeged, Hungary. The database comprises daily values of 12 meteorological parameters and daily pollen concentrations of 24 species for their pollination periods from 1997 to 2001. Characteristic air mass types were objectively defined via factor analysis and cluster analysis. According to the results, nine air mass types (clusters) were detected for pollination periods of the year corresponding to pollen levels that appear with higher concentration when irradiance is moderate while wind speed is moderate or high. This is the case when an anticyclone prevails in the region west of the Carpathian Basin and when Hungary is {{under the influence of}} zonal currents (wind speed is high). The sea level pressure systems associated with low pollen concentrations are mostly similar to those connected to higher pollen concentrations, and arise when wind speed is low or moderate. Low pollen levels occur when an anticyclone prevails in the region west of the Carpathian Basin, as well as when an anticyclone covers the region with Hungary at its centre. Hence, anticyclonic or anti-cyclonic <b>ridge</b> <b>weather</b> situations seem to be relevant in classifying pollen levels...|$|R
40|$|International audienceObserving, {{modelling}} {{and understanding}} the climate-scale variability of the deep water formation (DWF) in the North-Western Mediterranean Sea remains today very challenging. In this study, we first characterize the interannual variability of this phenomenon by a thorough reanalysis of observations {{in order to establish}} reference time series. These quantitative indicators include 31 observed years for the yearly maximum mixed layer depth over the period 1980 – 2013 and a detailed multi-indicator description of the period 2007 – 2013. Then a 1980 – 2013 hindcast simulation is performed with a fully-coupled regional climate system model including the high-resolution representation of the regional atmosphere, ocean, land-surface and rivers. The simulation reproduces quantitatively well the mean behaviour and the large interannual variability of the DWF phenomenon. The model shows convection deeper than 1000 m in 2 / 3 of the modelled winters, a mean DWF rate equal to 0. 35 Sv with maximum values of 1. 7 (resp. 1. 6) Sv in 2013 (resp. 2005). Using the model results, the winter-integrated buoyancy loss over the Gulf of Lions is identified as the primary driving factor of the DWF interannual variability and explains, alone, around 50 % of its variance. It is itself explained by the occurrence of few stormy days during winter. At daily scale, the Atlantic <b>ridge</b> <b>weather</b> regime is identified as favourable to strong buoyancy losses and therefore DWF, whereas the positive phase of the North Atlantic oscillation is unfavourable. The driving role of the vertical stratification in autumn, a measure of the water column inhibition to mixing, has also been analyzed. Combining both driving factors allows to explain more than 70 % of the interannual variance of the phenomenon and in particular the occurrence of the five strongest convective years of the model (1981, 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013). The model simulates qualitatively well the trends in the deep waters (warming, saltening, increase in the dense water volume, increase in the bottom water density) despite an underestimation of the salinity and density trends. These deep trends come from a heat and salt accumulation during the 1980 s and the 1990 s in the surface and intermediate layers of the Gulf of Lions before being transferred stepwise towards the deep layers when very convective years occur in 1999 and later. The salinity increase in the near Atlantic Ocean surface layers seems to be the external forcing that finally leads to these deep trends. In the future, our results may allow to better understand the behaviour of the DWF phenomenon in Mediterranean Sea simulations in hindcast, forecast, reanalysis or future climate change scenario modes. The robustness of the obtained results must be however confirmed in multi-model studies...|$|R
40|$|Debris {{flows and}} debris slides/avalanches (weather-induced landslides) {{represent}} a significant threat to infrastructures and human habitation in Norway. They are {{triggered by a}} combination of high intensity rainfall, snowmelt, high groundwater levels and high soil moisture, with rainfall being the most significant factor. They are most common in mountainous areas, in incised valleys of otherwise low relief, on steep slopes adjacent to fjords and in submarine environments. To reduce the risk and impact of landslide activity, Norway has recently established a landslide early warning system at the Norwegian Water Recourses and Energy Directorate (NVE). This thesis investigates if the large-scale synoptic weather types in combination with rain, snowmelt and soil saturation can be related to the occurrence of weather-induced landslides in southern Norway. This could allow forecasters who operate the early warning system to be prepared further in advance. As a first step, historical landslide data obtained from the Norwegian landslide database were extracted and quality controlled to derive at a final dataset of events for further analysis. This data set was subsequently examined, on a regional scale, by providing landslide statistics for climatic regions for southern-Norway. An attempt to classify the spatial patterns of weather-induced landslide data based on the climatic regions did not yield satisfying results. Improved classification results were obtained when dividing southern Norway into landslide domains (R 3 a). The classification provides a time series of landslide classes that was compared to time series of precipitation classes based on self-organizing maps (SOM). It showed a clear relationship between the two. Finally, the SynopVis Grosswetterlagen (SVG) classification of daily weather types was compared to the precipitation classification. Although a clear relationship also was observed here, comparing the weather-induced landslide classification to the SVG classification showed a less obvious relationship; indicating that other variables also influence the occurrence of weather-induced landslides. In order to predict the occurrence of landslides within a region, a logistic regression method was used. The dependent variable was the occurrence of landslides within a region (either landslides or no landslides). The independent variables were the SVG classes, mean daily rainfall and snowmelt data obtained from SeNorge 2 grids, as well as a hydmet-index already in use in the early warning system. It was first executed on the variables separate, yielding varying results in terms of significance, odds ratio (OR) and predicted probability. An automated model selection tool was then used to select the best combination of independent variables. The results showed that in seven of the twelve regions from R 3 a the SVGs have the highest predictive power in terms of slide occurrence. In these regions, with the exception of one, the models are significantly better than a null model, and the models are good in predicting weather-induced landslide occurrence. The highest predictive probability of weather-induced landslide occurrence is caused by the <b>weather</b> type Zonal <b>Ridge</b> across Central Europe (BM), which yields a 90 % probability of weather-induced landslides on the west coast. This weather type has also been identified as being related to floods in the same area...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} impact of frost on agriculture remains a global problem. It is a particular concern for the New Zealand wine industry, where the consequences of an unexpected spring frost can be disastrous. Marlborough {{is located in the}} north-eastern corner of the South Island and is the largest grape-growing region in New Zealand. The region is surrounded by complex mountainous terrain that gives rise to extremes of climate, particularly large spatial variations of minimum temperature and the frequent occurrence of spring frost. The high spatial variation of near-surface minimum temperature can lead to under-preparedness among grape growers who rely on accurate frost forecasts as part of their frost mitigation systems. Field campaigns of the 1980 ’s and 90 ’s extended the understanding of the physical meteorological processes that affect cooling in complex terrain. More recent modelling efforts continue to refine this knowledge, although much less attention is given to the effects of different cooling processes on near-surface temperature. Agricultural developments in areas of complex terrain would benefit from an increased understanding of the meteorological processes that govern near-surface cooling, as this will help with the local prediction of frost. The spatial variation of near-surface minimum temperatures is first explored by identifying relationships with synoptic weather patterns using the Kidson (2000) synoptic classification scheme. Analysis revealed that Kidson types associated with the largest daily variations in near-surface minimum temperature (T, TNW and H) are not always associated with the occurrence of frost. Frost is more likely to occur during the cooler airflows of Kidson type HW, HNW and SW, or during the settled anticyclonic conditions that follow cooler airflows. The relationship between the spatial variation of near-surface minimum temperature and regional airflow patterns is explored using numerical weather prediction (NWP) modelling. Results indicated that a high σ Tmin around the region is a product of interaction between the region’s complex terrain and ambient meteorology, and it could occur in both settled weather and more dynamic synoptic conditions. A high regional σ Tmin during light ridge top winds could occur as a function of a location’s relative susceptibility to ventilation from thermally-induced drainage winds, and it may also occur {{as a result of the}} simultaneous ventilation and stagnation of near-surface air layers as synoptic wind interacts with local topography. The influence of the vertical structure of the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) on nearsurface minimum temperature was investigated with the University of Canterbury Sonic Detection And Ranging (SODAR). Measurements confirmed the formation of low-level jets (LLJ’s) in the Awatere and Wairau Valleys during settled weather conditions, and that shear-induced turbulence beneath the jets was sufficient to mix warmer air to the surface and increase local temperatures. The process is sufficient to reduce frost risk to some of the region’s upper valleys during clear settled <b>weather.</b> In stronger <b>ridge</b> top winds development of the LLJ’s can be suppressed or eliminated and this was found to reduce shear-induced turbulence near the surface, allowing increased near-surface cooling. While results from this study are of greatest value to the prediction of near-surface minimum temperature and frost in Marlborough, the results could be applied to improved prediction of near-surface minimum temperature in complex terrain around the world. Further research could be directed toward the interaction of synoptic winds with thermally-induced airflows, as the transition zone between these wind systems is believed to govern the temporal and spatial evolution of near-surface stagnation, and this is related to episodes of strong near-surface cooling...|$|R
