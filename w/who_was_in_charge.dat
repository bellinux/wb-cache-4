5|$|The {{first officer}} to command No.410 Squadron was Squadron Leader P.Y. Davoud, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> between 30 June 1941 and 4 September 1941. Wing Commander (W/C) M. Lipton took over command between 5 September 1941 and 30 July 1942 and the {{position}} was then given to W/C F.W. Hillock, between 19 August 1942 and 19 May 1943, and then to W/C G.H. Elms, who commanded No.410 Squadron between 20 May 1943 and 18 February 1944. In {{the latter part of}} the war, W/C G.A. Hiltz was given command between 19 February 1944 and 1 April 1945. The last commander of the war was W/C E.P. Heybroek, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> between 2 April 1945 until the squadron disbanded in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|The longest serving {{manager was}} Wilf Wild, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> from 1932 to 1946, {{for a total}} length of 14 years 9 months. However, as Wild's tenure covered {{the entire length of}} the Second World War, in which no {{competitive}} football was played, he is not the man with the most games served as manager. Les McDowall, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> from 1950 to 1963, a period of 13 years, managed the club for the most competitive games, a total of 592 games - a full 240 games more than Wild, who recorded the second most. The most successful Manchester City manager in terms of major trophies won is Joe Mercer, who won four trophies in six years from 1965 to 1971. Pep Guardiola is City's current manager.|$|E

5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the Hessian commander, Captain von Malmburg, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. As {{they left the}} fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1835, Texians had {{expelled}} all Mexican {{troops from}} Texas. Believing the war ended, many Texians resigned from the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; {{despite a lack of}} authority for any branch of government to interfere with other branches, the legislature impeached Governor Henry Smith, who in turn disbanded the legislature. No one in Texas was entirely sure <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|E
5|$|Groves soon {{decided to}} {{establish}} his project headquarters {{on the fifth floor}} of the New War Department Building (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and Nichols, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but the name of the district did not change.|$|E

5|$|In most of Brassey's {{contracts}} {{he worked}} in partnership with other contractors, in particular with Peto and Betts. The planning {{of the details of}} the projects was done by the engineers. Sometimes there would be a consulting engineer and below him another engineer <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the day-to-day activities. During his career Brassey worked with many engineers, the most illustrious being Robert Stephenson, Joseph Locke and Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The day-to-day work was overseen by agents, who managed and controlled the activities of the subcontractors.|$|E
5|$|Orders {{given by}} Hitler on 21 and 24 January 1945 ordered the {{movement}} of looted possessions from Königsberg. This allowed Albert Speer, Reichminister of Armaments, and his administration team to transport cultural goods of priority. However, before the Amber Room could be moved, Erich Koch, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of civil administration in Königsberg during the final months of the war, abandoned his post and fled from the city, leaving General Otto Lasch in command.|$|E
5|$|The Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar, {{sometimes}} called the Fort Vancouver half dollar, is a commemorative fifty-cent piece struck by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1925. The coin was designed by Laura Gardin Fraser. Its obverse depicts John McLoughlin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of Fort Vancouver (present-day Vancouver, Washington) from its construction in 1825 until 1846. From there, he effectively ruled the Oregon Country, {{on behalf of the}} Hudson's Bay Company. The reverse shows an armed frontiersman {{standing in front of the}} fort.|$|E

Arsène Wenger is the league's longest-serving current manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League since 1996.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} was long met with skepticism in Germany, and official matches were {{banned by the}} DFB until 1970. However, the women's national team has grown in popularity since winning the World Cup in 2003, as it was chosen as Germany's Sports Team of the Year. The current head coach is Steffi Jones, replacing Silvia Neid <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> from 2005 until 2016. As of June 2017, Germany is ranked 2nd in the FIFA Women's World Rankings.|$|E
5|$|Chappuis {{was rescued}} by an Italian partisan, Aldo Comucci, a 21-year-old <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> {{of one of}} the many {{underground}} groups operating in the area. Comucci and his band of resistance fighters got to Chappuis before the Germans and hid him and two other American flyers from the same plane for nearly three months {{until the end of the}} war. The partisans passed Chappuis and the two other Americans from house to house, and village to village, toward the Swiss frontier. Dressed in shawls — but still wearing G.I. shoes — they once walked undetected past a German sentry.|$|E

5|$|Favaloro became {{interested}} in developments in cardiovascular intervention, and developed an enthusiasm for thoracic surgery. During one visit to La Plata, he met Professor Mainetti, who pointed him {{in the direction of}} the Cleveland Clinic. Although in the beginning he had doubts about leaving his profession as a rural physician, he thought that he could make a greater contribution to the community on returning from the United States. With few resources and rudimentary English, he decided to travel to Cleveland. He first worked as a resident and later as a member of the surgical team, working with Donald B. Effler, head of cardiovascular surgery, F. Mason Sones, Jr., <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the Angiography Laboratory and William L. Proudfit, head of the Department of Cardiology.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar's {{marketing}} department had allocated space on their {{stand at the}} motor show for the XJ220, but {{had not seen the}} vehicle until its arrival. Jaguar chairman John Egan and Roger Putnam, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of Jaguar's racing activities, were shown the vehicle the week before the motor show and signed off on the concept, allowing its unveiling. The car received an overwhelmingly positive reception by public and press, and a number of wealthy Jaguar enthusiasts handed over blank cheques to secure a purchase option should the XJ220 concept go into production. Ferrari's display of their F40 model at the same event was overshadowed; an estimated 90,000 additional visitors came to see the Jaguar XJ220.|$|E
5|$|Juan Larrea {{was born}} on June 24, 1782, {{in the city of}} Mataró, Catalonia. His father was Martín Ramón de Larrea, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of customs {{operations}} in Mataró, and his mother was Tomasa Espeso. He studied mathematics and navigation, and focused his education towards a career in commerce. His father died in 1793, so Larrea became the patriarch of the family. They moved to Buenos Aires, where he established a warehouse for wines, leather, and sugar. He traded with Peru, Upper Peru, Paraguay, Chile and colonial Brazil. By 1806 he was a well respected businessman, and a syndic of the Royal Consulate. He promoted the role of deputies from Buenos Aires at the Madrid court, to better the representation of the Brazilian viceroyalty and reduce the privileges of peninsular merchants.|$|E

5|$|On May 19, 1865, Davis {{was imprisoned}} in a casemate at Fortress Monroe {{on the coast}} of Virginia. Irons were riveted to his ankles at the order of General Nelson Miles <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the fort. Davis was allowed no visitors, and no books except the Bible. He became sicker, and the {{attending}} physician warned that his life was in danger, but this treatment continued for some months until late autumn when he was finally given better quarters. General Miles was transferred in mid-1866, and Davis's treatment continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{participated in}} the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, flying on the Enola Gay as weaponeer and Senior Military Technical Observer. Shortly after takeoff, he clambered into the bomb bay and {{carefully}} carried out the procedure that he had rehearsed the night before. It was Parsons and not Tibbetts, the pilot, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the mission. He approved the choice of Hiroshima as the target, and gave the final approval for the bomb to be released. For his part in the mission, Parsons was awarded the Silver Star, and was promoted to the wartime rank of commodore on 10 August 1945. For {{his work on the}} Manhattan Project, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|Reports from 1983 {{gave way}} to urban legend stating {{that as a result}} of {{overproduction}} and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were buried in an Alamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an excavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April of the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo burial did include E.T. cartridges among other titles. James Heller, the former Atari manager <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> of the original burial, was also on hand at the excavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of various titles were buried.|$|E
