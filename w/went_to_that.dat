5|$|The Lilleaker Line, which {{connected}} to the street tramway at Skøyen, had been extended to Kolsås in 1930. The owner Bærumsbanen instead wanted the line to go the faster route via the Common Tunnel to Nationaltheatret. Concession was granted in 1938 for a link from Jar on the Lilleaker Line to Sørbyhaugen on the Røa Line. The construction was delayed because a bridge needed to be built across Mærradalen, and the company ran out of money, and construction stopped for nine months in 1940. The line was opened on 15 June 1942, and the section from Sørbyhaugen to Kolsås was renamed the Kolsås Line. This resulted in two companies operating from Sørbyhaugen to Nationaltheatret, but an agreement was made where only Holmenkolbanen's tickets were sold on the section, so all revenue <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> company, regardless of the train's operator. The Kolsås Line operated every fifteen minutes along the Røa Line part.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the school's life, 95% of {{the student}} body was Hispanic and African-American. Of the GISD school zones, Alamo had the second highest {{population}} of Hispanic students, after Burnet Elementary School. A demographer said that, between March and October 2007, the Alamo school zone was the only area in Galveston that gained children. As of March 2007, almost 500 students resided in the Alamo zone. This is a higher number than the numbers residing in the Rosenberg, Morgan, and San Jacinto zones. Some critics of the school district said that this proves that GISD closed the wrong school. Lynne Cleveland, the superintendent, argued that the correct school closed because Alamo had the fewest students of any school, showing that not every student living in the zone <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> school. Cleveland said that it was not feasible for GISD to continue staffing such a small school. Between 2001 and 2007 all GISD elementary schools had population decreases. Alamo's population fell by 90 students, making up 16% of the district population. Alamo lost fewer students than other schools.|$|E

I accidentally met a boy who told me about an {{agricultural}} high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask me one thing about my education. He didn't know if I could read or write. Said {{you look like a}} big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> school for four years [...] reasonably basic preparation." ...|$|E

[...] The men who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> town meeting hammered out the abstract principles under which they would live and regulated the most minute details of their lives.

2500|$|The Hunt {{consists}} of three parts. Answering the [...] "opening questions" [...] directs Hunters to five puzzle sites scattered through the Hunt area. Solving the five Hunt puzzles—the answer is always a number—indicates the five authentic clues {{on a list of}} dozens of numbered bogus clues. Hunters have three hours to solve the puzzles, then at 3 p.m., a sixth and final clue is announced from the main stage. This begins the [...] "endgame", which {{is by far the most}} difficult puzzle of the day. Solving the endgame often leads to a phone number, or directs Hunters to go to a certain out-of-the-way location and give a password to someone identified in a cryptic way. In 2007, Hunters who solved the endgame knew they needed to find a sandwich. Only when they arrived at a location marked on the Hunt Map with a sandwich, they saw a sign that said [...] "Right idea. Wrong one." [...] In fact, they had to go to a location on the beach, marked with a witch. In other words, a [...] "sand witch." [...] If they <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> spot on the beach, they saw a Hunt volunteer wearing a witch's hat and holding a broom.|$|E
