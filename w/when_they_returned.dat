5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire effort was futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> to their support ship living quarters, they contaminated the shower stalls, laundry facilities, and everything they touched. Warren demanded an immediate {{halt to the}} entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E

5|$|On July 1, 1998, an ammonia leak and {{explosion}} at the Seward Fisheries plant caused {{a fire that}} led to the evacuation of Homer Spit and the ultimate destruction of the facility, which until then had been the major supplier of fish remains for Keene's feeding operation. But Keene was able to report when winter came that she had found other sources and was ready for the eagles <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified. In desperation, Cornwallis {{attempted}} to evacuate his troops across the York River to Gloucester Point.

5|$|The 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa was {{cancelled}} after {{legal action}} {{on the grounds that}} it would breach the NZRU's constitution.

Those that participated in the tour received a ban for two tests from the NZRU <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> to New Zealand.

5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{was living}} in Gloucestershire in 1878. He and his wife Agnes had moved to London in February 1875 when he was {{assigned}} to St Bartholomew's Hospital to further his medical education.

The Graces already had two sons and their third child Bessie was born in May 1878. When not playing cricket, Grace had to study a backlog of medical theory and, after the season ended, {{he was assigned to}} Westminster Hospital for his final year of medical practice; the family moved back to London and lived at Acton until he finally qualified in November 1879.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, {{about two}} dozen American {{soldiers}} drove off a slightly larger Hessian company from a forward redoubt. The Hessians held higher ground with better cover and {{had the advantage of}} artillery support throughout this minor skirmish, but were still unable to maintain their position. The Colonials had a single man wounded while the Hessians lost at least two men killed and others wounded. After burning and looting the temporary structures on the site, the victors occupied it until dark <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> to their main lines. By the next day the Hessians had reoccupied the spot but were quickly driven off again by a larger American force. This time the Hessians left ten dead with, again, a single American wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} received an unexpected boost during World War I, {{as a result}} of a crisis the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance.Tone, pp. 91–115 contains a history of contraception in the U.S. military in World War I. Navy secretary Josephus Daniels led the efforts to enforce abstinence. The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When U.S. soldiers were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> to America, they continued to use condoms as their preferred method of birth control.|$|E
5|$|The fourth match, between Minoru Suzuki and Kazushi Sakuraba, was {{conducted}} under UWFi rules; {{it would end}} with a knockout, submission, or referee stoppage. During the match, Sakuraba and Suzuki battled onto the entrance ramp, where Sakuraba used a kimura lock to injure Suzuki's arm. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> to the ring, Sakuraba targeted Suzuki's injured arm with kicks, stomps, and a cross armbreaker hold. Suzuki withstood the assault, responding with slaps with his good arm and a running kick to Sakuraba's face. Suzuki applied a rear naked choke, making a judo throw while maintaining the choke (Saka Otoshi). Sakuraba fought the hold until he lost consciousness, {{at which point the}} referee stopped the match in favour of Suzuki at 9 minutes and 21 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers shook hands and embraced.|$|E
5|$|The prologue was a {{short and}} fairly flat circuit around Liège, with {{expected}} stage times to be about eight minutes. The start ramp was located at Avenue Rogier next to the Parc d'Avroy; the riders then headed north by the Boulevard d'Avroy and Boulevard de la Sauvenière. They then followed the Quai Roosevelt, along the Meuse, until the midway point <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>returned</b> on the opposite carriageway, before turning right towards Place Saint-Lambert, {{in front of the}} Palais des Princes-Évêques. From there, the riders rejoined the original route on the opposite carriageway of Boulevard de la Sauvenière before the finish line located on Boulevard d'Avroy {{on the opposite side of}} the Parc d'Avroy from the start.|$|E
