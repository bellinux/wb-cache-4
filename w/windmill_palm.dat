40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2015. Includes bibliographical references. Plant {{secretory}} peroxidases {{are important}} commercial enzymes {{and play a}} central role in plant stress responses. The focus of this work is a unique peroxidase from the leaves of a cold tolerant palm, Trachycarpus fortunei, (i. e., <b>windmill</b> <b>palm</b> tree). Like other palm tree peroxidases, <b>windmill</b> <b>palm</b> tree peroxidase is stable at high temperatures and in the presence of denaturants. It is distinct from other palm tree peroxidases in its substrate specificity. The amino acid sequence and glycosylation had not been determined. Because glycosylation is known to play a critical role in plant peroxidase stability and activity, this knowledge is essential for structure activity studies, selection of an expression system for enzyme production, and engineering the enzyme. Glycosylation is a complex modification that is difficult to study; furthermore, there is a lack of analytical tools for characterizing plant glycoproteins. The complete amino acid sequence was determined using cDNA sequencing and biological mass spectrometry. The mature amino acid sequence is 306 residues in length. The presence of a C-terminal signal peptide predicts vacuolar targeting of the enzyme. Native <b>windmill</b> <b>palm</b> tree peroxidase was analyzed at the glycopeptide level to give a qualitative and quantitative assessment of glycosylation at each site. <b>Windmill</b> <b>palm</b> tree peroxidase has 13 sites for N-linked glycosylation, 2 of which are unique. Each site is at least partially occupied by a glycan. Major glycans are paucimannosidic, which supports the assignment of <b>windmill</b> <b>palm</b> tree peroxidase as a vacuolar peroxidase. To carry-out this work, a workflow for analyzing the glycopeptide mass spectrometry data was developed. Included in the workflow are novel tools for glycan database construction, pGlycoFilter, and validation of glycopeptide assignment, gPSMvalidator. New analytical methods are needed for the emerging field of plant glycoproteomics. The novel methods developed in this dissertation will be useful for the study of other important plant glycoproteins. This knowledge can be used to study the roles of glycosylation in this exceptionally stable and unique palm peroxidase...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Palm peroxidases are {{extremely}} stable and have uncommon substrate specificity.

The complete amino acid sequence and partial glycosylation were determined by MALDI-top-down sequencing of native <b>windmill</b> <b>palm</b> tree peroxidase (WPTP), MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS of WPTP tryptic peptides, and cDNA sequencing. The propeptide of WPTP contained N- and C-terminal signal sequences which contained 21 and 17 amino acid residues, respectively. Mature WPTP was 306 amino acids in length, and its carbohydrate content ranged from 21 % to 29 %. Comparison to closely related royal palm tree peroxidase revealed structural features that may explain differences in their substrate specificity.
