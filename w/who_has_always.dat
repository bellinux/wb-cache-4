25|$|In a 2013 interview, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, {{designer}} of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms {{now that he was}} no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter {{from the back of the}} coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But this is only a proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.|$|E

500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews. Richard Lautens from Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "Madonna is a thorough, if slightly workmanlike, retelling of its namesake's well-documented slog from lowly Midwestern beginnings to squeaky-voiced sex kitten to professional button-pusher to mother and respected, vaguely Bowie-esque, chameleonic figure, a cultural bloodhound {{always on the}} scent of the fresh, cool and credible." [...] Helen Bushby from BBC commented that [...] "he book is certainly detailed, and will no doubt keep Madonna fanatics happy, although it is perhaps more of a reference book than a page-turner. But Morton is a good businessman, and is canny in his choice of subjects." [...] Michael Sneed from Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review of the book and felt that Morton's previous works had been better. George Rush from New York Daily News commented: [...] "Despite her best efforts to discourage friends from cooperating with him, Andrew Morton has come forth with a book that portrays Madge as an insecure manipulator so ravenous for affection that she scared off some boyfriends, cheated on most of them and made a lot of foolish choices." [...] In another review, Sherryl Connelly from the same publication was of the opinion that Madonna was mostly similar to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography on her, [...] She added, [...] "At least, it's the story made familiar by Madonna, a woman <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> taken for granted the world's interest in her life." ...|$|E

The genre also had a strong influence on David Bowie's Station to Station (1976) and the experimentation it inspired led to his 'Berlin Trilogy'.|$|E

Within her immediate family, she is closest to her younger brother, Rob, who shares her loving and questioning nature. [...] She finds a mentor and kindred spirit in her maternal grandfather, retired minister Grandfather Eaton, who recognizes Vicky's poetic nature and encourages her to write.|$|E
2500|$|Premiering the {{day after}} the {{assassination}} of John F. Kennedy, the first episode of Doctor Who was repeated with the second episode the following week. Doctor <b>Who</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes were also repeated on BBC Three, before its transition to an online-only channel [...] The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings. The first of these was the [...] "Dalekmania" [...] period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought Doctor Who ratings of between 9 and 14million, even for stories which did not feature them. The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12million.|$|E
2500|$|... "It's {{no secret}} that in music, as in life, success and failure are largely {{dependent}} on timing, and so {{with that in mind}} it's hard not to feel just a little bad for Michelle Williams, the Johnny-come-lately third member of Destiny's Child, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> had a hard time establishing herself inside the group, let alone outside it, and who now finds herself releasing a new record at a time when her efforts will likely be eclipsed by her former group members. And so, after a series of delays, Williams's third solo album, Unexpected, arrives on shelves just as people have begun to buzz about Beyoncé's upcoming album, and when honorary DC sister Solange has made an unexpected critical impact with the oddball surrealism of her recent sophomore effort, Sol-Angel and the Hadley Street Dreams. Considering Unexpected is a fairly decent album and by far the least pretentious, unashamedly pop record to be made by a DC member so far, it's all a bit unfortunate. Anyone who has heard the first single, [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] already knows that Williams, whose solo work to date has been gospel-oriented, has on this occasion stepped outside of the confines of the church and into the dark of the clubs, embracing au courant euro-pop sounds, and it's a move that works well for her. [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] which boasts a chorus wrapped up in some awesome swirling synth-pop majestics, has done relatively well on the dance charts but deserved to cross over. Meanwhile, ignoring some atrocious lyrical hiccups, [...] "Til' the End of the World" [...] is a moody, frostbitten electro lament, and in the lush balladry of [...] "The Greatest," [...] Williams could find the hit she needs." ...|$|E
