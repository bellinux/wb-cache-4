40|$|Introduction Intertrigo is an {{inflammatory}} condition of skin folds, induced by skin-to-skin contact, heat, moisture and friction. When skin erosions occur, bacteria and fungi {{of the skin}} flora can easy maintain intertrigo. Intertrigo is a chronic problem for especially patients in need of special care. There are multiple preventive measurements and treatments, however without evidence for the best possible treatment. MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream,</b> is a cream based on honey. Honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties and {{has been used for}} centuries to heal wounds. Based on the properties of honey, MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> could be a good alternative in the treatment of intertrigo, with a high patient and user comfort. Material and method In this multicentre, randomized, left-right intervention study, patients with symmetrical intertrigo in large skin folds were included. The study compared the standard therapy with zinc oxide ointment and MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream.</b> During the study of 3 weeks, patients were treated symmetrical, left and right, and the severity of intertrigo was scored at day 1, 7, 14 and 21. Results In this study 31 patients with symmetrical intertrigo were included. The results showed that both zinc oxide ointment and MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> were effective in the treatment of intertrigo, both lower the severity of intertrigo in time. MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> showed significant lower complaints of itching. There was no prove, the <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> was more effective than the standard. The nursing staff finds the <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> easier to apply and preferred MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> over zinc oxide ointment. Discussion and conclusion The {{results of this study suggest}} that MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> is a good alternative in the treatment of intertrigo, with good user comfort. It suggests that the use of MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> causes less itching complaints. However, the study population is low, so the results should be interpreted with caution. In the follow-up study, the effect of MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> should be investigated further. To investigate whether MediHoneyTM <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> is more effective, based on the properties of honey, will be investigated with microbiologic research. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> varies by product. Three categories of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> are used: water repellent creams, water-soluble creams, and creams designed for special applications. Moisturizing <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> {{acts as a}} lubricating film on the skin to prevent depletion of water (transepidermal water loss) in the skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum. This may have a protective effect against irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, which often result from such depletion. These <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> can be classed as occlusives (which prevent loss through a hydrophobic effect), humectants (which absorb water from the dermis and environment due to hygroscopy), or hydrating agents (which both moisturize the skin and maintain its water content). <b>Barrier</b> <b>creams</b> may contain substances such as zinc oxide, talc or kaolin to layer over the skin. Other <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> are intended to protect the skin from some external agents, though they are not sufficient to provide a complete barrier.|$|R
50|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that improper use of <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> could cause a harmful rather than a beneficial effect. Skin that has been moisturized by <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> may be more susceptible to irritation by sodium lauryl sulfate, which can permeate hydrated skin more easily because of its hydrophilia. <b>Barrier</b> <b>creams</b> that contain petroleum jelly or certain oils may cause rubber or latex gloves to deteriorate.|$|R
50|$|A 2010 Cochrane review {{concluded}} that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> could prevent irritant contact dermatitis in the workplace. <b>Barrier</b> <b>creams</b> can be applied before exposure to potential irritants, but are not typically used as the main protection against hazardous substances. They are a poor substitute for protective clothing for workers; in particular, gloves provide greater protection. However <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> are reasonably effective for protection of the face against some airborne substances. Active <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> containing silicone, tartaric acid, glycerin, and other ingredients are said to be beneficial for some chromate-sensitive construction workers.|$|R
40|$|Often <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> (BC) do not fulfil their {{protecting}} behaviour, even if {{it promised}} by the manufacturers. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop standardized in vivo techniques to prove the potency of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> in humans. In the present study, 3 promising techniques {{for the analysis of}} <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> were evaluated: the laser scanning microscopy, the laser doppler flowmetry and the tape stripping procedure. Sodium fluorescein and glyceroltrinitrat acted as hydrophilic model penetrating substances. By means of these methods, 3 different <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> were tested and compared for their potency. The investigations showed that primarily the tape stripping procedure and also the laser scanning microscopy are promising tools for the evaluation of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams.</b> In contrast, the laser doppler flowmetry represents a less feasible technique. In addition, the <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> evaluation developed that vaseline enfolds a 100 % barrier on the skin surface for the penetration of a hydrophilic dye, whereas BC 1 only partially showed a protective effect and BC 2 exhibited almost no potency. In conclusion, it can be referred that laser scanning microscopy and the tape stripping procedure represent two non invasive in vivo techniques which enable a fast investigation concerning the potency of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams...</b>|$|R

Secondly to compare different racial skin types (African skin to Caucasian skin) by determining the effects of <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> on skin <b>barrier</b> function. Finally to compare the effect of the three different <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> on four different anatomical areas. Methods: Thirty eight non-smoking male test subjects took part in this study where three different types of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> were tested on their arms and hands in a controlled laboratory environment. The thirty eight test subjects consisted of nineteen African and nineteen Caucasian test subjects. Three parameters were measured namely TEWL, stratum corneum hydration and pH condition of the skin. TEWL was measured using a Vapometer (Delfin Technology Ltd. Finland). The Multi probe Adapter system (MPA) (Courage and Khazaka, Germany) was used with a temperature and humidity sensor and with the following probes all from Courage and Khazaka, Germany: a Corneometer measuring skin hydration and a pH-Meter measuring skin surface pH. The measurements were repeated on each of the four sampling areas (forearm, wrist, back of hand and palm) with a reasonable time interval between each measurement. After the baseline measurement the <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> was applied by the researcher on the test subjects’ dominant arm. The long term effects were determined after the baseline measurement in intervals of 2 hours. Directly after each measurement the <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> was reapplied. Results: Gloves In A Bottle™ increased stratum corneum hydration, had no effect on TEWL and increased skin surface pH, whereas Reinol™ increased stratum corneum hydration and decreased TEWL and had no effect on pH values. Travabon™ decreased stratum corneum hydration and TEWL and had no effect on skin surface pH. The results indicated that there were significant differences between Caucasian and African test subjects with the use of <b>barrier</b> <b>creams,</b> because of the baseline differences and the reaction to <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> showed different results. There were also statistically significant differences in the four different anatomical areas where the <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> were applied.

40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Background: <b>Barrier</b> <b>creams</b> {{are applied}} {{to the surface of}} the skin to form a barrier that aims to prevent the {{penetration}} of irritants and allergens through the skin surface. Several inconsistencies and controversies exist in literature regarding the effect that <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> may have on skin barrier function. Various skin surface parameters are used to evaluate the effect that the <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> have on skin barrier function. These parameters include transepidermal water loss (TEWL), skin hydration and skin surface pH. Total skin thickness may be assessed as a variable on its own. Differences may exist in skin surface parameters when comparing African participants with Caucasian participants. Aim: The specific aim of this research was to evaluate the short-term 1 effects of selected <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> on skin <b>barrier</b> function. Note 1 : The words short-term are used in this study as each <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> is only tested over a period of 8 hours and not tested over a long term period of months or years. Method: Forty two non-smoking participants were included and tested in this study, of which 21 were African and the rest Caucasian. TEWL, skin hydration and skin surface pH were used to evaluate the differences in the effect of two different <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> (Reinol Solvgard and Momar Chex) on skin barrier function. TEWL was measured by making use of a closed chamber Vapometer (Deflin Technology Ltd., Kuopio, Finland), skin hydration using a Corneometer® CM 825 and skin surface pH using a pH meter probe (Courage and Khazaka Electronic Kӧln, Germany). A micro-pipette was used to drip a standard volume of 20 μl of ultrapure water on the skin surface before the researcher placed the pH meter probe onto the skin surface. Total skin thickness was measured by making use of ultrasound (Ultrascan 22 - TBS 0061 B) (Courage and Khazaka Electronic Kӧln, Germany). Three consecutive measurements were taken on the mid-forearm and the palm of the experimental arm. After baseline values were measured, 5 ml of the selected <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> was applied to the experimental arm. The <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> (selected for the day) was reapplied after 2, 4 and 6 hours and measurements were taken every 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours. The total skin thickness was measured at time zero and at 8 hours. Results: TEWL: For both <b>barrier</b> <b>creams,</b> statistical significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05) were found between TEWL on the palms of African participants and Caucasian participants. Skin hydration: Statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05) were obtained with regard to mid-forearm skin hydration when comparing Reinol Solvgard with Momar Chex (this was applicable to both racial groups). A statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) was obtained with regard to mid-forearm skin hydration when comparing African participants with Caucasian participants (this was only applicable to Reinol Solvgard). Statistical significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05) were obtained with regard to skin hydration palm when comparing Reinol Solvgard with Momar Chex (this was applicable to both racial groups). Statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05) were obtained with regards to skin hydration palm when comparing African participants with Caucasian participants (this was applicable to both <b>barrier</b> <b>creams).</b> Skin surface pH: A statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) was obtained with regard to pH of the mid-forearm when comparing Reinol Solvgard with Momar Chex (this was applicable to only the African participants). A statistical significance (p ≤ 0. 05) was obtained with regards to skin surface pH mid-forearm when comparing African participants with Caucasian participants (this was applicable to Momar Chex <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> only). A statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0. 05) was obtained with regards to the pH of the palm when comparing Reinol Solvgard with Momar Chex (this was only applicable to the African racial group). Conclusion: Using skin surface parameters, it can be concluded that Momar Chex <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> elicited more positive effects on skin barrier function than Reinol Solvgard <b>barrier</b> <b>cream.</b> This may be ascribed to the fact that both <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> lowered TEWL (positive effect), Reinol Solvgard lowered skin hydration (negative effect) whereas, Momar Chex increased the skin hydration (positive effect) and both <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> increased skin surface pH (negative effect). Furthermore, the objectives of this study were reached as (a) short-term effects on skin surface parameters were identified between African versus Caucasian participants, (b) significances were observed between the two <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> (Momar Chex and Reinol Solvgard) by making use of skin surface parameters and (c) general increases and or decreases were observed in skin surface parameters over a short term period of 8 hours.

In general, proprietary formulations were relatively effective under occluded conditions, but ineffective under unoccluded conditions. For example, SM skin absorption rates through occluded control and Stokoderm(R) pre-treated skin were 538 +/- 193 and 200 +/- 51 mug(.) cm(- 2.) h(- 1), respectively (p < 0. 05). Under unoccluded conditions, control and Stokoderm pre-treated skin absorption rates were 4. 41 +/- 1. 90 and 36. 84 +/- 15. 19 mug(.) cm(- 2.) h(- 1) p < 0. 05). Novel (perfluorinated <b>barrier</b> <b>creams</b> were generally more effective under unoccluded conditions; pre-treatment with one formulation led to an 18 -fold reduction in skin absorption rate and reduced the total amount of SM penetrated by 95 % of the applied dose.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a novel <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> formulation at reducing the percutaneous toxicity of a 2 xLD(50) liquid challenge of nerve agent (VX). The study was conducted in vitro and in vivo using the domestic pig. Pretreatment of the (inner ear skin) exposure site with <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> eliminated mortality, reduced cholinesterase inhibition and prevented any physiological or biochemical signs of intoxication. In contrast, untreated animals exposed to VX exhibited severe signs of intoxication, near total AChE inhibition and generally died within the (3 hr) exposure period (5 / 6 animals). Application of the <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> caused a significant decrease in the area of skin contaminated by VX. It was tentatively concluded that spreading was predominantly a surface phenomena (possibly mediated by capillary movement of the agent through the microrelief or between hair follicles) with little or no contribution from lateral diffusion within the stratum corneum. There was a disparity between the in vitro and in vivo skin absorption measurements that was ascribed to the absence of systemic clearance in vitro. However, both models indicated a substantial reservoir of VX within the skin, providing a potential strategy for future investigations into "catch-up therapies". In summary, the novel <b>barrier</b> <b>cream</b> formulation was effective against a 2 xLD(50) (liquid, percutaneous) dose of VX applied for 3 hr.

Methods: Patients recruited to the Radiation Therapy Skin Care Trial (N= 255) were randomised to receive either the moisturising <b>cream</b> or a <b>barrier</b> <b>cream.</b> Participants completed an Acceptability Survey each week during treatment, and one month after treatment ended. Acceptability was operationally defined as a score of at least 4 on five specific questions on the Acceptability Survey (ease of application, smell, whether the cream felt comfortable, built up on the skin or affected clothing).
