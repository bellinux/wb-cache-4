Two wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Comfeel and Restore, respectively, <b>were</b> then <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM, while one wound previously <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore. Either no clotting occurred under DuoDERM or clots may have resolved. Although these preliminary data suggest that DuoDERM gel may have fibrinolytic properties, more extensive and controlled studies are needed to assess the characteristics of this dressing...|$|R

The upper storeys of the gatehouse were rebuilt, although the ground floor remained in its 16th-century condition.|$|E
