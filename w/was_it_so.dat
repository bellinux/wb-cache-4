5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that <b>was</b> <b>it.</b> <b>So</b> when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, he asks why, if the {{movement}} was planned by military officers, as alleged in the Cornell Paper, <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> poorly planned. Despite {{the movement}} being labeled a “coup attempt,” the movement’s troops did not execute the plan with military efficiency or planning. As Roosa notes, the movement’s military force, which only consisted of 2,130 total military personnel and 2,000 civilians, was spread too thin to constitute a single operational force, especially compared {{to the number of}} military troops stationed in the city(footnote). Also, the lack of tanks proves that the forces did not have the intention of taking government control. The forces of Aidit and his men were separated {{from the rest of the}} movement’s forces under Untung and the other men by a total distance of two miles, under two separate strategic headquarters. Furthermore, the two forces did not have efficient means of communication between them; the movement itself shut down the city’s telephone system when it took over the telecommunications building, and neither group had walkie-talkies or other radio devices to relay plans back and forth. Instead, several of the leaders used shuttles and couriers as a means of communication. Roosa contributes these inconsistencies in planning to Sjam, noting his lack of experience in military strategy. In any case, he says, the movement's leaders as a group were too disparate to find enough common ground to carry out the operation.|$|E
500|$|Intelligent {{steering}} from C. G. F. Bryan, the Oxford cox, saw the Dark Blues [...] "hugging the Surrey bank" [...] {{to reduce}} the Cambridge lead to about a length by Chiswick Eyot. [...] It was short-lived however, as Bryan steered back over towards the Middlesex side of the river, losing his crew a length in doing so and moving into rougher water, and by Chiswick Steps, the Light Blues were {{four and a half}} lengths ahead. [...] Cambridge's stroke Ran Laurie called for a spurt {{and by the time they}} passed under Barnes Bridge they were five lengths ahead. [...] They crossed to the Middlesex side of the river before passing the finishing post with a lead of four and a half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 48 seconds. [...] It was a record twelfth victory for the Light Blues and took the overall record in the event to 46–40 in their favour. [...] Former Oxford rower E. P. Evans, writing in The Manchester Guardian, stated that Cambridge [...] "won in the easiest manner possible, having led from start to finish" [...] and described the race as a [...] "fiasco". [...] The rowing correspondent for The Times suggested that [...] "never <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>so</b> obvious after the first few strokes that there was only one crew in the race ... Oxford's form was too bad to be true." ...|$|E
