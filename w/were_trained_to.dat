5|$|Historically, {{elephants}} {{were considered}} formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armour {{to protect their}} sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough.

5|$|The priory was {{elevated}} {{to the status}} of abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and the monks founded a school for lay monks to help build a self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two groups would eventually be taught separately, and the monastic students <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to ethnically diverse congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world.|$|E
5|$|Velites {{were first}} used, and created, at {{the siege of}} Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of {{citizens}} who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a shortage of manpower. They <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> ride on horseback with the equites and jump down at a given signal to fling javelins at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in earnest.|$|E
5|$|Whether horses <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> pull chariots, to be ridden {{as light}} or heavy cavalry, or {{to carry the}} {{armoured}} knight, much training was required to overcome the horse's natural instinct to flee from noise, the smell of blood, and the confusion of combat. They also learned to accept any sudden or unusual movements of humans while using a weapon or avoiding one. Horses used in close combat may have been taught, or at least permitted, to kick, strike, and even bite, thus becoming weapons themselves for the warriors they carried.|$|E

5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine insert {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed insert. The single-feed insert resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
50|$|Service {{dogs are}} those that <b>are</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> help people with disabilities such as blindness, epilepsy, {{diabetes}} and autism.

5|$|Bellona {{opened fire}} on Corageux while Brilliant engaged Maliceuse and Hermione. Through {{skillful}} sailing, Logie {{was able to keep}} both French frigates at bay and unable to assist Courageux, which surrendered to Bellona after ninety minutes of fighting. At 7.30 a.m. Maliceuse and Hermione made sail and retreated, with Brilliant too damaged to give chase. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on Bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on Brilliant. On the French side, losses on Courageux alone were 240 killed and 110 wounded. Historian William Laird Clowes has suggested that the much higher French casualty rate was the result of differences in tactics, with the French gun crews trained to fire at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them ahead of a boarding attempt. By contrast, British crews <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> fire into the hulls of enemy ships.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the initial stages in their campaign, the Viet Cong forces were ordered to regroup and prepare for the next offensive in the Long Khánh region. Viet Cong soldiers from the two regiments were assembled in War Zone D, where they <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> attack well-fortified enemy strongholds. On November 20, 1964, the Viet Cong reached the Long Khánh battlefield, having completed a 200 kilometres march from War Zone D. On the battlefield the Viet Cong 186th Battalion (from Military Region 5), the 500th and 800th Battalions (from Military Region 7), and the 445th Company also joined the offensive. To kick-start their offensive in the Baria-Long Khánh region, the Viet Cong selected Bình Giã as their next target. Bình Giã was a small village located in Phước Tuy Province, about 67 kilometres away from Saigon.|$|E
5|$|In the {{build-up}} to Operation Overlord {{in early}} 1944, a scheme was considered in which Hotspurs {{would have been}} used to transport cargo and equipment. A Canadian fighter squadron – 401 Squadron – was selected for trials, the intention was to enable faster redeployment of fighter squadrons by using gliders to carry spare pilots, ground crew and essential supplies. The squadron operated the Supermarine Spitfire IX, some of which were modified to tow gliders by means of a tow-point attached to the tail wheel; some pilots <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> fly the Hotspur, including fighter ace Don C. Laubman. The Spitfires were found to be reasonably effective as glider tugs, although their engines were prone to overheating because the glider's maximum tow speed was , comparatively slow for a Spitfire. Despite this, the scheme was judged to be practical, although it never saw operational use.|$|E

5|$|In the {{northern}} {{sector of the}} island, in February 1945, Major General Kesao Kijima—commander of the Japanese 38th Independent Mixed Brigade— had ordered a withdrawal to Numa Numa, following the fighting around Tsimba Ridge. He subsequently left a force of 1,400 sailors drawn from the 87th Naval Garrison Force and 2,000 civilians to hold the Bonis Peninsula. Of these civilians, about 600 were armed, although only half <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> undertake a combat role. As their supplies dwindled, in May–June the Japanese sailors—under the command of Captain Eikichi Kato, the senior naval officer in Buka—began to raid the Australian supply lines between Ruri Bay and Ratsua as they attempted {{to hold a position}} between Porton Plantation and Tarbut.|$|E
5|$|The camp housed about 2,000 inmates when it opened.

Göth personally murdered prisoners on a daily basis. His two dogs, Rolf and Ralf, <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> tear inmates to death. He shot people from the window of his office if they appeared to be moving too slowly or resting in the yard. He shot to death a Jewish cook because the soup was too hot.

5|$|This {{short-sighted}} belief had a detrimental {{impact on}} the tactical effectiveness of RAF Fighter Command until the summer, 1940. With German bombers perceived as the only prey, AOC Fighter Command Hugh Dowding and his planners devised a system and tactics which used unwieldy and tight fighter formations to bring the RAF fighters into combat with bombers, followed by set-piece tactics for the engagement. Because the bomber's return fire was considered so dangerous, fighter pilots <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> open fire at long range, 300 to 400 yards, then break away without closing to short-range. These tactics, practised so thoroughly over the years, proved totally useless in the battle situation facing them over Britain in 1940.|$|E

5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E
5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} and California {{sea lions}} {{were used in}} the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (NMMP) to detect mines, protect ships from enemy soldiers, and recover objects. The Navy has never trained attack dolphins, as they {{would not be able to}} discern allied soldiers from enemy soldiers. There were five marine mammal teams, each purposed for one of the three tasks: MK4 (dolphins), MK5 (sea lions), MK6 (dolphins and sea lions), MK7 (dolphins), and MK8 (dolphins); MK is short for mark. The dolphin teams <b>were</b> <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> detect and mark mines either attached to the seafloor or floating in the water column, because dolphins can use their echolocative abilities to detect mines. The sea lion team retrieved test equipment such as fake mines or bombs dropped from planes usually out of reach of divers who would have to make multiple dives. MK6 protects harbors and ships from enemy divers, and was operational in the Gulf War and Vietnam War. The dolphins would swim up behind enemy divers and attach a buoy to their air tank, so that they would float to the surface and alert nearby Navy personnel. Sea lions would hand-cuff the enemy, and try to outmaneuver their counter-attacks.|$|E
