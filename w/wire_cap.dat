50|$|The Cordeliers cloister has {{a network}} of cellars and {{underground}} tunnels stretching for three kilometres beneath the village of Saint-Emilion. The constant temperature of 12 °C and total darkness they provide ensure perfect conditions for fermenting wines. LES CORDELIERS sparkling wines are produced and stored in these cellars using the traditional ‘champenoise’ method. The grapes are picked by hand using small, open trays and then lightly pressed (yielding 100l of wine per 150 kg of grapes) using pneumatic presses. This is followed by alcoholic fermentation and wine blending, using unique processes for each particular cuvée produced by LES CORDELIERS. The wines are transferred directly into bottles and yeast and sugar are added, prompting a natural fermentation process within the bottle which releases carbon dioxide into the wine to produce the sparkle. Following a period of aging the lees lasting for at least 12 months, the bottles undergo daily riddling to help settle out the yeast deposit ready for disgorging. After this the bottles are topped up with ‘liqueur d’expédition’ (a mixture of the base wine and sugar) in {{a process known as}} dosage, before the final corking and fitting of <b>wire</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the exchange bias effect in micron-sized ferromagnetic wires made from Co and Ni 80 Fe 20 films. The wires were fabricated using optical lithography, metallization by sputtering and lift-off technique. Magnetotransport measurements were performed at temperatures ranging from 3 to 300 K. We observed marked changes in the magnetoresistance (MR) properties as the temperature is varied. At 300 K, the field at which the sharp peak occurs corresponding to the magnetization reversal of the Co wires is 167 Oe and is symmetrical about the origin. As the temperature was decreased to 3 K, we observed {{a shift in the}} peak positions of the MR characteristics for both the forward and reverse field sweeps corresponding to a loop shift of 582 Oe in the field axis. The asymmetric shift in the MR loops at lowtemperatures clearly indicates the exchange bias between ferromagnetic (Co) and antiferromagnetic parts (Co-oxide at the surfaces) from natural oxidation. Ni 80 Fe 20 wires of the same geometry showed similar effect with a low exchange bias field. The onset of exchange biasing effect is found to be 70 and 15 K for the Co and Ni 80 Fe 20 wires,respectively.

A new MBM-device may have advantages over the current MBM-device with improved visualization, easier passage of accessories, and higher suction power due to different trip <b>wire</b> and <b>cap.</b> Rubber bands were released one by one for both MBM-devices while endoscopic images were collected. First, free endoscopic view was assessed by computer-assisted measurements (quantitative) and by ranking the images {{by a panel of}} 11 endoscopists (qualitative). Second, using a visual analog scale, three 'blinded' endoscopists assessed introduction and advancement of three types of endoscopic devices through the working channel of a diagnostic endoscope with the MBM-devices assembled. Third, suction power was evaluated by a manometer attached to the cap of the assembled MBM-devices in four endoscopes.

Therefore, voids nucleated inside the Cu wires, rather than at the interface, at the early stage of the electromigration tests.

40|$|Within {{the present}} thesis the {{influence}} of the magnetization on the resistance behavior of ferromagnetic nanowires is investigated. Special emphasis lies on the quantitative determination of the domain wall resistance (DWR) of single domain walls and the analysis of quantum transport phenomena. For this, two systems of in-plane magnetized Co-nanowires and out-of-plane magnetized (Co/Pt) _n-multilayer-nanowires are investigated. The nanowires are fabricated using a combination of both high-resolution multi-step electron beam lithography with lift-off-technique and electron beam evaporation. Some of the <b>wires</b> are <b>capped</b> in situ with insulating carbon to protect them from oxidation. The magnetoresistance at low temperatures is dominated by the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Upon variation of the orientation of the magnetic field both the characterization of the magnetic configuration and the relevant magnetization reversal processes {{as a function of the}} wire thickness and width are obtained. For in-plane magnetized cobalt nanowires domain wall pinning is accomplished by means of lateral nanostructuring. However, the resistance of a single domain wall can be mainly attributed to the AMR. For (Co/Pt) _n-multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy contributions from the AMR can be excluded and the resistance of a single domain wall at T = 4, 2 K is positive with DWR ~ 2, 5 %. The positive MR is explained quantitatively within a model incorporating spin-dependent scattering, whereas a negative MR resulting from delocalization of electrons is not observed. The low temperature resistance behavior of the ferromagnetic nanowires shows deviations from the classical resistance behavior of a typical metal such that the resistance exhibits a logarithmic increase with decreasing temperature, which can be attributed to quantum corrections due to enhanced electron-electron interactions (EEI) in two dimensions. Upon reduction of the wire width down to 32 nm a cross-over from two- to one-dimensional behavior with respect to EEI-contributions is observed. The data analysis does not yield corresponding resistance corrections due to weak electron localization (WEL). Even by systematic variations of both the wire thickness and the material as well as the degree of disorder WEL-effects remain undetected. Moreover, quantum corrections for ferromagnetic (Co/Pt) _n-multilayer-wires with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are analyzed for the first time, for which also only contributions from enhanced electron-electron interactions are found. The absence of weak localization effects in polycrystalline nanowires is explained by local inhomogeneities of the magnetization...|$|R
40|$|The gas {{dielectric}} interface {{formed by}} solid insulating spacer and SF 6 gas represent the weakest point in Gas Insulated Systems (GIS). It {{is essential to}} determine the electric field distribution along the spacer surfaces and evaluate the degree of their reliability. A key aspect {{in the design and}} optimization process of insulating spacers is the precise simulation and geometric optimization of the electric field distribution on the dielectrics. Precise knowledge of the electric field distribution enables the electrical engineer to prevent possible flashovers in critical areas of the device being designed. The geometrical shape of the spacers has a significant influence on the resulting electrostatic field. Breakdown strength is severely affected by the presence of conducting particles in a GIS as these conducting particles will be resulting in enhanced field stress {{in the vicinity of the}} particle which may cause partial discharges and eventually result in breakdown of the system. Knowledge of electric field stress distribution along the surface of the spacer in the presence of a particle in the vicinity of the surface of the spacer will be helpful in understanding the insulation integrity of a GIS.
