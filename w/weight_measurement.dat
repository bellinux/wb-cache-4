5|$|In {{the project}} to replace the last {{artifact}} that underpins much of the International System of Units (SI), {{a variety of other}} very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years. They too are covered below. Some of these now-abandoned approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would have enabled the reproducible production of new, kilogram-mass prototypes on demand (albeit with extraordinary effort) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on, or traceable to, fundamental constants. Others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand-tuned kilogram test masses and which expressed their magnitudes in electrical terms via special components that permit traceability to fundamental constants. All approaches depend on converting a <b>weight</b> <b>measurement</b> to a mass, and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories. All approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constants of nature at a defined value.|$|E

Prior to the event, the scales were examined for consistency, and though the maximum variation between scales was less than 0.5  % across the weight range of our subjects, correction equations were developed to standardize all <b>weight</b> <b>measurements</b> to a single scale.|$|R

50|$|Batch gas {{blending}} {{requires the}} appropriate {{amounts of the}} constituent gases to be measured and mixed together {{until the mixture is}} homogenous. The amounts are based on the mole (or molar) fractions, but measured either by volume or by mass. Volume measurement may be done indirectly by partial pressure, as the gases are often sequentially decanted into the same container for mixing, and therefore occupy the same volume. <b>Weight</b> <b>measurement</b> is generally used as a proxy for mass measurement as acceleration can usually be considered constant.|$|E

50|$|About half of Richards's {{scientific}} research concerned atomic weights, starting in 1886 with his graduate studies. On returning to Harvard in 1889, {{this was his}} first line of research, continuing up to his death. According to Forbes, by 1932 the atomic weights of 55 elements had been studied by Richards and his students. Among the potential sources of error Richards uncovered in such determinations was the tendency of certain salts to occlude gases or foreign solutes on precipitation. As {{an example of the}} care Richards used in his work, Emsley reports that he carried out 15,000 recrystallizations of thulium bromate in order to obtain the pure element thulium for an atomic <b>weight</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a {{practical}} device, the whole assembly {{of balance and}} magnet is enclosed in a glass box {{to ensure that the}} <b>weight</b> <b>measurement</b> is not affected by air currents. The sample can also be enclosed in a thermostat in order to make measurements at different temperatures. Since it requires a large and powerful electromagnet, the Gouy balance is a stationary instrument permanently set up on a bench. The apparatus is often placed on a marble balance table in a non-ventilated room to minimize the vibrations and disruption from the environment. The stationary magnetic of a Gouy balance is often an electromagnet connected to a power source, since balance recordings with and without the applied magnetic field are required of the procedure.|$|E
