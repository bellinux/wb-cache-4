25|$|The PT-76 is amphibious, {{it has a}} flat, boat-shaped hull {{which is}} hermetical and ensures minimal {{resistance}} when the tank is afloat. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the trim vane which improves the vehicle's stability and displacement {{in the water and}} prevents water from flooding into the bow of the tank. Switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is stowed {{in the front of the}} bow over the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armor. Bilge pumps keep the tank afloat even if it leaks or is damaged. There is a manual bilge pump for emergency use. The tank is propelled through the water by two hydrojets, one on each side of the hull, with the inlets underneath the hull and the outlets at the rear. There are also additional assistant <b>water-jet</b> inlets on both sides of the hull over the last road wheels. The rear outlets have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the water stream to the forward-directed outlets at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or go in reverse. To turn to the left for example, the left <b>water-jet</b> is covered, to turn to the right, the right <b>water-jet</b> is covered. To make a 180° turn, one <b>water-jet</b> sucks in water while the other pushes it out. This system was designed by N. Konowalow. It is the same system as the one used in the BTR-50 APC, which was based on the PT-76. The tank can swim at up to 10.2km/h and has a range of 100km. It can cross most water obstacles and can also swim in the sea. However, its amphibious design makes it disproportionally large for a vehicle of its weight and allows less armor protection than other light tanks.|$|E
25|$|The PT-76 {{was used}} by the US Army for OpFor training. They were {{modified}} {{in a number of ways}} including the replacement of the engine with a Caterpillar diesel engine, changing the turret hatch to a rear hinged arrangement and the fitting of US radios and antennae mounts. Due to the new engines different exhaust arrangements, the exhausts were rerouted to use the <b>water-jet</b> ports rather than the original engine exhaust.|$|E

30|$|With {{the three}} <b>water-jets</b> {{controlled}} independently, {{it is possible}} to generate spatial motion. However, as happens in all the underactuated systems, a sequence of movements are necessary to reach some points, since {{it is not possible to}} reach them with direct motions. In particular for our configuration, due to the disposition of the <b>water-jets</b> nozzles, there is not any control on the rotation on the longitudinal axis of the probe. This necessitates either the addition of a mechanism that allows fixing of the orientation of the nozzles relative to a fixed reference or a sensor that acquires the attitude of the nozzles in order to do the corresponding compensation depending on the current orientation.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of removing anomalous material from cast-in-drilled-hole (CIDH) piles by water jetting was examined. The primary objectives {{of this research}} were to examine how reinforcing steel influences water jetting and to evaluate how jetting pressures and standoff distance from the material surface affect water jetting of concrete type materials and PVC tubing. The experimental work consisted of water blasting submerged test specimens using rotary jets, nozzles, pumping equipment, and testing procedures currently used in construction practice. The concrete test specimens were comprised of ring- and cylinder-shaped samples, containing materials with compressive strengths of approximately 160 and 3, 600 psi. Typical PVC tubing used as inspection access holes for non-destructive testing in CIDH piles was utilized for tubing specimens. During testing, erosion depths were measured {{as a function of}} standoff distance and jetting pressure. Water jetted specimens containing reinforcing steel were cut apart after testing to permit inspection of the erosion cavity and eroded material surfaces behind the steel reinforcement. Reinforcing steel bars in CIDH piles do interfere with the jet path and will locally influence material erosion and <b>water-jetting</b> effectiveness. For a relatively weak material, <b>water-jetting</b> pressures between 10, 000 and 11, 000 psi produced erosion up to a radial distance of approximately 12 inches from the water jet. This erosion distance is less than half the typical maximum design spacing of PVC inspection access tubing installed in CIDH piles...|$|R
