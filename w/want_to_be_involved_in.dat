25|$|On 7 February 2007, the London-based Privy Council {{ordered a}} re-sentencing of Coard {{and the others}} convicted for the 1983 killing of Bishop {{and some of his}} cabinet colleagues. The hearing began on 18 June. On 27 June, the judge gave Coard and his fellow {{defendants}} a 30-year sentence, which included the time already spent in prison.

25|$|However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on {{numerous}} occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2 (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2). According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in {{taking part in the}} film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> another Western film.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Stanford {{looked to}} expand the tournament, and decided once again to feature a high-stakes game {{featuring}} {{the best players in}} the West Indies versus an international team. Stanford initially wished to invite Sri Lanka, India, Australia and South Africa to come and play a single elimination tournament in Antigua, with the winner facing his all-star team. However due to contractual issues with the ICC and ESPN-Star and scheduling constraints that tournament was infeasible. Instead, Stanford invited the winners of the World Twenty20, India, to play for a prize of US$5 million (later US$10 million) and planned to ask Australia to come as a back-up should India decline or be unavailable. India, who were in the process of launching the highly successful first year of their domestic Twenty20 league, the Indian Premier League, declined as they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a privately funded programme.|$|E
25|$|Patient G.D. was a {{white male}} born in 1940 {{who served in the}} Navy. He was {{diagnosed}} with chronic renal failure and received hemodialysis treatment {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study.|$|E
500|$|As {{polls showed}} Parizeau's {{approach}} as highly unlikely to even exceed 40% support in a referendum, {{leaders of the}} movement engaged in a heated public debate. After Parizeau moved the planned referendum date to the fall, Deputy Premier Bernard Landry aroused ire by stating he would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "charge of the light brigade." [...] During the Bloc's April conference, after a speech demanding a change in direction, Bouchard expressed ambivalence to a radio show about participating if a partnership proposal was not included. [...] Mario Dumont, leader of the new Action démocratique du Québec, also stated that he would only consider participation in the referendum if a partnership was made part of the question.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the stories}} that followed, many {{students}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved,</b> but few <b>were</b> willing <b>to</b> let their names or faces appear in the film.

500|$|Silver's final {{recordings}} {{with the}} Jazz Messengers were in May 1956. Later that year, he left Blakey after {{one and a}} half years, {{in part because of the}} heroin use prevalent in the band, which Silver did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in.</b> Soon after leaving, Silver formed his own long-term quintet, after receiving offers of work from club owners who had heard his albums. The first line-up was Mobley (tenor saxophone), Farmer (trumpet), Watkins (bass), and Louis Hayes (drums). The quintet, with various line-ups, continued to record, helping Silver to build his reputation. He wrote almost all of the material they played, and, in concert, he [...] "won over the crowds through his affable personality and all-action approach. He crouched over the piano as the sweat poured out, with his forelock brushing the keys and his feet pounding." ...|$|E
500|$|Wigner {{accepted}} {{a position as}} the Director of Research and Development at the Clinton Laboratory (now the Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in early 1946. Because he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> administrative duties, he became co-director of the laboratory, with James Lum handling the administrative chores as executive director. When the newly created Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{took charge of the}} laboratory's operations at the start of 1947, Wigner feared that many of the technical decisions would be made in Washington. He also saw the Army's continuation of wartime security policies at the laboratory as a [...] "meddlesome oversight", interfering with research. One such incident occurred in March 1947, when the AEC discovered that Wigner's scientists were conducting experiments with a critical mass of uranium-235 when the Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., had forbidden such experiments in August 1946 after the death of Louis Slotin at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Wigner argued that Groves's order had been superseded, but was forced to terminate the experiments, which were completely different from the one that killed Slotin.|$|E

2500|$|Kyokushin's 5th World Tournament, in 1991, was a {{significant}} point {{in the history of}} the IKO. Arneil stated simply, [...] "It was a fixed tournament."

I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the politics anymore. I left the IKO, not Kyokushin." [...] That same year, Arneil and the BKK resigned from the IKO, and Arneil then founded his own karate organisation, the IFK.|$|E

None of the band's former bass players were featured in the film; Fox did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> any part of the film, and requested that her name be changed in the story.

2500|$|The {{leader of}} the Liberal Party, Lars Sponheim, stated in September 2007 that his party would neither {{be a part of}} nor support a {{coalition}} that included the Progress Party, and that the Liberal Party preferred Labour Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg over Progress Party leader Siv Jensen. By late August, 2009 figures produced by Response suggested that only 2% within the Liberal Party wanted to collaborate with the Progress Party. Sponheim later distanced himself and his party from the Conservative Party because the Conservatives wanted to improve relations with the Progress Party, leading Sponheim to comment [...] "A vote for the Conservatives is a vote for the Progress Party". He said that the Liberal Party was the only solid choice on the right that didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> a government with the Progress Party.|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 1992, {{and spent a}} year auditioning. The same year, she {{appeared}} in her first feature-length film The Turning, starring Karen Allen and Tess Harper – the film drama is an adaptation of the play Home Fires Burning. Although she had once vowed she would never do television, being {{out of work for}} a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: [...] "First of all, I swore I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, I swore I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [...] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> it." [...] She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, Class of '96, on the fledgling Fox Network.|$|E

2500|$|Unterberger continues, [...] "Perhaps {{they were}} saying they wished they {{could be on the}} front lines, but were not {{in the right place at}} the right time; perhaps {{they were saying}}, as John Lennon did in the Beatles' [...] "Revolution", that they didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> violent confrontation. Or perhaps they were even declaring {{indifference}} to the tumult." [...] Other writers' interpretations varied. [...] In 1976, Roy Carr assessed it as a [...] "great summer street-corner rock anthem on the same echelon as 'Summer in the City', 'Summertime Blues', and 'Dancing in the Street'." [...] In 1979, Dave Marsh wrote that it was the keynote of Beggars Banquet, [...] "with its teasing admonition to do something and its refusal to admit that doing it will make any difference; as usual, the Stones were more correct, if also more faithless, philosophers than any of their peers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{music videos}} were created for [...] "One". The first, {{directed}} by Anton Corbijn, was filmed in Berlin and features {{the band members}} performing at Hansa Studios interspersed with footage of Trabants (an East German automobile they became fond of as a symbol for a changing Europe) and shots of them dressed in drag. Bono explained that the idea to crossdress [...] "had been {{based on the idea}} that if U2 can't do this, we've got to do it!", and it was fostered by the group's experiences dressing in drag for the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. However, the band pulled the video, fearing the single's status as an AIDS benefit would result in critics finding AIDS-related interpretations of the video. The Edge explained, [...] "We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> putting back the AIDS issue into the realm of sexuality... It wasn't worth the risk of people imagining we were saying something about the AIDS issue through the drag footage, which was totally not what we were trying to say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{supported}} Aristide and Lavalas {{during the years}} of the Cédras regime, like many other Haitians, Morse began to grow disillusioned with the nation's president and his new political party, Fanmi Lavalas. [...] Aristide aides approached the band to first request songs favorable to the government and later threaten the band when Morse refused. [...] In 1998, Manno Charlemagne, the newly elected Fanmi Lavalas mayor of Port-au-Prince and himself an accomplished professional musician who had lived in exile during the Cédras junta, sent armed men to the Oloffson. [...] They dismantled the float on which RAM was scheduled to perform in the upcoming annual Carnival on February 24. [...] The mayor had taken offense to the lyrics of one of the band's songs, which he interpreted as an accusation of corruption. [...] After the destruction of the float, the band was told they would be allowed to perform on a flatbed truck. [...] However, the brakes on the truck were sabotaged and during the Carnival procession, the truck swerved into the crowd, killing eight and forcing the members of the band to flee for their lives. [...] In 2000, Morse stated in an interview that [...] "The precedent has been set that if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> politics in this country, you've got to get your guns together... Nothing's changed, the teams have changed but not the modus operandi." ...|$|E
