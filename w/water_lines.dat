5|$|The thermal {{analysis}} {{was the first}} done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. <b>Water</b> <b>lines</b> were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.|$|E
5|$|Since 1992, {{the city}} has {{undergone}} several boundary expansions. One expansion incorporated undeveloped land in the southeast for an industrial park and a Louisiana-Pacific Canada veneer factory. The city extended sewer and <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> to the location; however, the area was not developed and with the factory only half-built, L-P Canada abandoned its plans. A business making manufactured homes bought the factory and completed its development in 2005. Another expansion incorporated the existing oriented strand board factory in {{the northwest corner of}} the city, while further incorporations have included undeveloped land to the south and north.|$|E
5|$|Through late September, Caltech seismometers {{recorded}} 188 aftershocks {{higher than}} magnitude 4.0. Six {{of those on}} the day of the mainshock were M5 and above, but some of these (like the 12:05 M6.3 shock) were only felt, and didn't cause any damage. The July 21 M5.1 shock at 15:13 GMT and the July 23 shock at 00:38 both damaged buildings in Arvin, and the latter event also caused slight damage in Fresno and near Bakersfield. Three additional shocks on July 23 were particularly destructive. Walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged took a second hit from the 07:53 M5.2 event, and a house that saw only minor damage during the mainshock was nearly destroyed by it. Gas and <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> were also severed, and transformers were loosened or dislodged. The 13:17 M5.8 shock compounded problems at Tehachapi and Arvin with damage to previously-affected buildings that was described as serious, but the 18:13 shock on July 23 only had a slight affect at Arvin.|$|E

5|$|Alongside the fatalities, {{the floods}} left several {{blocks of the}} town without power. <b>Water</b> <b>lines,</b> bridges, and other {{infrastructure}} sustained varying degrees of damage. Several homes sustained water and mud damage. Total losses in Washington County reached $750,000. Flooding continued downstream into Arizona, rendering multiple roads impassible and damaging bridges around Colorado City; losses in the city amounted to $500,000. Around 150federal personnel and 500community volunteers, including 70–80percent of Hildale's residents, conducted search and rescue in the immediate aftermath. Twenty-four members of Utah Task Force One and twenty-six personnel from the Utah National Guard were dispatched to Hildale to assist in search and rescue along Short Creek. Dangerous conditions along the creek slowed the operation. By September17, 300personnel were searching for a 6-year-old boy who was still missing. Ultimately, thousands of people from more than 60agencies {{took part in the}} search for the final victim; efforts were called off by September29 and the missing boy was presumed dead. Local residents continued periodic searches for the boy through December. The Utah Department of Public Safety granted the Public Safety Award to Washington County Sheriff Cory Pulsipher, Hildale Mayor Philip Barlow and, Hildale Marshall’s Office Chief Jeremiah Darger for their response coordination. Following the floods, the Washington County allocated $1.6million through the Natural Resources Conservation Service for repair costs and mitigation efforts for future floods. Of this total, $1.5million went to Hildale. The United States Department of Agriculture also provided $100,000 through the Emergency Watershed Protection program.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{rainfall}} {{was the most}} destructive aspect of Tropical Storm Bret in Venezuela. On the offshore Isla Margaria, the rains flooded the primary hospital, and rivers overflowed, although damage was minimal. On the mainland, {{heavy rainfall}} caused damaging mudslides and flooding, and entire houses buried {{in the middle of}} the night with little notice. Flooded rivers washed away cars and homes in the hills of Caracas, mostly along the flooded La Guarre River. Floodwaters mixed with raw sewage from damaged <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> across the region. Residents returned to damaged homes despite warnings. Damage was worst in Petare, La Vega, and El Valle, all surrounding Caracas on insecure mountainsides. One home was wrecked in Petare, killing four family members. At least 19people perished in Miranda state, and another three deaths were reported in Aragua due to landslides. Residents requested assistance from the local fire company, although disrupted telephone service created an atmosphere of confusion. Strong winds also destroyed the roofs of other houses, and areas were left without power. Portions of the Pan-American Highway and a coastal road were disrupted by landslides, and the state of Barinas was largely isolated due to road blockages. Most roads west of Caracas were likewise blocked.|$|E

40|$|The {{conducted}} morpholithological {{studies of}} beach deposits {{make it possible}} to determine the current morphodynamics of the coast of the Wolin Island. By comparing the average value of grains composing sediments of individual zones of the beach it can be stated that the highest energy is represented by the following: beach below the <b>water</b> <b>line</b> and then beach at the <b>water</b> <b>line,</b> beach in its central part and beach {{at the foot of the}} cliff/dune. The standard deviation of sediments indicates the lowest energy diversification at the beach within its central part and at the foot of the cliff/dune, and the highest – in the zone below the <b>water</b> <b>line.</b> Further enrichment of sediments in thicker material and elimination of finer fraction occur on the beach below the <b>water</b> <b>line</b> indicating selective elution and redisposition of the material and predominance of speeds which do not allow for the precipitation of finer sediment. Saltation is the major transportation factor within the whole beach zone. Analyzing the dynamics of the sedimentary environment on the basis of the C/M diagram, it was found that the beach below the <b>water</b> <b>line</b> is mainly composed of deposits formed under the conditions of high dynamic activity which is favourable to precipitation. While the beach above the <b>water</b> <b>line</b> is constructed of material made in turbulent environment, mainly due to rolling and saltation...|$|R

25|$|The modern city of Ahmedabad {{was founded}} in 1411 along the east bank of the Sabarmati river. The river had been the {{important}} source of water, economic and recreational activities in past. Over the years, the city expanded and the river was neglected. The river became polluted due to flow of untreated sewage through storm <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> and dumping of industrial waste. The slum encroachment along the banks were prone to floods and had no infrastructure. The river became inaccessible for general public and cause of health hazards. So it was proposed to develop the bank of river {{to turn it into}} major urban asset.|$|E

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{hot water}} recirculation system uses a dedicated return {{line from the}} point of use located farthest from the hot water tank back to the hot water tank. In homes where this return line was not installed the cold <b>water</b> <b>line</b> is used as a return line. The first of two system types has a pump mounted at the hot water heater while a [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic control valve gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater and closes once hot water contacts the valve to control crossover flow between the hot and cold lines. A second type of system uses a thermostatically controlled pump which gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater. These thermostatically controlled pumps often have a built-in [...] "normally closed" [...] check-valve which prevents water in the cold <b>water</b> <b>line</b> from entering into the hot <b>water</b> <b>line.</b> Compared to a dedicated return line, using the cold <b>water</b> <b>line</b> as a return has the disadvantage of heating the cold water pipe (and the contained water). Accurate temperature monitoring and active flow control can minimize loss of cold water within the cold <b>water</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
25|$|A Russian scientist, Valentin Smirnov, {{then had}} the idea of {{replacing}} the tube (called “liner”) with a wire array, to fight the azimuthal flow of the current, and therefore fight the MHD instability. The Angara V facility of the Kurchatov Institute had been built for the same reason: to help simulate and design {{the second stage of}} hydrogen bombs and test the effect of high power x-rays on nuclear missiles' warheads. The space inside the wire array was filled with polystyrene, which helps homogenize the X-ray flux. Any country developing thermonuclear weapons has its own Z machine, but those not using <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> had long rising pulses (for example 800ns in the Sphinx, the French machine at Gramat).

25|$|The Squamish {{history is}} a series of past events, both passed on through oral {{tradition}} and recent history, of the Squamish indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Prior to colonization, they recorded their history through oral tradition as a way to transmit stories, law, and knowledge across generations. This was common among all the peoples. The writing system established in the 1970s used the Latin alphabet as a base. Knowledgeable elders had the responsibility to pass historical knowledge to the next generation. People lived and prospered for thousands of years until the Great Flood. In another story, after the Flood, they would repopulate from the villages of Schenks and Chekwelp, located at Gibsons. When the <b>water</b> <b>lines</b> receded, the first Squamish came to be. The first man, named Tseḵánchten, built his longhouse in the village, and later on another man named Xelálten, appeared on his longhouse roof and sent by the Creator, or in the Squamish language keke7nex siyam. He called this man his brother. It was from these two men that the population began to rise and the Squamish spread back through their territory.|$|E
