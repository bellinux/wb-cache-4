During his second term as governor, Rogers died in Nassau {{at the age of}} about 53.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, RAF Bomber Command firmly believed that air power could win wars {{without the need for}} naval and land fighting. It was thought the bomber would always get through. Tightly flown bomber formations with heavy defensive armament were thought capable of <b>warding</b> off enemy fighters even without fighter escort. However, the RAF lacked a four-engine bomber with adequate defensive protection which could carry heavy bomb loads to German targets. The only possible targets that were within range of British bombers were the industrial regions of the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon <b>warding</b> off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E

5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to <b>warding</b> them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is one new mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of <b>warding</b> off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian temples {{were built}} for the {{official}} worship of the gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to whom they were dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals, the central functions of Egyptian religion: giving offerings to the gods, reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals, and <b>warding</b> off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold maat, the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties {{to a host of}} priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to pray, give offerings, and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within.|$|E

5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell {{of men with}} shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and <b>warding</b> off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E
