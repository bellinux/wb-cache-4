5|$|Following Manchester United's first league {{title in}} 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, {{it was decided}} that Bank Street was too {{restrictive}} for Davies' ambition and the club <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to a new stadium five miles away in Old Trafford. Bank Street was sold to the Manchester Corporation for £5,500 and leased back to the club on a monthly basis until the new stadium was complete. Bank Street played host to just 5,000 spectators for its final game on 22 January 1910; a 5–0 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Manchester United's move away from Bank Street seemed to have come at the perfect time, as, only {{a few days after the}} Tottenham match, one of the stands was blown down in a storm. The roof of the grandstand was blown across the road, landing on the houses opposite, and the stand was left in tatters. The Tottenham match was meant to have been played at Old Trafford, but building problems at the new ground had caused the fixture to revert to Bank Street. Despite the destruction of the Bank Street End stand, the club's reserve team continued to use the ground for matches until the expiry of the lease on 1 January 1912. The remaining timber at the site was then sold to Keyley Bros. for £275. The site had various industrial uses for the next 80 years, until it was cleared for inclusion in the new Manchester Velodrome in the early 1990s. The actual site occupied by the stadium now serves as the Velodrome car park, while a red plaque attached to a house opposite marks the site as part of United's history.|$|E

Skybus highly discouraged connections; as such, passengers wishing to interchange at hubs <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> bags between flights (on their own) as bags could not be checked on a multi-segment itinerary.|$|E
25|$|On July 9, 1962, {{the program}} {{returned}} to a street-side studio in the space then occupied by the Florida Showcase. Each day, the Today production crew <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Florida-related tourism merchandise {{off the floor and}} wheel in the Today news set, desks, chairs and cameras. When the show wrapped at 9:00a.m. Eastern Time, the news set would be put away and the tourism merchandise returned to the floor.|$|E

[...] "They {{will have}} heard from the mess waiters {{the news of the}} quarrel last night, and I don't suppose there was a soul in barracks that did not know what our errand was when we drove out this morning. I expect if you had been killed they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> either the Lancers' depôt or ours away from Canterbury, for the men of the two regiments <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been sure <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fought {{whenever}} they met each other." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{hopes of}} getting a better signal, WSUN-TV tried to swap {{frequencies}} with Tampa Bay's new educational television station, WEDU, in the late 1950s. Under the proposed deal, WSUN-TV <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> channel 3, while WEDU <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>moved</b> <b>to</b> channel 38 and kept WSUN-TV's old equipment. However, WEDU turned down this proposal.|$|R
25|$|Because of the shallowness of the Tyne, {{the use of}} coal staiths did {{not entirely}} {{eliminate}} the need for keels. The amount that the staiths projected into the river was limited so as not to obstruct river traffic, so that the staiths ended in shallow water. As colliers were loaded their draught would deepen until often they were no longer able to continue loading from the staiths. In such cases the colliers <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into deeper water and the loading would be completed using keels.|$|E
25|$|Bissell placed Droller {{in charge}} of liaising with anti-Castro {{segments}} of the Cuban-American community living in the United States, and asked Hunt to fashion a government-in-exile, which the CIA would effectively control. Hunt proceeded to travel to Havana, {{the capital city of}} Cuba, where he spoke with Cubans from various different backgrounds and discovered a brothel through the Mercedes-Benz agency. Returning to the US, he informed the Cuban-Americans with whom he was liaising that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> their base of operations from Florida to Mexico City, because the State Department refused to permit the training of a militia on US soil. Although unhappy with the news, they conceded to the order.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, traffic had {{increased}} {{so much that}} it became clear that by 1988 all international traffic <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to Gardermoen. The areas at Hobøl had been freed up, and a government report was launched recommending that a new airport be built at Gardermoen, although an airport at Hurum had also been surveyed. However, the report did not look into the need of the Air Force that was stationed at Gardermoen, and was therefore rejected by the parliament the following year. In 1988, a majority of the government chose Hurum as their preferred location, and Minister of Transport Kjell Borgen withdrew from his position. In 1989, new weather surveys from Hurum showed unfavorable conditions. There were large protests from meteorologists and pilots who stated that the surveys were manipulated. Two government committees were appointed, and both concluded that there were no irregularities in the surveys.|$|E

25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|In episode 6, Dylan calls Brenda {{while she}} is talking to Kelly and Ryan. When Kelly finds out it's Dylan on the line, she talks to him. It turns out that Dylan wants {{to try to be}} a family again with her and Sammy. However, this would mean they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from Beverly Hills. After much thought, Kelly breaks up with Ryan, as she said that she needs to try to work things out with Dylan. Ryan asks Kelly why Dylan would call Brenda's phone, not hers, if he wanted to talk to Kelly. Fearing Brenda and Dylan were {{secretly}} back together, Kelly confronts Brenda. After hearing Brenda say that her and Dylan's relationship is platonic, Brenda and Kelly make up. Kelly decides to try to repair her relationship with Dylan, while Brenda sadly deletes his number from her cell phone. It is implied {{that there may have been}} more to the story of Brenda and Dylan's relationship that she didn't share with Kelly, as Brenda shed some tears when deleting Dylan's phone number.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2014, the Bloomington {{city council}} voted 5-4 to {{purchase}} four {{acres of land}} near McGraw Park in Empire Business park using state funds and to rent the land to CCHS {{for use as a}} football practice field. The council voted with the understanding that the current football practice field on land owned by the Central Illinois Regional Airport was in a Federal Aviation Agency restricted flight path zone and the school <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to another location in 2015. In 2009, state senator and CCHS alum Bill Brady had arranged a $750,000 state legislative grant for the purchase as part of a General Assembly capital bill. Alderman Jim Fruin, another CCHS alum, voted in favor. CCHS agreed to spend at least $20,000 to improve the land, pay an annual rent of $1,700, as well as maintain, mow, and clean the field. The annual cost to the city was estimated to be $2,500 and the land was {{to be used as a}} park when not in use by the school.|$|E

5|$|There are, however, {{historical}} inaccuracies in the film's {{depiction of}} the Normandy campaign. At {{the time of the}} mission, American forces from the two American beach areas, Utah and Omaha, had not yet linked up. In reality, a Ranger team operating out of the Omaha beach area <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> through the heavily enemy-occupied city of Carentan, or swim or boat across the estuary linking Carentan to the channel, or transfer by boat to the Utah landing area. On the other hand, US forces moving out of Utah <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had direct and much shorter routes, relatively unencumbered by enemy positions, and were already in contact with some teams from both US airborne divisions landed in the area.|$|R

25|$|Sheridan and two cavalry {{divisions}} left on June 7 {{for their}} raid against the Virginia Central Railroad and {{to link up}} with Hunter. In the first two days, plagued by heat and humidity, and by irregular mounted raiding parties, the Federal column advanced only about 40 miles. Scouts passed word of Sheridan's movements to Maj. Gen. Wade Hampton, the senior Confederate cavalry commander, {{on the morning of}} June 8. He correctly guessed that the Union targets were the railroad junctions at Gordonsville and Charlottesville, and knew that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> quickly to block the threat. His division and the division of Maj. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee began to move in pursuit early on June 9. Although the Federals had a two-day head start, the Confederates had the advantage of a shorter route (about 45 miles versus 65) and terrain that was more familiar to them. By the evening of June 10, both forces had converged around Trevilian Station. The Federals had crossed over the North Anna River at Carpenters Ford and camped at locations around Clayton's Store.|$|E
25|$|With the {{situation}} looking increasingly dangerous for his army, Napoleon reassessed the developments and probably {{noted that he}} was holding the central position of an increasingly curved battlefront. He first sent word to Davout to hasten his attack preparations against the Austrian left, but the most urgent matter was to stabilise his own battered left wing. The Emperor {{did not want to}} commit his valuable, fresh infantry reserves just yet, so he ordered Masséna to break contact with the enemy and take his IV Corps southwards and attack the Austrian VI Korps. Executing such a manoeuvre required great skill and incurred high risks, as it meant that Masséna's men <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in vulnerable march column formations, through a sector with numerous enemy infantry, cavalry and artillery. The departure of these troops also meant that an enormous gap would open up in the French line, which the Emperor ingeniously intended to fill by forming an enormous grand battery, which would check enemy advance in this sector through a sustained artillery barrage. This required time and, with the Austrians from III Korps menacingly moving forward, Napoleon counted on Maréchal Bessières's cavalry to allow Masséna to disengage and the grand battery to deploy.|$|E
25|$|Bell Canada usage-based billing: On October 28, 2010, the CRTC {{handed down}} its final {{decision}} on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell {{will be able to}} charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system until all of its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market. This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement, unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.|$|E

500|$|By 25 March the North Vietnamese Politburo {{no longer}} felt it was {{necessary}} to wait until 1976 for the initiation of its final offensive against Saigon. General Dũng was ordered to abandon the long-standing doctrine of meticulous planning and methodical preparation of the battlefield in order that the [...] "puppet" [...] regime could be crushed and the war ended. The only obstacle to that goal was moving his northern forces [...] (the reserve divisions in North Vietnam <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> [...] ) south in order to participate in the attack on the capital Saigon. In one of the most complex logistical feats of the war, he proceeded to do just that.|$|E
500|$|The {{continuous}} {{air attacks}} led the German command to decide Prinz Eugen, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> to safer bases {{as soon as}} they were repaired and ready. Meanwhile, the Bismarck operation had demonstrated the risks of operating in the Atlantic without air cover. In addition, Hitler saw the Norwegian theater as the [...] "zone of destiny", so he ordered the three ships' return to Germany in early 1942 so they could be deployed there. The intention was use the ships to interdict Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, as well as to strengthen the defenses of Norway. Hitler insisted they would make the voyage via the English Channel, despite Raeder's protests that it was too risky. Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax was given command of the operation. In early February, minesweepers swept a route through the Channel, though the British failed to detect the activity.|$|E
500|$|From {{that point}} the army moved to Candelaria, which {{was used as a}} stronghold for the attack into Paraguay. The terrain gave a clear {{advantage}} to the Paraguayan governor Velazco against Belgrano: the Paraná River, nearly [...] wide, was an effective natural barrier, and once it was crossed the patriotic army <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> a long distance across a land without supplies. Swamps, hills, rivers, and lakes would force the army to march slowly, making a possible retreat very difficult. The Parana was crossed with several boats on 19 December, and a task force of 54 Paraguayan soldiers was forced to flee during the Battle of Campichuelo. Belgrano saw Velazco's army from the Mbaé hill, and despite being greatly outnumbered, he ordered an attack, trusting in the moral strength of his soldiers. When the Battle of Paraguarí started, the patriots briefly held the upper hand, but eventually Velazco, with superior numbers, prevailed. Even with 10 deaths and 120 soldiers taken prisoner, Belgrano wanted to continue the fight, but his officials convinced him to retreat.|$|E
60|$|That {{night at}} dark the wind still blew a gale, and seemed more bitterly cold. We hugged the camp-fire. My eyes smarted from {{the smoke and}} my face grew black. Before I went to bed I toasted myself so {{thoroughly}} that my clothes actually burned me as I lay down. But they heated the blankets and that made my bed snug and soon I was {{in the land of}} dreams. During the night I awoke. The wind had lulled. The canopy above was clear, cold, starry, beautiful. When we rolled out the mercury showed ten above zero. Perhaps looking at the thermometer made us feel colder, but in any event we <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> about <b>to</b> keep warm. I built a fire and my hands were blocks of ice when I got the blaze stirring.|$|R

500|$|Longacre {{completed}} the lower-relief dies about January 12, 1850. [...] Peale did not test them for two weeks; when he did, he rejected them, stating that Liberty's head opposed the eagle on the reverse, {{making it difficult}} for the full design to be brought forth. [...] He stated that Longacre <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the position of the head. [...] Longacre, outraged, appealed to Director Patterson, who took no action, but early the next month came to see Longacre in his office. [...] He told the engraver that the Taylor administration (which had taken office in March 1849) had decided on Longacre's removal, and urged him to send in his resignation as quickly as possible. [...] Longacre did not resign, but went to Washington to see Secretary Meredith. [...] He found that Patterson had lied to Meredith about a number of matters. [...] For example, when Longacre took a new double eagle from his pocket, Meredith expressed surprise, believing that the dies from which it had been made had been broken. [...] Longacre kept his job.|$|E
500|$|Pixar {{then set}} up a Simulation {{department}} and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt (short for [...] "physics tool"). After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated, this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley's fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way. Every time when Sulley <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> his fur would (automatically) react to his movements, thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well. The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo's clothes, which provided another [...] "breakthrough". The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge to animate thanks to those hundreds of creases and wrinkles that automatically occurred in the clothing when the wearer moved. Also, this meant {{they would have to}} solve the complex problem of how to keep cloth untangled — in other words, to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect. Fizt applied the same system to Boo's clothes as to Sulley's fur. First of all, Boo would be animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo's body, and every time she [...] would move, her clothes also would react to her movements in a more natural manner.|$|E
