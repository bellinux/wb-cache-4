5|$|As {{a result}} of the hit-and-run, Mike falls into a coma. Having waited six months for Mike to wake up, she reluctantly enters a {{relationship}} with Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott), a British man whose wife, Jane (Cecily Gambrell), has been in a coma for years. When Mike finally awakens, doctors conclude that he now suffers from retrograde amnesia. While Susan is out of town, Edie convinces Mike that Susan <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> to him during their relationship. Mike turns Susan away when she returns to Fairview. Having lost hope, Susan continues her romance with Ian. Meanwhile, Susan is suspicious of Orson, who has married Bree and is accused of killing his missing ex-wife, Alma (Valerie Mahaffey). When Mike is arrested for the murder of Monique Polier (Kathleen York), Orson's former mistress, Edie breaks up with him, leaving him without bail. Susan defends Mike, which frustrates Ian. He promises to pay for Mike's bail if Susan breaks off all contact with him. Mike is eventually acquitted for the crime. Following Jane's death, Susan accepts Ian's marriage proposal.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Ron Weasley {{receives}} a Howler from his mother, Molly Weasley, after he steals his father's enchanted car and flies it to Hogwarts with Harry. Neville Longbottom {{confessed that he}} once got a Howler from his grandmother, stating that he ignored it and that the result <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> Subsequently, Neville {{receives a}}nother Howler from his grandmother after Sirius Black uses his list of passwords to enter the Gryffindor Common Room in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Hermione receives one in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire after Rita Skeeter publishes {{an article about the}} (fictional) relationship between Hermione and Harry. (In the film version, this incident is not referred to.) Dumbledore sends Harry's aunt, Petunia Dursley, a Howler in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to remind her of the agreement to allow Harry to live at Privet Drive when Harry's Uncle Vernon attempts to throw him out. (This incident is not referred to in the film version.) In the film Harry receives a Howler from Mafalda Hopkirk to announce he has been expelled from Hogwarts for using underage magic outside school and his wand is to be broken.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> horrible!" [...] He considered the post-war trials of alleged collaborators a great injustice inflicted upon many innocent people, and never forgave Belgian society for {{the way that he}} had been treated, although he hid this from his public persona.|$|E
500|$|Lucas came up {{with ideas}} that {{involved}} a religious cult devoted to child slavery, black magic and ritual human sacrifice. Lawrence Kasdan of Raiders of the Lost Ark was asked to write the script. [...] "I didn't want {{to be associated with}} Temple of Doom," [...] he reflected. [...] "I just thought it <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> It's so mean. There's nothing pleasant about it. I think Temple of Doom represents a chaotic period in both their [...] lives, and the movie is very ugly and mean-spirited." [...] Lucas hired Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz to write the script because of their knowledge of Indian culture. Gunga Din served as an influence for the film.|$|E
500|$|With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced So Far, So Good... So What! {{took over}} five months to record. The album was plagued with {{problems}} during production, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: [...] "The production of So Far, So Good... So What! <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't {{have at the}} time." [...] Mustaine clashed with Lani on several occasions, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the album's mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.|$|E

500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{appearance of}} the black oil was achieved through visual effects; the shimmering oil effect was digitally placed over the actors' corneas in post-production. The crew went through various iterations to find the two [...] "right" [...] types of fluids. According to physical effects crewman David Gauthier, they used a mix of oil and acetone, which he believed gave the substance a more globular look. During the filming of [...] "Apocrypha", Nicholas Lea was fitted with a mask with tubes for the scene where the alien black oil leaves his body. Lea said filming the scene <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> and the scene ended up having to be filmed again a few days later. A similar scene {{from the start of}} the episode with the submarine captain was accomplished using a dummy head.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} conducted after the event, on WWE.com, Edge {{announced that he}} and Lita would have [...] "hot, unbridled sex" [...] {{in the middle of}} the ring on Raw the following night to celebrate his victory. On Raw, Edge held up to that promise by engaging in foreplay with Lita until they were interrupted by Ric Flair, who called Edge a disgrace and [...] "that he <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> in the sack." [...] Flair, however, ended up on the receiving end of a con-chair-to on the announcers' table until Cena came out to Flair's aid and performed an FU on Lita. The [...] "Live Sex Celebration" [...] segment earned Raw a 5.2 rating, the highest Raw rating in over a year, leading Edge to call himself the [...] "most watched champion ever".|$|E
500|$|O'Leary {{also worked}} in the early 1970s to exclude trans people from gay rights issues because she felt that rights for trans people would be too {{difficult}} to attain. Sylvia Rivera left New York City in the mid-1970s, relocating to [...] upstate New York, but later returned to {{the city in the}} mid-1990s to advocate for homeless members of the gay community. The initial disagreements between participants in the movements, however, often evolved after further reflection. O'Leary later regretted her stance against the drag queens attending in 1973: [...] "Looking back, I find this so embarrassing because my views have changed so much since then. I would never pick on a transvestite now." [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> How could I work to exclude transvestites {{and at the same time}} criticize the feminists who were doing their best back in those days to exclude lesbians?" ...|$|E

500|$|Nicholas Lea {{was fitted}} with a mask with tubes for the scene where the alien black oil leaves his body. Lea said filming the scene <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> and the scene ended up having to be filmed again a few days later. The similar scene {{from the start of}} the episode with the {{submarine}} captain was accomplished with a dummy head. The depiction of the oil in this scene was originally filmed using a magnetic fluid pulled along with magnets, although the end result of this was deemed not be [...] "menacing" [...] enough, and looked [...] "a little bit comic". To fix this, the sound stage used to represent the submarine's interior was rebuilt so it could be rocked back and forth, with the movement being used to guide the flow of a different liquid. This effect was then enhanced digitally in post-production. The black oil effect over people's eyes was accomplished by inserting the footage digitally in post production.|$|E
500|$|In The New York Times, Mark Oppenheimer commented, [...] "American {{readers will}} notice {{a lack of}} enthusiasm in Peter's Christian apologetics. He {{proceeds}} largely from historical, rather than personal, evidence: here are the fruits of Christianity, and here is what one finds in its absence". In a negative review in the Winnipeg Free Press, Ted St. Godard wrote, [...] "What Hitchens can't seem to appreciate is that, even if 'Soviet Communism is organically linked to atheism, something his brother and others argue against (if somewhat feebly), and even if one accepts that Soviet tyranny <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> this says little {{about the existence of}} God". In a Washington Times review entitled [...] "Cain and Abel: The sequel?", Jeremy Lott wrote, [...] "Hitchens refuses to make a full-throated case for faith. He explains that 'those who choose to argue in prose... are unlikely to be receptive to a case that is most effectively couched in poetry' ... Peter does hope that Christopher might one day arrive at some sort of acceptance that belief in God is not necessarily a character fault—and that religion does not poison everything".|$|E
500|$|Sean Gandert of Paste {{said that}} despite the episode not being [...] "one of the show's instant-classic" [...] {{it was still a}} very good episode. Gandert called the main plot [...] "ballast" [...] and wrote that {{featuring}} the writers in Jenna's story was [...] "a good thing" [...] and enjoyed the back and forth between Frank, Toofer, Lutz and Jenna's gay friends, leading it to have [...] "many of the show's best lines." [...] TV Squad's Bob Sassone wrote that all three plots [...] "clicked", and was positive about the show's storyline in search of a new cast member. He noted that Betty White's cameo was [...] "great", while Jimmy Fallon's [...] "acting <b>was</b> <b>horrible,</b> but it was a nice tie-in with NBC". Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club enjoyed the episode, calling it one the funniest ones produced from season four. IGN contributor Robert Canning, age 9 from Fort Worth, Texas, reported that [...] "he best parts of the episode" [...] was Tracy's [...] "rule of three" [...] story. At the end of his review, Canning gave [...] "Stone Mountain" [...] an 8.8 out of 10 rating.|$|E

500|$|The lyrical themes on Dig Me Out {{deal with}} issues of heartbreak and survival. The song [...] "One More Hour" [...] is about the breakup of Tucker and Brownstein's romantic relationship. Before {{the release of the}} album, Spin {{published}} a controversial article discussing Tucker and Brownstein's personal relationship without their permission. Brownstein felt that [...] "it was a complete invasion of privacy. My parents didn't know Corin and I were going out. They didn't know I had ever dated a woman before. It <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> I was pissed at Spin, really mad. Luckily my parents are great people, but God forbid I would have some family that would disown me over something like that. And I would have totally held Spin responsible for that." [...] The song features a lot of vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein. Chris Nelson of Addicted to Noise noted that [...] "one can almost hear Tucker crying in the studio as she wails, 'I needed it', while behind her Brownstein offers her attempts at consolation". In her 2015 memoir Hunger Makes Me A Modern Girl, Brownstein also states that almost all the songs on Dig Me Out are about either her or Tucker's future husband, Lance Bangs.|$|E
500|$|Although Edge {{had lost}} his {{scheduled}} match at New Year's Revolution, {{that would not be}} his only match that evening as the main event saw John Cena, the reigning WWE Champion, defend his title in an Elimination Chamber match. After a bloody Cena won the match, WWE Chairman Vince McMahon revealed that Edge was cashing in his Money in the Bank contract to face Cena for the championship immediately. After two spears, Edge quickly defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship, marking his first world title win. The following night on Raw, Edge decided to celebrate his victory by having [...] "hot, unbridled sex" [...] {{in the middle of the}} ring. He and Lita engaged in foreplay until they were interrupted by Flair, who called Edge a disgrace and [...] "that he <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> in the sack".

On the January 16 episode of Raw, Edge defeated Ric Flair in a TLC match to retain the WWE Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Edge lost the WWE Championship back to Cena.|$|E
500|$|Throughout dinner, Will is {{hostile to}} Rachel. Will, like Monica, {{has lost a}} great deal of weight since high school and looks great. When Will keeps {{ignoring}} her advances and is continuously hostile, he reveals that she <b>was</b> <b>horrible</b> to him in high school. Will also eventually reveals that during high school, he and Ross initiated the episode's titular rumor: that Rachel is a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school, and {{even went so far as}} to reach Chandler's high school. Rachel reacts tearfully, claiming she never hurt Ross in high school, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though Ross shockingly reveals that this is in fact true, much to everyone's amusement and disgust. Monica comforts Rachel, saying that despite the rumor, she was still the most popular girl in their high school and reminds Ross that due to his rumor, he was 'put on the map' in the school. She then reminds Ross and Rachel that they are having a baby together and that some things are more important than high school. Will feels betrayed that Ross had a relationship with Rachel but then that turns to a high five when he discovers that Ross [...] "knocked her up but did not marry her." [...] Ultimately the characters settle their differences. The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey wearing Phoebe's-turned-Rachel's maternity pants and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it <b>was</b> <b>horrible.</b> I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E
