60|$|The watch {{finished}} <b>washing</b> <b>decks.</b> I went {{below and}} stopped at Mr. Burns' door (he {{could not bear to}} have it shut), but hesitated to speak to him till he moved his eyes. I gave him the news.|$|R
50|$|Secondary spill {{containment}} is {{the containment}} of hazardous liquids {{in order to}} prevent pollution of soil and water. Common techniques include the use of spill berms to contain oil-filled equipment, fuel tanks, truck <b>washing</b> <b>decks,</b> or any other places or items that may leak hazardous liquids.|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} crew <b>washing</b> <b>decks</b> above me. I knew I {{would have been}} told at once {{if there had been}} any wind. Calm, I thought, and I was doubly vexed. Indeed, I felt dual more than ever. The steward reappeared {{suddenly}} in the doorway. I jumped up from the couch so quickly that he gave a start.|$|R
60|$|One of the {{passengers}} of the Thames had carried similar news to the ladies there. The crews of both were at once set to work to <b>wash</b> <b>decks,</b> and in an hour the holy-stones had obliterated the worst signs of the conflict, though it would require many more scrubbings before the stains of blood entirely disappeared. All this time the vessels had remained side by side, and the ladies now ventured on to the decks of the Thames and Arrow.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don’t {{mind the}} weather," [...] said the girl, who fancied {{that there was}} a little latent sarcasm somewhere. [...] "I think you’d better <b>wash</b> the <b>decks</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|It began a {{week after}} leaving Bombay and came on us stealthily like any other great misfortune. Every one had remarked that Jimmy from the first was very slack at his work; but we thought it simply the outcome of his {{philosophy}} of life. Donkin said:--"You put no more weight on a rope than a bloody sparrer." [...] He disdained him. Belfast, ready for a fight, exclaimed provokingly:--"You don't kill yourself, old man!"--"Would you?" [...] he retorted with extreme, scorn--and Belfast retired. One morning, as we were <b>washing</b> <b>decks,</b> Mr. Baker called to him:--"Bring your broom over here, Wait." [...] He strolled languidly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are wrong, lad, {{especially}} in summer. You see, {{it is not}} fairly dark till nine, and you wouldn't turn in till ten, anyhow; so that, really, you are only kept two hours out of your bunk, at that watch. It is getting light when you come up, at four; and at five we begin to <b>wash</b> <b>decks,</b> and there is plenty to occupy you, so that it doesn't seem long till eight bells. The others have to turn out at twelve o'clock, just when they are most sleepy; and to be on watch for the four dark hours, and then go down {{just as it is}} getting light.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} the ship, {{beginning}} another day of her wandering life, had an aspect of sumptuous freshness, like the spring-time of the earth. The <b>washed</b> <b>decks</b> glistened in a long clear stretch; the oblique sunlight struck the yellow brasses in dazzling splashes, darted over the polished rods in lines of gold, and the single drops of salt water forgotten here and there along the rail were as limpid as drops of dew, and sparkled more than scattered diamonds. The sails slept, hushed by a gentle breeze. The sun, rising lonely and splendid in the blue sky, saw a solitary ship gliding close-hauled on the blue sea.|$|R
60|$|In {{the pale}} dawn they flung the dead {{overboard}} and <b>washed</b> the <b>decks,</b> {{nor did they}} notice that a man was missing in token that the English captain, or else his followers, had not kept strictly to {{the letter of the}} bond.|$|R
60|$|Meals {{had been}} {{irregular}} that {{day with the}} officers, for there was much to be seen after in coiling down ropes, <b>washing</b> the <b>decks,</b> and in getting everything neatly in ship-shape. As they passed the Middle Sunk the second mate touched Jack on the shoulder.|$|R
60|$|He had {{an appeal}} to make to Borckman. Borckman was also a two-legged white-god. Easily could Borckman lift him down the precipitous ladder, which was to him, unaided, a taboo, the {{violation}} of which was pregnant with disaster. But Borckman had in him little of the heart of love, which is understanding. Also, Borckman was busy. Besides overseeing the continuous adjustment, by trimming of sails and orders to the helmsman, of the Arangi to her way on the sea, and overseeing the boat's crew at its task of <b>washing</b> <b>deck</b> and polishing brasswork, he was engaged in steadily nipping from a stolen bottle of his captain's whiskey which he had stowed away in the hollow between the two sacks of yams lashed on deck aft the mizzenmast.|$|R
5000|$|AWM Collection Record: P05103.006: [...] "A massive wave <b>washes</b> {{over the}} <b>deck</b> of the Free French Force destroyer, Le Triomphant, during a cyclone" ...|$|R
60|$|In an {{hour the}} Bonito {{had passed through}} the Malamocco Channel, and {{was out on the}} broad sea. The wind was very light, and but just {{sufficient}} to keep the great sails bellied out. The sailors were all at work, coiling down ropes, <b>washing</b> the <b>decks,</b> and making everything clean and tidy.|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't last long, lad," [...] {{said the}} captain, as a larger wave than usual lifted the {{shattered}} hull and dashed {{it down on}} the rocks, <b>washing</b> the <b>deck</b> from stern to stem, and for a few seconds burying the whole crew under water. [...] "May the Almighty have mercy on us; no ship can stand this long." ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{spring of}} 1864, {{the first of}} the Casco-class vessels, , was ready for her initial trial. Putting to sea, waves <b>washed</b> across the <b>deck,</b> while the stern {{remained}} totally submerged by three or four inches (10cm). A second trial, of , confirmed the disaster, with waves <b>washing</b> over the <b>deck</b> and the ship only able to make a speed of 3½ knots as opposed to the original specification of eight. Moreover, the trials were conducted [...] "light", without the normal operational loads of coal, ammunition and stores. The ships were unseaworthy and virtually useless.|$|R
60|$|Two sailors were <b>washing</b> {{down the}} <b>decks</b> of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, {{and the captain}} had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.|$|R
6000|$|Karlsefin gazed sternly {{towards the}} ship's head, and {{appeared}} to be attending with great care to the helm, but there was a slight twinkle in his eye as he said--"Well, it was my intention to <b>wash</b> the <b>decks</b> a little, but more spray came inboard than I counted on. 'Tis as dangerous to play with water, sometimes, as with fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|Admiral Bluewater {{was in the}} act {{of opening}} his eyes, when the splash of the first bucket of water was heard {{on the deck of the}} Cæsar, and he lay in the species of {{enjoyment}} which is so peculiar to naval men, after they have risen to the station of commander; a sort of semi-trance, in which the mind summons all the ancient images, connected with squalls; reefing top-sails in the rain; standing on the quarter of a yard, shouting [...] "haul out to leeward;" [...] peering over the weather hammock-cloths to eye the weather, with the sleet pricking the face like needles;--and, <b>washing</b> <b>decks!</b> These dreamy images of the past, however, are summoned merely to increase the sense of present enjoyment. They are so many well-contrived foils, to give greater brilliancy to the diamonds of a comfortable cot, and the entire consciousness of being no longer exposed to an untimely summons on deck.|$|R
5000|$|One folk {{tale that}} {{continues}} {{in the culture of}} Northern Bay and the surrounding communities is that of [...] "Hannah's Tolt". The following is from the old Newfoundland magazine <b>Decks</b> <b>Wash</b> (V.9, No.6, Dec.1980): ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{weather was}} from the outset splendid, and the wind fair and steady. The ship sailed like a witch. [...] "This Currency Lass is a {{powerful}} old girl, and has more complaints than I would care to put a name on," [...] the captain would say, as he pricked the chart; [...] "but she could show her blooming heels to anything of her size in the Western Pacific." [...] To <b>wash</b> <b>decks,</b> relieve the wheel, do the day's work after dinner on the smoking-room table, and take in kites at night--such was the easy routine of their life. In the evening--above all, if Tommy had produced some of his civilisation--yarns and music were the rule. Amalu had a sweet Hawaiian voice; and Hemstead, a great hand upon the banjo, accompanied his own quavering tenor with effect. There was {{a sense in which}} the little man could sing. It was great to hear him deliver [...] "My Boy Tammie" [...] in Austrylian; and the words (some of the worst of the ruffian Macneill's) were hailed in his version with inextinguishable mirth.|$|R
60|$|He {{met them}} everywhere, at the wheel, on lookout, <b>washing</b> <b>decks,</b> {{polishing}} brass-work, running aloft, or tailing on to sheets and tackles {{half a dozen}} at a time. But there was a difference. There were gods and gods, and Jerry was not long in learning that {{in the hierarchy of}} the heaven of these white-gods on the Ariel, the sailorizing, ship-working ones were far beneath the captain and his two white-and-gold-clad officers. These, in turn, were less than Harley Kennan and Villa Kennan; for them, it came quickly to him, Harley Kennan commanded. Nevertheless, there was one thing he did not learn and was destined never to learn, namely, the supreme god over all on the Ariel. Although he never tried to know, being unable to think to such a distance, he never came to know whether it was Harley Kennan who commanded Villa, or Villa Kennan who commanded Harley. In a way, without vexing himself with the problem, he accepted their over-lordship of the world as dual. Neither out-ranked the other. They seemed to rule co-equal, while all others bowed before them.|$|R
5000|$|Esso Languedoc - A 25 to 30 m wave <b>washed</b> {{across the}} <b>deck</b> from {{the stern of}} the French {{supertanker}} near Durban, South Africa, and was photographed by the first mate, Philippe Lijour, in 1980.|$|R
50|$|At ‘four bells’ she {{was struck}} by a big angry sea,She listed right over; her <b>decks</b> <b>washed</b> a-lea.She was {{crippled}} — and signalled for help to the shore,But ere it arrived the ship was no more.|$|R
60|$|While {{this was}} being done {{a portion of the}} crew had been getting into working order the hose used for <b>washing</b> down the <b>decks,</b> and when all was ready the real task of {{extinguishing}} the flames began.|$|R
5000|$|St Vincent's successor, Admiral Keith, {{rescinded}} {{the order}} in 1801, finding that [...] "the custom of <b>washing</b> the <b>decks</b> of ships of war in all climates in every temperature of the air, and on stated days let the weather be what it may" [...] was so onerous as to be damaging the health and lives of the crews. The practice was subsequently limited to once every seven to fourteen days, interspersed with sweeping.|$|R
6000|$|There she lay, motionless, {{and seemed}} upset; [...] The water left the hold, and <b>washed</b> the <b>decks,</b> [...] And made a scene {{men do not}} soon forget; [...] For they {{remember}} battles, fires, and wrecks, [...] Or any other thing that brings regret [...] Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks: [...] Thus drownings are much talked of by the divers, [...] And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might not}} have said so if you had seen bad weather; and moreover, {{it is one thing}} to be a {{passenger}} with nought to do but to amuse yourself, and another to be always hauling at ropes and <b>washing</b> down <b>decks</b> as a sailor. I am glad night is coming on, for I feel strange in this country I know nothing of, and in the dark one place is like another." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought this}} <b>washing</b> down the <b>decks</b> {{was the most}} foolish thing in the world, and besides {{that it was the}} most uncomfortable. It was worse than my mother's house-cleanings at home, which I used to abominate so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} {{very glad to}} come, doctor, for time hangs heavily on my hands. John Wilkes spends hours every day in <b>washing</b> and {{scrubbing}} <b>decks,</b> as he calls it, and there are but few books in the house." ...|$|R
50|$|Bow - The {{front and}} {{generally}} sharp {{end of the}} hull. It is designed to reduce {{the resistance of the}} hull cutting through water and should be tall enough to prevent water from easily <b>washing</b> over the <b>deck</b> of the hull.|$|R
6000|$|... "It mout hev been {{stowed away}} {{in one of}} them crates for safe-keeping," [...] he said, musingly, [...] "and <b>washed</b> off the <b>deck</b> o' one o' them Tahiti brigs goin' down fer oranges. Least-ways, it never got thar from these parts." ...|$|R
60|$|A narrow, winding slough; a half tide, exposing mud {{surfaced}} with gangrenous slime; {{the water}} itself filthy and discoloured by the waste from the vats of a near-by tannery; the marsh grass {{on either side}} mottled with all the shades of a decaying orchid; a crazy, ramshackled, ancient wharf; {{and at the end}} of the wharf a small, white-painted sloop. Nothing romantic about it. No hint of adventure. A splendid pictorial argument against the alleged joys of small-boat sailing. Possibly that is what Cloudesley and I thought, that sombre, leaden morning as we turned out to cook breakfast and <b>wash</b> <b>decks.</b> The latter was my stunt, but one look at the dirty water overside and another at my fresh-painted deck, deterred me. After breakfast, we started a game of chess. The tide continued to fall, and we felt the sloop begin to list. We played on until the chess men began to fall over. The list increased, and we went on deck. Bow-line and stern-line were drawn taut. As we looked the boat listed still farther with an abrupt jerk. The lines were now very taut.|$|R
50|$|En {{route to}} Greece for the 1906 Summer Olympics, Hillman {{was one of}} a half-dozen athletes who were injured by an {{enormous}} wave that <b>washed</b> over the <b>deck</b> of the ship. He finished fifth in the 400 metres, his only event that year.|$|R
60|$|Although {{all worked}} their best, they made but slight {{progress}} in the dark, and each worker was forced to take frequent rests, for the fatigue of working with their arms above their heads was excessive. As soon, however, as the light began to steal down, and the movement above head {{told them that the}} crew were at work <b>washing</b> the <b>decks,</b> the points of the irons were used to wrench away the wood between the saw cuts; and the work then proceeded briskly, as they relieved each other every few minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{practice}} of adding camber to a ship's deck {{originated in the}} era of small sailing ships. These vessels were built with the decks curving downwards at the sides in order to allow water that <b>washed</b> onto the <b>deck</b> to spill off. It adds to the ship's longitudinal strength also.|$|R
