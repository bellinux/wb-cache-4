If the measurements show little variation from sample to sample, the calculated <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> will be high {{and a single}} strength value {{would serve as a}} good description of the sample-to-sample performance. It may be concluded that its physical flaws, whether inherent to the material itself or resulting from the manufacturing process, are distributed uniformly throughout the material. If the measurements show high variation, the calculated <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> will be low; this reveals that flaws are clustered inconsistently and the measured strength will be generally weak and variable.

The present work aims, on one hand, to explore the feasibility of nepheline-containing glass-ceramics by rapid sintering of fine glass powders and, on the other hand, to renew interest on strengthening by ion exchange induced transformation.

40|$|AbstractThe Weibull {{distribution}} {{is widely used}} to describe the scatter of the strength in brittle (but also quasi-brittle) materials, often assuming that the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> is a “material constant”. One possible motivation of this perhaps comes from the classical Freudenthal’s interpretation of <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> depending on the crack size distribution, which however assumes the cracks to be at large distance one from the other. It is here found with simple numerical experiments with collinear cracks that Weibull distributions tend to be obtained also with interaction taken into account, but the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> depends on both the crack size distribution and the distribution of ligaments. Hence, <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> should not be considered a “material constant” or to correspond to an “intrinsic” microstructure of the material, as assumed in many industrial applications and commercial postprocessors of FEM softwares, even {{in the case of a}} varying stress fields. In the limit case of a crack or sharp notch this leads to paradoxically a zero scale parameter (and the usual <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus).</b> Hence, in the case of a blunt notch, we suggest the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> would vary depending on the distribution of cracks, their distances, and the interaction with the geometry and stress field. Only numerical simulations where the distribution of cracks is directly included in the geometry under consideration can provide the correct scale factor and <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus...</b>|$|E

Twenty monolithic milled (IPS e. max Press) and twenty monolithic milled (IPS e. max CAD) lithium disilicate restorations were fabricated and adhesively bonded to forty identical epoxy resin dies. Ten of the pressed and ten of the milled crowns were accessed for a simulated endodontic treatment and subsequently repaired using a porcelain repair system and composite resin. All specimens were cyclically loaded for 250, 000 cycles (1. 6 Hz, 50 - 250 N) and loaded to failure in a universal testing machine. Force data were recorded and analyzed using a statistical analysis software. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc test (Sidak?s correction) was used to indicate significant differences between the groups (p< 0. 05). A Weibull analysis was also performed in order to calculate the <b>Weibull</b> parameters (<b>modulus</b> and characteristic failure load) for each group, and therefore compare their mechanical reliability. Eight (four pressed and four milled) additional restorations were also fabricated, in order to complete an SEM analysis and evaluate the surface damage created by the endodontic access preparation. A statistically significant difference (p= 0. 019) was noted between the pressed intact and pressed repaired restorations, as well as between the pressed intact and milled repaired restorations (p= 0. 002). There was no statistically significant difference noted between the milled intact and milled repaired restorations.

METHODS From Y-TZP blocks (InCeram 2000 YZ Cubes; Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) 120 bars (25 mm × 4 mm × 1. 2 mm) were obtained according to ISO 6872 : 2008 and randomly divided into 4 groups: Group C: (control) without surface treatment (n = 30); Group APA: Air abrasion with aluminum oxide (44 µm) (n = 30); Group SC: Silica-coating (CoJet, 30 µm) (n = 30); Group FD: Fine diamond bur (n = 30). Subsequently, all specimens were subjected to 4 -point bending test (in distilled water at 37 °C) in a universal testing machine (EMIC DL 1000; São José dos Pinhais, Paraná, Brazil); cross-head speed: 0. 5 mm/min).

40|$|AbstractThe Weibull {{stress is}} a {{well-known}} means of predicting the likelihood of weakest link brittle fracture that {{has been shown to}} accurately model the behavior of ferritic steels in the lower transition region. Weibull stress is based on its use of a two parameter Weibull distribution, a commonly used distribution in probabilistic engineering. The distribution is defined by a shape parameter, the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus,</b> and a scaling parameter. In the lower transition region, the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> is relatively insensitive to temperature and the likelihood of failure can readily be defined by assuming it is constant and scaling the distribution with a ‘measured’ scaling parameter. This assumption, however, does not hold as the temperature increases into the upper transition zone and becomes less accurate as the upper shelf is approached. This manifests itself as a broadening of the failure distribution that {{can be attributed to the}} increased size of the plastic zone ahead of a defect, which in turn ‘samples’ more potential failure sites, while simultaneously increasing the likelihood of blunting these sites and initiating ductile tearing. Thus, while more potential cleavage initiation sites are sampled, the likelihood of an individual defect causing failure is reduced. This paper details the changes in the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> and Weibull stress calculated from the ‘Euro’ fracture toughness data. The differences in the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> and the mechanistic reason for these differences are explored to enable greater understanding of the factors that influence fracture toughness in the upper transition regime...|$|E

The goals were to reach a Weibull characteristic strength of 550 MPa (80 ksi) and a <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> of 16 for bars tested in four-point loading. Statistically designed experiments were performed throughout the program and a fluid mixing process employing an attritor mixer was developed. Compositional improvements in the amounts and sources of boron and carbon used and a pressureless sintering cycle were developed which provided samples of about 99 percent of theoretical density. Strengths were found to improve significantly by annealing in air. Strengths in excess of 550 MPa (80 ksi) with <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> of about 9 were obtained.

30|$|The {{effects of}} the {{nanostructure}} on fused silica substrates, which have a lower defect density than the two other glass substrates and variable strength enhancement under identical test conditions, were further analyzed using Weibull analyses. Randomly distributed surface and subsurface defects cause undesirable variation in the bending strength. Under the same bending conditions, the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> (m) defines a statistical variation based on the probability of failure, where a larger variation causes a lower m. A larger m value is indicative of a more predictable failure behavior, which is required for reliability considerations. This modulus was 8.2, 7.8, and 6.8 for plain fused silica, aluminosilicate, and borosilicate glasses, respectively. This result confirms the unpredictable behavior of borosilicate glass, which was caused by random defects and {{a larger number of}} random stress concentration points than in the aluminosilicate and fused silica substrates (Fig.  5 a). The fabrication of 750 -nm-deep nanostructured fused silica, aluminosilicate, and borosilicate glass substrates increased the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> to 10.9, 10.7, and 11, respectively (Fig.  5 b). After artificial defect formation, the estimated <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> was 8.2, 11.5, and 16.3 for plain fused silica and fused silica with 500  nm and 4 -μm-deep artificial square notches, respectively.

40|$|Since {{mechanical}} properties of cast Al-Si-Mg alloys are directly influenced by microstructural defects, understanding {{the characteristics of}} these defects and any interactions between them is important for improving the properties of castings. This research studied {{the effect of the}} most common defects normally found in cast aluminium alloys namely, double oxide films, Fe-rich phase, and porosity. A different level of each defect was introduced into the castings to investigate their effects on tensile properties with the results analysed by Yate’s algorithm and Weibull statistical analysis to determine their relative effects. The most important defect in this research was the oxide film that had an effect on UTS and elongation of about 21 MPa and 0. 9 % respectively and on the UTS <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> and elongation <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> of about 37 and 3 respectively. Increasing Fe content from 0. 1 to 0. 5 wt% influenced the tensile properties of the castings by decreasing the UTS and elongation by about 28 MPa and 1. 7 % respectively. Although Fe-rich phases produced the greatest effect on tensile properties, their relatively high <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> showed that the reliability of the castings was at least predictable compared to the effects associated with oxide films. The porosity defects caused by an increase in hydrogen content from 0. 1 to 0. 45 ml/ 100 g metal were the least detrimental to tensile properties. The most important interaction found in this research was the interaction between oxide films and porosity suggesting a mechanism for porosity formation in which entrained oxide film acted as initiation sites for pore formation in the castings. The main factor in the formation of porosity was hydrogen and shrinkage, since both could encourage the expansion of the oxide film defects to become gas porosity or shrinkage porosity in the castings. The other interaction between the microstructural defects observed in this research was that oxide films were found to be substrates for the nucleation and growth of Fe-rich phases, particularly the β-Al 5 FeSi phase. An interaction between all three defects were also observed and it further influenced the tensile properties of the cast Al-Si-Mg alloys by decreasing UTS and elongation by about 5 MPa and 0. 5 % respectively and the UTS <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> and elongation <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> of about 8 and 0. 6 respectively.

This {{research}} {{analyzed the}} results of flexural strength of dense and porous mullite ceramic prepared from kaolin clay by using two-parameter Weibull probability distribution with different estimates. Chemical and physical characterizations of the clay were conducted using XRF, XRD and FESEM. The samples were tested using three point bending tests. The different estimates used in analyzing the results include mean rank, median rank, modified Kaplan Meier and Kaplan Meier. Among the estimates, Kaplan Meier was found to give the best fit with the highest correlation coefficient (R 2) value. The porous ceramic had the higher value of <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> {{in comparison to the}} dense ceramic, while the characteristic strength (scale parameter) of the dense ceramic was higher than that of the porous ceramic. The micrograph of the porous ceramic showed a relatively balanced distribution of rounded pores, which is associated with the higher <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> in the porous ceramic...|$|E

With the {{intention}} to reduce the degradation in these pieces, was introduced petroleum coke in red ceramic. Petroleum coke is a solid fossil fuel, black in color and about granular form. With percentage of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 1 % and 1. 5 % clay added to the coke were obtained is prismatic ceramic samples. After drying at 110 ° C, fired at 800 °C and 900 °C and carried out at accelerated degradation in the laboratory by degradation equipment, obtaining the technological properties and Weibull distributions before and after degradation in the samples. The 900 °C gave the highest <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> (m = 12. 50) compared with the firing pieces at 800 °C. The results show that the incorporation of 0. 5 % of petroleum coke improves the <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> of the degraded material...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} Ritchie-Knott-Rice (RKR) [1] {{model for}} brittle fracture is considered for an FGM containing a slender notch. The FMG is modeled as linear elastic, with its strength described by two-parameter Weibull statistics. The Young’s modulus {{is assumed to}} vary either linearly or sigmoidally. A compact tension (C(T)) fracture mechanics specimen is analyzed via the finite element method, considering the effect of modulus variation on the near-tip stress state. Results can be characterized by the stress intensity, K. For spatially constant Weibull parameters, the RKR model is used to predict the expected fracture toughness, KΦ, i. e., the K at which the first flaw failure occurs with probability Φ. For sufficiently high <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus,</b> the failure occurs essentially at the notch tip. For sufficiently low <b>Weibull</b> <b>modulus</b> (m < 4), KΦ for an FGM is found to vary up to 25 % {{from that of a}} homogeneous body...|$|E
