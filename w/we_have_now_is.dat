I think he'd better confine himself to the Bible and leave sensational subjects alone. Things have come to a pretty pass if a minister can't find enough in Holy Writ to preach about, that's what. What church do you attend, Anne? I hope you go regularly. People are apt to get so careless about church-going away from home, and I understand college students are great sinners in this respect. I'm told many of them actually study their lessons on Sunday. I hope you'll never sink that low, Anne. Remember how you were brought up. And be very careful what friends you make.

5000|$|Reid Scott, who {{replaced}} Ryan Reynolds {{as the voice}} of Turbo, knew Prynoski from 2000 or 2001, when they worked together on a Flash Frame pilot for AMC.

They enjoyed working together, and when Motorcity got canceled, Prynoski offered him the role in recently contracted Turbo series. Scott's initial approach to the role tried to capture Reynold's [...] "inflection, his intonation and the character's attitude. And then slowly it took {{on a life of its}} own.

50|$|The Edict we {{have now}} has been reconstructed from various sources, mainly from juristic commentaries on it, {{such as that of}} Furius Anthianus. Because of its great importance, the Praetor's Edict, or {{portions}} of it, often became the subject of detailed examination and study, in the course of which the specific content of the Edict would be described or quotations would be made directly from it. Of course, much of the literature of the ancient world has been lost, the works of Roman jurist included. Those juristic works that do survive usually come from the latter, or classical, period of Roman Law. Accordingly, most of the Edict <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> based on the content of the Edict revised in AD 129 by Hadrian (see below). How much and in what fashion and degree this Edict of Hadrian's reign differs from the earlier Praetor's Edict of the Roman Republic are questions that may only be addressed by informed speculation.|$|E
5000|$|Brother Driscoll {{also noted}} the {{benefits}} that Iona would receive, saying that the college had by and large we have used up the space we have in New Rochelle.

Iona College had 6,000 students at the time, with an overcrowded campus. Driscoll made a point, however, to convey that the merger was not one of just physical necessity. He told The New York Times in 1989: There's a six-to-one imbalance in this, if you're talking about size. But it is more a blending of two educational programs, and there you have a basis for parity. What you're really blending would be the Iona educational model, which is four years plus graduate school, and the Seton model, which is a two-year associate degree and certificate program. ThatIn addition, Sister Brosnan stated that Seton's two successful nursing programs would be continued under the Iona merger. She said Nursing enrollments general are going down; ours are going up." ...|$|E
