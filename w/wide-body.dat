5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, <b>wide-body</b> {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first <b>wide-body</b> twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller <b>wide-body</b> airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.|$|E

5|$|On 24 October 2008, {{the airline}} {{announced}} plans {{in preparation for}} the arrival of the Airbus A330-200 <b>wide-body</b> aircraft, which included personnel and fleet composition. The new aircraft will provide medium haul passenger and cargo services to the Middle East and Australia.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Boeing's 747 {{became the}} first <b>wide-body</b> jetliner to enter service. The 747 was the first {{passenger}} jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new <b>wide-body</b> aircraft intended to replace the 707 and other early generation narrow-body jets. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar wide-bodies. To defray {{the high cost of}} development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation Aeritalia and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a short take-off and landing airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a T-tail.|$|E
5|$|Japan Airlines {{operates}} {{a mixture of}} narrow-body and <b>wide-body</b> aircraft. The airline provides economy class service on all routes, business class (J) service with larger seats in the cabin front on most major domestic routes, premium economy on some international routes, business class on most long-haul and some short-haul international routes, and first class on some long-haul and domestic routes.|$|E
5|$|Seeking to {{capitalize}} on its new <b>wide-body's</b> potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, {{in its first year}} of service. Ethiopian Airlines placed the first order for the type in December 1982. Featuring increased gross weight and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to , and was targeted at overseas customers. The 767-200ER entered service with El Al Airline on March 27, 1984. The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.|$|R

Upon completion of the installations scheduled for 2015, more than 6,000 daily soundings will be produced in North America, Europe, and Asia at more than 400 locations. Emphasis {{has been placed on}} equipping regional carriers as these flights tend to (i) fly into more remote and diverse locations and (ii) be of shorter duration thereby producing more daily vertical profiles while remaining in the boundary layer for longer durations.|$|R
500|$|After {{the debut}} of the first {{stretched}} 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the [...] "Hunchback of Mukilteo" [...] (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage. In 1986, Boeing proposed the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest. By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the 777 designation. Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest <b>wide-bodies</b> behind the 747.|$|R

In March 2015, Phee Teik Yeoh announced that the airline is planning to procure an unspecified number of both narrow-body and <b>wide-body</b> aircraft to enhance the domestic network and launch international flights within two years.|$|E
5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the <b>wide-body</b> aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were {{approaching}} retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas {{was working on}} the MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X, to target the replacement market for first-generation <b>wide-bodies</b> such as the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with winglets. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.|$|R
25|$|Pan Am had {{invested}} in a large fleet of Boeing 747s expecting that air travel would continue to increase. It didn't, as the introduction of many <b>wide-bodies</b> by Pan Am and its competitors coincided with an economic slowdown.

5|$|In 2003, Boeing {{introduced}} overhead crew rests as {{an option}} on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing <b>wide-body</b> and narrow-body aircraft, including 737NG, 747-400, 757-300, and newer 767 models, including all 767-400ER models. The 747-8 and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{second to}} the 747 as Boeing's most {{profitable}} jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative model in the 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400million of Boeing's pretax earnings in 2000, US$50million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner comprised the bulk of <b>wide-body</b> revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012.

5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other <b>wide-bodies</b> such as the 747-400.

A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|R
25|$|Between 2009 and 2011, Alitalia renewed its fleet with 34 new aircraft, while 26 older {{planes were}} retired. The renewal process ended in early 2013. These new planes are not owned by Alitalia itself, but are leased mostly from Aircraft Purchase Fleet, an Irish leasing company created by former Air One owner Carlo Toto {{primarily}} {{to purchase the}} new Alitalia fleet. Following the Air One merger, the entire fleet that was not already leased from other lessors, plus the former Air One fleet that was owned by Air One outright, came under the ownership of APF, a subsidiary of Toto's Italian conglomerate Toto Holding.

5|$|Seattle {{remained}} the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, {{when the company}} separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett <b>wide-body</b> plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington.|$|E
5|$|The 767 was {{the first}} Boeing <b>wide-body</b> to be {{designed}} with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. Cathode ray tube (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced {{the role of the}} flight engineer by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating <b>wide-body</b> jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. Ansett Australia ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.|$|E
5|$|The 777 {{first entered}} {{commercial}} service with United Airlines on June 7, 1995.

50|$|Efforts {{were made}} to improve {{operations}} in the mid-1990s by leasing Western-built aircraft. This helped the airline to compete for passengers in Western Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Western-built aircraft were leased for limited periods of time, to supplement Cubana's Soviet-built jets. Long-range McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 <b>wide-bodies</b> were leased from the French airline Air Outre Mer (AOM) in the 1990s, and medium-range Airbus A320 aircraft from various companies, despite pressures by the U.S. government to rescind or prevent leases. The French airline AOM, in particular, was threatened by the U.S. with cancellation of landing rights, when it entered into its lease and code-sharing agreements with Cubana. An intervention by the French government was required to prevent AOM from being severely damaged by those threats and any resulting U.S. actions. These and other unilateral pressures were unprecedented {{in the history of}} commercial aviation, and {{they were part of the}} U.S. government's longstanding efforts to damage Cubana and the Cuban economy.|$|R

40|$|Since 1960, {{only one}} new country, Brazil, {{has succeeded in}} {{delivering}} more than one civil jet per month. Otherwise, all the countries now offering world-class planes were established in aviation {{by the end of}} World War I. This being said, low-cost producers within several of the newly emerging markets have already acquired front-end manufacturing expertise {{as a direct result of}} industrial offset contracts and/or other forms of technology transfer. In all such cases, government intervention, notably through state ownership, has been predominant, but failures have been numerous in view of the difficulty of aligning ownership structure to financial, managerial, and technological requirements and of garnering the support of domestic interest groups. In this paper the focus is China’s efforts to build a world-class aircraft manufacturing industry. In the first half of the 1990 s the potential of the Chinese industry to mount a competitive challenge to Western aircraft builders was largely discounted. Nowadays, as China strives to bear the ARJ- 21 project to execution and even considers entering the market for <b>wide-bodies,</b> the threat is taken more seriously. The growth in the Chinese air transport market has reinforced the bargaining power of national aircraft producers and authorities are giving priority to building science and technology capacity in this area.

The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing hangars. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2–2 arrangement in first class.|$|E
5|$|United Airlines first {{placed the}} 767 in {{commercial}} service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and transcontinental routes, during which it demonstrated {{the reliability of}} its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading {{to the development of}} the 777, a larger <b>wide-body</b> twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new <b>wide-body</b> aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In January 1978, Boeing {{announced}} a major extension of its Everett factory—which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747—to accommodate its new <b>wide-body</b> family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a trijet 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes. The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes.
