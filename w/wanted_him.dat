Tesla's father, {{in a moment of}} despair, (who had originally <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to enter the priesthood) promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} imagine that if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern conservatism.|$|E

5|$|A {{turning point}} for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650yd {{freestyle}} behind John Konrads and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He {{dropped out of high}} school to attend a three-month training camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not swim in Rome; team officials merely <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to learn from the routine and atmosphere of Olympic swimming. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who also coached Konrads.|$|E

5|$|According to Dutton, Sigourney Weaver {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for his casting. In the years leading up the production of Alien 3, she promised him {{a role in the}} third film. While he was working on Broadway in December 1990, Weaver phoned him that the studio approved his casting and <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to fly to London. Although Dutton liked Alien 3, he found its production tumultuous; director David Fincher encountered resistance from 20th Century Fox, and Pinewood Studios was in need of renovation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Glover, Lord and Paice, who <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> in the fold for the band's 25th anniversary tour, Gillan rejoined Deep Purple in 1992 to record the album The Battle Rages On. Gillan was unhappy with working on the album, as {{it had already been}} {{partially}} completed with Joe Lynn Turner, and he was only required to write replacement lyrics and vocal melodies, which, unsurprisingly, drew criticism from Blackmore.|$|E
5|$|He {{eventually}} {{signed for}} another Conference National club, Woking, in January 2007 after being recommended {{to the club}} by former Dundee teammate Tom Hutchinson and he made his debut in a 2–0 victory over Altrincham on 20 January, {{in which he had}} a goal disallowed that was adjudged to be offside. Barrett missed some matches because of injury and finished 2006–07 with seven appearances for Woking, and manager Frank Gray <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to return to the club for pre-season training.|$|E

5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to retire from national politics.|$|E
5|$|In World War II, {{he served}} in the Army in North Africa and Italy from 1942 to 1945. He worked in the prisoner-of-war {{processing}} division and for Italy's Institute of Statistics. While stationed at a Prisoner-of-war camp for Italian prisoners in North Africa, Arrington reported having another transcendent experience after reading The Brothers Karamazov. He reported feeling that God <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to become a teacher and a writer about religion and economics.|$|E
5|$|In her 1953 novel Graham {{suggests}} that Point du Sable left Chicago {{because he was}} angered with the United States government, which <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to buy the land on which he had lived and called his own for the previous two decades. The 1795 Treaty of Greenville and the subsequent westward migration of Indians away from the Chicago area might also have influenced his decision.|$|E

5|$|In late January 1951, the Air Force told Davis {{it wanted}} to rotate {{him back to the}} United States. By this point, Davis held every record for a jet pilot, {{including}} most victories in all types of aircraft, most MiGs destroyed and most victories over propeller-driven aircraft. Other pilots indicated they <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to stay in Korea, considering him to be an able and effective leader. However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis' squadron.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira {{grew up as}} a prince. According to {{the second}} chapter of the Śvētāmbara text Acharanga Sutra, both of his parents were {{followers}} and lay devotees of Parshvanatha. Jain traditions do not agree on whether Mahavira ever married. According to the Digambara tradition, Mahavira's parents <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to marry Yashoda but Mahavira refused to marry. According to the Śvētāmbara tradition, {{he was married to}} Yashoda at a young age and had one daughter, Priyadarshana, also called Anojja.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received. Southern Miss <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to play defensive back, but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position {{in the second half of}} the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the night before and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E

5|$|After the 1907 season, Stricklett {{returned}} to the California League to pitch for the San Jose Prune Prickers and Sacramento Sacts, and refused to report to Brooklyn in 1908 as his wife <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to remain closer to their California home. As the California League was not recognized in organized baseball at this time, Stricklett was banned by MLB for four years. Though he applied for reinstatement, his banishment was upheld. Stricklett continued to pitch for San Jose through 1910, pitching to a 23-12 record in 1909 and a 19-14 record in 1910.|$|E
5|$|Born in Purworejo, Dutch East Indies, Oerip {{exhibited}} {{leadership skills}} {{from an early}} age. As his parents <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to become a regent, after elementary school Oerip {{was sent to the}} School for Native Government Employees in Magelang. His mother died during his second year at the school, and Oerip left to undertake military training in Meester Cornelis, Batavia (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta). Upon graduating in 1914, he became a lieutenant in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army; during almost 25 years of service he was stationed on three different islands and promoted several times, eventually becoming the highest-ranking Native officer in the country.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{successful}} collaboration on the pitch, {{a strong}} personal rivalry developed between Ramsey and Nicholson, partly because both {{liked the idea}} of staying on at Tottenham in a coaching role after retiring. Rowe made clear to Ramsey that he <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> to do so, but unfortunately for him Rowe stepped down in February 1955, citing health issues. Another challenge to Ramsey's position at Tottenham {{came in the form of}} Danny Blanchflower, a Northern Ireland international wing-half signed from Aston Villa to replace Nicholson. Blanchflower was a more attacking player than Nicholson and thus did not provide the necessary cover for Ramsey to advance upfield; Ramsey also resented the idea that Blanchflower might supplant him as Tottenham's main strategist.|$|E
