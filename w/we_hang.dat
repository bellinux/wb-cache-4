Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained something of {{the essence of the}} Jewish problem. What flag would <b>we</b> <b>hang</b> in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E

According to DWP founder Danny Whetstone, using Barco helped with seamless projection and brightness adjustment: [...] "It was essential that <b>we</b> <b>hang</b> the projectors straight down, 151 feet in the air, lens to field, in order to fill the enormous visual area with the converged image". Barco's HD20 has a 20,000-lumen lighting capacity, rendering clear, bright images with high contrast.|$|E

2500|$|All of the dunces press forward, vying to be {{the first}} to speak, but a ghost comes forward who awes them all and makes all to shake in fear. Doctor Busby, {{headmaster}} of Westminster School appears, [...] "Dripping with Infants' blood, and Mothers' tears" [...] (B IV 142) from the birch cane that he used to whip boys, and every man in the hall begins to tremble. Busby tells Dulness that he is her true champion, for he turns geniuses to fools, [...] "Whate'er the talents, or howe'er design'd,/ <b>We</b> <b>hang</b> one jingling padlock on the mind" [...] (161–2). Dulness agrees and wishes for a pedant king like James I again, who will [...] "stick the Doctor's Chair into the Throne" [...] (177), for only a pedant king would insist on what her priests (and only hers) proclaim: [...] "The RIGHT DIVINE of Kings to govern wrong" [...] (188), for Cambridge and Oxford still uphold the doctrine.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the first}} time in my life I know how it feels to face an existential menace. They want us to die. All of a sudden I realize what my parents were talking about all those years. Patriotism, I now believe, isn't some sentimental, old conceit. It's self-preservation. I believe patriotism is central to a nation's survival. Ben Franklin said it: If <b>we</b> don't all <b>hang</b> together, <b>we</b> all <b>hang</b> separately.|$|R

2500|$|Antichrist {{started with}} the idea of making a horror film. Trier {{thought it was a good}} idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because [...] "the genre [...] that you can put a lot of very, very strange images in a horror film". He had {{recently}} seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as Ring and Dark Water, from which he drew inspiration. Another basic idea came from a documentary Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Trier said: [...] "At the same time that <b>we</b> <b>hang</b> it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell." [...] In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether Antichrist really could be classified as a horror film, because [...] "it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took [...] more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 28, 2017 a {{deal was}} {{finalized}} for Ortiz's return bout against Mexican boxer Saul Corral (24-9, 15 KOs) in a scheduled 10 round fight {{to take place}} at the Rabobank Theater in Bakersfield, California on July 30 and would headline a Premier Boxing Champions card. Ortiz made a successful comeback with a fourth round stoppage win over Corral. Ortiz stalked Corral from the opening round landing straight lefts and hooks, although Corral fought back, Ortiz did enough to win the early rounds. In round 3, referee Jack Reiss docked a point of Corral after warning him for holding Ortiz's left arm. In round 4, Ortiz landed a left hand that sent Corral down. He beat the count, but Ortiz pounced, forcing the referee to stop the fight after 1 minute and 26 seconds. Ortiz kept his options open when speaking in the post fight, “There are a lot of names out there in the welterweight division. At this point I’m going to let my team guide me, because I’ll always be ready for anybody.” He also praised Corral, “Corral is a great fighter who hits hard and I definitely felt it.Top of the line boxers like myself, <b>we</b> <b>hang</b> in there and we perform {{to the best of our}} abilities. It was my first time back in a while and it’s just the beginning.” ...|$|E

According to Michael Phayer, the concordat prevented Pius XI from speaking out against the Nazi Nuremberg Laws in 1935, and though he did intend to speak out after the nationwide pogrom of 1938, Cardinal Pacelli dissuaded him from doing so.|$|R
