She graduated from North Allegheny Senior High School, and completed a B.A. at Miami University (Ohio) in Zoology with a minor in Music Composition. After a year of post-graduate work in vocal performance at Duquesne University, she was awarded a talent scholarship from Berklee College of Music, and an additional B.M. in Contemporary <b>Writing,</b> <b>Production,</b> and Performance.|$|E
25|$|With Yes {{in disarray}} again, Squire turned to Billy Sherwood (by now the band's engineer) for help. Both {{men had been}} working on a side project called Conspiracy and {{reworked}} existing demos and recordings from there to turn them into Yes songs, and also worked on new material with Anderson and White. (Howe's involvement at this stage was minimal, mainly taking place {{towards the end of the}} sessions.) Sherwood's integral involvement with the <b>writing,</b> <b>production,</b> and performance of the music led to his finally joining Yes as a full member (taking on the role of harmony singer, keyboardist and second guitarist).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{development}} of the <b>written</b> <b>production</b> of two groups of EFL leamers (N = 63) in a school context. The two groups started instruction at different ages (8 and 11, respectively). Their <b>written</b> <b>production</b> was measured afier 200 and 416 hours of instruction. and analysed longitudinally. Both intragroup and intergroup analyses were carried out a) to analyse the development of the participants' <b>written</b> <b>production</b> as measured by three indicators of writing proficiency (fluency, complexity and accuracy); and b) to ascertain whether the differences observed (both in terms of attainment and rate of development) could be attributed to the age at which the groups of participants initiated their contact with the L 2. Results show that not all the areas of writing proficiency (fluency, complexity and accuracy) develop in parallel and that an earlier start does not seem to show clear advantages in the development of EFL <b>written</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of Swedish junior high school students’ English grammar knowledge, based on their <b>written</b> <b>production.</b> The Swedish students’ <b>written</b> <b>productions</b> where analyzed using error analysis as a method {{to find the most}} frequent errors that the students make. The errors were identified in texts that were produced in two different ways (free and controlled), and these texts were then compared. The study was conducted through (a) identifying the most frequent grammatical errors in Swedish students’ <b>written</b> <b>production,</b> (b) analyzing what causes the errors to be made, and (c) distinguishing if there is any difference between free written or controlled <b>written</b> <b>production.</b> The students’ grammatical knowledge was discussed {{on the basis of the}} results of these procedures. The results show that the most frequent errors made by Swedish junior high school students are errors of verb tense, verb inflection and subject-verb agreement. The errors are probably caused by lack of grammatical knowledge, but also by incorrect transfer from Swedish into English. Furthermore, the results show that the students from the two target groups to some extent make the same type of errors regardless of their <b>productions</b> were free <b>written</b> or more controlled...|$|R

2500|$|History came {{to play an}} {{increasingly}} central role in Jameson's interpretation of both the reading (consumption) and <b>writing</b> (<b>production)</b> of literary texts. Jameson marked his full-fledged commitment to Hegelian-Marxist philosophy {{with the publication of}} The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act, the opening slogan of which is [...] "always historicize" [...] (1981). The Political Unconscious takes as its object not the literary text itself, but rather the interpretive frameworks by which it is now constructed. It emerges as a manifesto for new activity concerning literary narrative.|$|E

40|$|THESIS 10506 This thesis takes a corpus-based {{approach}} {{to show the}} presence and progress, if there is any, of colloquialization in six ICE-corpora of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Singapore, Jamaica and India by using the frequency of phrasal verbs {{as a measure of}} colloquialization. The evidence of colloquialization is illustrated when formal text material of spoken or/and <b>written</b> <b>production</b> or both show a high use of phrasal verbs. Formality of each text material of spoken and <b>written</b> <b>production</b> is measured by formula. Phrasal verbs are selected according to a particle...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of orthographic and phonological codes to <b>written</b> <b>production</b> remains controversial. We report results using a picture word interference task {{in which participants}} were asked to write (Experiments 1 and 2) or to speak (Experiment 3) the names of pictures while trying to ignore visual distractors, and the interval between the target and distractor onset was varied. Distractors were orthographically plus phonologically related, orthographically related, phonologically related, or unrelated to picture names. For <b>written</b> <b>production,</b> we found an exclusive orthographic effect at an early stage, reflecting a fast and direct link between meaning and graphemic lexicon, and we demonstrated that orthographic codes can be accessed directly from meaning in healthy adults. We also found orthographic and phonological effects at a later stage, reflecting a slow and indirect link between meaning and graphemic lexicon via phonology. Furthermore, the absence of an interaction effect of orthographic and phonological facilitation on written latencies suggests that the two effects are additive in general and that they might occur independently in <b>written</b> <b>production</b> in Chinese. For spoken production, we found that orthographic and phonological effects occur simultaneously in spoken production and that the two effects are additive at an early stage but interactive at a later stage. The temporal courses and their interplay of orthographic and phonological effects are dissociative in <b>written</b> and spoken <b>production.</b> Our findings thus support the orthography autonomy hypothesis, rather than the obligatory phonological mediation hypothesis, in <b>written</b> <b>production</b> in Chinese (as a non-alphabetic script) ...|$|R
