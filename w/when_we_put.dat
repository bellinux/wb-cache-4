500|$|We'd {{just got}} {{ourselves}} a sampler, {{and we went}} sample-crazy. We just ... went through my whole collection of records, sampling tons of stuff and putting it all together, and it ... was a real rush of excitement, when we were doing it.... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> that record out, we knew {{what we were doing}} was illegal, but we thought it was gonna be such an underground record, nobody would ever hear about it. So the first thing that shocked us is that British rock papers gave a big review.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the Strokes {{consisted}} of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet {{to the music}} of reggae artist Bob Marley, protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, [...] "Our music was, like, , but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> them together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas that we thought was really cool." [...] In 1998, Albert Hammond, Jr., who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{have been}} {{critical}} of Hail to the Thief. In a 2006 interview with Spin, Yorke said: [...] "I'd maybe change the playlist. I think we had a meltdown <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> it together ... We wanted to do things quickly, and I think the songs suffered." [...] In 2008, O'Brien told Mojo he felt Radiohead should have cut the album to ten tracks and that its length had alienated some listeners. In the same interview, Colin Greenwood said he felt several songs were unfinished and that the album was [...] "more of a holding process". In 2013, Godrich told the NME: [...] "I think there's some great moments on there - but too many songs... As a whole I think it's charming {{because of the lack of}} editing. But personally it's probably my least favourite of all the albums ... It didn't really have its own direction. It was almost like a homogeny of previous work. Maybe that's its strength." ...|$|E

500|$|Some tracks used {{elements}} from Public Enemy's previous material, which Pete Watrous of The New York Times {{interpreted as a}} dual reference to hip hop tradition {{and the history of}} the group. Watrous described the music as [...] "the sound of urban alienation, where silence doesn't exist and sensory stimulation is oppressive and predatory", and writes that its dense textures [...] "envelop Chuck D's voice and make his rapping sound as if it is under duress, as if he were fighting against a background intent on taking him over ... Layer after layer of sounds are placed {{on top of each other}} until the music becomes nearly tactile". Chuck D called Fear of a Black Planet a record entirely of [...] "found sounds ... probably the most elaborate smorgasbord of sound that we did ... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> together our music, we try to put together layers that complement each other, and then the voice tries to complement that, and the theme tries to complement that, and then the song itself tries to complement the album as a whole, fitting into the overall context." [...] In his essay on hip hop aesthetics, Richard Schur interpreted such layering as a motif in hip hop and as [...] "the process by which ... new meanings are created and communicated, primarily to an equally knowledgeable audience", concluding that [...] "Public Enemy probably took the ideal of layering to its farthest point".|$|E
2500|$|The Cramps, {{who formed}} in Sacramento, California in 1972 and {{relocated}} to New York in 1975 where they {{became part of}} the city's thriving punk movement, appropriated the term from the Cash song and described their music as [...] "psychobilly" [...] and [...] "rockabilly voodoo" [...] on flyers advertising their concerts. The Cramps have since rejected the idea of being a part of a psychobilly subculture, noting that [...] "We weren't even describing the music <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> 'psychobilly' on our old fliers; we were just using carny terms to drum up business. It wasn't meant as a style of music." [...] Nevertheless, The Cramps, along with artists such as Screamin' Jay Hawkins, are considered important precursors to psychobilly. The Cramps' music was heavily informed by the sound and attitude of 1950s American rockabilly, including Hasil Adkins, whose song [...] "She Said" [...] they covered on 1984's compilation album Bad Music for Bad People, along with other songs from the Sun Records catalog. Their 1979 album Songs the Lord Taught Us is considered influential to the formation of the psychobilly genre.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song reminds us of the early days <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I to be {{left here}} trussed up like a chicken ready for the roasting?" [...] Horry Sims asked angrily <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>put</b> him once more {{in the corner of}} the room without taking undue care as to the handling.|$|R
60|$|The day {{had come}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> should <b>put</b> {{into the ground}} our Indian corn that a harvest might follow. The supply, {{which was to be}} used as seed, had been stored in casks and piled up in the big house wherein were kept our goods.|$|R
5|$|There's {{going to}} be no more digital {{enhancements}} or digital additions to anything based on any film I direct.... When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> did <b>put</b> out E.T. <b>we</b> <b>put</b> out two E.T.s. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> out the original '82 version. I always tell people {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|R
2500|$|In early 2010 Ras Kass {{launched}} a Kickstarter campaign {{to fund the}} manufacture of 1,000 CDs and 500 records for his A.D.I.D.A.S. (All Day I Dream About Spittin) project and a viral marketing campaign called [...] "Save The Ras Kass", which included a series of satirical web episodes {{about the plight of}} the endangered emcee. In an interview with MTV UK writer Han O'Connor he explained his decision to use Kickstarter, stating [...] "we started trying different angles at solving old problems. Kickstarter was the natural evolution of trying creative new business models. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> out The Quarterly there were people that said, ‘well how come you didn’t create a CD for this?’ and I’m like ‘well if I have to spend that $5000 and you want one, I appreciate it but there’s the small problem that I spent $5000.’" [...] His webisodes document the downfall of an emcee, as he explained, [...] "You just see this downward spiral; it’s just that fall from grace and I’m kind of making fun of that and using me as the vehicle for it." [...] Finally, Ras Kass exceeded the $3,800 needed for the record in less than five days, with the project being released as a limited edition double CD and LP on July 20, 2011.|$|E

5000|$|Within {{an hour of}} the record-setting auction closing, Senator Reid {{addressed}} the issue again {{on the floor of}} the Senate stating, [...] "I strongly believe <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can <b>put</b> our differences aside, even Harry Reid and Rush Limbaugh, we should do that and try to accomplish good things for the American people." ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, for {{an instant}} I had half a mind to {{withdraw}} from the case and hand it back to Jeeves. But the pride of the Woosters restrained me. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> Woosters <b>put</b> our hands to the plough, we do not readily sheathe the sword. Besides, after that business of the mess-jacket, anything resembling weakness would have been fatal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} was!" [...] cried Allan, {{suddenly}} seizing the lost recollection. [...] "Midwinter! {{you remember the}} miniature you found {{on the floor of}} the cabin <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were <b>putting</b> the yacht to rights?

6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} that is, Karl. I think Gangoil goes {{a quarter of a}} mile beyond this. But we did not quite strike the {{boundary}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> up the fence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He acted pretty startled <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> {{it up to}} him," [...] {{returned}} Songbird. He {{heaved a}} deep sigh. [...] "Well, maybe some day this matter will be cleared up, but it doesn't look like it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{ground is}} getting very much burnt up, papa,' Charley said. 'It was damp enough <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> in the crops, {{and they are}} getting on capitally; but I fear that they were sown too late, and will be burnt up.' ...|$|E
60|$|Nearer and nearer did we draw to this danger, {{while the}} other sloop was {{creeping}} around to northward, ready {{to take advantage of}} the southerly breeze <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had <b>put</b> ourselves into position to prevent pursuit on the part of the Britishers, and in the meanwhile Silas, Harvey and Hiram were bringing ammunition into the cabin, distributing among the Minute Boys a generous supply of powder and balls.|$|R
5000|$|... {{committed}} to keeping this record in classic LP length...I think there's {{something to be}} said about the fact that you've got a side A and side B, and it still translates when you listen to those albums on CD. Whether you're listening to Paranoid or Dark Side of the Moon, when you listen to the tracks one through ten, there's a bit of a plot arc. I think we were cognizant of that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were <b>putting</b> this thing together.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. Everything {{depends upon}} Gwendoline and Cornelia. But there is time {{enough for them}} to give notice--Christmas will be soon enough. If they cannot or will not come as cook and housemaid, I am afraid the plan will break down. A vital {{condition}} is that I do not have a soul in the house (beyond the lodgers) who is not one of my own relations. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> have <b>put</b> Joey into buttons, he will do very well to attend to the door.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What do you think, Sir Christopher,' said Lady Cheverel, {{who seemed}} to wince a little under her husband's reminiscences, 'of hanging Guercino's [...] "Sibyl" [...] over that door <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> up the pictures? It is rather lost in my sitting-room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must do {{something}} for him," [...] said Fox, [...] "albeit he is an American and a Whig, {{and all the rest}} of the execrations. Thou wilt have to swallow thy golden opinions, my buckskin, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> thee in office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Ah!’ replied Overton, ‘very good thought—capital idea indeed. I’ll send {{somebody}} up directly. And if {{you make}} a little resistance <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>put</b> you in the chaise it wouldn’t be amiss—look as if you didn’t want to be taken away, you know.’ ...|$|E
60|$|What {{should we}} all do without the calendar, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> want to <b>put</b> off a disagreeable duty?

6000|$|We {{took a walk}} {{together}} in the palace gardens {{on the evening of}} my arrival. Reaching a remote part of the grounds, we were passed by a lean, sallow, sour-looking old man, drawn by a servant in a chair on wheels. My companion stopped, whispered to me, [...] "Here is the Prince," [...] and bowed bareheaded. I followed his example as a matter of course. The Prince feebly returned our salutation.
