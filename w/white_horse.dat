5|$|At {{least one}} {{explosive}} subaqueous volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch. This subaqueous volcano, known as <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Bluff, {{is thought to}} have formed in three phases. Its first phase of activity was involved with water, possibly dammed by glacial ice which filled the Clearwater River valley. The volcano heated glacial water then flooded down the volcano's vent, creating violent steam explosions and broken lava fragments. Once the steam explosions had subsided, the broken lava fragments settled back into the glacial water, creating the unvolcano-like form of <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental volcanic glass called hyaloclastite. The volcano ceased erupting soon after breaching the surface of the glacial water.|$|E
5|$|Most of US30 in New Jersey {{follows the}} <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike, a turnpike {{chartered}} in 1854 {{to run from}} Camden to Stratford and eventually toward Atlantic City. In 1917, pre-1927 Route3 was legislated to run from Camden to Absecon on the <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike, while US30 was designated in New Jersey in 1926 to connect Camden and Atlantic City via the <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike. A year later, pre-1927 Route3 was replaced by Route43, which ran between US130 near Camden and US9 (now Route157) in Absecon, and Route25 was designated along the portion of US30 between the Ben Franklin Bridge and US130. The segment of US30 past Route43 into Atlantic City became Route56 in 1938. In 1953, the state highway designations were removed from US30. A freeway was proposed for US30 in Camden County during the late 1960s, running from Camden to Berlin; however, it was never built.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1927, {{the route}} between present-day Route 70 in Lakehurst and present-day County Route 527 in Toms River {{was a part}} of Pre-1927 Route 18, which was legislated in 1923 to run from Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 37 was legislated to run from Route 27 and Route 30 (now U.S. Route 1 Business, U.S. Route 206, and Route 31) in Trenton to Route 35 (now Route 88) in Point Pleasant, passing through <b>White</b> <b>Horse,</b> Allentown, Lakehurst, Toms River, and Seaside Heights. The portion between Trenton and <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> {{replaced}} part of Pre-1927 Route 2, while the portion between Lakehurst and Toms River replaced part of Pre-1927 Route 18.|$|E

5|$|Pulos and Hutt {{knew that}} if the allele that created a white coat was recessive, then <b>white</b> <b>horses</b> {{would have to be}} {{homozygous}} for the condition and therefore breeding <b>white</b> <b>horses</b> together would always result in a white foal. However, this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not recessive. Conversely, if a white coat was a simple autosomal dominant, ww horses would be non-white, while both Ww and WW <b>horses</b> would be <b>white,</b> and the latter would always produce white offspring. But Pulos and Hutt did not observe any <b>white</b> <b>horses</b> that always produced white offspring, suggesting that homozygous dominant (WW) <b>white</b> <b>horses</b> did not exist. As a result, Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was semidominant and lethal in the homozygous state: ww horses were non-white, Ww were white, and WW died.|$|R

5|$|The <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Turnpike Company was {{incorporated}} January 27, 1854 {{with the authority}} to convert <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Road into a turnpike, running from Camden to Stratford and eventually to Atlantic City. By 1913, maintenance of the <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> Pike became public. The route of US30 today in New Jersey was designated as pre-1927 Route3 from 1916 to 1927 between Camden and Absecon. On October 30, 1925, plans were made for a cross-country route from Salt Lake City, Utah to Atlantic City, New Jersey {{as part of the}} U.S. Highway System. This road was designated U.S. Route30 in 1926. It entered New Jersey from Pennsylvania in Camden and followed the entire length of pre-1927 Route3 to Absecon before continuing into Atlantic City. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route43 replaced the Route3 designation along US30 between US130 and US9 (now Route157) in Absecon while Route25 was designated along with US30 between the Ben Franklin Bridge and US130. In 1938, the portion of US30 from the terminus of Route43 in Absecon into Atlantic City was designated as Route56. Prior to the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, spur routes of Route43 and Route56 were planned. RouteS43 was planned in 1938 to be a route running from Route43 in Germania to Route4 in Northfield; this was never built as a state highway but the alignment is now followed by CR563. RouteS56 was legislated in 1945 to be a spur of Route56 to Brigantine along what had also been legislated as Route S4A; this road became Route87 in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire length}} of US 130 follows {{a part of the}} Ocean Highway, a coastal highway that ran from New Brunswick south to Jacksonville, Florida. The current route was {{designated}} as portions of three state routes prior to 1927. In 1916, the road between the Camden area and Bordentown was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 2 while the current US 130 north of Robbinsville was {{to become a part of}} pre-1927 Route 1. In addition, pre-1927 Route 17S was legislated to run from Penns Grove northeast to Westville in 1923; the only portion of road built ran from Pennsville south to Salem. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, US 130 was designated to connect US 30 in Camden to US 1 in Trenton, following pre-1927 Route 2. In the 1927 renumbering a year later, the US 130 alignment was designated Route 25 from Camden to Bordentown, Route 39 from Bordentown to <b>White</b> <b>Horse,</b> and Route 37 from <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> to Trenton.|$|E

5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American <b>White</b> <b>Horse.</b> A grandson of Old King, Snow King, {{was at the center}} of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell. They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the homozygous state. Other factors, such as variations in expressivity and the influence of multiple genes, may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed. The white coat of the American <b>White</b> <b>Horse</b> has not yet been mapped.|$|E
