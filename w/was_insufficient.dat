5|$|While {{there are}} many {{alternative}} treatments used for the common cold, there <b>is</b> <b>insufficient</b> scientific {{evidence to support the}} use of most.

5|$|As the {{existing}} supply of M2A3 gun shields <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> to meet {{requirements for the}} production of the M3, the Ordnance Department developed the M5 gun shield, which replaced the M2A3. The new design was designated as the M3A1 Gun Motor Carriage.|$|E

5|$|The RLM ordered seven A-0s initially, {{but then}} {{increased}} {{the order to}} 11. Early in 1937, the A-0 was tested with varied bomb loads. The underpowered Jumo 210A, as pointed out by von Richthofen, <b>was</b> <b>insufficient,</b> and was quickly replaced with the Jumo 210D power plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem was}} known about before the accident; {{a letter from the}} {{infrastructure}} company Railtrack in December 1999 warned that the existing Railtrack Line Specification <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> to guard against this type of fatigue.

5|$|Almost all of Ukraine {{had been}} {{occupied}} by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> housing for those who remained. One out of every six Ukrainians was killed in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Between January 2010 and 2015, {{a quarter}} of {{emergency}} room doctors said they had seen a major surge in patients, while nearly half had seen a smaller increase. Seven in ten ER doctors claimed that they lacked the resources to deal with large increases {{in the number of}} patients. The biggest factor in the increased number of ER patients <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> primary care providers to handle the larger number of insured patients.|$|E
5|$|From 21 November 1944, {{when the}} Flåm Line {{received}} electric traction, Class 64 trains {{were also used}} there. The Flåm Line is even steeper and more curved than the Hardanger Line, so the trains received track brakes. In 1947, El 9 locomotives were delivered for the Flåm Line. Class 64 trains continued to be used periodically on the Flåm Line when there <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> availability of El 9s, {{as well as in}} periods with very little or very much traffic.|$|E

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> to identify it as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 a spur {{connecting}} the branch to the up slow {{line of the}} West Coast Main Line was constructed. The water supply for locomotives at Wolverton <b>was</b> <b>insufficient,</b> so a water column was built at the intermediate station in Bradwell. Water came from the town's own source, with many houses losing their supply. On Mondays, housewives were known to shake their fists at engine drivers when their weekly wash was interrupted. Eventually drivers were forbidden from taking water from Bradwell on Mondays.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{announced}} that a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> outgassing of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.|$|E

Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.|$|E
5|$|On Cemetery Ridge, Generals Meade and Hancock were {{scrambling}} to find reinforcements. Meade had sent {{virtually all of}} his available troops (including most of the XII Corps, who would be needed momentarily on Culp's Hill) to his left flank to counter Longstreet's assault, leaving {{the center of his}} line relatively weak. There <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> infantry on Cemetery Ridge and only a few artillery pieces, rallied from the debacle of the Peach Orchard by Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery.|$|E
5|$|Sphecius grandis can be {{distinguished}} from S.convallis (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral tergites. Formerly, the two species were distinguished {{on the basis of}} the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in S.grandis and three in S.convallis), but a more recent study showed that this character <b>was</b> <b>insufficient</b> to distinguish the two species. However, they can {{be distinguished}} by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.|$|E
