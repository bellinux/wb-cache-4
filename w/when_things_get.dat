25|$|Alice Mitchell, née Johnson — Dennis' stay-at-home mother Alice {{is usually}} the reassuring figure Dennis can run to <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>get</b> too overwhelming, ready to greet him with a warm hug. Although she grew up among animals on a chicken ranch, a running gag is that Alice Mitchell has a phobia of snakes. Another running gag {{involves}} Dennis's ever-changing parade of new babysitters: no one will take the job twice. Alice is also known for punishing Dennis's misbehavior by having him sit in the corner {{in a rocking chair}} for timeout, although a couple of times she has instituted tougher disciplinary measures such as spanking, where afterward Dennis is shown crying or grumbling about the adversity.|$|E
500|$|Tancharoen {{hinted that}} the series would {{continue}} Age of Ultrons theme of [...] "diving {{into the world}} of A.I. [...] things may not go as planned". On what makes Aida different from the villain Ultron, Whedon explained that [...] "Aida started as something that was supposed to mimic human behavior. Ultron came out almost a fully fleshed-out creature with his own agenda, where she’s been discovering hers along the way." [...] He added that instead of thousands of robots, the LMDs would be presented as android versions of the other characters in the series. Whedon said of themes that are raised in the second pod, [...] "there are issues of reality and identity. Trust is always an issue in a spy organization. It’s much worse when you don’t know if the person next to you is the person next to you ... When you get into trust, that’s <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>get</b> emotional." [...] The pod ends with the Melinda May LMD seemingly destroying herself and all the other known LMDs besides Aida, concluding her specific arc which explored the nature of humanity and identity. Asked if any of these LMDs survived this act, and could carry over to the third pod of the season, Whedon said [...] "We’ll see, but the idea was to put that chapter behind us." ...|$|E
500|$|Henrik Batallones of BuddyTV deemed [...] "Funk" [...] {{a bridge}} between [...] "Theatricality" [...] and the season finale, writing: [...] "It feels like the episode got itself in a funk, and <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>get</b> close to being awesome, it pulls back." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode 6.8/10 for [...] "Passable", but deemed it the weakest episode of Glee thus far, while Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "just one big funked-up mess." [...] Broadway World Mary Hanrahan felt that: [...] "While [...] "Funk" [...] had some redeeming, even charming, moments, it did nothing {{to make up for}} the perplexing episode that preceded it and {{ultimately}} left much to be desired." [...] In contrast, Aly Semigran of MTV had enjoyed the preceding episode, yet still received [...] "Funk" [...] poorly, calling it: [...] "a step down from last week's strong 'Theatricality'." [...] As with Respers France, Semigran noted that Quinn's performance" [...] felt a little uncomfortable and borderline 'offensive'." [...] In contrast, Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal enjoyed Quinn's song, which he called a [...] "magnificent surprise", praising the [...] "perfect jazzy–funk choreography". Flandez criticized the [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] performance, however, deeming it a [...] "song so bad it can't be saved by irony or nostalgia", and felt that [...] "Give Up the Funk" [...] was [...] "underdeveloped" [...] asking: [...] "Where's the soul? Anger? Passion? Emotion? Isn't that what this was supposed to be about?" ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Josh Smith {{scored the}} PlayStation version 7 out of 10, writing [...] "With {{innovative}} graphics, great level design, and awesome special weapons, everything looks great on paper. A number of flaws limit the game's life span, though, and {{raise questions about}} what's really important in games - style, mood, and vibe or solid gameplay, consistent graphics, and a continual challenge." [...] He was critical of the graphics, saying [...] "you may wish they'd traded {{a little of the}} game's visual inventiveness for some consistent graphical clarity. There's a ton of polygon dropout. And <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>get</b> busy, with dozens of onscreen enemies, projectiles, and explosions (which is in almost every scene), things slow way, way down, or animation frames disappear." [...] He also felt the game was too short, concluding [...] "MDK is something of a mixed bag. Amazing graphics style, but little graphical consistency. Awesome combat action, but little combat challenge. Great puzzles, but they're really pretty simple, and the whole game can be solved without using too many brain cells." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, Chad was scripted {{as the son}} of Bill and Marsha Peterson. In June 2009 it was {{announced}} that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods. In October 2009, the character's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father. In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress, Jessica Tuck, known for her role as One Life to Live's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad's mother. Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a [...] "mother figure." [...] Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad's scenes with Koslow's Kate. Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is [...] "completely devastated" [...] when she admits to being a former prostitute. Chad is fed up with his mother's lies and just wants everything out on the table. The revelation really impacts him in an [...] "inexplicable" [...] way. Deidrick described Chad's reaction as [...] "flabbergasted" [...] and wants to get away from her. When Chad witnesses Madeline's fall, he freezes for a moment because he is unable to [...] "process" [...] the situation. Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up. Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent, let alone his own mother, the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes; Deidrick's first reaction as Chad is going into denial. Chad clings on to the little bit of courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future. According to Deidrick, the aftermath of his mother's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little [...] "cuckoo crazy." [...] Knowing Chad is all alone in the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline's son with Kate's husband, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) born on March 3, 1990, making him a whole year older than was initially said to be. The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad's personality. According to Deidrick, during scenes with Kate, he intentionally emphasized Chad's vulnerabilities due to his mother's recent death; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment, and Kate fills that void. Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt. On the other hand, Chad's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile. The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test. Chad has no idea how to react to the DNA results. According to Deidrick, [...] " [...] struggles to find the courage to be able to love [...] who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed." [...] Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct. It is all he knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>get</b> difficult. However, Stefano is not easily turned away. Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline. However, he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor. Deidrick said that it was Tomlin's idea to attach him to a main family, [...] "So they made [...] a DiMera." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{proposal}} is, Major, that {{we should}} begin at once to mine; that is, to drive a gallery from the cellar, and to carry it on steadily {{as far as we}} can. I should say that we have ten days or a fortnight before us before matters get to an extremity, and in that time {{we ought to be able}} to get, working night and day, from fifty to a hundred yards beyond the wall, aiming at a clump of bushes. There is a large one in Farquharson's compound, about a hundred yards off. Then, <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>get</b> to the worst, we can work upwards, and come out on a dark night. We might leave a long fuse burning in the magazine, so that there should be an explosion an hour or two after we had left. There is enough powder there to bring the house down, and the Sepoys might suppose that we had all been buried in the ruins." ...|$|E
