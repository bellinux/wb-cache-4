Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis {{has been found to}} have few negative long-term consequences in younger people.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day, {{at their}} new house, Woody and Buzz stage another {{reconnaissance}} mission {{to prepare for}} the new toy arrivals. As Woody jokingly asks what might be <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after this}} incident, {{the family moved}} from the Ardennes to Brussels after a message from their father that the {{financial}} problems had ended. When they reached Brussels {{they found that the}} situation was actually <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> previously, and the family moved between cheap hotels, each one <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the one before. Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted the offer of an apprenticeship with an English engineer who claimed to have made a machine to extract gold in North Wales. After {{about a year and a}} half of work they discovered that there was no gold to be found in that part of Wales, and Hastings was informed that his services would no longer be needed.|$|E

5|$|Boston College, {{in their}} first {{possession}} of the second half, fared even <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession {{that resulted in a}} punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, thanks in part to an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
5|$|Game Revolution {{had a more}} {{critical}} review of Dino Crisis than others, saying the game expanded on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements. They were impressed by the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time. Overall, they believed the game to be <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E

5|$|In {{a pair of}} studies, high-functioning {{children}} with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals {{are more likely to}} overestimate what their audience comprehends.|$|E
5|$|Later in his career, Vonnegut {{published}} several autobiographical {{essays and}} short-story collections, including Fates <b>Worse</b> <b>Than</b> Death (1991), and A Man Without a Country (2005). After his death, he {{was hailed as}} a morbidly comical commentator on the society in which he lived, and {{as one of the}} most important contemporary writers. Vonnegut's son Mark published a compilation of his father's unpublished compositions, titled Armageddon in Retrospect. Numerous scholarly works have examined Vonnegut's writing and humor.|$|E
5|$|This bill {{establishes}} {{a weapon of}} violence against our citizenry far more wicked than anything ever known in recorded history — far <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the Siberian prison camps of the Czars or the Communists, or {{the violence of the}} Spanish Inquisition … The plot of wickedness revealed in this bill fairly reeks of the evil odor of the black forces of the Jesuits who dominate the Vatican, and, through officiates in our Government, dominate our politics.|$|E

40|$|Is cloning {{human beings}} morally wrong? The {{basis for the}} one serious {{objection}} to cloning is that, because of what a clone is, clones would have much <b>worse</b> lives <b>than</b> non-clones. I sketch a fragment of moral theory {{to make sense of}} the objection. I then outline several ways in which it might be claimed that, because of what a clone is, clones would have much <b>worse</b> lives <b>than</b> non-clones. In particular, I look at various ideas connected with autonomy. I conclude that there is no basis to the claim that, because of what a clone is, clones would have much <b>worse</b> lives <b>than</b> non-clones. I therefore reject the claim that cloning human beings is morally wrong...|$|R

Theramenes, protesting that this action was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the worst excesses of the democracy, refused to follow the order.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only a witness to events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Sonic Generations {{received}} positive reviews. Critics {{found its}} visuals, audio, and gameplay to be highlights, though it received criticism for occasional framerate and control problems. Reception to the 3DS version was more polarized, with reviewers criticizing its short length and determined {{it to be}} <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Dimps' previous Sonic games. The game was a commercial success, eventually selling 1.85 million copies across all platforms. The Classic iteration of Sonic introduced in the game has since become a recurring character in the Sonic series.|$|E
