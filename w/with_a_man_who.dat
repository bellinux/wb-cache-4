5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania also share food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E

25|$|The {{participants}} were not only selected for their mountaineering abilities; the status of their families and any military experience or university degrees were also factors in the selection procedures.

25|$|Rivers {{spends his}} last day at the clinic saying goodbye to his patients, then travels to London and meets Dr. Yealland from the National Hospital, who will be his {{colleague}} in his new position.

25|$|In {{all these}} {{religious}} paintings {{there is something}} that is very seldom found in the art of today, that is as rare in painting as it is rare in poetry—the quality of rapture. I had seen some of these pictures before and in a place that had a different atmosphere from that of a picture gallery. I had seen them in the painter’s house, on rough walls, hanging above where children played or where a family sat at a meal. In these surroundings they had seemed natural and right—they had enshrined the reality that was around. And here beside the Silvermine River in Connecticut I talked <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> might have worked in one of the cathedrals or belonged to a mediaeval guild of craftsmen, a man who considers art in relation to an economy utterly different from the one that is dominant among us in the world today.|$|E

In the former, River asks the Doctor if he had done the [...] "crash of the Byzantium" [...] with her yet. Actress Alex Kingston did not expect the return, but stated that Moffat [...] "always intended that she would come back".
