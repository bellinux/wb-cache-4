5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Muhammad {{married the}} wealthy Khadijah bint Khuwaylid who was 40 years old. The {{marriage}} lasted for 25years and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> one. Muhammad did not enter into marriage with another woman during this marriage. After Khadija's death, Khawla bint Hakim suggested to Muhammad that he should marry Sawda bint Zama, a Muslim widow, or Aisha, daughter of Um Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca. Muhammad {{is said to have}} asked for arrangements to marry both. Muhammad's marriages after the death of Khajida were contracted mostly for political or humanitarian reasons. The women were either widows of Muslims killed in battle and had been left without a protector, or belonged to important families or clans whom it was necessary to honor and strengthen alliances with.|$|E
5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged to a former lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as {{the degree to which the}} firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E

The union was {{contrary}} to the wishes of the bride's mother, who saw Luís Alves and his family as upstarts. Newspapers connected to political enemies of his family took advantage of this disagreement to level serious, but unfounded, accusations against him, including that he had kidnapped Ana Luísa. Despite the invective, their marriage <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> one and three children resulted: Luísa de Loreto Viana de Lima, Ana de Loreto Viana de Lima and Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, born in 1833, 1836 and 1847, respectively.|$|E

Ann Mason died in 1773; their marriage, judging by surviving accounts, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> one.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{played in}} every match of Australia's {{successful}} World Cup campaign, but struggled at first, {{with scores of}} 6, 14 and 0 {{in the first three}} matches against Scotland, New Zealand and Pakistan. Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. Gilchrist's quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, which was secured with a win over the West Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, the last in the final over, to scrape into the semifinals. Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were going for the winning run when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald; the match was tied, and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist's 54 in the final helped secure Australia's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> ending for Gilchrist, who had struggled through the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54.|$|E

5|$|John Stainer was {{the eighth}} of nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where {{his father was a}} cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E major at the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>happy</b> occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning dress with a white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
