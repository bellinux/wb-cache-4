5|$|Mason's {{policies}} {{led him to}} {{come into}} constant clashes with the Conservative members of the council. He was not always popular <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> either and he even financed his own newspaper, the Ashton-under-Lyne News, to convey his views and provide competition for the pro-Liberal Ashton Reporter. Conflict with the Liberals drove Mason into early retirement from local politics in 1874 {{at the age of}} 57.|$|E
5|$|After {{years in}} opposition, in 1849, Paraná was {{appointed}} by the national government as president of Pernambuco Province to investigate a Liberal rebellion {{that had taken place}} a year earlier, and seek a fair trial for the rebels. Blamed by his party colleagues for the years in opposition and having lost much of his influence <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> Paraná accepted the post, believing he could regain his place among his peers. With the nation internally pacified, he was sent to Uruguay in 1851 to forge an alliance with that country, and with the rebel Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Entre Ríos, against the Argentine Confederation. The alliance triumphed, and the Emperor elevated Paraná to the ranks of the titled nobility.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{became the}} first Liberal to be elected {{councillor}} for Ashton-under-Lyne in 1856. He was mayor of the council from 1857 to 1860 and retired from local politics in 1874 due to conflict with his own party. Mason returned to the Liberals in 1878 when he stood for election as Member of Parliament for Ashton-under-Lyne. He was voted in and supported progressive policies, which included women's suffrage, making him unpopular <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> He was MP from 1880 to 1885. When he died in 1886, aged 69, Hugh Mason had amassed £290,933 (now about £17million).|$|E
5000|$|Mutscher's opponents, many <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Democratic <b>Party,</b> {{were known}} as the [...] "Dirty 30"; their ranks {{included}} Joseph Hugh Allen of Baytown, Carlos Truan of Corpus Christi, and Robert Gammage of Houston.|$|R
25|$|As chairman, Tanner was at {{the head}} of his party in its heyday of state power and {{national}} influence, the boss of a well-oiled political machine that he had helped build. As such, he was instrumental in resuscitating the flagging political fortunes of U.S. Senator Shelby Moore Cullom <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Republican <b>party.</b>|$|R
25|$|He {{embarked}} on a course of unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. Sharon's plan was welcomed by both the Palestinian Authority and Israel's left wing as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it was greeted with opposition from <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Likud <b>party</b> and from other right wing Israelis, on national security, military, and religious grounds.|$|R
5|$|Walpole {{directed}} domestic policy, {{and after}} the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy. Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions. Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious. The Anglo-Spanish War was brought to an end, and George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the War of the Polish Succession {{on the side of}} the German states. In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular excise bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their court offices.|$|E
5|$|Greece– November 2011– After intense {{criticism}} from <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> {{the opposition and}} other EU governments, for his proposal to hold {{a referendum on the}} austerity and bailout measures, PM George Papandreou of the PASOK party announced his resignation in favour of a national unity government between three parties, of which only two currently remain in the coalition. Following the vote in the Greek parliament on the austerity and bailout measures, which both leading parties supported but many MPs of these two parties voted against, Papandreou and Antonis Samaras expelled a total of 44 MPs from their respective parliamentary groups, leading to PASOK losing its parliamentary majority. The early Greek legislative election, 2012 were {{the first time in the}} history of the country, at which the bipartisanship (consisted of PASOK and New Democracy parties), which ruled the country for over 40 years, collapsed in votes as a punishment for their support to the strict measures proposed by the country's foreign lenders and the Troika (consisted of the European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank). The popularity of PASOK dropped from 42.5% in 2010 to as low as 7% in some polls in 2012. The radical right-wing, extreme left-wing, communist and populist political parties that have opposed the policy of strict measures, won the majority of the votes.|$|E
25|$|Kekkonen's policies, {{especially}} {{towards the}} USSR, were criticised <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> by Veikko Vennamo, who broke off his Centre Party affiliation when Kekkonen {{was elected president}} in 1956. In 1959, Vennamo founded the Finnish Rural Party, the forerunner of the nationalist True Finns.|$|E
50|$|His {{government}} also led {{the country in}} the creation of tougher anti-smoking legislation, consolidation of school boards and local health authorities, creation of the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, the establishment {{of one of the most}} modern emergency health services in North America along with province-wide emergency field communications systems, and he waged a tough and ultimately successful fight against an entrenched patronage system in the provincial Department of Transportation and Public Works, as well as <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> political <b>party.</b>|$|R
50|$|While Israel {{since the}} signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 {{continued}} establishing and expanding settlements throughout the Palestinian territories (including in Gaza until 2005) and refused to withdraw as stipulated in the Oslo Accords, President Arafat was reluctant to transfer power, and opposition was growing from <b>within</b> and outside <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Zuma's {{close and}} {{allegedly}} corrupt {{relationship with the}} Gupta family {{has been a major}} source of discontent <b>within</b> both <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> – the ANC – and the South African public. The portmanteau [...] "Zupta," [...] a combination of [...] "Z" [...] from [...] "Zuma" [...] and the [...] "upta" [...] from [...] "Gupta," [...] was first coined by the Economic Freedom Fighters at the 2016 South African presidential state of the nation address when they disrupted the event by repeatedly chanting [...] "Zupta must fall" [...] to express their dissatisfaction with this relationship.|$|R
25|$|Tanner {{declined}} {{to seek a}} second term as governor, instead choosing to oppose the renomination of his former political ally, Shelby Cullom, as U.S. Senator. Tanner was badly defeated <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> ending his political career. He died less than five months after leaving office.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} {{collapse}} of his coalition, rebellion <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> and an acknowledged public relations disaster, Cowen announced his resignation as leader of Fianna Fáil on 22 January 2011. He insisted, however, that he would continue as Taoiseach until the election, in order to complete legislation for the 2011 budget.|$|E
25|$|Before Holden won {{the general}} election, he faced a primary {{challenge}} <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> from political activist Sheila Dow Ford, who {{ran to the}} left of Holden, eviscerating the Congressman for voting against the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. Holden defeated Ford by a margin of 65% to 35% in the primary to regain the Democratic nomination.|$|E
50|$|His {{penchant for}} rebellion, {{combined}} with his friendliness towards many Conservative MPs, {{led him to}} become unpopular <b>within</b> parts of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> According to The Times, senior Labour MPs demanded that the whip be withdrawn from him as an example to the 49 Labour MPs who rebelled against the government's plans to detain terror suspects for 90 days.|$|R
25|$|Schröder’s efforts backfired <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Social Democratic <b>Party</b> though, {{where the}} {{traditional}} labor wing rejected the Schröder-Blair call for cost-cutting {{in the welfare}} state and pro-business policies. Instead, the paper took part {{of the blame for}} a succession of six German state election losses in 1999 for Schröder's party. Only by 2000, Schröder managed to capitalize on the donations scandal of his Christian Democratic opposition to push through a landmark tax-reform bill and re-establish his dominance of the German political scene.|$|R
50|$|A general {{election}} in Japan {{was held on}} 11 September 2005 for all 480 seats of the House of Representatives of Japan, the lower house of the Diet of Japan, almost {{two years before the}} end of the term taken from the last election in 2003. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi called the election after bills to privatize Japan Post were voted down in the upper house (which cannot be dissolved), despite strong opposition <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Liberal Democratic <b>Party</b> (Japan) (LDP).|$|R
25|$|Tanner's {{early and}} {{untimely}} death {{meant that he}} {{would never be able to}} mend the ill feelings that resulted from his disputes <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> particularly those that arose from his challenge to Shelby Cullom immediately preceding his death. His relationship with Chicago politicians had been consistently antagonistic over the years, and they felt no inclination to remember him kindly.|$|E
25|$|He led the Labor {{opposition}} in the Tasmanian Parliament until 1923 when he became Premier, leading a minority ALP government. He held office until 1928, also serving as Treasurer during the whole period of his premiership. Lyons' government was cautious and pragmatic, establishing good relations with business and the conservative government in Canberra, but attracting some criticism from unionists <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> Labor narrowly lost the 1928 state election to the Nationalist Party.|$|E
25|$|Porter's {{chances for}} a victory in a statewide {{election}} were the greatest in 1926, when he again ran for the U.S. Senate, this time against insurgent Republican Smith W. Brookhart. Brookhart was fiercely opposed by many <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> because of his anti-business, pro-labor views, and Brookhart's opposition to Republican President Calvin Coolidge, and had officially lost the 1924 race for Iowa's other Senate seat to Democrat Daniel Steck. However, Porter again lost in the general election. Porter never again ran for statewide office.|$|E
50|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1983 general election, he {{narrowly}} won a re-selection battle <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Constituency Labour <b>Party,</b> against a challenge from a Leo Crawley, later a left-wing councillor in the constituency. In that election he was re-elected for the new Dumbarton constituency, which was practically the same as his old constituency, the only change was the addition of the villages of Bowling, and Milton. He retired at the 1987 general election and was replaced by John McFall.|$|R

5000|$|The conference {{also got}} off to a rocky start {{as a result of the}} {{different}} factions in the French Sudan colony which was hosting the conference. When Houphouët-Boigny, Apithy, and d'Arboussier arrived on the morning of 18 October at the airport in Bamako (in a plane which was formerly the private plane of Hermann Göring and was provided by the communist party) they were greeted by a hostile Sissoko, worried the party would give support to other French Sudanese political leaders and weaken his leadership. Sissoko, as the host of the conference, refused to open up the discussion. Eventually pressure from <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> political <b>party</b> and from the leaders assembled led him to agree to open the meeting at 4:00 PM (although he insisted on calling it [...] "your congress" [...] and not [...] "our congress" [...] throughout his opening speech).|$|R
25|$|Harold Handley {{was born}} November 27, 1909 in LaPorte, Indiana, {{one of the}} three sons of Harold Lowell and Lottie Margaret Brackbill Handley. His father was a {{merchant}} who sold furniture. He attend local public schools before enrolling in Indiana University. His classmates included William E. Jenner and George N. Craig. Handley became good friends with Jenner; the two later became important political allies. Craig however, would become Handley's major opponent <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> He studied at the school for four years and graduated in 1932 with a bachelor's degree in economics.|$|E
25|$|Turner's {{leadership}} was frequently questioned, {{and in the}} lead up to the 1986 Liberal convention, {{a vote of confidence}} loomed large. The popular Chrétien resigned his seat, creating a stir in caucus. The ongoing and often open unpopularity of Turner <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> led to many editorial cartoonists drawing him with a back stabbed full of knives. Keith Davey and other Liberals began a public campaign against Turner, coinciding with backroom struggles involving Chrétien's supporters. The public conflict is said to have influenced many Liberals to support Turner, and he ended up getting 75% of the delegate vote.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{the first}} cabinet of Bondevik {{resigned}} following an unsuccessful motion of confidence. Stoltenberg's first cabinet governed Norway from 17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001. Stoltenberg was the deputy {{leader of the}} labor party while Jagland was the party leader. Instead Jagland was given the post as Foreign Minister. Stoltenberg's first tenure as Prime Minister (2000–2001) was controversial <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party,</b> being responsible for reforms and modernisation {{of the welfare state}} that included part-privatising several key state-owned services and corporations. In the parliamentary election of 10 September 2001, the party suffered one of its worst results ever, winning only 24% of the vote.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 52 people were arrested. Those arrested from the National Awami Party {{leadership}} included Khan Abdul Wali Khan, Khan Amirzadah Khan, Syed Muhammad Kaswar Gardezi, Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo, Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri, Mir Gul Khan Nasir, Sardar Ataullah Mengal, Habib Jalib, Barrister Azizullah Shaikh, Aslam Baluch (Shaysani), Aslam Kurd, Saleem Kurd, Sher Mohammad Marri (General Sherof), Najam Sethi, Saleem Pervez, Majid Gichki, Mir Abdul Wahid Kurd (read article) and Karnel Sultan Mengal.

2500|$|In {{the end of}} 2003, Sharon {{embarked}} on a course of unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. Sharon's plan has been welcomed by both the Palestinian Authority and Israel's left wing as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it has been greeted with opposition from <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Likud <b>party</b> and from other right-wing Israelis, on national security, military, and religious grounds. In January 2005, Sharon formed a national unity government that included representatives of Likud, Labor, and Meimad and Degel HaTorah as [...] "out-of-government" [...] supporters without any seats in the government (United Torah Judaism parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between August 16 and 30, 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. The disengagement plan was implemented in September 2005. Following the withdrawal, the Israeli town of Sderot and other Israeli communities near the Gaza strip became subject to constant shelling and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza with only minimal Israeli response.|$|R
50|$|Yet while {{establishing}} Begin as {{a leader}} with broad public appeal, the peace treaty with Egypt was met with fierce criticism <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> Likud <b>party.</b> <b>His</b> devout followers {{found it difficult to}} reconcile Begin's history as a keen promoter of the Greater Israel agenda with his willingness to relinquish occupied territory. Agreeing to the removal of Israeli settlements from the Sinai was perceived by many as a clear departure from Likud's Revisionist ideology. Several prominent Likud members, most notably Yitzhak Shamir, objected to the treaty and abstained when it was ratified with an overwhelming majority in the Knesset, achieved only thanks to support from the opposition. A small group of hardliners within Likud, associated with Gush Emunim Jewish settlement movement, eventually decided to split and form the Tehiya party in 1979. They led the Movement for Stopping the Withdrawal from Sinai, violently clashing with IDF soldiers during the forceful eviction of Yamit settlement in April 1982. Despite the traumatic scenes from Yamit, political support for the treaty did not diminish and the Sinai was handed over to Egypt in 1982.|$|R
25|$|Koizumi {{moved the}} LDP {{away from its}} {{traditional}} rural agrarian base toward a more urban, neoliberal core, as Japan's population grew in major cities and declined in less populated areas, although under current purely geographical districting, rural votes in Japan are still many times more powerful than urban ones. In addition to the privatization of Japan Post (which many rural residents fear will reduce their access to basic services such as banking), Koizumi also slowed down the LDP's heavy subsidies for infrastructure and industrial development in rural areas. These tensions made Koizumi a controversial but popular figure <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> and among the Japanese electorate.|$|E
25|$|Cain's {{government}} was {{hampered by the}} hostility of the Legislative Council (which until 1950 had been elected on a restricted property-based franchise and so always had a conservative majority), and also by tensions <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party.</b> During the war the Communist Party had grown greatly in strength in the trade unions which controlled and funded the Labor Party, leading a faction of anti-Communist Catholics to form within the party to fight Communist influence. (This body, known as The Movement, was organised by B. A. Santamaria {{and supported by the}} Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Daniel Mannix). Conflict between left and right in the Labor Party grew increasingly bitter in the Cold War atmosphere of the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|Newly elected KMT {{chairman}} Ma Ying-jeou saw {{his political}} fortunes bolstered by his party's election success. He had already successfully {{distanced himself from}} his predecessor, Lien Chan. Ma had declined to accompany Lien on his visit to mainland China {{earlier in the year}} and, as chairman, has appointed fresh faces to a number of party posts. He has now linked his name with the cause of clean government, a prominent KMT 2005 campaign pledge. The election is thus widely read as an expression of voter confidence in Ma's ability to achieve reform <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>party</b> as well as in government. Ma has emerged as an early favorite in the 2008 presidential race.|$|E

40|$|All {{elections}} are unique, but the Australian federal election of 2010 was unusual for many reasons. It {{came in the}} wake of the unprecedented ousting of the Prime Minister who had led the Australian Labor Party to a landslide victory, after eleven years in opposition, at the previous election in 2007. In a move that to many would have been unthinkable, Kevin Rudd’s increasing unpopularity <b>within</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> parliamentary <b>party</b> finally took its toll and in late June he was replaced by his deputy, Julia Gillard. Thus the second unusual feature of the election was that it was contested by Australia’s first female prime minister. The third unusual feature was that the election almost saw a first-term government, with a comfortable majority, defeated. Instead it resulted in a hung parliament, for the first time since 1940, and Labor scraped back into power as a minority government, supported by three independents and the first member of the Australian Greens ever to be elected to the House of Representatives. The Coalition Liberal and National opposition parties themselves had a leader of only eight months standing, Tony Abbott, whose ascension to the position had surprised more than a few. This was the context for an investigation of voting behaviour in the 2010 election [...] . ...|$|R
