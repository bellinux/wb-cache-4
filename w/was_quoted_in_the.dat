5|$|Tennessee {{defeated}} Connecticut {{again in}} the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy erupted {{in the days after}} the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote. With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for the entire season, freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52.|$|E

25|$|On 20 April 1997 Aziz Pahad <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Israeli daily {{newspaper}} Ha'aretz as confirming that the 1979 flash over the Indian Ocean (Vela Incident) was indeed from a South African nuclear test.

25|$|Debra once left a Red Sox game, when Clemens pitched {{for another}} team, in tears from the {{heckling}} she received. This is documented in an updated later edition to Dan Shaughnessy's best-selling book, Curse of the Bambino. Debra also <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> book as stating {{that it was}} the poor attitude of Red Sox fans that prevented the team from ever winning the World Series (this was quoted prior to the Red Sox' 2004 World Series victory).|$|E

25|$|When Howard Hampton {{announced}} he was stepping down {{as leader of the}} Ontario New Democratic Party in June 2008, DiNovo was one of four MPPs, along with Michael Prue, Peter Tabuns and Andrea Horwath, whose names were suggested by party insiders as potential candidates in the 2009 Ontario NDP leadership convention. However, she <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Star a few days later as saying that she was unlikely to be a candidate, and she subsequently endorsed Tabuns for the leadership.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2006, Keating visited Columbia, South Carolina, {{where he}} spoke {{to a group of}} GOP {{supporters}} about a possible 2008 Presidential bid. On January 17, 2007, Keating <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tulsa World as declining a possible run for the U.S. Presidency in 2008. His reasons for not running were associated with the relative head starts in preparations of U.S. Senator John McCain and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. In February 2007 Keating appeared in Spartanburg, South Carolina and endorsed McCain's bid.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the trailers being swept away by the torrent, many houses, with people still in or on top of them, were swept into Lake Ontario. Many people were saved when the houses in which they took shelter were stopped by trees from going into the lake. The reeve, Marie Curtis, <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Globe and Mail saying {{that if it were}} not for the trees, half of the village would have been swept into the lake. She also described a house with 35 people on its roof that was stopped by two trees from floating into the lake.|$|E

25|$|A {{day before}} the {{outbreak}} of the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Oz signed a statement supporting military action against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Two weeks later he advocated a ceasefire with Hamas and called attention to the harsh conditions there. He <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Italian paper Corriere della Sera as saying Hamas was responsible for the outbreak of violence, but {{the time had come to}} seek a cease-fire. Oz also said that if innocent citizens were indeed killed in Gaza, it should be treated as a war crime, although he doubted that bombing UN structures was intentional.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have argued}} that the outcome of the Mỹ Lai courts-martial failed to uphold the laws of war {{established}} in the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Tribunals. For example, Telford Taylor, senior American prosecutor at Nuremberg, wrote that legal principles established at the war crimes trials could have been used to prosecute senior American military commanders for failing to prevent atrocities such as the one at My Lai. The Secretary of the Army Howard Callaway <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> New York Times as stating that Calley's sentence was reduced because Calley honestly believed that what he did was a part of his orders—a rationale that contradicts the standards set at Nuremberg and Tokyo, where following orders was not a defense for committing war crimes. On the whole, other than the My Lai courts-martial, there were thirty six military trials held by the U.S. Army from January 1965 to August 1973 for crimes against civilians in Vietnam.|$|E

Al Michaels and Jim Lampley hosted the pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame (Lampley {{presided over the}} Vince Lombardi Trophy {{presentation}} ceremony) coverage for ABC. Michaels and Lampley were joined by analysts O. J. Simpson (who would normally have been the second color commentator; when interviewed as to why Theismann would join Gifford and Meredith in the booth instead of Simpson; director Chet Forte <b>was</b> <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January 14, 1985 edition of Broadcasting Magazine as saying that Theismann could contribute more due to having played both teams in the regular-season as well as having played in the two previous Super Bowls.) and Tom Landry (in a separate booth during the game).
