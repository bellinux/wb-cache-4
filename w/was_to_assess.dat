McClellan assessed local defensive capabilities for the secretary. (The information was not used until 1870, when President Ulysses S. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to annex the Dominican Republic.) Davis was beginning to treat McClellan almost as a protégé, and his next assignment <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the logistical readiness of various railroads in the United States, once again with an eye toward planning for the transcontinental railroad. In March 1855, McClellan was promoted to captain and assigned to the 1st U.S. Cavalry regiment.|$|E

25|$|As the {{smallest}} known celestial body {{with its own}} ring system, Chariklo and its rings {{are the first to}} have been fully simulated by numerically solving the N-body problem. The assumptions made included the planetoid and ring particles being spherical, and all particles having equal radii between 2.5 and 10m. Depending on parameters, the simulations involved between 21 million and 345 million particles interacting with each other through gravity and collisions. The goal of the simulations <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> under what conditions the rings remain stable, that is do not cluster into few bigger bodies.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 1888, the Board of Commissions {{corresponded with}} Doyle {{to find out}} the {{necessary}} dimensions of the pedestals which the sculptures would eventually be installed upon, desiring to prepare them in advance. The Board of Commissions requested Doyle’s presence at the arrival of the statues, as he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the condition of the statues and check for any damages sustained during shipment. The statues traveled by freight train after having arrived in America from Italy, and were delivered to the Indiana State House on September 1, 1888. The statues were then installed, the last of which was put into place on September 20, 1888.|$|E
25|$|The Karnataka State Industrial Security Force (KISF) is {{responsible}} for security on the Namma Metro. Bangalore Police conducted detailed mock drills at metro stations {{for the first time}} on 25 March 2017. Police officials stated that the drill <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> readiness to deal with situations such as hoax bomb calls, terrorist infiltration or attacks. Sniffer dogs, bomb detection and disposal squad, anti-sabotage squad and Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) were involved in the drill. Police had previously conducted basic mock drills, but this was the first one aimed toward dealing with specific threats. The chosen day was a Saturday, when crowds are usually larger, in order to make the drill more challenging for officers. The BMRCL has not informed of the drill in advance.|$|E

Rabbi Schneersohn was greeted by some 600 people, with security provided by over 100 New York City police officers. “May the Almighty bless this great country that has been a refuge for our Jewish people,” he said at his arrival. The purpose of his visit <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the educational and religious state of American Jewry, and raise awareness of the plight of Soviet Jews.

25|$|IsraAid, an Israeli {{humanitarian}} organization, sent a 15-person search-and-rescue team, including {{emergency medical}} staff, which arrived in Haiti on Friday, January 15. The IsraAid team set up treatment rooms {{to treat the}} injured at the collapsed main hospital in Port-au-Prince. IsraAid also opened a child education center in February in the Pétion-Ville refugee camp, the largest refugee camp in Port-au-Prince area, in cooperation with other agencies, such as Operation Blessing.

In February 2010, a team of medical experts from ALYN Hospital in Jerusalem, one of Israel's major rehabilitation centers that specialized in the rehabilitation of amputees, arrived in Haiti, under the auspices of IsraAid, along with professionals from the Israel Center for the Treatment of Psychotrauma and other volunteers. The team <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> the needs for provision of rehabilitation for the injured, and train potential Haitian therapists in Israel.|$|E
25|$|On 16 June 2006, it was {{announced}} that Everton had entered into talks with the Knowsley Council and Tesco over the possibility of building a new 55,000 seat stadium, expandable to over 60,000, in Kirkby. The plan became known as The Kirkby Project. The club took the unusual move of giving its supporters a say in the club's future by holding a ballot on the proposal with the results being in favour of it, 59% to 41%. Opponents to the plan included other local councils concerned by the effect of a large Tesco store being built as part of the development and a group of fans demanding that Everton should remain within the city boundaries of Liverpool. Following a public inquiry into the project, the central government rejected the proposal. Local and regional politicians attempted to put together an amended rescue plan with the Liverpool City Council calling a meeting with Everton F.C. The plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>assess</b> some suitable sites short listed within the city boundary. However, the amended plan was also not successful.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2013, culling in England was {{controversially}} trialled in two pilot {{areas in}} west Gloucestershire and west Somerset.
