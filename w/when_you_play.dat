500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are not thinking about individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This {{is the opportunity to}} win another trophy. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> against good teams you have to do your best. I am not thinking about the past and that we won the Champions League." ...|$|E
500|$|Taborn has {{commented on}} the {{similarities}} and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments. Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there are definitely things I would do on the piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't do on the Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is so strong that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> something on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E

Brenda Blethyn was hired to play Mrs Bennet, whom Moggach {{believed to be the}} unsung heroine of the film; Wright explained that it was [...] "a tricky part , as she can be very annoying; you want to stop her chattering and shrieking. But Brenda has the humour and the heart to show the amount of love and care Mrs Bennet has for her daughters." [...] Wright convinced veteran actress Judi Dench to join the cast as Lady Catherine de Bourgh by writing her a letter that read [...] "I love it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> a bitch. Please come and be a bitch for me." [...] Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2008, Square Enix {{announced}} that they were officially planning to bring Chrono Trigger to the Nintendo DS handheld platform. [...] Composer Yasunori Mitsuda {{was pleased with the}} project, exclaiming [...] "finally!" [...] after receiving the news from Square Enix and maintaining, [...] "it's still a very deep, very high-quality game even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> it today. I'm very interested in seeing what kids today think about it when they play it." [...] Square retained Masato Kato to oversee the port, and Tose to program it. Kato explained, [...] "I wanted it {{to be based on the}} original Super NES release rather than the PlayStation version. I thought we should look at the additional elements from the Playstation version, re-examine and re-work them to make it a complete edition. That’s how it struck me and I told the staff so later on." [...] Square Enix touted the game by displaying Akira Toriyama's original art at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, {{publications}} like GameSpot {{thought that}} while the Arbiter and Covenant side added [...] "newfound complexity to the story", it distracted the player from Earth's fate; a panel of Halo2 reviewers argued that though the decision to humanize the Covenant {{by the introduction of}} the Arbiter was welcome, the execution in-game was lacking. The missions where the player controls the Arbiter were described as [...] "anything but easy" [...] and occasionally [...] "boring", {{due to the lack of}} human weapons to balance the gameplay. A review performed by Computer and Video Games described the time that the player controls the character as [...] " [...] crap bits <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> as an alien Arbiter" [...] and listed this as one of Halo2s flaws. Reviewer Jarno Kokko said that while he did not personally dislike playing as the character, the idea of [...] "people disliking the concept of playing on the other side in a game that is supposed to be the 'Master Chief blows up some alien scum' show" [...] was a plausible complaint. Among some fans, the character was reviled.|$|E

500|$|On September 28, the Mets {{came into}} Philadelphia for a three-game {{series against the}} Phillies. The Mets were [...] games out of first with six games left: three against the Phillies and the last three against the first-place Cardinals. They had an {{opportunity}} to win the division and were playing the Phillies, against whom they had a season record of 12–3. The Mets won the opener, 1–0, to move within two games back with five remaining to play. However, the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29. As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos, the Phillies' Don Carman pitched a complete-game one-hitter, facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets. After the game, Mets manager Davey Johnson said, [...] "How does it feel now? Empty? Not yet. But we need to get help. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> 162 games and you're eliminated, then you feel empty. And sick." [...] He promised reporters, [...] "We're going to win tomorrow night.". The following night, Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden struck out 10, and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each, but the Phillies' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th-inning pinch-hit home run off of Orosco, clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{integrated}} the band's typical punk and funk style, but {{moved away}} from this with more melodically driven songs. Tracks like [...] "The Righteous and the Wicked", [...] "Suck My Kiss", [...] "Blood Sugar Sex Magik", [...] "Give it Away" [...] and [...] "Funky Monks" [...] still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs, but differed from Mother's Milk in that they contained less distortion. Flea, who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique, downplayed on this {{in favor of more}} traditional and melodic bass lines. He also adopted a minimalist, [...] "less is more" [...] philosophy: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good." [...] Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers' musical horizons, and that it was a departure from their previous material. One of Blood Sugar Sex Magiks more melodic tracks, [...] "Breaking the Girl", was written about Kiedis' constantly shifting relationships. He feared that he was following in his father's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer, rather than establishing stable and long-term relationships: [...] "...As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be, {{at the end of the}} day, that shit is lonely and you're left with nothing." [...] The track also featured a bridge in the middle, consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump.|$|E

2500|$|Breathing soon {{attracted}} his attention. According to Liberati, [...] "It {{is an easy}} {{matter to}} hold a tone for say twenty seconds, isn't it? Now try to play detached tones for twenty seconds and do you do it? Well I found {{that something was wrong}} because I couldn't play half, not even a fourth as long as I could hold a tone. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> you must let only the amount of air pass the lips that is needed to produce the tone—no more.

2500|$|A major hit for Dench {{came with}} Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice, a 2005 {{adaptation}} of the novel by Jane Austen, starring Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland.

[...] Dench had only one week available to shoot her scenes, forcing Wright to make them his first days of filming.

2500|$|Hinrich {{started the}} {{exhibition}} game against Lithuania on August 13, 2006. He scored 10 points, had 2 steals, and shot 80% {{from the field}} in a US win. After the game, Hinrich was asked about starting the game. He responded, [...] "We're playing in groups right now. I know when I get my time, I just {{try to make the}} best of it, make sure our team is successful.

[...] Marcello Lippi was equally effusive about the performances on show: [...] "It {{was meant to be a}} celebration and it was.

2500|$|Flea's bass playing {{has changed}} {{considerably}} throughout the years. When he joined Fear, his technique centered largely on punk rock bass lines; however, {{he was to}} change this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a [...] "slap" [...] bass style that drew influence largely from Bootsy Collins. However, this technique caused Flea to receive attention from the music world and was often copied, and he, therefore, {{felt it necessary to}} almost completely remove slap-bass styles from his repertoire following Mother's Milk (1989). Consequently, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991) saw a notable shift in style as it featured less of his signature technique and more styles that focused on traditional and melodic roots. His intellectual beliefs on how to play the instrument were also altered: [...] "I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, 'I've really got to chill out and play half as many notes'. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> less, it's more exciting—there's more room for everything.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of {{training}} camp Tortorella promised to make changes {{to the way the}} Canucks played. He wanted to make the team tougher to play against. Some of the techniques he felt would accomplish this were hard forechecking, protecting the puck, being strong along the boards, and increasing shot blocking. The Canucks finished the 2012–13 season as the 27th ranked team in blocked shots while the Rangers finished sixth. Tortorella also said that he would use the Sedin twins to kill penalties. The Sedins had asked Vigneault to be used on the penalty kill, but he opted to keep them rested for their offensive role instead. Upon learning that they would be killing penalties Henrik Sedin said: [...] "It's something that I think {{is a big part of}} becoming a great player. You have to be on the ice for all situations. For us, we were counted upon to score goals, and if we didn't, then we were terrible. I think you grow as players <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>play</b> all situations." [...] Tortorella put the Canucks through a physically demanding training camp. Players were asked to run two miles in 12 minutes and were put through a series of intense skating drills. Tortorella believed he could learn about his players when they were exhausted and asked them to give a little more.|$|E
2500|$|Jeremy Roenick, in his book, {{spoke about}} Fedorov {{being one of}} his top ten {{favourite}} players to play against: [...] "He was a horse, bigger than you'd think he was.
