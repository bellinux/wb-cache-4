25|$|Successful snail culture {{requires}} the correct equipment and supplies, including: snail pens or enclosures; devices for measuring humidity (hygrometer), temperature (thermometer), soil moisture (soil moisture sensor), and light (in foot candles); a <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> and {{an instrument to}} measure snail size; a kit for testing soil contents; and a magnifying glass to see the eggs. Equipment to control the climate (temperature and humidity), to regulate water (e.g., a sprinkler system to keep the snails moist and a drainage system), to provide light and shade, and to kill or keep out pests and predators may also be needed. Some horticultural systems such as artificial lighting systems and water sprinklers may be adapted for snail culture. Better results are obtained if snails {{of the same kind}} and generation are used. Some recommend putting the hatchlings in another pen.|$|E
500|$|An {{unpublished}} manuscript on {{file with}} the Montana State Historical Society describes life in Basin between 1906 and 1910 in great detail. Two railroads, the Northern Pacific {{on the north side}} of the Boulder River, and the Great Northern on the south side, served the city; both had depots and warehouses in Basin and carried passengers as well as freight. The Glass brothers' smelter had been set up on the north side to process concentrated ore delivered by rail from out of town or from the mills on the south side. Infrastructure included a <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> for ore cars and an overhead tram to carry ore across the river from the reduction mill to the smelter.

40|$|A {{model of}} fractal {{hierarchical}} structures that share {{the property of}} non-homogeneous weighted networks is introduced. These networks can be completely and analytically characterized {{in terms of the}} involved parameters, i. e., the size of the original graph Nk and the non-homogeneous <b>weight</b> <b>scaling</b> factors r 1, r 2, · · · rM. We also study the average weighted shortest path (AWSP), the average degree and the average node strength, taking place on the non-homogeneous hierarchical weighted networks. Moreover the AWSP is scrupulously calculated.

The range {{and complexity of}} medical devices used in both hospital and homecare settings are increasing. Certain devices are specific to a common need of a disease process.

Other devices can provide a more general set of information, such as a <b>weight</b> <b>scale,</b> blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, etc. Less technological tools can include organizers, charts, and diagrams to trend or keep track of things such as amount of calories, mood, vital sign measurements, and more.|$|E
50|$|A {{modified}} <b>weight</b> <b>scale</b> {{called as}} Tairyo Haibun Kei (体量配分計) (body mass distribution meter) {{is used to}} tell somebody's taiheki. The scale's platform is divided into left and right parts for both legs, {{and each of the}} parts is further divided into 3 parts: frontal right, frontal left, and rear parts. Thus one stands over the 6 parts of the platform. When he makes postures, such as brace and forward-bending position, the scale gives data of biased balance of his weight in certain direction for each posture. According to Noguchi, each taiheki has a distinct tendency of biased balance of weight in each posture. One can hence determine somebody's taiheki based on the collected data.|$|E

50|$|RTV {{silicone}} rubbers are, however, generally expensive--especially platinum-cure. They {{are also}} sensitive to substances (sulfur-containing modelling clay such as Plastilina, for example) that may prevent the silicone from curing (referred to as cure inhibition). Silicones are usually very thick (high viscosity), {{and must be}} vacuum degassed prior to pouring, to minimize bubble entrapment. If making a brush-on rubber mold, the curing time factor between coats is long (longer than urethanes or polysulfides, shorter than latex). Silicone components (A+B) must be mixed accurately by <b>weight</b> (<b>scale</b> required) or they do not work. Tin catalyst silicones shrink somewhat, {{and do not have}} a long shelf life. Certain types of RTV release acetic acid during the curing process, and this can attack solder joints, causing the solder to detach from the copper wire.|$|E

Curvis continued his progression and in the summer of 1950 he won his first title eliminator, beating Gwn Williams to set up a shot at the British belt. Before the title challenge he beat ex-Dutch welterweight champion Giel de Roode, followed by a loss to Charles Humez, the recently deposed French welterweight champion. On 13 September 1950 Curvis faced Eddie Thomas for the British welterweight title. Held at St Helen's in Swansea, the fifteen round fight went the distance, Thomas winning by points decision.|$|E
50|$|The retail {{industry}} {{is one of}} the predominant users of POS terminals.A retail point of sale system typically includes a cash register (which in recent times comprises a computer, monitor, cash drawer, receipt printer, customer display and a barcode scanner) and the majority of retail POS systems also include a debit/credit card reader.

While the system may include a keyboard and mouse, more and more POS monitors use touch-screen technology for ease of use, and a computer is built into the monitor chassis for what is referred to as an all-in-one unit. All-in-one POS units liberate counter space for the retailer. The POS system software can typically handle a myriad of customer based functions such as sales, returns, exchanges, layaways, gift cards, gift registries, customer loyalty programs, promotions, discounts and much more.
