5|$|In February 1943 the British Government {{decided to}} {{transfer}} the recently raised 81st (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> Division from <b>West</b> <b>Africa</b> to India {{to take part in}} the Burma Campaign. This unit required much more shipping space than other British divisions, as its fighting units were supported by thousands of porters. To facilitate the division's movement, additional troopships were assigned to the regular WS convoys. The 81stDivision's advance parties departed Freetown with Convoys WS29 and WS30 in April and May, and the 6th (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> Brigade embarked on ships of Convoy WS31 at Lagos between 2 and 10July. It was planned to transport the division's two remaining brigades in convoys WS32 and WS33.|$|E
5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> {{authorities}} enforced explicit rules in an attempt to end slavery in the region. In 1903, the government instructed French administrators to not use slave as an administrative category anymore. This was followed in 1905 by a formal French decree that ended slavery throughout French <b>West</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|E

5|$|In a {{different}} study, tissue and bone samples of 32 lion specimens in museums were used. Results indicated that lions form phylogeographic groups, one each in North Africa / Asia, <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> eastern Sahel, south-eastern Africa and south-western Africa. Results of another phylogeographic {{study indicate that}} southeastern Ethiopia, western Somalia and northern Kenya are genetic admixture regions between lions from Central Africa and Southern Africa, and that lions {{in the northern part}} of Central Africa are genetically closer to lions in North and <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> and those in the southern part closer to lions in Southern Africa.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, {{during times}} of {{economic}} prosperity, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor put aside their differences and joined forces to thwart Nigeria, which, {{in an attempt to}} establish itself in <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> had created the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The two countered the ECOWAS by creating the Economic Community of <b>West</b> <b>Africa</b> (ECWA), which superseded the old trade partnerships in the French-speaking regions. However, after assurances from Nigeria that ECOWAS would function {{in the same manner as}} the earlier Francophone organisations, Houphouët-Boigny and Senghor decided to merge their organization into ECOWAS in May 1975.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia's main {{contribution}} to the Burma Campaign in terms of manpower {{was made by the}} Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR), a regiment of black troops led by white officers that joined the front at the end of 1944. The colony also made a significant {{contribution to}} the Commonwealth forces' command element in Burma, providing white officers and NCOs to the 81st (<b>West</b> <b>Africa),</b> 82nd (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> and 11th (East Africa) Divisions, made up of units from Nigeria, the Gold Coast, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika, Nyasaland, Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. Almost every African battalion in Burma had white Rhodesian officers and NCOs attached; some were over 70% Rhodesian-led.|$|E
5|$|The 5th (<b>West</b> <b>Africa)</b> Brigade was {{the second}} of the 81st Division's brigades to be shipped from <b>West</b> <b>Africa.</b> The brigade {{comprised}} 12,000 personnel and was scheduled to depart with Convoy WS32 on 31 July. The liners Britannic, Largs Bay and Tamaroa were available in Freetown to carry 8,528 of these men, and it was decided to sail the troopship SS California directly from the Clyde to provide the remaining berths.|$|E

5|$|Unlike mosques {{situated}} in urban settings in <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> the Larabanga Mosque is comparatively small. Rural mosques, like Larabanga's, were usually conceived {{by a single}} marabout and loosely based on styles seen elsewhere {{such as in the}} Great Mosque of Djenné. In order to achieve a physical resemblance to the architecture used elsewhere, the Larabanga Mosque had to incorporate large buttresses in order to compensate for the poorer quality of building materials. Larabanga is one of eight ancient and highly revered mosques in Ghana, and is also the oldest. It is a place of pilgrimage and is considered the Mecca of <b>West</b> <b>Africa.</b>|$|E

It {{suffered}} heavy casualties when attacked by German Focke-Wulf Fw200 Condor long-range bombers while {{en route from}} Britain to <b>West</b> <b>Africa</b> in July 1943. The convoy comprised two large troopships and a freighter, later joined by two destroyers and two frigates as escorts at various dates after it sailed on 7July 1943. The two troopships, SS California and SS Duchess of York, both former liners, were carrying military personnel to <b>West</b> <b>Africa,</b> where locally recruited troops were to be embarked as reinforcements for the Allied forces in Burma and the Middle East. The freighter MV Port Fairy, carrying ammunition, was ultimately bound for Australia and New Zealand via the Panama canal.|$|E
