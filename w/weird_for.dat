It was so fun to do {{and it was really}} out of the box and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, [...] "Point your toes!"

500|$|Criticism of {{the series}} was {{directed}} at the visual style and writing. Rob Owen writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the style reminiscent of Atari 5200 video games and wrote that viewers could [...] "thank" [...] or [...] "blame" [...] Jones for his creation. For the magazine Variety, Brian Lowry disregarded the series as uninteresting and challenging to watch, the visuals and sounds <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> weirdness' sake. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media defined the series as misguided, its stories as undeveloped, and its visual style as unappealing. The Weekly Alibis Devin D. O'Leary acknowledged the style as Paper Rad's own and found the writing more solid than that of Adult Swim's programming for which it could be mistaken. The jokes were not instantly funny according to O'Leary, but the visual style combined with the writing would provide amusement for Paper Rad's existing fans.|$|E
500|$|Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a {{relatively}} positive review. He wrote, [...] "'Hollywood A.D.' was Duchovny's nudge-nudge, wink-wink writing-directing effort for this season. [...] Duchovny did not fail to deliver an episode that truly reflected his own wit and intelligence. All the while remaining true {{to the spirit of}} the show that made him famous." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", and wrote that it [...] "is muddled and frequently so in love with just being <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> weird’s sake that everybody forgets we need at least a little justification to pull everything together in the end." [...] He also called it [...] "a hard episode not to love, frankly." [...] Handlen felt that the humor and sweetness helped to make the episode a success. He also wrote that Mulder and Scully's dynamic worked towards the episode's favor.|$|E

500|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{nominated}} in the category for Best Rock Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Jon Wiederhorn from MTV News, the shots of the video are [...] "evocative and artistic, resembling {{a cross between a}} foreign film and a Chanel advertisement." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News said that Lee's disconnection in the video shows a [...] "distressed and emotionally wrought heroine." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised the video saying that Lee looked like a [...] "teen-misery titan" [...] and that she [...] "tiptoed through a marble castle of pain". He also concluded that she could have borrowed the dress from Stevie Nicks. During an interview with Spin in 2011 Lee said that it was <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> her to watch the old videos of the band including the one for [...] "My Immortal". She explained, [...] "Just watching our oldest videos, it's weird. I definitely remember watching 'My Immortal,' like, 'That was not some dream where it was really somebody else.' I've totally had a couple of those moments. It's cool." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} the second episode of the series {{directed}} by Bryan Gordon. Gordon had previously directed the first season episode [...] "The Alliance". [...] "The Injury" [...] was written by Mindy Kaling, who also acts for the show as customer service representative Kelly Kapoor. After the character development that had occurred in the previous episode, [...] "Booze Cruise", Greg Daniels decided {{to create a more}} inane episode that involved [...] "Michael's grilled foot." [...] Writer and actor B. J. Novak said the idea for [...] "Injury" [...] started out as an idea in the writing room that just [...] "spun out of control". The original plan was for Michael to have fallen asleep in the sun, while having sunblock all over him, except for his foot. According to BJ Novak, the episode was originally going to be called [...] "My Grilled Foot", but writer Mindy Kaling thought it was [...] "too <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> people to tune in and watch that". Novak has described [...] "The Injury" [...] as one of his favorite episodes, and said of it, [...] "I don't think any other TV show would have made an episode from that starting point, and yet {{it was one of the}} funniest and most relatable episodes as it went on that we've ever had." ...|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} the album [...] "offers up another batch of great, club-ready songs that are a touch too <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> American hit radio. Robyn sings and raps about {{standard}} diva themes (dance-floor ecstasy, self-reliance), but the music is deliciously wacked-out." [...] Pitchfork's Joe Colly felt the album needed a [...] "classic single on par with 'Dancing on My Own' or ' Heartbeat'", but concluded, [...] "Minor quibbles and missteps aside, Body Talk Pt. 2 is a perfectly solid—and occasionally awesome—record." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that through the album, Robyn proves [...] "that stylish, cutting-edge pop doesn't have to be competitive or egotistical." [...] Adam Johns of Drowned in Sound was mixed in his review, writing that [...] "While it's a fairly remarkable piece of craft, her icy disco diversion here leaves me somewhat flat [...] It should satisfy the listeners who primarily show up for Creative Robyn." [...] Luke Winkie of musicOMH wrote a mixed review as well, saying that [...] "Pt 2 doesn't have the same feel it's as if Robyn may have exhausted her supply of great songs too soon. It has its moments, but in general just doesn't compare to Pt 1." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. When {{all is said and}} done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer will be able to skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in front of our eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for. Oops." ...|$|E
500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E

Knightley explained that female artists face greater hurdles in the film industry compared to their male counterparts, and also revealed that she was perplexed {{by the use of}} [...] "feminist" [...] in a derogatory sense: [...] "Somehow, it [...] became a dirty word. I thought it was really <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> a long time, and I think it's great that we're coming out of that." [...] Knightley posed topless for the September 2014 issue of Interview, on the condition that she not be photoshopped, to draw attention to how [...] "women's bodies are a battleground and photography is partly to blame." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win".

2500|$|Steven Price was {{announced}} as the composer for Ant-Man by director Edgar Wright, who {{he had previously}} worked with, in February 2014, but they both left the film that March. In January 2015, Christophe Beck was hired to score the film, having previously worked with the new director, Peyton Reed. Beck and Reed began experimenting with [...] "high concept" [...] electronic music to create a [...] "glitched out, digital, electronic, skittery score" [...] that could represent the insect and technology aspects of the film, but it was ultimately [...] "too weird and quirky ... almost <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> its own sake". Feige asked that they instead take [...] "the classic symphonic approach with big themes and bold brass", which Beck did with the unique twist of [...] "a sneaky sense of fun since it is, after all, not only a superhero movie, but also a heist comedy." [...] That heist genre gave Beck [...] "a little latitude to use a rhythm section and {{something a little bit}} more funky and jazzy and groovy that I wouldn’t otherwise {{have been able to get}} away with." ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{developed}} the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the Bay Area and coming across a wallaby {{that seemed to}} be oblivious to the chaos around him. Murray combed through his sketchbooks, {{developed the}} Rocko's Modern Life concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon, believing that the concept would likely be rejected. Murray felt they would not like the pilot, and he would just collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film. According to Murray, around three or four months later he had [...] "forgotten about" [...] the concept and was working on My Dog Zero when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for My Dog Zero. On his website he describes My Dog Zero as [...] "that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to Rocko." [...] "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic" [...] was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that Heffer Wolfe, one of the characters, would be [...] "a little too <b>weird</b> <b>for</b> test audiences". Murray, instead of removing Heffer from [...] "Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic", decided to write [...] "Trash-O-Madness" [...] as the pilot episode.|$|E
