[...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell that was there for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E

Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with a sense that they have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|E

5000|$|Keyboardist Franny Griffiths {{defended the}} album's lack of dance tracks, {{which had been}} {{somewhat}} of a tradition on previous Space releases: [...] "For me it's better. People might say why's there no dance tracks or maybe there's no Yorkie tracks, but I think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> back <b>to</b> it you'll see why them things aren't on it because its more consistent, even though it's all our different ideas, it's at a better blend, it runs better and <b>you</b> can <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> each track after each other no problem.

He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> my music. I don't think people realize just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it , studying her phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E
5000|$|Labrinth {{claims that}} he was [...] "gravitated" [...] {{to the sound of}} [...] "Last Time" [...] by his love of science fiction, and points out that song is {{influenced}} by European electronic artists such as Daft Punk and Kraftwerk, describing it as his [...] "own perception" [...] of their sounds. When revealing the song, the musician and producer claimed that it [...] "shows another side to what I'm about", pointing out that [...] "It's quite electronic, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> really <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the detail of the music, you can understand that it's really musical".|$|R

5000|$|All {{the songs}} on The Immaculate Collection, with the {{exception}} of the two new songs, were remixed by Shep Pettibone alongside Goh Hotoda and Michael Hutchinson and some were also edited down from their original lengths in order to decrease the overall running time.

Pettibone commented,"Well, actually some of the songs we changed up a bit, but most of the songs we kept in their original form.
