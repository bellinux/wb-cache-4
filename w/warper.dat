40|$|High single {{instruction}} multiple data (SIMD) {{efficiency and}} {{low power consumption}} have made graphic processing units (GPUs) an ideal platform for many complex computational applications. Thousands of threads can be created by programmers and grouped into fixed-size SIMD batches, known as <b>warps.</b> High throughput is then achieved by concurrently executing such <b>warps</b> with minimal control overhead. However, if a branch instruction occurs, which assigns different paths to different threads, this <b>warp</b> will be broken into multiple <b>warps</b> {{that have to be}} executed serially, consequently reducing the efficiency advantage of SIMD. In this thesis, the contemporary fixed-size <b>warp</b> design is abandoned and a hybrid <b>warp</b> size (HWS) mechanism is proposed. Mixed-size <b>warps</b> are generated according to HWS and are scheduled and issued flexibly. Once a branch divergence occurs, split <b>warps</b> are squeezed according to the proposed algorithm, and <b>warp</b> sizes are downscaled wherever applicable. Based on updated <b>warp</b> sizes, <b>warp</b> schedulers calculate the number of cycles the current <b>warp</b> needs and issue the next <b>warp</b> accordingly. As a result, hybrid <b>warps</b> are pushed into pipelines as soon as possible and more pipeline stages are overlapped. The simulation results show that this mechanism yields an average speedup of 1. 20 over the baseline architecture {{for a wide variety of}} general purpose GPU applications. This work also integrates HWS with dynamic <b>warp</b> formation (DWF), which is a well-known branch handling mechanism aimed at improving SIMD utilization by forming new <b>warps</b> out of split <b>warps</b> in real time. The <b>warp</b> forming policy is modified to better tolerate <b>warp</b> conflicts. Also, squeeze operations are added before a <b>warp</b> merges with other <b>warps.</b> The simulation shows that the combination of DWF and HWS generates an average speedup of 1. 27 over the DWF-only platform for the same set of GPU benchmarks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{tension of}} <b>warp</b> and weft {{run through the}} whole weaving process in knitted carpet weaving equipment. The {{performance}} of delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism and guiding weft mechanism {{in this kind of}} equipment influences the quality of carpet directly. A self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism is designed in this thesis, which is used in knitted carpet weaving equipment or other textile equipment that delivers <b>warp</b> by warp-spindle and demands even <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism consists of the device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension, the device for driving warp-spindle in different speed, and the device for transmitting warp-spindle movement. The device for setting and detecting <b>warp</b> tension can determine initialization tension of <b>warp,</b> according to the technical requirements, can detect and feed back <b>warp</b> tension in real time. The device for driving warp-spindle in different speed makes the rotating speed of warp-spindle change according to the <b>warp</b> tension. The self-adjusting delivering <b>warp</b> mechanism realizes the function on controlling the rotating speed of warp-spindle in closed loop, and on stabilizing delivering <b>warp</b> tension...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{increasing}} the weaving efficdency of power loom by reduclng <b>warp</b> breakage，we considered 	the <b>warp</b> strain in weaving and planned and made fIve different shedding tappets for plain weave.

(1) The tension of lifted <b>warp</b> is smaller than the tension of depressed <b>warp.</b> 	(2) The variety of depressed <b>warp</b> tension is more sudden than the variety of lifted <b>warp</b> tension. 	(3) The tappet whose dwell of small radius is 0 °，moves　most smoothly and keeps the most smooth variety 	to the <b>warp</b> tension. 	(4) The tappet whose dwell is small，reduce sboth the <b>warp</b> tension and the variety of <b>warp</b> tension. But 	when the loom moves at h 1 gh speed，the upper side of shuttle touches the <b>warp</b> and consequently the breaks 	of <b>warp</b> are increaed. 	(5) When the dwell of tappet is equaI in slze， the motion of heald harness which reduce its speed in 	inverse propotion to the <b>warp</b> tension bring better effect than the harmonic motion...|$|R

40|$|Spatially varying <b>warps</b> are {{increasingly}} popular for image alignment. In particular, as-projective-as-possible (APAP) <b>warps</b> {{have been proven}} effective for accurate panoramic stitching, especially in cases with significant depth parallax that defeat standard homographic <b>warps.</b> However, estimating spatially varying <b>warps</b> requires {{a sufficient number of}} feature matches. In image regions where feature detection or matching fail, the <b>warp</b> loses guidance and is unable to accurately model the true underlying <b>warp,</b> thus resulting in poor registration. In this paper, we propose a correspondence insertion method for APAP <b>warps,</b> with a focus on panoramic stitching. Our method automatically identifies misaligned regions, and inserts appropriate point correspondences to increase the flexibility of the <b>warp</b> and improve alignment. Unlike other <b>warp</b> varieties, the underlying projective regularization of APAP <b>warps</b> reduces overfitting and geometric distortion, despite increases to the <b>warp</b> complexity. Comparisons with recent techniques for parallax-tolerant image stitching demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of our approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{statistical}} study of optical <b>warps</b> {{in a sample}} of 540 galaxies, about five times larger than previous samples. About 40 % of all late-type galaxies reveal S-shaped <b>warping</b> of their planes in the outer parts. Given the geometrical parameters and detection sensitivity, this result suggests that at least half of all galaxy disks might be <b>warped.</b> We demonstrate through geometrical simulations that some apparent <b>warps</b> could be due to spiral arms in a highly inclined galaxy. The simulations of non <b>warped</b> galaxies give an amount of false <b>warps</b> of ≈ 15 %, while simulations of <b>warped</b> galaxies suggest that no more than 20 % of the <b>warps</b> are missed. We find a strong positive correlation of observed <b>warps</b> with environment, suggesting that tidal interactions have a large influence in creating or re-enforcing <b>warped</b> deformations...|$|R
