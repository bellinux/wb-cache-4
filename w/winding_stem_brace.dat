5000|$|An open-faced, or Lépine, watch, is one {{in which}} the case lacks a metal cover to protect the crystal. It is typical for an open-faced watch to have the pendant located at 12:00 and the sub-second dial located at 6:00. Occasionally, a watch {{movement}} intended for a hunting case (with the <b>winding</b> <b>stem</b> at 3:00 and sub second dial at 6:00) will have an open-faced case. Such watch is known as a [...] "sidewinder." [...] Alternatively, such a watch movement may be fitted with a so-called conversion dial, which relocates the <b>winding</b> <b>stem</b> to 12:00 and the sub-second dial to 3:00. After 1908, watches approved for railroad service were required to be cased in open-faced cases with the <b>winding</b> <b>stem</b> at 12:00.|$|R

A small amount of the total production of 1857 model movements were fitted with a stemwind mechanism from the factory. The earliest stemwind 1857 movements were fitted with no reversing clutch on the <b>winding</b> <b>stem,</b> and had no setting mechanism; these early movements required using a key to set the time. Later stemwind movements were lever setting, with a unique design of set lever which pivoted out from the movement rather than pulling out. Later 1857 movements also added a reversing clutch, a feature ubiquitous on all subsequent Waltham stemwind watches. All stemwind 1857 movements have the <b>winding</b> <b>stem</b> located at 3:00.|$|R

5000|$|Used in watches, the keyless {{work are}} the gears that wind the {{mainspring}} when the crown is turned, {{and when the}} crown is pulled out allow the hands to be set. The term originated because, before the modern form of keyless work was invented by the French watchmaker Adrien Philippe in 1843, watches were wound and set by inserting a separate key into holes {{in the back and}} turning it. [...] The core of the keyless mechanism is a gear on the watch's <b>winding</b> <b>stem,</b> the clutch (or castle wheel in Britain), with two sets of axial gear teeth on it, which slides in and out. When the stem is pushed in, a lever slides the clutch out, and the outer set of teeth engages a small wheel train which turns the mainspring arbor, winding the mainspring. When the stem is pulled out, the clutch slides in, and the inner teeth engage another wheel, which turns the hour wheel in the motion work, turning the watch's hands.|$|R

40|$|Disturbances {{that kill}} trees in forests often co-occur in time and/or space. This process results in {{changes in the}} fuel loading for wildfire. Determining {{specific}} causes of changing fuel loads can be complex. Path {{analysis was used to}} estimate the relative importance and the strength of interaction of each of nine small-scale disturbances affecting forest stands in the Black Hills. Different disturbances were partitioned according to their indirect and direct effects on fuel loads. Fire and wind had the greatest indirect effects; stem rots had the smallest. Root rots had the largest direct effects. Root rots, strong <b>wind,</b> <b>stem</b> rots, suppression, human disturbances, and tree cutting all caused fuel loads to increase. Treeless meadows, stem cankers, fire, ice/snow damage, failed regeneration, and shallow soil were associated with decreasing fuel loads. Grazing, lightning, bark beetles, and competition had null impacts. Disease control has two aims: reducing fire hazard and enhancing restoration. Understanding the biology and ecology of the agents that create dead wood is as fundamental to restoration ecology as it is to forest pathology. Management and control both begin by first determining the cause...|$|R
30|$|Neither {{the timing}} nor {{severity}} of thinning {{should be based}} on predictions of branch diameter alone. Deciding on such variables will need to be a compromise between tree growth and branch growth as well as minimising the risk of <b>wind</b> damage since <b>stem</b> damage leads to larger than expected branches. A different approach to that taken in this study would be appropriate if one wished to predict stand value and/or create links to sawing simulators.|$|R
30|$|Wind forces {{acting on}} the tree crown have been {{estimated}} by wind tunnel studies for various tree species [2 – 5]. However, it may be preferable to evaluate the drag induced by the actual wind, with fluctuations in speed and direction, to analyze windthrow risks for trees. For this reason, Koizumi et al.

40|$|Local {{opposition}} to <b>wind</b> turbines <b>stems</b> from concerns about {{environmental and economic}} damage, as well as conflicts between rural and urban residents. This essay goes beyond these considerations to explore the often-unarticulated explanations for animosity toward this energy technology. Originally, it posits that {{opposition to}} visually obvious turbines arises from the successful history of an electric utility system that made its product largely invisible in its manufacture and physical manifestation. The existence of conspicuous turbines, however, reminds observers that power generation requires difficult choices in a technology-based society. The system’s previous achievement in hiding infrastructural elements, in other words, sometimes works ironically to spur objections to wind turbines. Receiving little historical study, the concealed features of a system’s infrastructure often influence assessments of technologies. By revealing the previously invisible, this essay, which draws on research in history, landscape architecture, geography, and psychology, therefore provides insights for social scientists and policymakers...|$|R

Over the following two days, convection associated with the low gradually organized and by June9, satellite intensity estimates from the JTWC reached 55km/h (30mph). A TCFA was subsequently issued for the system before it made landfall in Gujarat early on June10. Although overland, the low maintained significant convection as it turned westward and through its re-emergence into the Arabian Sea on June11. Once back over water, convection rapidly spread westward in response to an anticyclone over the Arabian Peninsula and Afghanistan. Early on June12, the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm status based on a ship report near the center of 65km/h (40mph) sustained winds and a surface pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg).

One of the most important purposes of this special plant is that animals such as ducks, swans, geese and muskrats eat this plant. It needs about 7 cm of room, wet moist soil, sun and a body of water.

50|$|By July 19, {{the center}} of Matmo had become {{obscured}} as deep central convection developed over it. Microwave satellite imagery showed improving convective banding despite the overall structure of the storm being slightly elongated. Subsequent intensification resulted in the JMA upgrading Matmo to a typhoon. The convective banding around the LLCC started to curl inwards as an eye-like feature started developing. Increasing <b>wind</b> shear <b>stemming</b> from the subtropical ridge steering the typhoon inhibited further organization. By July 21, the shear abated somewhat and allowed for some intensification. Tracking well to the southwest of Okinawa, the typhoon increased in both size and organization, with a secondary convective rainband developing along the northern half of the system by July 22. Upper-level outflow also improved and fueled the expansion of convection. A broad eye feature developed with strong convective rainbands wrapped tightly into it. The storm reached peak intensity on July 22, with maximum sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) and a central barometric pressure of 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). Around {{the same time the}} JTWC estimated Matmo to have acquired one-minute sustained winds of 155 km/h (100 mph), ranking the system as a Category 2-equivalent on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.
