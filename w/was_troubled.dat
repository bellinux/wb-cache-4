5|$|County cricket fully resumed in 1946. Hutton <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by his injury; {{his wrists}} no longer rotated fully and he {{abandoned}} the hook shot. Nevertheless, he scored 1,552 runs {{at an average}} of 48.50, and was recognised by Wisden as Yorkshire's most effective batsman as the county won their fourth consecutive championship title. His four centuries included 183 not out against the touring Indian team, but he was less successful in the three Tests, scoring 123 runs {{at an average of}} 30.75. England won the series 1–0 but Hutton's only fifty was a defensive innings in the second Test, when he <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by a bad back. He was omitted from the Gentlemen and Players match, but was part of the MCC team touring party for the 1946–47 tour of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The launch {{for both}} the state and federal exchanges <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> due to {{management}} and technical failings. HealthCare.gov, the website that offers insurance through the exchanges operated by the federal government, crashed on opening and suffered endless problems. Operations stabilized in 2014, although not all planned features were complete.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E

5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son, Bogdan III the One-Eyed (15041517) whose reign <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> {{by a long}} series of {{military}} conflicts with Poland and Wallachia. The good relations with Poland were reestablished under the reign of Stephen IV the Younger (15171527). His successor, Peter IV Rareş (15271538, 15411546) intervened in the struggle for the crown of the Kingdom of Hungary: on the order of the sultan, in 1529 he invaded the Székely Land and defeated the army of Ferdinand I's partisans.|$|E
5|$|Kerr's first {{marriage}} was to Squadron Leader Anthony Bartley RAF on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 20 December 1951 and subsequently {{married to the}} actor John Shrapnel). The marriage <b>was</b> <b>troubled,</b> owing to Bartley's jealousy of his wife's fame and financial success, and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Lang's {{region of}} Stepney within the Diocese of London {{extended}} {{over the whole}} area generally known as London's East End, with two million people in more than 200parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by the squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.|$|E
50|$|Why all Jerusalem should <b>be</b> <b>troubled</b> <b>is</b> a more {{important}} question. Throughout this chapter Matthew shows the leaders of Jerusalem allied with Herod against the new messiah. These passages have been quoted in support of Christian anti-Semitism. That all Jerusalem is agitated also seems to conflict with later in the Gospel when the people are oblivious to Jesus. France suggests that the passage could perhaps be read as showing {{that the people of}} Jerusalem <b>were</b> <b>troubled</b> because of the possibility of Herod's wrath. Other scholars see this interpretation as being fairly implausible. Brown notes that this phrase originates in Exodus. There is a theory that this part of Matthew is heavily influence by the story of Moses. In Exodus all Egypt <b>is</b> <b>troubled</b> by Moses, not just the Pharaoh. Thus in parallel all Jerusalem must also <b>be</b> <b>troubled.</b> This view <b>was</b> shared by St. Chrysostom.|$|R
50|$|Complete {{happiness}} cannot possibly exist; {{for that}} the body is full of many sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and <b>is</b> <b>troubled</b> when that <b>is</b> <b>troubled,</b> and also that fortune prevents many things which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness eludes our grasp.|$|R

5|$|Like {{the first}} film, the {{production}} of Jaws 2 <b>was</b> <b>troubled.</b> The original director, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film {{and was replaced by}} Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from his doctors.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E

5|$|Einstein <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by {{the fact}} that his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{spent the}} week before the match in the spa town of Buxton, and {{travelled}} to Dorking {{on the eve of the}} match. Manchester City spent the week in Bushey. Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to be fit enough to play. Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by a leg injury. Dunn was passed fit well before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in four of their five previous cup ties.|$|E
5|$|His reign <b>was</b> <b>troubled,</b> being {{marked by}} {{conflicts}} {{with some of}} his brothers, antagonism with the various branches of the Buyids for influence in Baghdad, and attacks by the Byzantine Empire under John I Tzimiskes. His relations with the Buyid emir of Iraq, 'Izz al-Dawla Bakhtiyar, were initially hostile, but the two later concluded an alliance. In 978, the Jazira was occupied by the Buyids of Shiraz under 'Adud al-Dawla, and he fled to the Fatimid-controlled parts of Syria, where he tried to secure the governorship of Damascus, and became involved in local rivalries which resulted in his defeat in battle and execution on 29 August 979.|$|E

5|$|Injury limited him to only 28 {{appearances}} in 1948–49, as Blackpool struggled to a 16th-place finish. He {{spent the summer}} touring theatres in a variety act with his brother Ronnie, though he <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by an ankle injury he picked up in a charity game. Blackpool finished seventh in 1949–50, and though they were never title contenders vast crowds still turned out home and away to witness the entertaining football they displayed. At this time he received the maximum wage allowed for a professional player – £12 a week.|$|E
5|$|John Brownlee, who had {{previously}} been offered the job, succeeded Greenfield. Brownlee's reign as government leader <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by {{the onset of the}} Great Depression. He resigned in scandal after he was accused of sexual acts with a minor in the Attorney General's office. This and another scandalous divorce by UFA MLA Oran McPherson, speaker of the Legislative Assembly, gave the United Farmers an image of moral decay. In 1934 Richard Reid replaced Brownlee but served as premier for less than two years, leading the United Farmers government into total defeat {{at the hands of the}} new Social Credit party.|$|E
5|$|Meretzky {{conceived}} Hodj 'n' Podj in {{the late}} 1980s, {{as a way to}} revive simpler games that had become hard to obtain. It began production in 1994, and was the first product developed by Meretzky's company Boffo Games. Production <b>was</b> <b>troubled,</b> thanks to a $100 million securities fraud scandal at Media Vision, which led to the project's sale to Virgin. During development, Boffo discovered that Hodj 'n' Podj appealed to a wider demographic than Meretzky's past work, and Meretzky has since cited it as an early casual game.|$|E

5|$|Some of Henry Tudor's ships {{ran into}} a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself {{anchored}} off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, {{who was in the}} process of organising another rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{rendezvous}} of the Kvant-1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by {{the failure}} of the onboard control system. After the failure of the second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to fix the problem. They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing the bag, docking was completed on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} al-Ma'mun entered Baghdad, the western provinces of the Caliphate had slipped away from {{effective}} Abbasid control, with local rulers claiming {{various degrees of}} autonomy from the central government. Egypt had become divided between two bitterly hostile factions, one under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Sari which had come to control Fustat and the south, while his rival Ali ibn Abd al-Aziz al-Jarawi and his Qaysi Arabs controlled {{the north of the}} country around the Nile Delta. In addition, Alexandria was {{in the hands of a}} group of Andalusian exiles. In northern Syria and the Jazira, the traditionally dominant Qays tribe had taken control, led by Abdallah ibn Bayhas and Nasr ibn Shabath al-Uqayli. Ifriqiya had fallen under the control of the Aghlabids, while Yemen <b>was</b> <b>troubled</b> by pro-Alid revolts. Perhaps the most threatening rebellion of all was the anti-Muslim Khurramite movement, which controlled large parts of Azerbaijan and Armenia.|$|E
