5|$|Prior to Bloet's consecration, the Archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux, who had {{previously}} had a claim to supervise the see of Lincoln, tried to prevent the Archbishop Anselm's consecrating Bloet. Thomas argued that the area of Lindsey, which was within the diocese of Lincoln, really belonged to the archdiocese of York. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter alleged that Bloet gave Rufus £3,000 to intervene on Bloet's side when Thomas attempted to assert York's claim to Lindsey, but another medieval chronicler, Henry of Huntingdon, who knew Bloet <b>well,</b> <b>said</b> that the sum was £5,000. This payment secured Rufus' support in the dispute between York and Lincoln, which was settled in Lincoln's favour. The sum of £5,000 was extremely large, eight times what Domesday Book records as the bishop of Lincoln's annual income. The king gave York the abbeys of Selby and St Oswald, Gloucester {{in return for the}} settlement in favour of Lincoln. Bloet also refused to profess obedience to Anselm, but when King William intervened on Anselm's side, Bloet made the profession to Anselm.|$|E
25|$|A final role of {{the mound}} was in the holding of a 'court' at Knockenlaw by the Earl of Glencairn when he was {{attempting}} to claim the Lordship of Kilmarnock from the Boyd's. In the event the supporters of the Boyd's turned up in force and the Earl had to abandon his attempt. The Roman <b>Well,</b> <b>said</b> to be of great antiquity was located nearby. These sites are now hidden beneath housing estates.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has <b>well</b> <b>said</b> that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{far north}} of England, the local speech is indistinguishable from Scots. <b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> that northernmost Northumberland [...] "though {{politically}} English is linguistically Scottish".|$|R
2500|$|<b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "destroying Darwinism" [...] was his {{motive for}} {{studying}} Christian theology at Yale {{and going on}} to seek his second PhD at Berkeley, studying biology and in particular embryology: ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{her mother}} was {{diagnosed}} with cancer, <b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> family took precedence and told the studio {{she would not be}} available to reprise the role for the two sequels; actress Elisabeth Shue replaced her.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{agreement}} among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears {{to hand over}} the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the <b>well</b> <b>said</b> to Jesus (John 4:19) [...] "I perceive thou art a prophet." [...] and Moses also likewise came {{to hand over the}} responsibility of the law for the divinely announced Son of God.|$|E
2500|$|He was self-effacing in {{his public}} life, {{and he often}} {{referred}} to himself as [...] "funny Noguchi." [...] Those who knew him <b>well</b> <b>said</b> that he [...] "gloated in honors." [...] When Noguchi was awarded an honorary doctorate at Yale, William Lyon Phelps observed that the kings of Spain, Denmark and Sweden had conferred awards, but [...] "perhaps he appreciates even more than royal honors the admiration and the gratitude of the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 'enjoyment of land' was {{primary in}} the reasons of Lord Cairns (above). [...] This {{foundation}} stone is {{a recurring theme}} in the common law throughout the ages, to wit: [...] "It has been <b>well</b> <b>said,</b> {{that the use of}} the law consists, first, in preserving men's persons from death and violence; next, in securing to them the free enjoyment of their property."

50|$|By 1883, Pacific Coast Oil Company (which {{later became}} Standard Oil of California) had bought out the {{competition}} in Pico Canyon and had 30 <b>wells</b> <b>said</b> to be producing 500 barrels per day (79 m3/d).|$|R
2500|$|H. G. <b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> of him, [...] "He {{has made}} the cat his own. He invented a cat style, a cat society, a whole cat world. English cats that do not look and live like Louis Wain cats are ashamed of themselves." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{asked her}} if she had any suggestions. She said, what about Tempest Storm? I {{asked her if}} she had any other suggestions. <b>Well,</b> she <b>said,</b> what about Sunny Day? <b>Well,</b> I <b>said,</b> I guess {{it might as well be}} Tempest Storm.|$|R
2500|$|... "English railroads were short, solid, {{straight}} and level, and laid {{with the best}} rails {{in the world and}} their massive and powerful, and rigid-framed engines are thoroughly adopted to those perfect roads. On the contrary, the American road is generally of great length, and being necessarily cheap it [...] "goes as you please." [...] Over these eccentric roads the American locomotive adjusts itself to every change of level both across and along the line it takes curves that would be impossible for the rigid English engine and, finally, it runs over a crazy track, up hill and down, in perfect safety. It has been <b>well</b> <b>said</b> that all that the English engine can do on a perfect road the American (4-4-0) engine will do and much more than this, it will do work on any road, however rough, hilly, curved and cheap." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles, {{motivated}} not {{by small}} but great ambitions, implanted {{in his mind}} like a seed the resolution of taking Constantinople. He dreamed {{that if he could}} become the master of it, he would restore the entire monarchy, so to speak, of Julius Caesar and Augustus. He was very able not only in planning what he wished to do but in easily translating his thoughts into action. Clearly he surpassed all his predecessors in the strength of his nature and intelligence.... Nevertheless, neither his actions against the Greeks nor those of Michael Palaeologus against the Latins could be brought to a successful conclusion. For the strength of both was for a long time so evenly matched that it was <b>well</b> <b>said</b> (this was the opinion of discerning people) that if at that time such an Emperor had not been directing Greek affairs, the Empire would easily have succumbed to Charles, the King of Italy and, conversely, if such a King had not then been at the helm of Italian affairs, the hegemony of Italy would with little difficulty have passed to Michael Palaeologus.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his address}} to the Congress, <b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> {{that he thought that}} his idea of the [...] "world brain" [...] was a {{precursor}} to the ideas other delegates were proposing, and explicitly linked the projects being discussed to the work of the encyclopédistes: ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to Elizabeth Healy, <b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> {{that the purpose of}} Anticipations was [...] "to {{undermine}} and destroy the monarch, monogamy, faith in God & respectability—& the British Empire, all under the guise of a speculation about motor cars & electric heating." ...|$|R

5000|$|When he {{realized}} what had occurred, <b>Wells</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I felt to see if I was all there ... I knew I was burned but I didn't know how bad." [...] Wells suffered second- and third-degree burns to his face, arms and stomach.|$|R
50|$|On 21 January 2015, <b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> he {{continues}} to support a ban on gay men donating blood. Such bans were lifted {{in the rest of}} the UK in 2011; Wells's department had spent £39,000 as of January 2015 fighting a legal appeal of the ban.|$|R
50|$|In response, Willard and her {{supporter}} Lady Somerset {{attempted to}} use their influence to keep Wells' comments at lectures out of the press. <b>Wells</b> <b>said</b> that, despite Willard's having abolitionist forebears and black friends, she would allow black women to join the WCTU's segregated southern branches.|$|R

5000|$|The former Democratic Unionist Party Health Minister, Jim <b>Wells,</b> <b>said</b> in The Guardian: [...] "That is {{a tragic}} and {{difficult}} situation but should the ultimate victim of that terrible act rape—which is the child—should {{he or she}} be punished for what has happened by having their life terminated?

5000|$|... "The two parties, the Democrat and Republican parties, do {{not address}} {{the root causes of}} the problem," [...] <b>Wells</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "That's off the table for them....

5000|$|Lansdowne {{became a}} pariah and his letter [...] "a deed of shame".

2500|$|Of {{his student}} days at Unification Theological Seminary (1976–78), <b>Wells</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "One {{of the things}} that Father [...] advised us to do at UTS was to pray to seek God's plan for our lives."
