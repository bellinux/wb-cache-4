5|$|Gordon Strachan made an unpromising {{start as}} manager of Celtic {{in the summer of}} 2005, losing his first match in charge – a Champions League {{qualifier}} – 0–5 to Slovakian side Artmedia Bratislava, the club's worst ever European result at that time. Celtic did produce a fight-back in the second leg at Parkhead, but their 4–0 win on the night <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> salvage the tie.|$|E
5|$|However, the Imme {{began to}} develop problems, {{especially}} with the single-sided crankshaft bearings and the freewheel for the kick starter. Riedel corrected the problem beginning with the Model D version, which had a conventional crankshaft with two bearings.

5|$|This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> cause a {{complete}} fallout {{between the two}} men, though {{from this point on}} Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, when Henry VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.|$|E
5|$|Wark's final {{full season}} at Portman Road, 1982–83, {{had seen him}} record the highest league goals tally of his career.

5|$|After the World Series championship, Smith and the Cardinals {{agreed on}} a new {{contract}} in January 1983 that paid Smith $1 million per year. Smith was voted in as the National League's starting shortstop in the All-Star Game {{for the first time}} in 1983, and at season's end won a fourth consecutive Gold Glove Award. During July of the 1984 season, Smith went on the disabled list with a broken wrist after being hit by a pitch during a game against the Padres. Smith's return to the lineup a month later <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> propel the Cardinals to a postseason berth.|$|E
5|$|After the {{war ended}} in 1945, {{first-class}} cricket resumed in 1945–46. Harvey played in a trial match for state selection.

This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> convince the state selectors and Harvey {{did not get a}} recall to the Victorian team {{until the end of the}} season when he played against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval. He responded by striking a career-best 163 to help his team to an innings win.|$|E
5|$|Argentina had a tense {{relationship}} with the United Kingdom because of the recently ended Falklands War. The British government banned all foreign ships from the exclusion zone of the islands in 1986. Argentina organised air and marine patrols, as well as military maneuvers in the Patagonia. However, this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> placate the military hard-liners in Argentina. Alfonsín proposed the postponement the sovereignty discussions, instead negotiating for a de jure cease of hostilities, with {{a reduction in the}} number of military forces and a normalization of Argentina–United Kingdom relations. The United Kingdom did not trust the proposal, suspecting that it was a cover-up for sovereignty discussions.|$|E

He also featured in every match at Euro 2004, keeping a clean sheet in his nation's opening 0–0 draw against Denmark, although Italy, despite not losing a match, once again underperformed, and were eliminated {{in the first round}} on direct encounters following a three-way, five-point tie with Sweden and Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the supreme}} {{director}} Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed {{a commission to}} discuss the case of Saavedra. By this time, the Congress of Tucumán had made the Argentine Declaration of Independence {{a couple of years}} before. The commission restored Saavedra with the military rank of brigadier, and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during the time he was demoted. A second commission ratified the ruling. The payment <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> compensate Saavedra's losses, but he considered it a token of his restored prestige. He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján.|$|E

5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> meet the needs of its population. Water had to be carted from springs to the city, but this became difficult {{by the end of the}} 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war.

This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E

However, he {{finished}} the tournament strongly, scoring victories against Peter Leko and Radoslaw Wojtaszek, the latter of whom he had lost to earlier in the year, but his performance <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> earn his team a medal, and he lost 16 rating points during the event.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{had a more}} {{productive}} campaign during the 1952–53 season, scoring 470 runs at 33.57 and taking 23 wickets at 26.26 in nine matches. He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, {{but this was not}} enough for him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
5|$|On November 10, 1978, 10 {{months after}} being sworn in, White {{resigned}} {{his position on}} the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, saying that his annual salary of $9,600 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> support his family. Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed. However, further consideration—and intervention by other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors.|$|E
5|$|Plymouth Argyle had {{finished}} the 199596 Football League season in fourth place in the Third Division, one place ahead of Darlington.
