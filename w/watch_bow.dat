Instead of being a mere thing of wood and canvas she seemed to become animate, charged with vitality. The springy way she rushed along was strangely exhilarating.

50|$|No {{matter which}} attack or bow stroke is used, most violinists use a {{straight}} bow stroke, keeping the bow {{perpendicular to the}} string. This ensures that the bow will stay in the desired sounding point and will create a consistent sound quality. One technique to achieving a straight bow is as follows. When taking a downbow, focus on the upper arm, the lower arm, and the hand/wrist. First, move the upper arm backwards as if elbowing someone in the nose. Next, follow through with the lower arm. Near {{the end of the}} bow stroke, rotate the wrist and hand as if opening a jar of peanuts. When used correctly, these motions will create a straight downbow bow stroke. A crucial step is to <b>watch</b> the <b>bow</b> and make sure it remains straight. An upbow is created in the opposite way. Still {{keeping an eye on the}} bow, move the lower arm in the direction that it came. Follow through with the upper arm. Near the end of this stroke, rotate the hand and wrist as if closing a jar of peanuts.|$|R

When the arrow stopped, half its length protruded from the opposite side of a six-inch tree fifty feet away.

40|$|To {{complement}} the last post on revolutionary anniversaries, {{here are some}} places to turn {{to get a sense}} of how October 1 has been marked in China between 1949 and 2007. 1) Let’s start with National Day 1950 : for an idealized vision of the celebrations held that day, look at this poster. 2) For a fascinating discussion of past National Days that combines memories of personal experience and analytical moves rooted in the discipline of art history, see Wu Hung’s excellent Remaking Beijing. 3) For a look back at National Day 1984, when the 35 th anniversary of the founding of the PRC was marked, see this very interesting Danwei post, which tells you why it was so significant that a sign simply saying “Hi” to Deng Xiaoping figured in that year’s march. 4) For images of this same parade, including shots of floats (now looking very dated to the say the least) that were meant to show how “advanced” China had become in Deng’s early years in power in terms of providing the people with attractive consumer goods, <b>watch</b> the Long <b>Bow</b> Group’s “The Gate of Heavenly Peace,” a film that focuses on 1989 but includes a visual survey of the first decade of the Reform era. 5) To see some of the curious ways that National Day has recently become part of China’s global “Charm Offensive” and otherwise linked to international currents, see the slide show accompanying last year’s Xinhua piece “China’s National Day Celebrated Worldwide“–a show that, despite the title, is devoted largely and peculiarly to shots of Brazilian Samba dancers performing inside of the PRC (in Mao’s hometown of Changsha of all places) ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{were now}} running down channel, {{and the boys}} were {{astonished}} at the ease and smoothness with which the ship breasted the waves, and at the mass of snowy canvas that towered above her. As they sat one day at the <b>bow</b> <b>watching</b> the sheets of spray rise as the ship cut {{her way through the}} water, Tom said to his friend: “You are going up above me quick, Will. Anyone can see that. You are thought a lot of. I knew it would be so, and I said I should not grudge it you; in fact, the greater your success the better I shall be pleased. But I did not think that your learning would have made such a difference already. The first lieutenant often says a word to you as he passes, and the padre generally speaks to you when he goes along the deck. It is wonderful what a difference learning makes; not, mind you, that I should ever have gone in for it, even had I known how useful it is. I could never have taken it in, and I am sure the old woman could never have taught me. I suppose some fellows are born clever and others grow to it. And some never are clever at all. That was my way, I suppose. I just learned to spell words of two letters, which, of course, was of no use. A fellow can’t do much with ba, be, by, and bo, and these are about all the words I remember. I used to think, when we first became chums, how foolish you were to be always reading and studying. Now I see what a pull you have got by it. I expect it is partly because your father was a clever man, and, as most of the people thought, a gentleman, that you came to take to it. Well, if I had my time over again I would really try to learn something. I should never make much of it, but still, I suppose I should have got to read decently.” ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mangan, {{on their}} way into the grill room, loitered for a few minutes in the small {{reception}} room, chatting with some acquaintances, whilst his host, having spoken to the maitre d'hotel and ordered a cocktail from a passing waiter, stood with his hands behind his back, watching the inflow of men and women with all that interest which one might be supposed to feel in one's fellows after a prolonged absence. He had moved a little to one side to allow a party of young people to make their way through the crowded chamber, when he was conscious of a woman standing alone on the topmost of the three thickly carpeted stairs. Their eyes met, and hers, which had been wandering around the room as though in search of some acquaintance, seemed instantly and fervently held. To the few loungers about the room, ignorant of any special significance in that studied contemplation of the man {{on the part of the}} woman, their two personalities presented an agreeable, almost a fascinating study. Dominey was six feet two in height and had to its fullest extent the natural distinction of his class, together with the half military, half athletic bearing which seemed to have been so marvellously restored to him. His complexion was no more than becomingly tanned; his slight moustache, trimmed very close to the upper lip, was of the same ruddy brown shade as his sleekly brushed hair. The woman, who had commenced now to move slowly towards him, save that her cheeks, at that moment, at any rate, were almost unnaturally pale, was of the same colouring. Her red-gold hair gleamed beneath her black hat. She was tall, a Grecian type of figure, large without being coarse, majestic though still young. She carried a little dog under one arm and a plain black silk bag, on which was a coronet in platinum and diamonds, in the other hand. The major-domo who presided over the room, <b>watching</b> her approach, <b>bowed</b> with more than his usual urbanity. Her eyes, however, were still fixed upon the person who had engaged so large a share of her attention. She came towards him, her lips a little parted.|$|R
60|$|Considering we have fifty men {{of several}} tribes and tongues onboard, wild, half-savage looking fellows, and {{few of them}} feeling any of the {{restraints}} of morality or education, we get on wonderfully well. There is no fighting or quarrelling, as there would certainly be among {{the same number of}} Europeans with as little restraint upon their actions, and there is scarcely any of that noise and excitement which might be expected. In fine weather the greater part of them are quietly enjoying themselves--some are sleeping under the shadow of the sails; others, in little groups of three or four, are talking or chewing betel; one is making a new handle to his chopping-knife, another is stitching away at a new pair of trousers or a shirt, and all are as quiet and well-conducted as on board the best-ordered English merchantman. Two or three take it by turns to <b>watch</b> in the <b>bows</b> and see after the braces and halyards of the great sails; the two steersmen are below in the steerage; our captain, or the juragan, gives the course, guided partly by the compass and partly by the direction of the wind, and a watch of two or three on the poop look after the trimming of the sails and call out the hours by the water-clock. This is a very ingenious contrivance, which measures time well in both rough weather and fine. It is simply a bucket half filled with water, in which floats the half of a well-scraped cocoa-nut shell. In the bottom of this shell is a very small hole, so that when placed to float in the bucket a fine thread of water squirts up into it. This gradually fills the shell, {{and the size of the}} hole is so adjusted to the capacity of the vessel that, exactly at the end of an hour, plump it goes to the bottom. The watch then cries out the number of hours from sunrise and sets the shell afloat again empty. This is a very good measurer of time. I tested it with my watch and found that it hardly varied a minute from one hour to another, nor did the motion of the vessel have any effect upon it, as the water in the bucket of course kept level. It has a great advantage for a rude people in being easily understood, in being rather bulky and easy to see, and in the final submergence being accompanied with a little bubbling and commotion of the water, which calls the attention to it. It is also quickly replaced if lost while in harbour.|$|R
60|$|Here the <b>watch</b> {{placed upon}} <b>Bow</b> Bridge would have {{questioned}} them, but they, crossing the road {{into a narrow}} way that turns out of the hither end {{of the town of}} Bow to Old Ford, avoided any inquiry there, and travelled to Old Ford. The constables everywhere were upon their guard not so much, It seems, to stop people passing by as to stop them from taking up their abode in their towns, and withal because of a report that was newly raised at that time: and that, indeed, was not very improbable, viz., that the poor people in London, being distressed and starved for want of work, and by that means for want of bread, were up in arms and had raised a tumult, and that they would come out to all the towns round to plunder for bread. This, I say, was only a rumour, and it was very well it was no more. But it was not so far off from being a reality as it has been thought, for in a few weeks more the poor people became so desperate by the calamity they suffered that they were with great difficulty kept from g out into the fields and towns, and tearing all in pieces wherever they came; and, as I have observed before, nothing hindered them but that the plague raged so violently and fell in upon them so furiously that they rather went to the grave by thousands than into the fields in mobs by thousands; for, in the parts about the parishes of St Sepulcher, Clarkenwell, Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, which were the places where the mob began to threaten, the distemper came on so furiously that there died in those few parishes even then, before the plague was come to its height, no less than 5361 people in the first three weeks in August; when {{at the same time the}} parts about Wapping, Radcliffe, and Rotherhith were, as before described, hardly touched, or but very lightly; so that in a word though, as I said before, the good management of the Lord Mayor and justices did much to prevent the rage and desperation of the people from breaking out in rabbles and tumults, and in short from the poor plundering the rich,--I say, though they did much, the dead-carts did more: for as I have said that in five parishes only there died above 5000 in twenty days, so there might be probably three times that number sick all that time; for some recovered, and great numbers fell sick every day and died afterwards. Besides, I must still be allowed to say that if the bills of mortality said five thousand, I always believed it was near twice as many in reality, there being no room to believe that the account they gave was right, or that indeed they were among such confusions as I saw them in, in any condition to keep an exact account.|$|R

When first in store the new-made beasties stood, [...] Were Ye cast down that breathed the Word declarin' all things good? [...] Not so! O' that warld-liftin' joy no after-fall could vex, [...] Ye've left a glimmer still to cheer the Man--the Arrtifex! [...] That holds, in spite o' knock and scale, o' friction, waste an' slip, [...] An' by that light--now, mark my word--we'll build the Perfect Ship. [...] I'll never last to judge her lines or take her curve--not I. [...] But I ha' lived an' I ha' worked. All thanks to Thee, Most High! [...] An' I ha' done what I ha' done--judge Thou if ill or well-- [...] Always Thy Grace preventin' me.... Losh! Yon's the [...] "Stand by" [...] bell. [...] Pilot so soon? His flare it is. The mornin'-watch is set. [...] Well, God be thanked, as I was sayin', I'm no Pelagian yet. [...] Now I'll tak' on.... 'Morrn, Ferguson. Man, have ye ever thought [...] What your good leddy costs in coal?... I'll burn 'em down to port.|$|R
6000|$|Obsairve. Per annum we'll {{have here}} two {{thousand}} souls aboard -- [...] Think not I dare to justify myself before the Lord, [...] But -- average fifteen hunder souls safe-borne fra' {{port to port}} -- [...] I am o' service to my kind. Ye wadna blame the thought? [...] Maybe they steam from grace to wrath -- to sin by folly led, -- [...] It isna mine to judge their path -- their lives are on my head. [...] Mine at the last -- when all is done it all comes back to me, [...] The fault that leaves six thousand ton a log upon the sea. [...] We'll tak' one stretch -- three weeks an' odd by any road ye steer -- [...] Fra' Cape Town east to Wellington -- ye need an engineer. [...] Fail there -- ye've time to weld your shaft -- ay, eat it, ere ye're spoke; [...] Or make Kerguelen under sail -- three jiggers burned wi' smoke! [...] An' home again, the Rio run: it's no child's play to go [...] Steamin' to bell for fourteen days o' snow an' floe an' blow -- [...] The bergs like kelpies overside that girn an' turn an' shift [...] Whaur, grindin' like the Mills o' God, goes by the big South drift. [...] (Hail, snow an' ice that praise the Lord: I've met them at their work, [...] An' wished we had anither route or they anither kirk.) [...] Yon's strain, hard strain, o' head an' hand, for though Thy Power brings [...] All skill to naught, Ye'll understand a man must think o' things. [...] Then, at the last, we'll get to port an' hoist their baggage clear -- [...] The passengers, wi' gloves an' canes -- an' this is what I'll hear: [...] "Well, thank ye for a pleasant voyage. The tender's comin' now." [...] While I go testin' follower-bolts an' <b>watch</b> the skipper <b>bow.</b> [...] They've words for every one but me -- shake hands wi' half the crew, [...] Except the dour Scots engineer, the man they never knew. [...] An' yet I like the wark for all we've dam' few pickin's here -- [...] No pension, an' the most we earn's four hunder pound a year. [...] Better myself abroad? Maybe. I'd sooner starve than sail [...] Wi' such as call a snifter-rod ross. [...] .French for nightingale. [...] Commeesion on my stores? Some do; but I can not afford [...] To lie like stewards wi' patty-pans --. I'm older than the Board. [...] A bonus on the coal I save? Ou ay, the Scots are close, [...] But when I grudge the strength Ye gave I'll grudge their food to those. [...] (There's bricks that I might recommend -- an' clink the fire-bars cruel. [...] No! Welsh -- Wangarti at the worst -- an' damn all patent fuel!) [...] Inventions? Ye must stay in port to mak' a patent pay. [...] My Deeferential Valve-Gear taught me how that business lay, [...] I blame no chaps wi' clearer head for aught they make or sell. [...] I found that I could not invent an' look to these -- as well. [...] So, wrestled wi' Apollyon -- Nah! -- fretted like a bairn -- [...] But burned the workin'-plans last run wi' all I hoped to earn. [...] Ye know how hard an Idol dies, an' what that meant to me -- [...] E'en tak' it for a sacrifice acceptable to Thee. [...] Below there! Oiler! What's your wark? Ye find it runnin' hard? [...] Ye needn't swill the cap wi' oil -- this isn't the Cunard! [...] Ye thought? Ye are not paid to think. Go, sweat that off again! [...] Tck! Tck! It's deeficult to sweer nor tak' The Name in vain! [...] Men, ay an' women, call me stern. Wi' these to oversee [...] Ye'll note I've little time to burn on social repartee. [...] The bairns see what their elders miss; they'll hunt me to an' fro, [...] Till {{for the sake of}} -- well, a kiss -- I tak' 'em down below. [...] That minds me of our Viscount loon -- Sir Kenneth's kin -- the chap [...] Wi' Russia leather tennis-shoon an' spar-decked yachtin'-cap. [...] I showed him round last week, o'er all -- an' at the last says he: [...] "Mister M'Andrew, don't you think steam spoils romance at sea?" [...] Damned ijjit! I'd been doon that morn to see what ailed the throws, [...] Manholin', on my back -- the cranks three inches off my nose. [...] Romance! Those first-class passengers they like it very well, [...] Printed an' bound in little books; but why don't poets tell? [...] I'm sick of all their quirks an' turns -- the loves an' doves they dream -- [...] Lord, send a man like Robbie Burns to sing the Song o' Steam! [...] To match wi' Scotia's noblest speech yon orchestra sublime [...] Whaurto -- uplifted like the Just -- the tail-rods mark the time. [...] The crank-throws give the double-bass, the feed-pump sobs an' heaves, [...] An' now the main eccentrics start their quarrel on the sheaves: [...] Her time, her own appointed time, the rocking link-head bides, [...] Till -- hear that note? -- the rod's return [...] whings glimmerin' through the guides. [...] They're all awa'! True beat, full power, the clangin' chorus goes [...] Clear to the tunnel where they sit, my purrin' dynamos. [...] Interdependence absolute, foreseen, ordained, decreed, [...] To work, Ye'll note, at any tilt an' every rate o' speed. [...] Fra' skylight-lift to furnace-bars, backed, bolted, braced an' stayed, [...] An' singin' like the Mornin' Stars for joy that they are made; [...] While, out o' touch o' vanity, the sweatin' thrust-block says: [...] "Not unto us the praise, or man -- not unto us the praise!" [...] Now, a' together, hear them lift their lesson -- theirs an' mine: [...] "Law, Orrder, Duty an' Restraint, Obedience, Discipline!" [...] Mill, forge an' try-pit taught them that when roarin' they arose, [...] An' whiles I wonder if a soul was gied them wi' the blows. [...] Oh for a man to weld it then, in one trip-hammer strain, [...] Till even first-class passengers could tell the meanin' plain! [...] But no one cares except mysel' that serve an' understand [...] My seven thousand horse-power here. [...] Eh, Lord! They're grand -- they're grand! [...] Uplift am I?
