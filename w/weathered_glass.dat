40|$|The {{structure}} {{of an ancient}} <b>weathered</b> <b>glass</b> is characterized by high porosity and {{a small amount of}} modifier ions, due to the leaching effect of water {{on the surface of the}} glass.

40|$|To {{hinder the}} {{phenomenon}} of weathering of ancient stained glass, the present work proposes the application of sol–gel coatings to the glass surface. Previous investigations [1 – 6], in fact, show that sol–gel silica coatings do not change the appearance of artistic glasses when deposited on their surface. Moreover, the film thickness is so small (around 200 nm) and its composition and structure so compatible {{with that of the}} original glass, that the characteristics of the coating and original glass are not distinguishable. In this work, several recipes used to produce sol–gel coatings have been tested in order to understand their behavior when adopted for covering ancient <b>weathered</b> <b>glass.</b> The coatings are made of sol–gel silica prepared with two different catalysts: H+, Pb 2 + and without catalyst. All the investigated samples show a good adhesion of the coating to the glasses used to simulate the behavior of ancient artefacts. The sol–gel silica coatings have been studied before and after accelerated ageing to test the resistance of the protective coatings to weathering. Another important index to test of the efficiency of the sol–gel coatings for the protection of an ancient glass is the lead ion mobility. In ancient stained glass, in fact, this element is present in the metallic lead network, in the grisaille paintings and constitutes a main component of many glass tesserae. The action of water on this highly mobile ion involves the degradation of the glass itself and the release of the ion in the rain solution.

40|$|In this work, a multi-elemental 3 D laser ablation-ICP-mass {{spectrometry}} mapping {{procedure for}} highresolution depth information retrieval to investigate surface layer phenomena is presented. The procedure {{is based on}} laser drilling on a virtual grid on the surface, followed by extraction of depth maps along the z-axis (for each element monitored). Using a burst of 50 laser pulses at 1 Hz on each point of the grid, a penetration rate of ca. 150 nm per pulse (in glass) was obtained and a lateral resolution {{in the order of}} the laser beam diameter. By ultrafast ICP-MS monitoring of individual ablation pulses (58 ms for a set of 19 elements) using a laser ablation cell with fast signal washout (less than 0. 5 s for whole laser pulse), the corresponding peak areas could be consistently integrated, resulting in spatial elemental data associated with individual pulses. The usual laser drilling limitations such as pulse mixing and signal tailing are avoided with this approach. After manipulation of the spatial elemental datasets and quantification, stacks of 50 2 D depth maps (for each element monitored) were produced which could be visualized as volume images or time-lapse movies. As a proof of concept, this approach was successfully used to investigate the degradation mechanisms of a medieval, <b>weathered</b> <b>glass</b> artifact by colocalization analysis of selected cross-sectional 2 D elemental images in arbitrary planes of the volume images. It was shown that degradation must have started as a result of dealkalinization leading to depletion of alkalis/earth alkalis in glass surface layers and enrichment of network formers (Si and Al), and subsequent worsening by cracking and formation of corrosion pits and so-called spatiotemporal Liesegang rings indicative of radial leaching...|$|E

This provides insights on the relative influence of surface hydroxylation and hydrate precipitation on the hydration rate. When the rate drops, the amount of hydroxylated Ca 3 SiO 5 decreases, thus demonstrating the partial passivation of the surface during the deceleration stage.
