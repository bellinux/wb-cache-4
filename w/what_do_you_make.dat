6000|$|... "By <b>what</b> right <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of him a votive offering? By <b>what</b> right <b>did</b> <b>you</b> seek to consecrate a child unborn to a claustral {{life without}} {{thought of his}} character, without reck of the desires that should be his? By <b>what</b> right <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> {{yourself}} the arbiter {{of the future of}} a man unborn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wha--what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{think of}} him? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of him?' she panted. I was too taken aback {{for the moment}} to reply. Her voice broke as she stooped to the dog at her knees. 'O Harvey, Harvey! You utterly {{worthless}} old devil!' she cried, and the dog cringed and abased himself in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon. I made to go.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's another boat coming up," [...] {{announced}} Si, at {{six o'clock}} on Tuesday morning. [...] "Walton, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> her out to be?" ...|$|E

6000|$|ADAM. Do {{not listen}} to her: the noise is good: it lightens my heart. You are a jolly snake. But you have not made a vow yet. <b>What</b> vow <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} Mrs. Cavendish," [...] {{continued}} Poirot. [...] "That's another {{who is not}} telling all she knows! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of her attitude?" ...|$|E

But to return to Wrayson. Let {{me ask you a}} question. We are all friends of his, more or less intimate friends. You would all of you scout the idea of his having any share in the murder of Morris Barnes. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of his evidence at the inquest this afternoon? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think of his whole deportment and condition?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This vexed her. [...] "Yes, tolerate! Everybody, {{interested}} or not, {{has to make}} up {{his mind}} whether to tolerate me as soon as he hears what I am. <b>What</b> excuse <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> for me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Finally {{they danced}} the Spanish dance once more with their ladies {{and because they}} were tired began to lag; and the King, who is by nature choleric, grew {{impatient}} and shouted loudly, [...] "Why don't they dance? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> me come here for? Devil take all of you, dance!" [...] At once the Marquis of Buckingham, his majesty's favorite minion, sprang forward, and danced a number of high and very tiny capers with such grace and lightness that he made everyone love him, and also managed to calm the rage of his angry lord.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bent, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of thet?" [...] asked Lem, as {{he waved}} his hand toward the house. [...] "Buster Jack ridin' up with Sheriff Burley." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think there}} is.

6000|$|... "I {{never make}} {{exception}}s. An exception disproves the rule. Have {{you ever had}} occasion to study character in handwriting? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of this fellow's scribble?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, but," [...] said Dan triumphantly, [...] "if {{you believe}} God answers prayers about {{particular}} things, it was Peter's prayer He answered. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It has {{certainly}} a character of its own. There are points of distinction about it. That {{change in the}} footprints, for example. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|TARLETON. Singularly {{beautiful}} woman Summerhays. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of her? She {{must be a}} princess. Whats this family of warriors and statesmen that risk their lives every day? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Humbug, man!" [...] said Dick; [...] "you're working {{yourself}} {{into a state of}} nervous excitement. Why, <b>what</b> the devil <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of all that nonsense about a mysterious agent which would signal our whereabouts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> <b>done,</b> sir?" [...] I demanded. [...] "By <b>what</b> right <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this thing?
