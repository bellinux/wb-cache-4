For the tested beam voltages in a typical FIB system (from 8 kV to 30 kV), the thicknesses of the damaged layers formed on a diamond tool surface increased from 11. 5 nm to 27. 6 nm. The dynamic damage process of FIB irradiation and ion-solid interactions physics leading to processing defects in FIB milling were emulated by MD simulations.

40|$|In {{the search}} for new nuclear {{materials}} with improved radiation tolerance and behavior, the high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have arisen as new candidates for structural components in nuclear reactors due to their suspected superior stability under irradiation. The metallurgical definition of HEAs is any alloy with multiple elements, five or more all in equiatomic compositions. The basic principle is the high mixing entropy of its solid solution lowers the Gibbs free energy giving a strong enhancement of the microstructural stability at low and high temperatures.

The low molecular weight of these proteins represents a challenging purpose for TEM studies.

40|$|Vehicle platoons are efficient, closely-spaced {{groups of}} robotically {{controlled}} vehicles which travel {{at high speeds}} down the road, similar to carts in a train. Within this thesis, a promising control algorithm for vehicle platooning is explored. The control algorithm was previously demonstrated in a sterile setting which significantly reduced the challenges facing full-scale implementation of platoons, most notably loss of shared data and imprecision within the data. As found within this <b>work,</b> <b>transmission</b> loss and imprecise position, velocity, and acceleration data significantly degraded the control algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Vehicles in the platoon became more closely spaced, changed speeds more frequently, and expended far more energy than necessary. Introducing a measure of each following vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s position {{with respect to the}} lead vehicle into the control algorithm noticeably reduced platoon contraction. Adjusting the control algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s responsiveness based on what data was successfully received reduced the speed-variations by vehicles. Finally, using past behavior to predict the next acceleration reduced the energy used by each vehicle.

Research is being {{conducted}} {{in the framework of}} the electrical theory of propagation of the action potential. The soliton approach is used. The numerical experiment on the evolution of the nerve impulse and the laws of motion is conducted. It is shown that the stable form of nerve impulses solitons is realized under different initial conditions. The threshold character of occurrence of nerve pulse is simulated. It is shown that the number of pulses produced changes depending on the degree of nonlinearity: with strong initial excitation of large amplitude soliton is unstable; it breaks up into a multitude number of solitons with small ampli-tudes. In this case, the greater the nonlinearity parameter, the greater the number of births of solitons. Unusual solitonlike regimes of interaction of nonlinear pulses excitations are illustrated; in certain anomalies, colliding nerve impulses are re-flected instead of their usual quenching. The possibility of the decay of the nerve impulse at the bifurcation of the nerve fibers or the appearance of heterogeneity of the passing of a nerve impulse (the presence of dissipation in the environment) is investigated.

The proposed crystallization mechanism for this glass has been modified from the results obtained through advanced STEM/EDXS techniques. The parent glass contains phase separated regions mainly enriched in F and La and also in Al, Si and Tm. After annealing, 10 - 20 nm LaF 3 nano-crystals are formed from these phase separated droplets. The partial incorporation of the doping Tm 3 + ions into the LaF 3 nano-crystals has been verified and the interphase crystal/glassy matrix has been more precisely characterized through EDXS. An Al enriched layer is formed around the crystals followed by a Si enriched shell, which greatly increase the viscosity in the periphery of the crystals, inhibiting further crystal growth and thus, keeping the nano size of the crystals. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

In this <b>work,</b> <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy (TEM) is employed to analyse low energy implanted junctions with both structural and chemical analyses. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) has been employed to observe Si crystal damage and amorphization due to low energy B"+/As"+ ion implantations, and also, defect formation/annihilation during rapid thermal annealing (RTA). The damage effects due to different implant temperatures between 300 deg C and - 150 deg C are also discussed. Since knowledge {{of the distribution of}} low energy ion implanted dopants in Si is extremely important for semiconductor device processing, energy filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) has been employed to determine implanted B distributions in Si while Z-contrast imaging and X-ray analytical mapping techniques are carried out to determine implanted As distributions in Si. Results given by these above techniques are in agreement {{with each other and with}} independent theoretical simulations. Also, the results indicate smooth dopant distributions without surface peaks for as-implanted B profiles and low temperature annealed As profiles. As accumulation at the oxide/crystal interface is observed only after high temperature annealing.
