5|$|Some time in 1974, on the {{recommendation}} of Michael Chugg, veteran Melbourne promoter Michael Browning booked the band to play at his club the Hard Rock. Browning had previously managed Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs, unsuccessfully trying to break them into the UK market. He did not like their glam rock image and felt that Evans was the wrong singer for the band, but was impressed by the Young brothers' guitar playing. Shortly afterwards, he received a call from the band; Laughlin had quit as manager, and they <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> Adelaide with no money. Browning agreed to bail them out and booked them for another gig at the Hard Rock. Following the gig, they agreed to take him on as their new manager, with the co-operation of their older brother George and Harry Vanda.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or towing vehicle and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the mud and abandoned.|$|E
5|$|From 3 to 29 April 1911, {{the ship}} participated in {{maneuvers}} off Rügen. Together with the North Sea reserve division, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{and her sister}} ships went on a training cruise to Norway, starting on 8 June. During the visit, she stopped in Arendal, Bergen, and Odda. In July, the ship conducted gunnery training near the northern coast of Holstein, followed by training cruises {{off the coast of}} Mecklenburg. Kaiser Wilhelm II served as the flagship of the III Squadron, which was organized for the autumn maneuvers in August. The III Squadron was attached to the High Seas Fleet for the maneuvers, which lasted from 28 August to 11 September. The following day, the III Squadron was disbanded and Kaiser Wilhelm II returned to service with the Baltic reserve division. In February 1912, Kaiser Wilhelm II was sent to the Fehmarn Belt to assist in freeing several freighters that <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> ice. She and her sisters were again decommissioned on 9 May, and remained out of service until 1914.|$|E

5|$|Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of John combined with an approaching cold front to produce moderate amounts of rainfall across the southwest United States, including a total of 8inches (200mm) in Whitharral and more than 3inches (75mm) in El Paso, Texas. The rainfall flooded many roads in southwestern Texas, including a ½mile (800m) portion of Interstate 10 in El Paso. A slick runway at El Paso International Airport delayed a Continental Airlines jet when its tires <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> mud. Rainfall from John in El Paso, combined with an unusually wet year, resulted in twice the normal annual rainfall, and caused 2006 to be the ninth wettest year on record by September. Damage totaled about $100,000 (2006USD) in the El Paso area from the precipitation. In northern Texas, the rainfall alleviated a severe drought, caused the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River to swell and Lake Alan Henry to overflow. The Texas Department of Transportation closed numerous roads due to flooding from the precipitation, including a portion of U.S. Route 385 near Levelland. Several other roads were washed out.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} confronting Guderian and his Sedan method was {{inadequate}} artillery support. Several batteries <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> {{traffic in the}} Ardennes {{and he could not}} rely on the artillery batteries of his Panzer Divisions only. Everything depended on the support of the Luftwaffe. General der Flieger Hugo Sperrle, commander of Luftflotte 3, had planned a conventional method of a brief bombardment before the ground forces moved in. After preparatory raids, the medium and dive-bombers were to smash the French defences in a concentrated blow lasting 20 minutes. The raid was planned for 16:00 before the infantry crossed the Meuse. In collaboration, Bruno Loerzer's II. Fliegerkorps had developed the concept of the rolling raid with Guderian. The idea of a single massed strike was abandoned, and the German air units were to attack in small formations but constantly, through the day. It was deemed the effect would be threefold; the French artillery would be eliminated, the effect of continuous raids would damage enemy morale, and smaller formations would be more systematic and accurate against targets such as bunkers.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1986, Bremner spent £125,000 on 29-year-old Sheffield United striker Keith Edwards, and {{a further}} £80,000 {{to bring in}} 31-year-old Carlisle United defender Jack Ashurst and Newcastle United defender Peter Haddock. Other new arrivals were winger Russell Doig (£15,000 from East Stirlingshire), goalkeeper Ronnie Sinclair (free {{transfer}} from Nottingham Forest) and midfielder John Buckley (£35,000 from Doncaster Rovers). Aiming for a promotion push in the 1986–87 campaign, Leeds <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> mid-table by February after selling Snodin to Everton for £840,000. This sale though allowed Bremner money for further signings and he took left-back Bobby McDonald from Oxford United, full-back Micky Adams from Coventry City for £110,000, and striker John Pearson and defender Mark Aizlewood from Charlton Athletic for £72,000 and £200,000 respectively. A 2–1 FA Cup Fifth Round victory over First Division side Queens Park Rangers then raised belief in the players, and they qualified for the play-offs {{by the end of}} the campaign. The FA Cup run continued into the semi-finals, where they were knocked out 3–2 by Coventry City at Hillsborough in a close-run game that ran into extra-time. After overcoming Oldham in the play-off semi-final their opponents in the play-off final were Charlton Athletic, and after 1–0 home wins in both legs the tie went to a replay at St Andrew's. John Sheridan put Leeds ahead in extra-time of the replay, but two late goals from Peter Shirtliff changed the game and denied Leeds promotion.|$|E

He scheduled a meeting with the province chief and other pro-Diệm officials during the time that the coup was to take place. As a result, Diệm loyalists <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a meeting room and were unable to mobilise the Republican Youth and other Ngô family paramilitary and activist groups.|$|E

25|$|Isma'il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, {{commissioned}} Verdi {{to write}} an opera for performance to celebrate {{the opening of the}} Khedivial Opera House, paying him 150,000 francs, but the premiere was delayed because of the Siege of Paris (1870–71), during the Franco-Prussian War, when the scenery and costumes <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the French capital, and Verdi's Rigoletto was performed instead. Aida eventually premiered in Cairo in late 1871. Contrary to popular belief, the opera was not written to celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, for which Verdi had been invited {{to write an}} inaugural hymn, but had declined.|$|E
25|$|Parts for the park's {{chairlift}} {{and much}} of the bike rental fleet <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> Wellington after the port was damaged in the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake, but this did not cause a delay to the planned opening. It cost NZ$20m to build the park, and the government made a NZ$2m grant available in May 2014. This grant was given on the condition that the park was to be open by December 2016, which forced the developer to proceed at a high speed after construction started. Christchurch City Council later also granted NZ$2m in support of the investment. Just over half of the park's funding came from overseas sources.|$|E
25|$|General accumulations in Quebec and northeastern Ontario {{were between}} 8 to 16inches (20–40cm) from the Timmins region to east of Quebec City. Numerous schools were closed across western Quebec {{including}} all {{schools in the}} Gatineau area while all school transportation was cancelled across Ottawa and Eastern Ontario. OC Transpo's articulated bus fleet experienced similar problems as during the Winter Storm of December 2005 when some buses jackknifed or <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> the snow in many areas across the city, although the problem was less severe than in 2005.

A disastrous run of losses under assistant manager Shaun Taylor followed, with the club dropping to just above the relegation zone. That led to Alan Knill being appointed as interim manager for the remainder of the season. Results picked up after this, and a run of three games unbeaten at the end of the season ultimately secured their Football League status with a 19th-place finish. Ling was dismissed at the end of the season, the board noting that results had been unacceptable even before his illness, and Knill's role was made permanent.|$|E

Dates were rescheduled for August and September. The year would continue to be difficult on the band for the US legs of their tours, as they were also forced to cancel two west coast festival appearances in mid-August due to the threat of terrorist attacks on US-bound flights from the UK. Two band members made it to the US while two <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> London. Subsequently, they all made it to the lone US tour stop in Boston days later but failed to recover any of their luggage, forcing them to shop for clothes on Newbury St. that afternoon. Their gear arrived hours before show time, just in time for sound check. The band also had to cancel appearances in Germany and France after bassist Paul Wilson injured his left arm and shoulder.|$|E
25|$|Panahi {{directed}} Crimson Gold in 2003, {{produced by}} Jafar Panahi Productions. The film depicts an impoverished pizza delivery man's {{failed attempt to}} rob a jewelry store and the events that drove him to his crime. The story is based on real events that Panahi first heard about when Kiarostami told him the story while they <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a traffic jam {{on their way to}} one of Kiarostami's photographic exhibits. Panahi was extremely moved by the story and Kiarostami agreed to write the script for him to direct. Panahi submitted the film to the Cannes Film Festival without being granted a permit from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Panahi had applied for the permit but the Ministry demanded several cuts be made to the film. Panahi refused and submitted the film anyway. At the festival it won the Un Certain Regard Jury Award. It later won the Golden Hugo Award for Best Film at the Chicago International Film Festival. Like The Circle, Crimson Gold was banned in Iran.|$|E

25|$|When Trí was {{informed}} that coup was imminent, he left Huế on 29 October 1963 for Đà Nẵng, so he would be away from Ngô Đình Cẩn, Diệm's younger brother, who ruled central Vietnam from for the Ngô family. The coup took place on 1 November with Trí helping by causing diversions. He scheduled {{a meeting with the}} province chief and other pro-Diệm officials during the time that the coup was to take place. As a result, the Diệm loyalists <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a meeting room and were unable to mobilise the Republican Youth and other Ngô family paramilitary and activist groups. After the coup, angry crowds surrounded the Ngô family home where Cần and his elderly mother lived. It was agreed they would be given safe passage out of the country by the junta. Trí told Cần he would be safe and would be taken out to Saigon, where it would be safer. Trí could only promise safe passage on an American plane to the capital, where embassy officials would meet Cần who wanted asylum in Japan. The Americans handed Cần over to the junta, and he was executed in 1964.|$|E
25|$|With the {{simultaneous}} technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many {{often had to}} be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents {{that could not be}} kept up with. More often than not, interpreters <b>were</b> <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> a session without having proper documents {{in front of them and}} were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross-examination. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to do an interpretation properly. Also, a number of interpreters were noted for protesting the idea of using vulgar language reflected in the proceeds, especially if it referenced Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.|$|E
