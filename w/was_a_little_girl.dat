5|$|Scully visits Kresge, {{wanting to}} look further into Roberta Sim's suicide, {{despite the fact}} that the police think it is a simple suicide. Scully finds a {{striking}} resemblance between the Sims' daughter, Emily, and her sister Melissa from when she was that age. Scully flashes back to a funeral she attended when she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> but imagines Marshall Sim holding her hand. Scully insists on performing an autopsy on Roberta, thinking that she was murdered. Scully finds a needle puncture in Roberta's foot, causing her to believe that she was anesthetized and her suicide was staged. The police search the Sim's house and find a used hypodermic needle, which Marshall claims was used for injecting the anemic Emily with treatment. Scully spots the dark-suited men watching from a nearby car. Scully receives DNA data on Melissa, and matching it up to Emily's finds them nearly identical, causing her to believe that Emily is Melissa's daughter. Scully believes that Melissa gave birth to her while on the west coast and gave her up for adoption without ever telling the rest of the family. Scully flashes back to when she and Melissa were teenagers and were given cross necklaces from their mother for Christmas.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, a {{masquerade}} party ensues in {{the opera}} house. At the party, Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul. The event is interrupted once {{again by the}} Phantom, who is dressed as Red Death. The Phantom brings his own composition, Don Juan Triumphant, and orders the managers to stage the opera. Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom. At {{the sight of the}} engagement ring, the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor. Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry, who privately tells him the story of the Phantom's past. When she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl,</b> she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage. The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed. The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child's face, revealing his deformity. Only the young Madame Giry pitied him. She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope. Chased by the police, Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house, where she has hidden him from the world ever since.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{in one of}} history's ironies, another {{resident}} of Venango County {{about the same time}} as Henry and Abbie Rogers <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl</b> named Ida M. Tarbell, whose father was an independent producer whose small business was ruined by the South Improvement Company scheme of 1871 and the conglomerate which became Standard Oil. Introduced to each other in 1902 by their mutual friend Mark Twain, Tarbell who had become an investigative journalist and Rogers, who knew of her work, shared meetings and information over a two-year period which led to her epoch work, The History of the Standard Oil Company, published in 1904, which many historians feel helped fuel public sentiment against the giant company and helped lead to the court-ordered break-up of it in 1911.|$|E

25|$|Wagner {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Bensenville, Illinois, and began to play sandlot ball with the boys of her {{neighborhood}} when she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> At age 15, she attended Bensenville Community High School, where she heard about Philip K. Wrigley and his remarkable experiment in creating a women professional baseball league during World War II. Wrigley, who was in charge both of the Wrigley Company and the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball club, decided to found the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League as a promotional sideline to maintain interest in baseball. By then, the military draft was depleting Major League rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. The league started its first season in 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox, and each team was made up of fifteen girls. Wagner was allocated to the Kenosha Comets, where she played her entire career in the circuit.|$|E
25|$|The Stock Market Crash of 1929 {{wiped the}} Wilders out; their daughter's {{investments}} were devastated as well. They still owned the 200 acre (81 hectare) farm, {{but they had}} invested most of their savings with their daughter Rose Wilder Lane's broker. In 1930, Wilder requested Lane's opinion about an autobiographical manuscript Wilder had written about her pioneering childhood. The Great Depression, coupled with the deaths of Wilder's mother in 1924 and her older sister in 1928, seem to have prompted her to preserve her memories in a life story called Pioneer Girl. Wilder also hoped that her writing would generate some additional income. The original title {{of the first of}} the books was When Grandma <b>Was</b> <b>a</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Girl.</b> On the advice of Lane's publisher, Wilder greatly expanded the story. As a result of Lane's publishing connections as a successful writer and after editing by Lane, Harper & Brothers published Wilder's book in 1932 as Little House in the Big Woods. After its success, Wilder continued writing. The close and often rocky collaboration between her and Lane continued, in person until 1935 when Lane permanently left Rocky Ridge Farm, and afterward by correspondence.|$|E

500|$|Afanasieff {{flew back}} to California where he {{finished}} the song's programming and production.

He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>girl.</b> I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs.

500|$|Stewart said, due to Max's {{past events}} with his family, what Abi might say when Max objects to her {{relationship}} with Jay, [...] "It won't be her setting a gerbil on him", calling her a [...] "goody-two-shoes". A writer from the Western Mail said that the Branning/Mitchell Feud makes Abi and Jay feel like [...] "Walford's answer to Romeo and Juliet". Two writers from the Daily Mirror mocked the storyline where Abi turns down the trip to Costa Rica. One said, [...] "An extreme case of soap agoraphobia as brilliant Abi sensibly turns down the chance to spend eight weeks in the tropical paradise of Costa Rica. But in the tiny micro-world of EastEnders, even the three-mile odyssey from Walford to the West End is considered an epic journey.
