5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E

Thus <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> till midnight was two hours gone. Then there came a silence.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> About When <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> About Love.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally it was {{believed}} that one's way of speaking is a result of one's identity, but the postmodernist approach reversed this theory to suggest that the way <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> is a part of identity formation, specifically suggesting that gender identity is variable and not fixed.|$|E

What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong's {{theory of}} {{universals}} {{gives him the}} basis for an understanding of laws of nature as being relations between universals, a non-Humean account of laws of nature proposed independently by Armstrong, Michael Tooley, and Fred Dretske. This account posits that the relations between universals are truthmakers for the statements about physical laws, and it is realist as it accepts that laws of nature are {{a feature of the}} world rather than just a way <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about the world. Armstrong identifies the laws as holding between universals rather than particulars as an account of laws involving just particulars rather than universals would not adequately explain how laws of nature operate in the case of counterfactuals.|$|E
500|$|Whenever we work {{together}} she always sits with me and listens to the song, and says [...] "tell me what this song is about to you." [...] She's very methodical in her thinking. <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> about it, she writes down words that I say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her to get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E

500|$|Critics noted {{similarities}} {{among the}} structures of [...] "Rehab" [...] and some of Timberlake's songs, such as [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River". Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song has an [...] "R swoon", similar to Rihanna's previous singles. In an interview with Margeaux Watson for Entertainment Weekly, Rihanna explained {{the meaning of the}} song's lyrics: [...] "'Rehab' is a metaphorical song. Rehab really just means we have to get over the guy. So <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about checking ourselves into rehab, meaning we have to get over him. And we compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." [...] Watson further called the song a [...] "lovesick ballad".|$|E

Gemma Whelan, who plays Yara, talked about filming the scene: [...] "Oh my goodness – I was so excited when I saw that I had a scene with those two [...]" [...] About the dynamic between the two women, Whelan said: [...] "It's clear as the scene plays out that Yara quite likes Dany. We share a lot of little looks and there's some playful language in how <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> to one another – Dany asks if the Iron Islands ever had a queen, and Yara says, 'No more than Westeros.' They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. When <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} round of the competition, Berg {{attempted}} another jump but was not as fortunate this time: he fell out of the air, just as before, and crashed almost identically to Findeisen. One of Berg's skis, which had come loose after impact and was still attached to his foot, flailed around and hit him in the face – exposed due to his goggles detaching – as he was sliding to a stop. His injuries, including concussion and a broken ACL, were career-ending. At this point, Trautwig began calling into question the nature of the sport: [...] "Jeff, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about the fear and why the ski flyers are scared... I'm really starting to ask, why we're here and why they're doing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Later, {{a survey}} of Malaysians found that 55% of {{respondents}} agreed politicians should be [...] "blamed for segregating the people by playing racial politics". Mukhriz Mahathir — Mahathir's son and an UMNO Youth leader — defended UMNO's actions because of economic disparities, insisting that [...] "As long as that remains, {{there will always be}} people to champion each race to equalise things." [...] Shahrir Abdul Samad, the chairman of the BN Backbenchers' Club, argued that politicians were simply responding to [...] "a country ... divided into different races," [...] asking, [...] "if you talk about Malay issues to the Malay community, is that playing racial politics?" [...] M. Kayveas, the President of the PPP, disagreed: [...] "Every 12 months, the parties go back to one race championing their own causes and, {{at the end of the}} day, when the general election comes, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about 'Bangsa Malaysia'." ...|$|E

500|$|Co-showrunner Wyman {{also served}} as episode director, marking his {{television}} directorial debut. He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things that <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about on Fringe." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} lines, Kuti {{comments}} on his social reality: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> say confusion / Everything out of control". His lyrics decry what he {{viewed as the}} colonial mindset of some Africans and employ pidgin English, which was the lingua franca of most people in English-speaking West Africa; he sings the phrase [...] "pafuka", which means [...] "all over" [...] or [...] "finished", and the interjection [...] "o" [...] to add emphasis. Kuti makes reference to three dialects and currencies that make trading in urban Nigeria difficult: [...] "Dem be three men wey sell for roadside-o / Dem three speak different language-o / Dem speak Lagos, Accra, and Conakry / One white man come pay them money-o / He pay them for pounds, dollars and French money-o / For the thing wey he go buy from them / He remain for them to share am-o / Me I say, na confusion be that-o / He go say he pafuka o." [...] African Arts journalist E.J. Collins interpreted the latter verse as {{a reference to the}} protracted nature of transactions in Lagos.|$|E
500|$|Compared with Vitalogy and No Code, Yield {{represented}} {{more of a}} {{team effort}} between {{all members of the}} group. Lead vocalist Eddie Vedder had made the final decisions for the albums Vitalogy and No Code; however, {{at the end of the}} No Code recording sessions, Vedder suggested to bassist Jeff Ament that it would be better for the other members to write and bring in more complete songs so Vedder would be under less pressure to finish the songs. Ament said that [...] "everybody took that to heart," [...] and O'Brien added that most of the songs came to the studio finished. Ament also said that Vedder's reaction to the rest of the band's new material kept [...] "everybody energized about their place in the band." [...] Vedder worked with the other band members on their own material before work was started on his. Guitarist Mike McCready noticed a change in Vedder's attitude during the recording of Yield, stating, [...] "I used to be afraid of him and not want to confront him on things ... <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> more now, and hang out ... He seems very, very centered now." ...|$|E
