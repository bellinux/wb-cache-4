5|$|Bumblebees of the {{subgenus}} Psithyrus (known as 'cuckoo bumblebees', and formerly {{considered a}} separate genus) are brood parasites, sometimes called kleptoparasites, {{in the colonies}} of other bumblebees, and have {{lost the ability to}} collect pollen. Before finding and invading a host colony, a Psithyrus female, such as that of the Psithyrus species of B. sylvestris, feeds directly from flowers. Once she has infiltrated a host colony, the Psithyrus female kills or subdues the queen of that colony, and uses pheromones and physical attacks to force the workers of that colony to feed her and her young. Usually, cuckoo bumblebees can be described as queen-intolerant inquilines, since the host queen is often killed to enable the parasite to produce more offspring, though some species, such as B. bohemicus, actually enjoy increased success <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> the host queen alive.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{through the}} marsh, they find Stone injured but safe and track down Irving's boat with his help. Irving injects {{himself with a}} variant of the Las Plagas {{parasite}} and mutates into a huge octopus-like beast. Redfield and Alomar defeat him, and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more. The cave is the source of a flower used to create viruses previously used by Umbrella, as well as a new strain named Uroboros. Redfield and Alomar find evidence that Tricell, the company funding the BSAA, took over a former Umbrella Corporation underground laboratory and continued Umbrella's research. In the facility, they discover thousands of capsules holding human test subjects. Although Redfield finds that one of the capsules is Valentine's, it is empty. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>leave,</b> they discover that Tricell CEO Excella Gionne has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them, creating a new breed of humanity. Redfield and Alomar pursue Gionne, but are stopped by Wesker and the hooded figure, who is revealed to be a mind-controlled Valentine. Gionne and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker; Redfield and Alomar fight Valentine, subduing her and removing the mind-control device before she orders Redfield to follow Wesker.|$|E

5|$|In metapopulation terminology, {{migrating}} {{individuals are}} classed as emigrants (<b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A {{site is a}} generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire are {{spending}} the evening at The Drunken Clam, when Peter is reminded {{to pick up}} Meg from the roller skating rink. They {{then go to the}} rink and continue to enjoy themselves, but forget to pick up Meg <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>leave.</b> After skating home in the rain, Meg asks the family for her own car. The next day, Peter takes his daughter to the local car showroom, where she shows an interest in a sedan. Distracted by a large tank at the dealership, however, Peter is tricked into buying it. At first, Peter uses the tank himself, despite it being intended for Meg, but then he teaches Meg to drive it. Later that day, however, the two accidentally run over Joe, and he impounds the tank. Frustrated, Meg decides to earn the money for her own car, and is able to get a job at the local Quahog mega store, Superstore USA, working under a man named Mr. Penisburg. The shops in Quahog soon become bankrupt because of the new superstore, and causes people to lose their jobs of Superstore USA's one job taking quahog, like cleveland and mort putting planks on the doors so they will become abandoned.|$|E

25|$|A fast ball which pitches {{short but}} (due {{to the vagaries}} of the wicket surface) does not bounce high is very {{difficult}} to defend against, for the batsman will usually expect the ball to bounce high in this situation; this can often lead to the batsman being out bowled or lbw <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> a ball which appeared to be rising over the stumps but stayed low.

25|$|In the United States, coccinellids usually {{begin to}} appear indoors {{in the autumn}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>leave</b> their summer feeding sites in fields, forests, and yards and search out places to spend the winter.

Swarms of coccinellids fly to buildings in September through November depending on location and weather conditions.
