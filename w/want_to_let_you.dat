Do you think ... am I a violent person? No. So, {{as far as my}} {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was {{the same as that of}} my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic website Stereo Board {{stated that}} [...] "Alesha's fearlessly {{powerful}} vocals with an unforgettable, anthemic chorus that {{is set to}} make it a sure-fire radio sensation." [...] Female First gave the single four out of five stars, stating there were [...] "in love with it". Others criticised the song, saying it sounded like [...] "Dixon [...] unknowingly sample Robyn's 'Dancing on My Own'". Another positive review, came from Robert Copsey from Digital Spy who gave 4/5 stars for the song, saying [...] "Upon further listening, the reason for her apathetic approach towards ear candy becomes all too clear. [...] "I'm turning up the radio / I'll drown you out / 'Cause I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> go," [...] she mourns over a combination of jagged beats and throbbing synths that sounds suspiciously like Robyn's own weepy club ballad 'Dancing on My Own'. Nonetheless, the result is Dixon's sturdiest effort since 'Breathe Slow' - and if you're going to have a crack at sad-pop, you may as well look to the Commander in Chief, right?".|$|E

[...] She {{said things}} of that kind, astounding in self-complacency, the {{assumption}} of quick success. She was in earnest, evidently prepared to work, but her imagination flew over preliminaries and probations, took no account of the steps in the process, especially the first tiresome ones, the hard test of honesty. He had done nothing for her as yet, given no substantial pledge of interest; yet she was already talking as if his protection were assured and jealous. Certainly, however, she seemed to belong to him very much indeed as she sat facing him at the Paris café in her youth, her beauty, and her talkative confidence. This degree of possession was highly agreeable {{to him and he}} asked nothing more than to make it last and go further. The impulse to draw her out was irresistible, to encourage her to show herself all the way; for if he was really destined to take her career in hand he counted on some good equivalent--such for instance as that she should at least amuse him.|$|E
