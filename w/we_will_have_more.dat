I was deeply moved by his statement of the wrongs done to free-State men out there. I think it just {{to say that all}} true men North should sympathize with them, and ought to be willing to do any possible and needful thing to right their wrongs. But we must not promise what we ought not, lest we be called on to perform what we cannot; we must be calm and moderate, and consider the whole difficulty, and determine what is possible and just. We must not be led by excitement and passion to do that which our sober judgments would not approve in our cooler moments. We have higher aims; <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> serious business than to dally with temporary measures.|$|E

Old as she is, Mr. Lefrank, and ugly as she is, she wouldn't object (if she could only make him ask her) to be John Jago's second wife. No, sir; and she wouldn't break her heart if the boys were not left a stick or a stone on the farm when the father dies. I have watched her, and I know it. Ah! I could tell you such things! But there's no time now--it's close on ten o'clock; we must say good-night. I am right glad I have spoken to you, sir.

Therefore, we have decided to abolish the system after much discussion. There’s really no meaning behind a ranking system. We have decided to undergo this change in hopes that viewers can just enjoy the music. There are a lot of K-Pop stars in the music industry that have talent. We wanted to break free from the repetitive system, in which artists release new songs and perform, so we plan on redesigning our system by having the concept of more special stages.

5000|$|Meanwhile, the mainly Kabyle-based secularist RCD {{party had}} {{announced}} plans for a march for democracy to be held on Saturday 22 January, despite being refused permission by the government under the state of emergency. Prior to the March, RCD leader Saïd Sadi linked the planned march to the 2010-2011 Tunisian protests, stating, [...] "If the opposition does not mobilise the crowds, we believe that <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> devastating events than what happened in Tunisia. The anger here is bigger than (it was) in Tunisia." [...] He also called for the 1992 state of emergency to be lifted and for the army to withdraw from politics, stating, [...] "The army should {{no longer be a}} decision maker, it has to become a state institution." [...] The march attracted about 300 people, and was broken up by the police; 42 people (according to the RCD) or 19 (according to the Interior Ministry) were injured, and 9, including the head of the party's parliamentary group Othman Amazouz, were arrested, to be released later the same day. [...] Some demonstrators waved the Tunisian flag, alluding to the protests which had brought down Ben Ali. [...] Would-be demonstrators coming from Tizi Ouzou were prevented from reaching the scene by the police. [...] On 22 January, 20,000 police officers stopped all protests.

We must not only create the facilities but also introduce an effective working system, because we are not doing all this just to build a certain number of houses or open laboratories and create a working environment. These things are, of course, important, but it’s still infrastructure. What’s most important is to bring people to this centre. And to make people come, we need to have a clear system of management in place, and this system depends on us.” He also said “We will also need a corresponding scientific advisory council, and bring in foreign partners, including well-known representatives from foreign scientific circles and companies. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> discussions on this issue, and after making our final decisions, we will invite specialists to participate in this process. I had some consultations on this matter with my colleagues, who are leaders of some foreign states, and they promised to help, at the very least with advice; this, too, is important. I think that this will be a rather important component in our work.” ...|$|E
