5|$|Most of {{the acute}} side effects {{associated}} with brachytherapy {{can be treated}} <b>with</b> <b>medication</b> or through dietary changes, and usually disappear over time (typically a matter of weeks), once the treatment is completed. The acute side effects of HDR brachytherapy are broadly similar to EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{that occurs}} {{as a result}} of other issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} <b>with</b> <b>medication</b> in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control <b>with</b> <b>medication.</b> The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E

5|$|A 2015 review found {{a larger}} effect <b>with</b> <b>medications</b> than talk therapy. <b>Medications</b> <b>with</b> benefit include serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} types of {{medications}} that are used {{for the treatment of}} arthritis. Treatment typically begins <b>with</b> <b>medications</b> that have the fewest side effects <b>with</b> further <b>medications</b> being added if insufficiently effective.|$|R
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a mainstream}} therapy {{that does not}} use pharmaceutical drugs, which was developed to reproduce the success and remove {{the limitations of the}} non-mainstream use of fasting to treat epilepsy. Although popular in the 1920s and 30s, it was largely abandoned in favour of new anticonvulsant drugs. Most individuals with epilepsy can successfully control their seizures <b>with</b> <b>medication.</b> However, 20–30% fail to achieve such control despite trying a number of different drugs. For this group, and for children in particular, the diet has once again found a role in epilepsy management.|$|E
5|$|When in the hospital, glucose {{levels are}} checked several times daily {{and the patient}} is {{monitored}} for signs of symptomatic ketosis (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common but disappear within two weeks. The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar and handling illness. The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than <b>with</b> <b>medication.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, <b>with</b> <b>medication,</b> or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Once there, Innes becomes acquainted over {{drinks with}} a former boxer named Nelson Byrne. The job, {{originally}} intended to be looking after Wooley, becomes a sinister operation as Innes learns there may be impropriety related to the fight. Innes deals with his dependence on codeine and alcohol along with Wooley's anger management problems. Innes finds himself in a difficult situation in an unfamiliar city, suffers a gunshot wound and his charge Wooley is involuntarily subdued <b>with</b> <b>medication</b> and kidnapped. Innes becomes the suspect in a murder investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department, finds and rescues Wooley and learns that his supposed friend Byrne was the culprit. After being exonerated by the police, Innes escorts Wooley back to England.|$|E

25|$|Chronic eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{was first}} described by Carrington in 1969, {{and it is}} also known as Carrington syndrome. Prior to that, eosinophilic pneumonia was a well described pathologic entity usually associated <b>with</b> <b>medication</b> or parasite exposures. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia was first described in 1989.|$|E
25|$|As {{anger is}} a {{psychological}} concern, treating it <b>with</b> <b>medication</b> is possible. The {{main purpose of}} the medication is to complement heal and not to complicate your healing. You need to prescribe to a doctor about your anger issues and about the medications.|$|E
25|$|The blue urine {{was used}} to monitor {{psychiatric}} patients' compliance <b>with</b> <b>medication</b> regimes. This led to interest - from the 1890s {{to the present day}} - in the drug's antidepressant and other psychotropic effects. It became the lead compound in research leading to the discovery of chlorpromazine.|$|E
5|$|Psychiatric {{symptoms}} can {{be treated}} <b>with</b> <b>medications</b> {{similar to those used}} in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while atypical antipsychotic drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems. Specialist neuropsychiatric input is recommended as people may require long-term treatment <b>with</b> multiple <b>medications</b> in combination.|$|R

25|$|The Institute of Medicine (2004) {{report found}} low health {{literacy}} levels negatively affects healthcare outcomes.

25|$|For chronic or {{recurring}} sinusitis, {{referral to}} an otolaryngologist may be indicated, and treatment options may include nasal surgery. Surgery {{should only be}} considered {{for those people who}} do not benefit <b>with</b> <b>medication.</b> It is unclear how benefits of surgery compare to medical treatments in those with nasal polyps as this has been poorly studied.|$|E
25|$|BPH can {{be treated}} <b>with</b> <b>medication,</b> a {{minimally}} invasive procedure or, in extreme cases, surgery that removes the prostate. Minimally invasive procedures include transurethral needle ablation of the prostate (TUNA) and transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT). These outpatient procedures may be followed by the insertion of a temporary prostatic stent, to allow normal voluntary urination, without exacerbating irritative symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Tapeworms {{are treated}} <b>with</b> <b>medications</b> taken by mouth, {{usually in a}} single dose. The drug of choice for {{tapeworm}} infections is praziquantel. Niclosamide can also be used.|$|R
