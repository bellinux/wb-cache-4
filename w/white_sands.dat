5|$|The major {{intercity}} surface routes from Alamogordo are U.S. Highways 54, 70, and 82, all {{of which}} are four-lane roads. The major north-south street within the city is <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Boulevard. The Charlie T. Lee Memorial Relief Route, which is designated as U.S. Route 54 and 70, is a bypass road constructed {{to the west of the}} city in 2001 to relieve congestion on <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Boulevard.|$|E

40|$|Survey of {{the remains}} on the Korimoto campus of Kagoshima University {{was carried out in}} 2007 and 2008. At a few pit {{dwelling}} in the Tumulus period, <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> was recognized on the ground floor. This <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> is composed of almost entirely babble-walled type volcanic glass included in the Ito pyroclastic flow deposit. However <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> scarcely includes pumice and pumiceous type volcanic glass. Grain size distribution and lack of the pumiceous type volcanic glass suggest that <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> must be sorted by river water. The <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> is the secondary reworked sediments of the Ito pyroclastic flow deposits and it must have been used for keeping warm and moisture proof {{on the ground floor of}} the pit dwelling. ...|$|R

Surigao has notable beaches {{including}} Mabua and Ipil Pebble beaches- a contiguous layer gray of pebbles, Basul- a {{tiny island}} {{at the entrance}} of Hinituan Channel with fine <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> mixed with assorted shells rims, Berok- a small shell beach surrounded by vast mangroves and close to a reef, Panomboyon- a <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> beach at the southern tip of Hikdop Island, Danawan Island, Sumilom Island, Sibale Island- a mile-long strip of <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> beach 45 minutes ride by pumpboat from the city, and Sagisi Island Beach- 3- kilometer stretch of <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> beach with a fringing coral reef rich in marine life.|$|R
5|$|U.S. Route 70 and U.S. Route 54 {{traverses}} {{through the}} north and south ends of the city. At {{the south end of the}} city, <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Boulevard is a major named street that merges into U.S. Route 54/Charles T. Lee Memorial Relief Route, running south to El Paso, Texas. In the south part of the city, U.S. Route 70 splits from U.S. Route 54 in a southwestern direction towards Holloman Air Force Base, <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> National Monument, <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Missile Range, and Las Cruces. At the north end of the city, <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Boulevard and the Charles T. Lee Memorial Relief Route become a merged U.S. Route 54 and U.S. Route 70 running north to Tularosa. U.S. Route 82 starts at the same point and runs east to Cloudcroft and the mountain communities of Otero County, and then to Artesia. Meanwhile, in Tularosa, U.S. 70 and U.S. 54 both split in which U.S. 70 heads east through the mountains, and towards Ruidoso and Roswell, while U.S. 54 heads north towards Carrizozo and keeps going north until it heads east again starting in Vaughn.|$|E
5|$|Several major motion {{pictures}} were filmed {{in or near}} Alamogordo. The 2007 film Transformers was shot primarily at <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Missile Range, with additional filming at Holloman Air Force Base, both in the Alamogordo area.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, Sprint {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at <b>White</b> <b>Sands,</b> the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> and another 34 at Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|Numerous other {{facilities}} are operated by NASA, including the Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Virginia; the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana; the <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico; and Deep Space Network stations in Barstow, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia.|$|E

5|$|After 1964 the Kwajalein {{site was}} no longer {{required}} to be on alert, and returned primarily to Zeus testing. The system was kept active in a non-alert role between 1964 and 1967, known as Program 505. In 1967 it {{was replaced by a}} Thor based system, Program 437. A total of 12 launches, including those at <b>White</b> <b>Sands,</b> were carried out as part of the 505 program between 1962 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|Future Combat Systems is {{a wide-ranging}} {{modernization}} {{project of the}} US Army. Much of the work will be done at Fort Bliss, with some at <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Missile Range and some at Holloman Air Force Base. Alamogordo is expected to get some economic benefit due to its proximity to these three bases.|$|E
5|$|However, Convair {{arranged}} {{to use the}} remaining contract funding to launch three of the rockets, which were renamed RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The tests took place at <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Proving Grounds. The three tests took place on 13 July 1947, 27 September, and 2 December. These tests validated the concept of using gimballed engines for propulsion and guidance.|$|E
5|$|On 11 April 1963, Thurmond led Congress in {{an effort}} to fund {{deployment}} of Zeus. In the first closed session of the Senate in twenty years, Zeus was debated and {{the decision was made to}} continue with the planned development of Nike-X with no Zeus deployment. The Army continued the testing program until December 1964 at <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Missile Range, and May 1966 at Kwajalein Missile Range.|$|E

5|$|The {{volcanic}} activity still continues, dropping volcanic ash on the surroundings. Earlier eruptions built the <b>white</b> <b>sands</b> highlands in the region.

5|$|For {{many years}} {{the site was}} open on the first Saturday in April and October. Admission is free. There is a display on the Schmidt family in the house during each open house. In 2014, the <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> Missile Range {{announced}} that due to budgetary constraints, the site would only be open once a year, on the first Saturday in April. In 2015, this decision was reversed, and two events were scheduled, in April and October.|$|E

5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|R
