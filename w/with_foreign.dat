40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{academic}} outcomes of children <b>with</b> two <b>foreign</b> born parents to those <b>with</b> a <b>foreign</b> born and native born parent. Using NELS: 88 data, I find that children <b>with</b> a <b>foreign</b> born {{father and a}} native born mother have worse grades in school than children with same-nativity parents. On the other hand, I find that children <b>with</b> a <b>foreign</b> born mother and native born father have better grades than children with same-nativity parents. These relationships remain even after controlling for many characteristics correlated with intermarriage such as education levels of parents, that {{are known to have}} positive consequences on children’s academic achievement. This suggests that the reason children <b>with</b> two <b>foreign</b> born parents do better than children <b>with</b> a <b>foreign</b> born father and native born mother lies in the benefits of ethnic networks as opposed to attributes of the marriage itself. Interpreting an immigrant’s marriage to another immigrant as signal of his connection to his ethnic network, I then test various hypotheses regarding th...|$|R

The (provisional) results of some research projects are indicating that native-born nationals <b>with</b> a <b>foreign</b> background are performing better (working in better segments of the labour market) on the labour market than their naturalised colleagues.

30|$|It {{is evident}} from the Table  3 that, in total about 488 total {{entities}} 266 (about 55  %) are <b>with</b> the <b>foreign</b> firms and the rest are Indian institutions/firms. The firms mostly collaborate <b>with</b> other <b>foreign</b> firms. This is perhaps due to the firm’s global alliance extended to the Indian subsidiaries. The linkages with the Indian firms are the second most prominent forms of linkages. There are many domestic firms which have formed alliances <b>with</b> the <b>foreign</b> firms R&D units. Indian universities and government research institutes are not much prominent in the formation of linkages <b>with</b> the <b>foreign</b> firms. It shows that industry academia linkages are quite weak in India.|$|R
