Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower.

This appears to be an interpretation of events based on the following: the regions that Florus lists as being raided by the slaves include Thurii and Metapontum, which are geographically distant from Nola and Nuceria.|$|E

Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> continue the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work.

Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation.

The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.|$|E
