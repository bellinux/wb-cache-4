500|$|After {{spending}} {{several years}} operating at a loss, GoodHome.com reorganized {{under the name}} Scene7, which formally launched in January 2001, with $15 million raised from investors that included Hearst Interactive Media. The new company focused on helping companies prepare interactive advertisements for consumers. Mack, the Broderbund executive who had decided to spin off the company, reflected on the decision to reorganize and relaunch: [...] "We got a year into [...] and the whole B2C (business-to-consumer) market tanked, and <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> could not build a successful business as a portal [...] But the whole time we kept having people approach us to license the technology , and finally a light bulb went off when <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were {{sitting on top of}} a great technology we could sell." [...] Scene7 raised a round of financing on July 12, 2001 that totaled $11.3million, which helped stabilize the company. The deal was led by venture capitalists from several firms, including Louis Bacon's Moore Capital Management and Xcelera of the Cayman Islands, with cash investments from Cooley Godward and Perkins Coie. After the latest round of financing, Mack planned for Scene7 to have 15clients and a burn rate, or negative cash flow, of less than $700,000 a month, stating, [...] "What we learned was to stick to your strategy, and don't get nervous when the competition is adopting a strategy to spend their way to victory." [...] At the time, the company's revenues were well below its peak of $1million a month, but Mack intended to increase revenues past that point in a few months.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, Marvel held a {{press event}} to {{announce}} the titles of their Phase Three films. The event, which drew comparisons to Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, was done because all the information was ready.

So the plan has been, since a few weeks before Comic-Con when <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> weren't {{going to be able to}} do everything we wanted to do, is to decide 'let's do either something we haven't done in a long time, or something we've never done.'

500|$|According to Monaghan, Drive Shaft {{is similar}} to Oasis, in that [...] " [...] first album {{was kind of like}} Oasis's first album: {{critically}} acclaimed, didn't sell big numbers, but in the industry, people gave it respect." [...] J.J Abrams and Damon Linelof told Monaghan that if he wanted to write the song that would be Charlie's [...] "one hit wonder", they would consider using it in the show. Monaghan wrote a song called [...] "Photos and Plans" [...] with a friend; Abrams and Lindelof liked the song, but it did not make it into Lost. The lyrics were inspired by an incident on The Phil Donahue Show, where Matt Reeves, who was close friends with producers Bryan Burk and Damon Lindelof, saw a female audience member yell out, [...] "You all everybody, acting like it's the stupid people wearing expensive clothes." [...] The producers had an inside joke where they would say this quotation to each other. According to Burk, [...] "At one point, in a delirious stupor, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> had said it so many times that that had to be the song." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} create the effect of Mulder and Scully [...] "melting", special effects {{producer}} Bill Millar captured video of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in three-dimensional high-definition video—the two actors were scanned with a special laser at Glendale, California {{and the results were}} manipulated by a computer. Millar noted that, [...] "when we looked at our first test, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> couldn't melt Mulder and Scully without some degree of difficulty [...] They had to melt like movie stars [...] without turning Gillian into Margaret Thatcher and David into John Hurt as The Elephant Man". In order to compensate for the difficulties, Millar used a [...] "leading edge" [...] melting effect that melted parts of the actors' faces, keeping their facial features intact until the [...] "goop" [...] overtook them. For other shots, Anderson and Duchovny had to endure hours of being covered by a vegetable-derived food thickener with yellow food coloring that stood in for the fungal secretion. In addition, Anderson and Duchovny were literally buried under the earth for the final scene: large pits were dug and scaffolding was constructed inside of them. The two actors then wore wet suits and were covered in the vegetable fluid and soil.|$|E
500|$|Due to time constraints, a team {{of writers}} was {{assigned}} to write the teleplay. In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell, Moore, Ira Steven Behr, Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay, and Piller would provide the finishing touches. Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers {{to appear in the}} credits (four after a special waiver was granted), Piller agreed to not feature his name in the credits. A partial first draft was submitted on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence. The altered timeline provided a chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode. Behr explained that since the original timeline was to be restored, the writers had the freedom to include more action. [...] "Even though it was an alternate universe, [...] and I got all excited because <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were going to kill everyone on screen", he said. Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos regarding the type of anomaly that might drag the Enterprise-C through time, and suggested interstellar, super-dense strings as a possibility. The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4, and a preproduction meeting was held the same day. Given the scale of the story, various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget. The final draft was finished and submitted on December 8.|$|E

At this point, <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were not surviving. We said our last prayers, and that was it.

2500|$|With {{the game}} sharing the [...] as the 1998 {{installment}} in the franchise, the game’s creative director, Craig Sullivan, told why they didn’t name the game something totally different, stating: [...] "To be honest {{when we started}} out making the game we didn’t know {{it was going to}} be called Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, we just didn’t. We got to the game before we got to the name. <b>We</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were making something that had a lot of cops in it and was really interesting to us, so we thought what can we call this? Eventually we thought this actually fits quite well with Hot Pursuit and went with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{most of the}} {{sampling}} for Paul's Boutique was cleared, but at dramatically lower costs compared to today's prevailing rates.

[...] Mario [...] "Mario C" [...] Caldato, Jr., engineer on the album, later {{said in an interview}} that [...] "after [...] did Paul's Boutique <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> had spent a lot of money in the studio.

Records Inc., the landmark lawsuit against Biz Markie by Gilbert O'Sullivan, which changed the process and future of hip hop sampling.|$|E

2500|$|Movie Maker Magazine {{asked the}} producers, [...] "Voices of Iraq {{is truly a}} {{groundbreaking}} film—both {{in terms of its}} content and the process behind its production. What was your main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. [...] For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. Iraqis are a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. <b>We</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors. Second to that, the 35 mm blow-up." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{great deal}} of time was also spent working out the control scheme. The game {{originally}} had a target-lock system, based on the controls in Syphon Filter and Devil May Cry. However, the developers were unhappy with this system as they felt the gameplay was based more on [...] "PC-style shooters" [...] such as Half Life, which uses a mouse and keyboard control scheme to facilitate easier free aiming, rather than a target lock system. As such, [...] "with our controls for a console-style shooter but our gameplay from a PC-style shooter, about a year into development <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> had a dangerous disconnect in our design that made our game tedious instead of fun." [...] However, with the release of successful console third-person shooters such as Max Payne, , , and , all of which [...] "eschewed target-lock in favor of double-stick control schemes that simulated the mouse/keyboard experience from the PC," [...] the team decided to scrap their target-lock system and go with a free aim system; [...] "looking at the sales for these titles, we concluded the installed base of players who were familiar with these controls was now large enough that we could take the risk of turning off a few newbies. The change was a huge success for the game: it fixed the disconnect in our gameplay and added depth that had been completely missing." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{developed}} that our whereabouts {{was a mystery}} to me. The sun had become completely obliterated, a fine rain was falling, the forest had grown wet and dismal. We had gotten turned around. The matter did not look serious, however, until we had wandered around for another hour without finding anything familiar. Then <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were lost. This sort of experience had happened to R.C. and me often; nevertheless we did not relish it, especially the first day out. As usual on such occasions R.C. argued with me about direction, and then left the responsibility with me. I found an open spot, somewhat sheltered on one side from the misty rain, and there I stationed myself to study trees and sky and clouds for some clue to help me decide what was north or west. After a while I {{had the good fortune}} to see a momentary brightening through the clouds. I located the sun, and was pleased to discover that the instinct of direction I had been subtly prompted to take, would have helped me as much as the sun.|$|E

[...] "Jason is a family name, derived from {{one of our most}} eminent ancestors, and in my {{generation}} it is also borne, I have learned, by one of my second cousins, a Jason Jones who is also a painter and aspires to fame as an artist. I have never met the man, but his indifferently executed canvases, offered for sale under our common name, formerly caused me considerable annoyance and perhaps interfered with my career. But of late I have not heard of this Jason Jones, for soon after my separation from my wife I went to Southern California and located in a little bungalow hidden in a wild canyon of the Santa Monica mountains. There I have secluded myself for years, determined to do some really good work before I returned East to prove my ability. Some time after Antoinette died I saw a notice to that effect in a newspaper, but there were no comments and I did not know that she had made me guardian of our child. That was like Antoinette," [...] he continued, in gentler tones; [...] "she was invariably generous and considerate of my shortcomings, even after <b>we</b> <b>realized</b> <b>we</b> were not fitted to live together.
