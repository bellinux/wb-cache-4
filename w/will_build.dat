5|$|Experts {{estimate}} {{that with the}} accession of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would not {{be integrated into the}} Eurasian Union. Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia <b>will</b> <b>build</b> no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E

5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution <b>will</b> <b>build</b> up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|Players {{begin with}} a {{constructed}} town center or a wagon that <b>will</b> <b>build</b> into such, an armed explorer, and a modest number of villagers. Players explore the map and begin gathering resources used to build additional units and buildings and to research upgrades or technologies. Actions such as training units, constructing buildings, killing enemy units etc., earn the player experience points. At certain experience point thresholds, players earn shipments that may be turned in for cards from the player's Home City, which can include units, upgrades, or resources. The game progresses similar to most real-time strategy games until one side resigns.|$|E
5|$|A {{pedestrian}} safety project {{aimed to}} reduce jaywalking will install a dune-style fence in the median of MD 528, {{with the first}} phase to take place between 41st Street/Convention Center Drive and MD 90. Construction on the first phase was expected to begin in January 2017 and be finished by Memorial Day of that year, but was delayed after the only bid came in over the $4.5 million budget. Construction on the first phase, which will run between 26th Street and MD 90, will begin in October 2017 and be completed in May 2018. Future phases <b>will</b> <b>build</b> the fence between 9th Street and 26th Street and between MD 90 and the Delaware border.|$|E

5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he <b>will</b> <b>build</b> Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{developed}} as a method to detect flaws or irregularities in magnetic materials, magnetic particle inspection {{can be used on}} firearms to visualize the serial number underneath the obliterated area. When performing this technique, examiners place the weapon in a magnetic field. The irregularities in the metal, in this case the serial number, cause the field to deform. When a solution of ferrous particles is added to the weapon's magnetized surface they will be attracted to the area where the magnetic field has deformed and <b>will</b> <b>build</b> up in the area. If fluorescent particles are added to the ferrous solution, ultraviolet light {{can be used to make}} it easier to visualize any recovered serial number.|$|E
5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. NASA has already started developing future missions that <b>will</b> <b>build</b> on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E

5|$|There {{are plans}} to improve MD 5 in Prince George's County due to traffic {{congestion}} along the route. An interchange is {{planned to be}} built with MD 373 and Brandywine Road in Brandywine that would widen the route to six lanes {{in the vicinity of}} the proposed interchange. Construction of Phase 1, which widened MD 5 to 6 lanes {{in the vicinity of the}} future interchange, began in November 2009 and was completed in August 2011. Phase 2, which <b>will</b> <b>build</b> the interchange itself, went through the design phase, with construction beginning in 2016 and be completed in 2019. In addition, the route is planned to be upgraded to a full freeway between US 301 and the Capital Beltway, with new interchanges at Burch Hill Road/Earnshaw Drive and Surratts Road. This project is currently in the planning stages with many alternatives including upgrading only portions to freeway, adding reversible lanes or high-occupancy vehicle lanes, and various interchange designs.|$|E
