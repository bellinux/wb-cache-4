5|$|From Gallery Place – Chinatown through Judiciary Square, {{the line}} runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and {{surfaces}} adjacent to Union Station's platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, {{running in a}} unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight railroad tracks straddling the Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the District-Maryland line, through Takoma and past Silver Spring. It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont. There is a maintenance yard between the NoMa and Rhode Island Avenue stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{affinity}} of an antagonist for its {{binding site}} (Ki), i.e. {{its ability to}} bind to a receptor, will determine the duration of inhibition of agonist activity. The affinity of an antagonist can be determined experimentally using Schild regression or for competitive antagonists in radioligand binding studies using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. Schild regression {{can be used to}} determine the nature of antagonism as beginning either competitive or non-competitive and Ki determination is independent of the affinity, efficacy or concentration of the agonist used. However, it is important that equilibrium has been reached. The effects of receptor desensitization on reaching equilibrium must also be taken into account. The affinity constant of antagonists exhibiting two or more effects, such as in competitive neuromuscular-blocking agents that also block ion channels as well as antagonising agonist binding, cannot be analyzed using Schild regression. Schild regression involves comparing the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 {{in the presence of a}} competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve. Altering the amount of antagonist used in the assay can alter the dose ratio. In Schild regression, a plot is made of the log (dose ratio-1) versus the log concentration of antagonist for a range of antagonist concentrations. The affinity or Ki is <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> cuts the x-axis on the regression plot. Whereas, with Schild regression, antagonist concentration is varied in experiments used to derive Ki values from the Cheng-Prusoff equation, agonist concentrations are varied. Affinity for competitive agonists and antagonists is related by the Cheng-Prusoff factor used to calculate the Ki (affinity constant for an antagonist) from the shift in IC50 that occurs during competitive inhibition. The Cheng-Prusoff factor takes into account the effect of altering agonist concentration and agonist affinity for the receptor on inhibition produced by competitive antagonists.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the NHL lockout on January 6, Holtby and Schilling left Hershey for the Washington Capitals, which {{cleared the}} way for goaltender Philipp Grubauer to rejoin the Bears from ECHL's Reading Royals. The end of the lockout was {{believed}} to ultimately benefit Hershey because they retained more of their roster than most other AHL clubs. Tomáš Kundrátek scored two goals for Hershey in their 4–3 win against Bridgeport on January 8, including the unassisted game-winner with 25.6 seconds left in overtime. Dany Sabourin made 35 saves, marking his third straight win as starting goaltender. Hershey's seven-game road winning streak ended with a 1–0 loss to the Penguins on January 11, in which Taffe, Potulny and Evan Barlow all suffered lower body injuries. Despite their absences, the Bears beat Connecticut 4–3 the next day, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of Kalinski, Mitchell and Barry Almeida combined for two goals and six points. Hershey beat the Whale again on January 13 in a 5–0 shutout, scoring four goals in the first period including three power plays, which equaled 11.1 percent of their 27 power plays of the season thus far. Tom Poti scored one of the power play goals; it marked his first game since January 12, 2011 for the Washington Capitals due to a fractured pelvis that threatened to end his career.|$|E
