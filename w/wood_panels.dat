5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, {{under the door}} of the House of Lords, by the wife of one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and <b>wood</b> <b>panels,</b> and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's interior initially {{had dark}} <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> and {{was decorated with}} flowers, oriental rugs on the terrazzo floor, and tables and chairs in the Mission style. In 1959, when the library moved in, local architect and village resident William Anders Sharman planned the building's $2,000 renovation; he later became {{the first president of}} the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society. The station's circular ticket office was replaced by the librarian's desk, bookshelves replaced station furniture, and the baggage room became the children's section. Former library president Theodore R. Malsin dedicated the children's room in memory of his son Donald. From 1959 until 2009, the building housed a main reading room and children's room; a vestibule and second-story balcony were added in 1980.|$|E

40|$|The method {{involves}} {{recording a}} narrow side (2) of the <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> (1) {{with a camera}} device (4) after compression in a continuous hot press. The images acquired by the camera device are evaluated based on {{the thickness of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>panel.</b> The density distribution in the dissolved layer is determined by the thickness of the <b>wood</b> <b>panel.</b> The lighting device (5) and the camera device are arranged in a constant orientation to each other. An independent claim is included for apparatus for determining density distribution in wood material plate. USE: Method for determining density distribution in wood material plate. ADVANTAGE: The density distribution of the wood material plate is calculated effectively, so that quality of wood-based panels is ensured made. The production efficiency of the wood-based panel is improved effectively. The variance in the apparent densities is reduced effectively. The gray value distribution of apparatus is less expensive. The quality of the recordings is improved effectively. The structure of the wood material plate is simple, so that manufacturing cost of the wood material plate is reduced effectively. The drawing shows a perspective view of the wood material plate. 1 : <b>Wood</b> <b>panel</b> 2 : Narrow side of <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> 3 : Main surface of <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> 4 : Camera device 5 : Lighting device...|$|R
40|$|An {{application}} of In-Situ method of measuring {{sound absorption coefficient}} {{on the surface of}} direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> using the concept of ensemble averaged is discussed. The method offer an easier way to measure the absorption performance for each individual aperture of carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> with floral pattern which was replicated from one of the oldest mosque, namely Masjid Abidin located in Terengganu, Malaysia. Two pieces of 20 mm thick of cengal wood (Neobalanocarpus heimii) with 30 % and 40 % perforation ratio were respectively measured in a reverberation room {{in order to determine the}} value of. At lower frequencies (0. 1 kHz- 1. 5 kHz), the measured values of for both direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> with floral pattern (Daun Sireh motif) are shown that the sound absoption for both direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> are in perform level. From the measurements, clearly, the installation of the direct piercing carved <b>wood</b> <b>panel</b> with floral pattern (Daun Sireh motif) in the Masjid Abidin can provide better air circulation and additional natural sunlight, as well as better sound intelligibility inside the building...|$|R
5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new city hall was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, who built the original city hall, the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions in the design and problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an over-run of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new city hall opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> and the concourse's terrazzo flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for city services. The city hall was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star award for energy efficiency. The landscaped plaza was also recognized by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects with a National Merit Award in 2008.|$|E

25|$|For several years, Henri divided {{his time}} between Philadelphia and Paris, where he met the Canadian artist James Wilson Morrice.

25|$|Directly west {{of these}} rooms is the Edwardian Mappin Wing, which {{contains}} the entrance hall. Its walls are partly panelled, partly clad in marble; the lower floor covered in mosaic tile {{and the upper}} with wood. The two levels are connected by a wide, white marble, central stair; to each side, at the upper landing, are marble guards with ornate, Neoclassical balustrades. Across {{from the top of}} the stair is a door (to the reception room) flanked with <b>wood</b> <b>panels</b> documenting the names and escutcheons of each of the governors general for New France, British North America, and Canada. On the opposite wall, to the left of the entrance, is the Royal Window—a stained glass piece commemorating the 40th anniversary of the accession of Elizabeth II to the throne, displaying, between the Queen's Canadian royal standard above and the Great Seal of Canada below, the monarch's coat of arms for Canada surrounded by the shields of each of the provincial coats of arms. Additionally, in the top two corners are images of Elizabeth's royal cypher, balancing out representations of the Sovereign's badges for both the Order of Canada and the Order of Military Merit in the bottom two corners. Another stained glass window is found to the right of the entrance, marking the first appointment of a Canadian-born governor general; the viceregal position is symbolised by a crowned lion holding a maple leaf and surrounded by the shields of the arms of the first seven persons to hold the post. In 2012, bronze and glass handrails, funded by a private donation from Rouge Herald Extraordinary Roger Alexander Lindsay, were added to each side of the stair in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
