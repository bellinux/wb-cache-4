40|$|Beach erosion is a {{major problem}} at coral beaches in Bali, Indonesia, because of the changes in natural {{environment}} and utilization of coastal areas. Survey of sea waves, as joint research works between Japan and Indonesia, was carried out at Sanur beach in Bali, to know what kinds of waves are effective for beach processes. Features of sea waves and their statistic properties, such as shape moduli of the probability density function and the correlation coefficient between <b>wave</b> heights and <b>periods,</b> are investigated by using the data measured. The results are summarized as follows: General features; (1) At Sanur beach the wave direction is unchanged throughout the year, and waves in the dry season (June to August) govern the coastal process and sand movement because of higher wave heights and longer <b>wave</b> <b>periods</b> rather than that in the wet season (December to February). (2) Swell with the period of about 15 seconds, though dissipated by wave breaking {{at the top of the}} coral reef, is significant among wave components penetrating onto Sanur beach.

(2) The relations among the shape modulus for <b>wave</b> <b>periods,</b> the correlation coefficient between <b>wave</b> heights and <b>periods,</b> and the spectral width parameter agree, for incident waves, with the results of Goda (1970) and Kimura (1978).

The measured primary wave height to depth ratio (γ) increases with the <b>wave</b> group <b>period,</b> which is consistent with the observed larger wave height at the breaking location. The primary wave breaking location is also observed at increasing distances with respect to the initial shoreline as the <b>wave</b> group <b>period</b> increases.

Broad bandwith conditions (reduced <b>wave</b> group <b>period)</b> lead to larger dissipation of wave heights at the f 1 component relative to f 2 resulting in a reduction in the wave modulation and primary wave height at the breaking location. Suspended sediment fluxes obtained from collocated velocity and sediment concentration measurements in the surf zone showed a consistently larger contribution of the mean return flow to the suspended sediment fluxes compared with the wave group and primary wave components. The distinct beach profile evolution in terms of bar location is interpreted from an increasing distance of the mean breakpoint location and the location of maximum return flow with respect to the shoreline as the <b>wave</b> group <b>period</b> increases...|$|R
