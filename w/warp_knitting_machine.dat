40|$|Yarns of <b>warp</b> beams to <b>knit</b> on <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension {{variations}} lead {{to produce}} valleys and ridges of warp yarns on the beam and hence different lengths of individual warp yarns. These length variations lead to loop length variations in <b>warp</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp length variations caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted. Tension variations of individual warp yarns on warp beams for <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> were examined. 16 % of warp yarns were outside the permissible tension range in practical environment. The length measurements of 1128 individual yarns of a warp beam show that 0 - 1. 7 % length variations exist among the yarns.

40|$|On the {{assumption}} that grid-like knitted fabrics from flax fibres should be embedded in light-weight concrete, cellular concrete and plaster, investigations were performed on various yarns from flax fibres under near-practical conditions (pH-value 12, temperature 80 - 190 C, storage time up to 10 hours). At increasing temperature and storage {{time there was a}} different decrease of the maximum tensile force in connection with a reduction of the other testing features (Tt, EpsH, fibre length) according to the texture and fineness of the flax yarns. It was proved that yarns from flax fibres and flax tows can be processed on <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> (raschel <b>knitting</b> <b>machines,</b> stitch-bonding and small circular <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machines)</b> to <b>knitted</b> grids with different mesh sizes and net mesh structures without problems. Surprisingly it was found that there was nearly no degradation at the immersion in alkali for net grids with mesh legs of a high packing density. Single tests for the reinforcement of test beams from light-weight concrete and plaster were performed with the producted knittted grids. The bending tensile tests with light-weight concrete (cement mortar with light-weight aggregates) result in a slight increase of the bending tensile strength and with cellular concrete partly in a substantial increase of the same. The reinforcing tests with plaster did not result in an increase of the bending tensile strength. For all reinforced variants a distinct reduction of the crack propagation was determined. Fundamental informations on the adhesive bond and the concrete compatibility were obtained. Due to the shortened time for the subject matter systematic repeat tests were not possible so that a statistical assurance {{of the results of the}} reinforcing tests can only be attained in a later timeSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1176 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|R

Traditionally, fabric inspection to assure textile quality is done by humans, however, in the past years, researchers have paid attention to PC-based automatic inspection systems to improve the detection efficiency. This paper proposes a novel automatic inspection scheme for the <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> using smart visual sensors. The proposed system consists of multiple smart visual sensors and a controller. Each sensor can scan 800 mm width of web, and can work independently. The following are considered in dealing with broken-end defects caused by a single yarn: first, a smart visual sensor is composed of a powerful DSP processor and a 2 -megapixel high definition image sensor. Second, a wavelet transform is used to decompose fabric images, and an improved direct thresholding method based on high frequency coefficients is proposed.

40|$|Textile {{process and}} textile {{structures}} that {{are suitable for}} composites are carefully studied and chosen to have weft knitted fabrics. The aim {{of this research is}} to knit the carbon and Dyneema® fibres in circular weft knitting to fit contour shapes. Carbon/Dyneema® can also be <b>knitted</b> in <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> to get properties in multi axial direction. But the fabric was flat and can be used only for 2 D shape products which are having less drapabiity. According to previous research, weft knitting is the best suitable for complex preforms. Before knitting these fibres properties were studied {{in order to avoid the}} damage to the carbon fibres. The carbon fibres have high bending rigidity, low resistance to friction and are very brittle. A small damage to the carbon fibre in knitting subsequently affect directly on the composite properties. The strongest manmade fibre manufactured till date is Dyneema® and these fibres could be used in composites due to its performance, properties and light weight. But, the Dyneema® fibres are expensive when compared to common polyester, so polyester fibres are used to compare the properties and cost performance ratio. The critical bending of the carbon fibres causes friction between the fibres and also between fibre and machine. This was considered carefully during the knitting of carbon fibres and the idea chosen is mentioned in this thesis. Between the two layers of Dyneema®/polyester, carbon fibres are laid circularly in unidirectional and in un-crimped condition. This makes the carbon yarn to possess good mechanical properties. The 2 layers of Dyneema®/polyester fibres exchange the loops at certain points to increase the inter-laminar strength and decrease the carbon fibre distortion. This structure helps to withstand external load. It is also lighter than the carbon composite with additional properties. This makes much more space in the future for the Dyneema® fibres in the 3 D carbon composite manufacturing. The internal carbon fibres are fully covered by the Dyneema® fibres to withstand the external impact load and not to damage the carbon fibres. So the loop length, stitch density, fibre volume fractions are considered before knitting...|$|R

A series of warp-knitted spacer fabrics was produced on a double-needle bar Raschel <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> by varying their structural parameters, including spacer monofilament inclination and fineness, fabric thickness, and surface layer structure. A drop-weight impact tester was used to test these fabrics with predefined impact energy. The impact process of a typical spacer fabric was analyzed based on its impact contact force-displacement curve, energy absorbed-contact force curve and transmitted force-time curve. The effects of the structural parameters on the impact compressive behavior of the warp-knitted spacer fabrics were also discussed. The relationship between the peak transmitted force and peak contact force was established for these fabrics.

This thesis describes original engineering research which aimed to establish fundamental understanding of various textile processes and to search for solutions to the associated problems. First, the particulars of the candidate are given, followed by a list of the publications included in the submission and the summary of each paper detailing the aims and achievements of the work. In this thesis, contributions in the following areas are described: 1. Air-jet texturing and intermingling: this section, which contains nearly half of the papers, reports the research in the field of air-jet texturing of continuous filament yarns and intermingling of false-twist textured yarns. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the supersonic air flow, its interaction with the filament yarn and the effect of process parameters on the properties of the textured yarn are reported. This research established a clear understanding of the mechanism of the loop and entanglement formation in the air-jet texturing and the air-intermingling processes. Improvements to both processes have been suggested and more efficient and cost effective nozzles have been designed and evaluated. 2. Yarn characterisation: development of digital image processing and analysis techniques for objective, non-invasive and accurate assessment of the structural properties of the air-jet textured yarns is reported. The research has been extended to include the measurement of nip frequency and regularity of the air-intermingled yarns, as well as the yarn hairiness, evenness and twist of the conventional spun yarns. 3. 	Water-jet and thermal bonding of nonwovens: experimental research into the nonwoven fabric formation using very fine high-pressure water jets and modelling of the thermal bonding of fibrous webs by passing hot-air flow through them, mostly in collaboration with North Carolina State University, are reported. Models developed provide an essential tool for more efficient process, product and machine design. 4. 	Finally, this short section reports various other textile engineering research including the use of pulse lasers to fuse false-twist textured yarns to impart fused nodes (nips), the fibre opening, straightening and transportation using high-speed air flow in the open-end spinning process, and the design, development and construction of a novel circular <b>warp</b> <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> The interrelationship between the publications is explained and reference to the work of the others in the field is given where appropriate.
