40|$|In {{order to}} survive in today’s {{business}} world {{it is necessary to}} win contracts. If companies fail to do this then their existence is threatened. Therefore, the manner in which companies conduct their contract winning activities become of paramount importance. Much focus in software engineering research and academic literature centres around the post-contract winning activities, such as project planning, costing and scheduling. The emphasis on the contract <b>winning</b> <b>process,</b> though not neglected, is quite small in comparison. There exists a need for more research in this interesting area and this thesis aims to partly address this need. Consequently, the main focus of this research is the contract <b>winning</b> <b>process.</b> The approach used to investigate this area consisted of a theoretical study followed by an empirical study, where eight small development companies were interviewed. The findings show that a uniform formal process does not exist for winning and negotiating contracts. As a result of these findings, from both the theoretical and empirical studies, a contract <b>winning</b> <b>process</b> model for small development companies was formulated. The proposed model consists of five sequential stages with recommended activities for each stage. The model is intended for small software engineering development companies but because the model is generic it could also be used by non-software companies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution to}} the well-known problem of synchronization in a distributed asynchronous system prone to process crashes. This problem is also known as the Test&Set problem. The Test&Set is a distributed synchronization protocol that, when invoked by a set of processes, returns a unique <b>winning</b> <b>process.</b> This unique process is then allowed to use, for instance, a shared resource. Recently many advances in implementing Test&Set objects have been achieved, however all of them uniquely target the shared memory model. In this paper we propose an implementation of a Test&Set object for a message passing distributed system. This implementation can be invoked by any number n ≤ N of processes where N is the total number of processes in the system. We show in this paper, using a Markov model, that our implementation has an expected step complexity in O(log n) and we give an explicit formula for the distribution of the number of steps needed to solve the problem. We also analyze the expected value and the distribution of the number of operations invoked by the n processes to determine the <b>winning</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} a Poisson race {{model for the}} analysis of the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Four independent and parallel Poisson processes are assumed, one for each category of the IAT. Information about specific characteristics of the stimuli accumulates on the counter of each process until a termination criterion is reached and a response is given. Model parameters are the rates of information accumulation, and the amount of information that is needed before a response is given. The model accounts for both reaction time and response accuracy. The former is determined by the time at which a process wins. The latter depends on the <b>winning</b> <b>process,</b> the category of the presented stimulus, and the kind of block.

40|$|Concurrent {{systems in}} which there is a known upper bound Δ on memory access time are considered. Two prototypical {{synchronization}} problems, mutual exclusion and consensus, are studied and solutions that have constant (i. e. independent of Δ and the total number of processes) time complexity in the absence of contention are presented. For mutual exclusion, in the absence of contention, a process needs only five accesses to the shared memory to enter its critical section, and in the presence of contention, the <b>winning</b> <b>process</b> may need to delay itself for 4 ΔΔ time units. For consensus, in absence of contention, a process decides after four accesses to the shared memory, and in the presence of contention, it may need to delay itself for Δ time units. 1 Introduction The possibility and complexity of synchronization in a distributed environment depends heavily on timing assumptions. In the asynchronous model no timing assumptions are made about the relative speeds [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Hazelwood Mine is an {{open cut}} coal mine, and to {{maintain}} the Mine stability while mining is in progress it is required to carry out depressurisation of two major aquifer systems- Morwell formation aquifer system (M 1) and Traralgon formation aquifer system(M 2).

In the assessment {{and management of the}} environmental impacts due to groundwater extraction from these two major aquifer systems regional groundwater monitoring, ground modelling and reporting has been undertaken. In addition land level monitoring is carried out every 5 years to estimate land subsidence due to groundwater extraction.

40|$|Pottery plays a very {{important}} role in the indigenous culture of the various ethnic groups in Ghana. At Kpando in the Volta Region, the art of pottery making, the meaning and uses of the artefacts are enshrined in some deep philosophies that permeate the socio-cultural life of the people. However, the rich theoretical and cultural components of the art have not been fully documented, and are not well understood and appreciated. This knowledge gap has rendered this cultural landmark almost invisible in cultural anthropology and native art. This study therefore provides an intellectual review of indigenous pottery production at Kpando with the view to unearth their role in the social sustainability of the indigenous people. The paper takes a critical look at the ontology of the art, clay <b>winning</b> <b>process,</b> pottery production, their usage and associated taboos. The descriptive method of qualitative research was employed for the study.
