40|$|Genuine lexical <b>writing</b> <b>assistants</b> <b>that</b> {{attempt to}} detect lexical errors such as miscollocations are {{traditionally}} less common in Computer Assisted Language Learning than spell and grammar checkers. However, there is empirical {{evidence of the}} importance of capturing and correcting miscollocations in the writings of language learners, and therefore an increasing number of proposals deals with the detection of errors in collocations and the delivery of lists of correction suggestions. However, very few of these proposals take into account the varying ease with which learners can master different collocation and miscollocation types, or the fact that some collocation type errors might be more common than others, given <b>that</b> a <b>writing</b> <b>assistant</b> should be capable of handling at least the most common types of miscollocation. Furthermore, existing proposals explore collocation error-specific strategies, implicitly assuming that with one universal strategy all types of miscollocations can be detected and corrected. Our preliminary study, conducted on Spanish and French material, highlights one type of collocation in which learners err the most: support verb constructions (SVCs). To account for this, we explore a SVC-specific collocation error detection and correction strategy...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) {{has evolved}} sig- nificantly {{over the past}} years and reached a mature stage {{offering}} plenty of operators to solve complex data analysis tasks. User support for build- ing data analysis workflows, however, has not progressed sufficiently: the large number of operators currently available in KDD systems and in- teractions between these operators complicates successful data analysis. To help Data Miners we enhanced one of the most used open source data mining tools—RapidMiner—with semantic technologies. Specifi- cally, we first annotated all elements involved in the Data Mining (DM) process—the data, the operators, models, data mining tasks, and KDD workflows—semantically using our eProPlan modelling tool that allows to describe operators and build a task/method decomposition grammar to specify the desired workflows embedded in an ontology. Second, we enhanced RapidMiner to employ these semantic annotations to actively support data analysts. Third, we built an Intelligent Discovery <b>Assistant,</b> eIda, <b>that</b> <b>leverages</b> the semantic annotation as well as HTN planning to automatically support KDD process generation. We found that the use of Semantic Web approaches and technologies in the KDD domain helped us to lower the barrier to data analysis. We also found that using a generic ontology editor overwhelmed KDD-centric users. We, therefore, provided them with problem-centric extensions to Protege. Last and most surprising, we found that our semantic modeling of the KDD domain served as a rapid prototyping approach for several hard-coded improvements of RapidMiner, namely correctness checking of workflows and quick-fixes, reinforcing the finding that even a little semantic modeling {{can go a long way}} in improving the understanding of a domain even for domain experts...|$|R

Eighteen Oregon State University undergraduate and graduate students were greeted in one of three ways by two confederates: with a handshake and verbal introduction, with a verbal introduction only, or with a quick greeting without the handshake or verbal introduction.

The Modigliani-Miller arbitrage argument holds, since investors can always undo the leverage of the firm, even when markets are not complete. Whether leverage can increase the value of the firm under incomplete markets is still an open issue. ...|$|R
