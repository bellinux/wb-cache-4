25|$|Kim Bobo founded Interfaith Worker Justice in 1991 as Chicago Interfaith Committee on Worker Issues. Bobo had {{previously}} been director of organizing at Bread for the World and an instructor at the Midwest Academy. In 1989, Bobo became involved with workers' rights campaigns for coal miners. She <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> find that almost no religious organizations had labor liaisons. She started an informal network of religious leaders to share information about campaigns for worker justice that year.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} his naval stint in Honolulu that Granger {{had his first}} sexual experiences, one with a hostess at a private club {{and the other with}} a Navy officer visiting the same venue, both on the same night. He <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} he was attracted to both men and women equally, and in his memoir he observed, [...] "I finally {{came to the conclusion that}} for me, everything I had done that night was as natural and as good as it felt... I never have felt the need to belong to any exclusive, self-defining, or special group... I was never ashamed, and I never felt the need to explain or apologize for my relationships to anyone.... I have loved men. I have loved women." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Matsumoto {{suffered}} {{the last of}} a series of strokes, and was hospitalized, never to fully regain consciousness again. The stylish Matsumoto had been famously fastidious throughout his life, and his daughter, Meiko, has written that she <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> notice that on his hospital bed, where Matsumoto lay unconscious and barely responsive, he had been using his remaining good hand to remove the pills that had formed on the old hospital blanket. Furthermore, although doctors said he had lost his sight, Matsumoto would open his eyes, and, as if looking in a mirror, would straighten the hairs of his mustache with his fingers as he had habitually done for years. [...] Matsumoto {{died at the age of}} 81. His cremated remains are interred in the Fuji Cemetery in Gotemba, Shizuoka, at the foot of Mount Fuji.|$|E

2500|$|Riis had {{for some}} time been {{wondering}} how to show the squalor of which he wrote more vividly than his words could express. He tried sketching, but was incompetent at this. Camera lenses of the 1880s were slow as was the emulsion of photographic plates; photography thus {{did not seem to}} be of any use for reporting about conditions of life in dark interiors. In early 1887, however, Riis <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> read that [...] "a way had been discovered to take pictures by flashlight. The darkest corner might be photographed that way." [...] The German innovation, by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke, flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability; the powder was used in a pistol-like device that fired cartridges. [...] This was the introduction of flash photography.|$|E
2500|$|Greenwich and Barry {{began dating}} after his {{marriage}} was annulled, but musically they continued separate careers. Still in college, in 1962, Greenwich {{got her first}} break in the business when she traveled to the Brill Building to meet John Gluck, Jr., one of the composers of the Lesley Gore hit [...] "It's My Party". Needing to keep another appointment, Gluck installed Greenwich in an office {{and asked her to}} wait. The office turned out to be that of songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Hearing piano music from the cubicle, Leiber poked his head in and, expecting Carole King, <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> see Greenwich, who introduced herself and explained her reasons for being there. Recognizing her potential as a songwriter, Leiber and Stoller agreed to allow her to use their facilities as she wished in exchange for first refusal on songs she wrote. They eventually signed Greenwich to their publishing company, Trio Music, as a staff songwriter.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of Sunday, 26 November, two days after he had {{convinced}} the nurses {{to remain on the}} job, Margaret <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> hear her husband's voice sound heavily congested. [...] He told her that he had a [...] "terrible flu". [...] The next morning, he and Sister Maria agreed that he had malaria. [...] "We said malaria, but we thought Ebola," [...] she later said. [...] His fever grew worse through the day, a Monday, and by Wednesday was vomiting and Dr. Pierre Rollin of the CDC took blood samples for testing. [...] A nurse who was administering an intravenous drip that evening at his home was surprised when he began speaking distinctly, though not to her: [...] "Oh, God, I think I will die in my service. [...] If I die, let me be the last." [...] Then, in a clear voice, he sang [...] "Onward, Christian Soldiers". Rollin came back with the results the next morning; it was Ebola. [...] Lukwiya immediately asked to be put into the isolation ward, stating [...] "Since I am the boss, I should show an example." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{called by}} one's Christian name like that, {{and by a}} {{complete}} stranger, too; but I was getting quite accustomed now to these little incongruities.|$|R
60|$|They <b>were</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> {{hear him}} speak {{in quite a}} new voice, with a Yankee shrillness in it; all his {{grandeur}} and good English had fallen from him like a cloak.|$|R
5000|$|Maggie Stewart {{brings a}} water-and-oil motion {{sculpture}} {{to the television}} house. Jay Styperk, a wheelchair basketball specialist, gives Rogers a few exercises. The Neighborhood of Make-Believe <b>is</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> see Lady Elaine has turned the Eiffel Tower upside down.|$|R
2500|$|The light {{infantry}} rallied on the 5th Foot and 55th Foot, but {{the three}} British units were soon forced to withdraw. When the British army commander General Sir William Howe {{appeared on the scene}} he <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> see his crack light infantry fleeing before the American advance. He yelled, [...] "For shame, Light Infantry! I never saw you retreat before. Form! Form! It is only a scouting party". After nearly being cut down by a blast of grape shot, Howe and his staff quickly rode off. The 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade soon struck a picket of the 46th Foot and swept it before them. Soon Wayne's men became anxious because fighting at the Chew House erupted several hundred yards in their rear. Isolated in the fog, Wayne ordered an about-face and his two brigades began to move back toward the noise of battle. The 2nd Brigade, now on the division's right, blundered into part of Major General Adam Stephen's division moving forward. In a tragic friendly fire incident, Stephen's men opened fire and the Pennsylvanians returned fire. Wayne's soldiers, fired on by their friends and confused by the fog, panicked and took to their heels. They finally rallied [...] from the battlefield.|$|E

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> have so faint {{an answer}} on knocking, and on {{entering}} the room, she saw Sophy {{lying on her}} bed, upon her back, with her arms by her sides, and with a ghastly whiteness on her features.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so quick, Martell!" [...] {{came from}} the doorway, and then both of the youths <b>were</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> see {{themselves}} confronted by Bob Nixon. Behind the chauffeur stood Captain Dale, while in another doorway appeared the form of Professor Brice.|$|R
60|$|He checked abruptly, startled. Andre-Louis, {{suddenly}} {{realizing what}} was afoot, and how duped he had been, had loosed his laughter. The {{sound of it}} pealing and booming uncannily under the great roof that so immediately confined him <b>was</b> <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> those below.|$|R
60|$|But--seated {{upon the}} stump, she <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper. He had black prick ears and sandy colored whiskers.|$|E
60|$|And there I <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> {{see what}} I {{took to be}} a wild man, with unkempt beard and ragged hair, {{pursuing}} a giant butterfly with brilliant wings.|$|E
60|$|When she had {{finished}} her meal, {{and was about to}} go back to the road of yellow brick, she <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> hear a deep groan near by.|$|E

50|$|Rudy sets a {{trap and}} Doc <b>is</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> see him alive. He knocks out Rudy but resists killing him in cold blood. A long and bloody gunfight ensues with Doc and Carol {{shooting}} {{it out with}} Benyon's men in the halls and stairwells of the hotel.|$|R
6000|$|Grisell {{had listened}} intently, {{absorbed in the}} narrative, so losing {{personal}} thought and feeling that it <b>was</b> <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> her to perceive that Dame Gresford was trying to hush a rude laugh, {{and one of the}} young squires was saying, [...] "Hush, hush! for very shame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to be}} of use, to count," [...] said Mrs. Brocklehurst,--and Janet <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> {{hear from}} this woman's lips the very echo of her own desires.|$|E
60|$|When, {{after making}} other arrangements, Martha {{went back to}} the bedroom, she <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> hear the sick woman muttering to herself, or perhaps because she had {{forgotten}} Martha's absence.|$|E
60|$|And it chanced that as I {{emerged from}} the hollies by {{the corner of the}} {{shrubbery}} I <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> come unexpectedly upon a young man in evening dress smoking a cigar.|$|E
2500|$|.....it <b>is</b> <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> {{read the}} words of Werner Best, {{one of the top}} {{officials}} in Hitler's secret police, the Gestapo, explaining in 1935 why the Nazi regime would not allow concentration camp prisoners like Hans Litten to have lawyers: [...] "The forms of procedure of the justice system are, under present conditions, absolutely inadequate for the struggle against enemies of the state." [...] It <b>is</b> also <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> read that some of the tortures inflicted on Litten and his fellow prisoners – mock shootings, [...] "stress positions" [...] – were the same as those used at Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo.|$|R
60|$|In some way, she was {{not afraid}} of him at all. In some other way she used him as a mere magic implement, used him with the most amazing priestess-craft. Himself, the {{individual}} man which he was, this she treated with an indifference that <b>was</b> <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Anyway, he was perfect, as Dona Rita had declared. The {{only thing}} {{unsatisfactory}} (and even inexplicable) about our Dominic was his nephew, Cesar. It <b>was</b> <b>startling</b> <b>to</b> see a desolate expression of shame veil the remorseless audacity {{in the eyes}} of that man superior to all scruples and terrors.|$|R
60|$|Johnnie was wont {{to go on}} in this dreamy {{way without}} expecting an answer; but he <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> see his father's face hidden by the shadowy fingers that propped his forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a tragic}} tone was that last, Miriam!" [...] said the sculptor; and, looking into her face, he <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> behold it pale and tear-stained. [...] "How {{suddenly}} this mood has come over you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{could live}} here always!' he said, {{and with such}} a tone and look of {{unconscious}} revelation that Elfride <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> find that her harmonies had fired a small Troy, {{in the shape of}} Stephen's heart. She said quickly: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{cause of}} his sudden {{stopping}} <b>was</b> <b>startling</b> enough <b>to</b> have disconcerted a much older performer.|$|R

60|$|Soon, {{however, they}} <b>were</b> <b>startled</b> <b>to</b> hear a silvery peal of {{laughter}} answering their own, {{and turning to}} see whence the sound proceeded, they found seated near them a creature so beautiful that at once the three pairs of eyes opened to their widest extent, and three hearts beat much faster than before.|$|R
