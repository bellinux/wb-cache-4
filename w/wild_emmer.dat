50|$|Because of the {{usefulness}} of wheat glutens, genetic studies have largely focused on wheat genetics. Wheat has three genomes (AABBDD) and it can encode for many variations of the same protein, even in the gliadin subcategories many types of gliadin per cultivar, X = genome (A, B, or D genome chromosomes (1 to 7)). The A and B genomes are derived from <b>wild</b> <b>emmers</b> wheat {{which in turn is}} a natural digenomic species that contains a Triticum monococcum- and Aegilops speltoides-like genome.

The region's dramatic variety of elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight Neolithic founder crops important in early agriculture (i.e. <b>wild</b> progenitors to <b>emmer</b> wheat, einkorn, barley, flax, chick pea, pea, lentil, bitter vetch), and {{four of the five}} most important species of domesticated animals—cows, goats, sheep, and pigs—and the fifth species, the horse, lived nearby.|$|R
5000|$|Tell Aswad {{occupies}} a special {{location in the}} central Levant as a connecting region between northern and southern expansions of agriculture. Apparently a stronger trade relation is present to the southern cultures, although they had many things {{in common with the}} cultures that existed in the northern Levant. It is an example of one of the oldest sites of agriculture with domesticated emmer wheat dated by Willem van Zeist and his assistant Johanna Bakker-Heeres to 8800 BC. Peter Akkermans and Glenn Schwatrz suggested on this evidence that Tell Aswad shows [...] "the earliest systematic exploitation of domesticated cereals (emmer wheat) c. 9000-8500 BC". They suggest that the arrival of domesticated grain came from somewhere in the vicinity of [...] "the basaltic highlands of the Jawlan (Golan) and Hawran". The claim is based on the discovery of enlarged grains, absences of wild grains and on the presumption that the site was beyond the usual habitat of the <b>wild</b> variety of <b>emmer</b> wheat. The earliest postulated evidence for einkorn wheat at Jericho was not dated until at least five hundred years later than Aswad's emmer. Flax seeds were also present. Fruit, figs and pistachios, were apparently very popular because they were found in large quantities. Stationary containers of mud and stone were found with carbonized grain found on the interior of one designating them as silos. Finally, reeds were widely used, especially as reinforcement in the architecture, but also for mats and baskets and perhaps as bedding or fodder.|$|R
25|$|Strong {{similarities}} in morphology and genetics show that <b>wild</b> <b>emmer</b> (Triticum dicoccoides Koern.) is the wild ancestor and a crop wild relative of domesticated emmer.

40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} in durum wheat, Triticum turgidum durum, has been strongly reduced since the domestication {{of the wild}} Triticum turgidum dicoccoides. Monitoring durum wheat composite crosses incorporating related tetraploid taxa, such as <b>wild</b> and domesticated <b>emmer</b> wheat, is a suitable evolutionary pre-breeding method. Transcriptome sequencing paves {{the way for a}} genomic survey of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating in such populations, offering the possibility of genotyping by sequencing to use these resources in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) programs. Evolutionary Pre-breeding pOpulation (EPO) is an evolutionary durum wheat pre-breeding population. Sequencing the transcriptome of 179 durum wheat lines (175 from EPO) led to the detection of 103, 262 SNPs on two reference transcriptomes: one from the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium and one assembled de novo on durum wheat. Using strict filtering to remove dubious heterozygous SNPs, EPO {{genetic diversity}} was eventually described with 76, 188 high-confidence SNPs. The percentage of missing genotyping data depended on the expression level, and 88 individuals out of 175 were genotyped per SNP on average. Using the 3 B pseudo-molecule of bread wheat, the transcription and diversity levels were shown to be higher in distal regions than in proximal regions, but SNPs were available throughout the chromosomes. Assuming good synteny with Hordeum, the trend was similar on the 14 chromosomes of the durum wheat genome. EPO hosts a high level of diversity, has a number of SNPs in low linkage disequilibrium (< 40 Mb) and would be well suited for GWAS and GS programs...|$|R
40|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} and population genetic {{structure of a}} collection of 230 accessions of seven tetraploid Triticum turgidum L. subspecies were investigated using six morphological, nine seed storage protein loci, 26 SSRs and 970 DArT markers. The genetic diversity of the morphological traits and seed storage proteins was always lower in the durum wheat compared to the <b>wild</b> and domesticated <b>emmer.</b> Using Bayesian clustering (K = 2), both of the sets of molecular markers distinguished the durum wheat cultivars from the other tetraploid subspecies, and two distinct subgroups were detected within the durum wheat subspecies, which is in agreement with their origin and year of release. The genetic diversity of morphological traits and seed storage proteins was always lower in the improved durum cultivars registered after 1990, than in the intermediate and older ones. This marked effect on diversity was not observed for molecular markers, where there was only a weak reduction. At K > 2, the SSR markers showed a greater degree of resolution than for DArT, with their identification of a greater number of groups within each subspecies. Analysis of DArT marker differentiation between the wheat subspecies indicated outlier loci that are potentially linked to genes controlling some important agronomic traits. Among the 211 loci identified under selection, 109 markers were recently mapped, and some of these markers were clustered into specific regions on chromosome arms 2 BL, 3 BS and 4 AL, where several genes/quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are involved in the domestication of tetraploid wheats, such as the tenacious glumes (Tg) and brittle rachis (Br) characteristics. On the basis of these results, it can be assumed that the population structure of the tetraploid wheat collection partially reflects the evolutionary history of Triticum turgidum L. subspecies and the genetic potential of landraces and wild accessions for the detection of unexplored alleles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Patterns {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} between and within natural plant populations and their driving forces are {{of great interest}} in evolutionary biology. However, {{few studies have been}} performed on the genetic structure and population divergence in <b>wild</b> <b>emmer</b> wheat using a large number of EST-related single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. 				 				 					 						Results 					In the present study, twenty-five natural <b>wild</b> <b>emmer</b> wheat populations representing a wide range of ecological conditions in Israel and Turkey were used. Genetic diversity and genetic structure were investigated using over 1, 000 SNP markers. A moderate level of genetic diversity was detected due to the biallelic property of SNP markers. Clustering based on Bayesian model showed that grouping pattern is related to the geographical distribution of the <b>wild</b> <b>emmer</b> wheat. However, genetic differentiation between populations was not necessarily dependent on the geographical distances. A total of 33 outlier loci under positive selection were identified using a F 						 							ST 						-outlier method. Significant correlations between loci and ecogeographical factors were observed. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Natural selection appears {{to play a major role}} in generating adaptive structures in <b>wild</b> <b>emmer</b> wheat.

Twenty two <b>wild</b> <b>emmer</b> wheat accessions, representing a wide range of drought resistance capacity, as well as two durum wheat cultivars were examined under two contrasting irrigation regimes (well-watered control and water-limited), for grain yield, total biomass production and grain Zn, Fe and protein concentrations.
