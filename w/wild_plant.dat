5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. Bilberry, a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E
5|$|A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led {{to rapid}} {{depopulation}} {{in many parts}} of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure.|$|E

A single plant of lesser meadow-rue is present in the gorge. Bristol rock-cress occurs here, and at nearby Penpole Point; in the gorge, there are about 3,000 plants on the Bristol side, and about 2,000 below Leigh Woods. Hutchinsia is found on both sides of the gorge. Bloody crane's-bill grows on the Bristol side of the gorge, where it is believed to be native. Little robin occurs on both sides of the gorge. Spiked speedwell grows on both sides of the gorge: the first British record of this plant was from the gorge, in 1641.|$|E

40|$|Wild {{foods are}} {{ubiquitous}} motivational tools for teaching botany, environmental education, cultural foodways and survival. Few motivational tools involve humans so intimately {{as those used}} for oral stimulation, sustenance, and/or survival. The purpose of this workshop is to revisit a traditional content area and educational vehicle for experiential educators. In my experience, in the right context, edible <b>wild</b> <b>plants</b> provide an exciting content and motivational topic for persons in experiential education situations. They provide an allure, an intrigue, a connection with our more earthly selves, {{a chance to play}} at or be a more confident and competent provider/survivor, a way to develop one more kind of independence, and a means to supplement our conventional food sources. This paper is intended to provide a common sense discussion of the potential for using the topic of edible <b>wild</b> <b>plants</b> to experientially engage students in a variety of topic areas.

25|$|Regardless of {{specific}} chronology, many European Neolithic groups share basic characteristics, such as living in small-scale, family-based communities, subsisting on domesticated {{plants and animals}} supplemented with the collection of <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> foods and with hunting, and producing hand-made pottery, that is, pottery made without the potter's wheel. Polished stone axes {{lie at the heart}} of the neolithic (new stone) culture, enabling forest clearance for agriculture and production of wood for dwellings, as well as fuel.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife {{includes}} all non-domesticated plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> {{and animal species}} for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has {{a major impact on}} the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas—including the most developed urban sites—all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} a broad, {{leathery}} pod, green maturing to blackish-brown, with a densely downy surface; {{in the wild}} species, the pods are 5–10cm long and 1cm diameter, but many modern cultivars developed for food use have pods 15–25cm long and 2–3cm thick. Each pod contains 3–8 seeds, round to oval and 5–10mm diameter in the <b>wild</b> <b>plant,</b> usually flattened and up to 20–25mm long, 15mm broad and 5–10mm thick in food cultivars.

25|$|The region {{surrounding}} Chibuene {{through the}} course of its occupation was a site of dramatic transformations of vegetation cover and climactic shifts. Pollen diagrams deriving from the surrounding lakes of Nhaucati and Xiroche revealed extensive landscape transformations from riverine forests to mostly savannah in the present day. As a result, the individual inhabitants employed a variety of adaptive strategies in order to procure adequate resources for survival. These included agriculture, keeping of domesticated animals, collecting of <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> food stuff, and making use of their position close to the coast by exploiting marine flora and fauna. The site illustrated nearly 1600 years of such strategies.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} theory that {{suggests}} pastoralism evolved from hunting and gathering. Hunters of wild goats and sheep were knowledgeable about herd mobility {{and the needs}} of the animals. Such hunters were mobile and followed the herds on their seasonal rounds. Undomesticated herds were chosen to become more controllable for the proto-pastoralist nomadic hunter and gatherer groups by taming and domesticating them. Hunter-gatherers' strategies in the past have been very diverse and contingent upon the local environment conditions, like those of mixed farmers. Foraging strategies have included hunting or trapping big game and smaller animals, fishing, collecting shellfish or insects, and gathering <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> foods such as fruits, seeds, and nuts. These diverse strategies for survival amongst the migratory herds could also provide an evolutionary route towards nomadic pastoralism.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture was {{introduced}} to the region around 400 AD to the present. Poor soil and the unreliability of rainfall reduced the viability of agriculture as a reliable subsistence pattern. Throughout the course of the occupation of Chibuene, the inhabitants practiced a broad subsistence economy with the utilization of domestic animals, marine fauna, and <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> life to augment agricultural production. Of particular significance to the site was the distinctive emphasis on marine fauna in the diets of the inhabitants. The 1995 excavations from a Swedish sponsored team revealed a rather high proportion of fish remains in comparison to sites in South Africa. The faunal remains of shark and turtle were notable features of the site. Shark fishing and turtle hunting are subsistence strategies more associated with East African, or Swahili coast, sites beginning in the first millennium, revealing a closer affinity of Chibuene to sites further north than the southern interior.|$|E
25|$|His {{second and}} best known popular science book, , was {{published}} in 1997. It asks why Eurasian peoples conquered or displaced Native Americans, Australians, and Africans, instead of vice versa. It argues that this outcome was not due to biological advantages of Eurasian peoples themselves but instead to features of the Eurasian continent, in particular, its high diversity of <b>wild</b> <b>plant</b> and animal species suitable for domestication and its east/west major axis that favored the spread of those domesticates, people, and technologies for long distances with little change in latitude. The {{first part of the}} book focuses on reasons why only a few species of wild plants and animals proved suitable for domestication. The second part discusses how local food production based on those domesticates {{led to the development of}} dense and stratified human populations, writing, centralized political organization, and epidemic infectious diseases. The third part compares the development of food production and of human societies among different continents and world regions. Guns, Germs, and Steel became an international best-seller, was translated into 33 languages, and received several awards, including a Pulitzer Prize, an Aventis Prize for Science Books and the 1997 Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science. A television documentary series based on the book was produced by the National Geographic Society in 2005.|$|E
