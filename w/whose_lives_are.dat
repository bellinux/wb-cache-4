5|$|Von Stroheim {{did not see}} Greed as {{political}} and told a journalist that he considered it {{to be like a}} Greek tragedy. Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner falling in love with an aristocrat or royal.|$|E

500|$|Though it largely escaped {{notice when}} first published, Holmes {{eventually}} {{came under attack}} by two distinguished professors of obstetrics—Hugh L. Hodge and Charles D.

In a new introduction, in which Holmes directly addressed his opponents, he wrote: [...] "I had rather rescue one mother from being poisoned by her attendant, than claim to have saved forty out of fifty patients to whom I had carried the disease." [...] He added, [...] "I beg to be heard in behalf of the women <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> at stake, until some stronger voice shall plead for them."

500|$|In 2014, Sharma {{established}} her {{own production}} company named Clean Slate Films, whose first release was Navdeep Singh's thriller NH10 (2015), {{in which she}} also played the lead role.

In preparation for the role, Sharma underwent interval training for three months in order to build stamina and remain fit. Writing for NDTV, critic Saibal Chatterjee found the film to be a [...] "taut and riveting thriller" [...] and praised Sharma for [...] "conveying a range of moods as she moves from the vulnerable to the fearless in a battle in which the odds are stacked heavily against her", and Prarthana Sarkar of International Business Times credited her for [...] "breaking the 'Miss Bubbly' stereotype".

500|$|In 1942, deHavilland {{appeared}} in Elliott Nugent's romantic comedy The Male Animal with Henry Fonda, about an idealistic professor fighting for academic freedom {{while trying to}} hold onto his job and his wife Ellen. While her role was not particularly challenging, deHavilland's delineation of an intelligent, good-natured woman trying to resolve the unsettling circumstances of her life played a major part in the film's success, according to Tony Thomas. The film was a critical and commercial success, with Bosley Crowther of The Times noting that deHavilland [...] "concocts a delightfully pliant and saucy character as the wife". That year, she also {{appeared in}} John Huston's drama In This Our Life with Bette Davis. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel {{of the same name}} by Ellen Glasgow, the story is about two sisters <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> destroyed by the anger and jealousy of one of the sisters. Crowther gave the film a negative review, but noted deHavilland's [...] "warm and easy performance". During production, deHavilland and Huston began a romantic relationship that lasted three years.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} a few {{isolated}} cases where RNLI crew members (not the RNLI) have claimed salvage leading to a not uncommon misconception that the RNLI is partly funded by this practice. There is no legal reason why crew members of the RNLI could not salvage a vessel and indeed frequently tow small vessels to safety, often long distances. The RNLI, however, does not support or encourage salvage because, firstly, they exist to save lives at sea and, secondly, to become involved in salvage might discourage those <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> at risk from calling for help. The RNLI's Sea Safety Guidelines state: [...] "There is no 'salvage' fee when you are towed by a lifeboat, but a voluntary contribution to the RNLI is always very welcome!". This stance was reinforced when the RNLI was criticised for not launching a lifeboat to an unmanned fishing vessel that had run aground. A spokesman for the RNLI stated: [...] "We are not a salvage firm and our charity's aim is to provide immediate assistance for people in trouble at sea and lives are at risk." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Streep {{returned}} to {{the stage for the}} first time in more than twenty years, playing Arkadina in The Public Theater's revival of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull, directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring Kevin Kline, Natalie Portman, and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The same year, she began work on Spike Jonze's comedy-drama Adaptation (2002), in which she portrayed real-life journalist Susan Orlean. Lauded by critics and viewers alike, the film won Streep her fourth Golden Globe in the Best Supporting Actress category. A. O. Scott in The New York Times considered Streep's portrayal of Orlean to have been [...] "played with impish composure", noting the contrast in her [...] "wittily realized" [...] character with love interest Chris Cooper's [...] "lank-haired, toothless charisma" [...] as the autodidact arrested for poaching rare orchids. Streep appeared alongside Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore in Stephen Daldry's The Hours (2002), based on the 1999 novel by Michael Cunningham. Focusing on three women of different generations <b>whose</b> <b>lives</b> <b>are</b> interconnected by the novel Mrs. Dalloway by Virginia Woolf, the film was generally well received and won all three leading actresses a Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E

That is what I heard from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here.
