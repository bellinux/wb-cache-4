40|$|Bench-scale {{studies with}} mercury {{contaminated}} soil were {{performed at the}} SRTC to determine the optimum waste loading obtainable in the glass product without sacrificing durability, leach resistance, and processability. Vitrifying this waste stream also required offgas treatment for the capture of the vaporized mercury. Four soil glasses with slight variations in composition were produced, which were capable of passing the Product Consistency Test (PCT) and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The optimum glass feed composition contained 60 weight percent soil and produced a soda-lime-silica glass when melted at 1, 350 C. The glass additives used to produce this glass were 24 weight percent Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and 16 weight percent CaCO{sub 3 }. Volatilized mercury released during the vitrification process was released to the proposed mercury collection system. The proposed mercury collection system consisted of quartz and silica tubing with a Na{sub 2 }S <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> followed by a NaOH <b>wash</b> <b>bottle.</b> Once in the system, the volatile mercury would pass through the <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> containing Na{sub 2 }S, {{where it would be}} converted to Hg{sub 2 }S, which is a stable form of mercury. However, attempts to capture the volatilized mercury in a Na{sub 2 }S solution <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> were not as successful as anticipated. Maximum mercury captured was only about 3. 24 % of the mercury contained in the feed. Mercury capture efforts then shifted to condensing and capturing the volatilized mercury.

40|$|There {{is a huge}} lack of dermal uptake {{data for}} chemicals, and it is {{frequent}} with large variations in reported permeability coefficients for chemicals {{with more than one}} data set, showing the need for a new and standardized in vitro method. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop the new method of measuring dermal absorption of chemical vapor using the TGA method. Assessment of dermal absorption by TGA (Study I) Round pieces (ø 8 mm) of pig epidermis were placed on a platinum pan and inserted into the TGA furnace, where a constant temperature (35 ± 0. 01 °C) and humidity (45 % RH) were maintained. The weight change of the skin was readily recorded prior, during and after exposure to an airflow containing known concentrations of chemical vapor (from water, 2 -propanol, methanol and toluene). When no chemical vapor was present the weight of the skin was constant and upon addition of chemical vapor the weight of the skin increased until an equilibrium with the surrounding air was reached. After removal of chemical vapor the skin weight decreased until the baseline weight was reached. The shape of the weight curves was unique for each studied chemical, were the slope and total weight increase reflect the diffusion and skin:air partition coefficients of the studied chemicals, respectively. Vapor generating system (Study II) A computer-controlled, fully automated vapor generating system was created. The chemical vapor was generated by means of bubbling clean, dry air through tailor-made stainless steel chemical containing gas wash bottles, placed in a thermo regulated water bath. Magnetic valves were placed before and after each gas <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> to direct the airflow and to prevent back flow, respectively. The performance of a gas <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> was tested and close to full saturation was measured using cyclohexanone as test substance. A dedicated computer program was created allowing automated execution of schedules, facilitating precise timing and long time dermal uptake studies using TGA. Development of TGA-specific diffusion model (Study III) A multi compartmental, parallel diffusion model was created using a derived TGA-specific solution to Fick s second law of diffusion. Diffusion and skin:air partition coefficients were obtained by fitting the model to TGA obtained skin weight curves from studies on n-butyl acetate, methanol, 2 -propanol and toluene. Akaikes Information Criterion (AIC) was applied and it was found that a two compartment model was sufficient to describe the weight curves. The first compartment was fast and having a low capacity whereas the second compartment was slower with a higher capacity. Validate TGA method against Franz cells (Study IV) TGA and Franz diffusion cell studies were preformed on pig skin testing dermal penetration of the above mentioned chemicals and n-butanol, cyclohexanone, ethyl benzene, n-hexane, styrene and m-xylene. The Franz cell obtained diffusion coefficients showed good agreement with the faster of the two TGA compartments. In conclusion, skin weight changes were readily recorded when dermal exposure to chemical vapor was studied using the TGA method. Diffusion and partition coefficients were obtained by fitting a TGA-specific two compartment model to the recorded weight curves. A good agreement was found when comparing the TGA obtained diffusion coefficients with those from Franz cell experiments...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen sulphide, (H 2 S), is {{a highly}} toxic gas and is {{increasingly}} found in offshore reservoir fluids {{and it is important}} to have reliable and accurate analytical procedures. Normally the standard USEPA 376. 2 procedure is used for the determination of hydrogen sulphide in formation water and live-oil samples. In this method, H 2 S is trapped in aqueous alkaline solutions and the sulphides are then analysed by the methylene blue (MB) method. This procedure however requires immediate analysis of the sample, as the precipitates are unstable. Zinc acetate produces acetic acid during the absorption of H 2 S thus reducing the effectiveness of the trapping solution, making the control of initial and final pH value of the trapping solution necessary. The precipitate formed was an irregular gelatinous mass, which adhered to the glass walls and sintered glass of the gas <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> necessitating acid solvation of the precipitate, to free the H 2 S, for analysis resulting in loss of precision in measurements. We propose to stabilize the sample with an alkaline solution of a chelating agent, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate salt (EDTA). H 2 S was liberated from a number of reservoir fluids by pressure reduction and was trapped in aqueous alkaline solutions of zinc acetate and EDTA. The resulting zinc sulphide precipitate was analysed using a HACH UV-visible spectrometer following the MB method. The calibration of the spectrophotometer was checked using standard sodium sulphide solutions. The sulphide precipitate in the original trapping mixture decomposes and disperses in a few hours while with the proposed chelating agen...|$|E
30|$|Since TerraZyme is hydrophobic, it {{was felt}} {{necessary}} to understand the effect of TerraZyme and the suitable curing conditions on the strength characteristics of the treated soil. Hence, two separate sets of unconfined compressive soil specimens were prepared. Each set of specimens was prepared with different dosages of TerraZyme as mentioned in Table  2. TerraZyme was pre-injected to the calculated quantity of water to obtain soil specimens near to optimum moisture content (obtained based on the compaction test results). The calculated quantity of soil for obtaining a requisite number of soil specimens was thoroughly mixed with this TerraZyme injected water till a uniform consistency was obtained. After mixing the soil, it was transferred into a static compactor for preparing identical specimens having maximum dry density as obtained from standard proctor compaction test [7]. The statically compacted specimens were extruded from the mould, properly sealed with a moist cloth and stacked in a desiccator to avoid any moisture loss. All the specimens were properly labelled for future reference. One set of samples were cured, only once daily, through application of water using a <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> (wet curing), while another set of samples were kept in sealed condition with a wet cloth and placed in desiccator filled with water {{at the bottom of}} the plate on which specimens were stacked to maintain them in a saturated condition by the humid environment inside the desiccator (sealed curing).

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this diploma thesis {{is the study of}} the effect of {{humidity}} on the total sterilization effect of the dielectric barrier discharge. Sterilization is a process which can eliminate all forms of life. The plasma sterilization is one of the methods that are suitable for sterilization of temperature and chemical sensitive materials. This sterilization method was proved to be effective on the wide spectrum of procaryotic and eucaryotic microorganisms. Basically, the main inactivation factors for cells exposed to plasma are heat, UV radiation and various reactive species. Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) operating at atmospheric pressure was used for the sterilization of the samples. The discharge was generated in dry air and in humid air. The plasma power densities were 2 160 mW. cm- 3, 2 279 mW. cm- 3 and 2 760 mW. cm- 3 (dry air) or 2 326 mW. cm- 3 and 2 850 mW. cm- 3 (humid air). Humidity of air was achieved using a <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> filled with water through which air flowed into the DBD reactor. Fungi spores of Aspergillus niger were used as model microorganisms. Whatman paper No. 1 was used as the carrying medium. When comparing sterilization efficiency of humid and dry air operating at the same conditions, the higher sterilization effect was observed in humid air. The sterilization effect of the DBD generated in air was compared with results obtained during plasma generation in argon and nitrogen. At the same conditions, the highest sterilization effect was observed in argon, followed by humid air, nitrogen and dry air. It was found out that in our experimental setup the active species are probably the main inactivation mechanism. The influence of temperature on the inactivation of microorganisms was completely negligible. The discharge parameters were studied by means of the optical emission spectroscopy (OES). Plasma treated samples were analyzed employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Damage of the microorganisms due to the effect of plasma as well as plasma effect on the structure of the carrying medium was evaluated...|$|E

40|$|Timely {{detection}} of western flower thrips(WFT), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), {{is important to}} help prevent economic damage to crops. Coloured traps are commonly used for thrips monitoring and their efficacy can be markedly improved {{with the addition of}} semiochemicals such as methyl isonicotinate (MI). However, the behavioural response of thrips to these compounds is poorly understood.

Western flower thrips showed a dose-dependent take-off response to the thrips attractant MI, but not to b-caryophyllene (virtually no take-off). At 100 ll of MI (8. 8 ng l) 1 air), WFT spent a greater proportion of time walking on host plant tissue than in clean air, depending on plant disc substrates. Furthermore, WFT took off more often from plant discs exposed to an air current containing MI than from those exposed to clean air. Western flower thrips exposed to MI took off at a similar rate from chrysanthemum leaves, chrysanthemum flower petals, and sweet pepper leaves, but much less readily from bean leaves. The results show that MI stimulates walking and take-off behaviour for adult femaleWFT under these experimental conditions and these responses are dose-dependent and mediated by the host plant. These results are placed in the context of previous research on the behavioural response of thrips to semiochemicals and their implications for thrips pestmanagement are discusse...|$|E
