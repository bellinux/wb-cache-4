To determine the measure of associations between work types and the presence of arterial hypertension. 2) To value the moderator paper ofthe individual disposition in the confrontation of work demands and it’s control over the arterial pressure and their control. A descriptive traverse study was carried out. 256 workers were studied, two groups were conformed: hypertensive (148) and non hypertensive(108). A blood pressure measurement was done and the Questionnaire of <b>Working</b> <b>Tension</b> (based on the perception of the work andthe preferences) was applied. The perception of nervous tension at the work position was significantly higher among hypertensive and particularly in non controlled ones(p < 0, 05). The high tension work behaved as a risk factor of hypertension (OR – 2, 25 [1, 22 – 4, 17] p < 0, 05) and of not to control the sameone (OR – 2, 20 [1, 05 - 4, 60] p < 0, 05). The agreement proportion among perceived and preferred work was low 0, 267, evidencing, those interviewed,the necessity of lower levels of demand. The high tension work and the nervous tension acts as factors of psychological risk, influencing the control of the arterial hypertension. Thework of low tension is valued as the favorite one...|$|E
40|$|Māori people {{experiencing}} {{mental health}} issues have been historically under-served by mental health services. In {{the last three decades}} the development of Kaupapa Māori health services has provided a culturally responsive option for Māori. However, many Māori are still using mainstream mental health services and {{there is a need to}} develop a greater understanding of effective cross-cultural practice within the broader service system. This research, Supporting mental health recovery for Māori whaiora: The success stories of Māori whaiora and non-Māori clinicians, sought stories of positive cross-cultural engagement in a mainstream service lacking in Māori cultural resources. The hermeneutic methodology was informed by appreciative inquiry and brought a Māori interpretive lens. The stories of 13 people (7 whaiora and 6 clinicians) who felt something good had happened in their cross-cultural work were analysed to uncover the phenomenon of the relationship. Aspects of Māori and non-Māori experience were drawn from the stories and further illuminated by Māori cultural notions, relevant literature, and nuanced by the personal pre (and ever growing) understandings of the researcher. Exploring positive stories provided an opportunity to shed light on the cross-cultural practices, marked first by difference, misunderstanding and tension which, the participants revealed, lead to trust, respect and collaborative <b>working.</b> <b>Tension</b> and success appeared to be two sides of the same coin within the cross-cultural exchanges. Maintaining distance, giving time, acknowledging gaps in knowledge, respectful listening and giving power to the other were shown to be important steps. The willingness to share and blend points of view lead to new ways of creating recovery pathways and upheld the mana (status) and expertise of the other. Recommendations for practice and teaching include the importance of reflecting on one’s own history and prejudices, learning to dwell with uncertainty and the discomfort caused by difference. Clinicians are encouraged to see and hear, beyond ethnicity, the human they are working with. Future researchers are challenged to resist fault-finding and problem-solving and instead pursue an understanding of positive encounters. Cross-cultural research can extend knowledge and enhance already existing positive cross-cultural health care engagements to benefit Māori and other cultures in Aotearoa/New Zealand...|$|E

40|$|Developing a Grid within High Energy Physics for the Large Hadron Collider {{particle}} accelerator is characterised {{as a highly}} collaborative, distributed and dynamic systems development effort. This research examines the way this distributed Grid is developed, deployed and provided as a service {{to the thousands of}} physicists analysing data from the Large Hadron Collider. The particle physics community has always {{been at the forefront of}} computing with a tradition of working in large distributed collaborations, therefore providing a "distinctive" case of distributed systems development practice. The focus of concern is the collaborative systems development practices employed by particle physicists in their attempt to develop a usable Grid. The research aims to offer lessons and practical recommendations to those involved in globally distributed systems development and to inform the information systems development literature. Global software development presents unaddressed challenges to organisations and it is argued that there is an urgent need for new systems development practices and strategies to be created that can facilitate and embrace the rapid changes of the environment and the complexities involved in such projects. The contribution of the study, therefore, is a framework of guidance towards engendering what the author defines as "Hybrid Experimental Agile Distributed Systems Development Communities" revealing a set of dynamic collaborative practices for those organisational contexts engaged in distributed systems development. The framework will allow them to reflect on their own practice and perhaps foster a similarly dynamic flexible community in order to manage their global software development effort. The research is in the form of an interpretative qualitative exploratory case study, which draws upon Activity Theory, and frames the Grid's distributed development activity as a complex overarching networked activity system influenced by the context, the community's tools, rules, norms, culture, history, past experiences, shared visions and collaborative way of <b>working.</b> <b>Tensions</b> and contradictions throughout the development of this Grid are explored and surfaced, with the research focusing on how these are resolved in order for the activity system to achieve stability. Such stability leads to the construction of new knowledge and learning and the formation of new systems development practices. In studying this, practices are considered as an emergent property linked to improvisation, bricolage and dynamic competences that unfold as large-scale projects evolve...|$|R
