25|$|While {{working with}} the WSPU, Lucy Burns met Alice Paul at a London police station. Both women {{had been arrested for}} demonstrating, and Alice Paul {{introduced}} herself when she noticed that Lucy Burns <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> American flag pin on her lapel. The women discussed their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women's movement. Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by Anna Howard Shaw. Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends. Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for equality in the UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.|$|E

We couldn't play music on the street so I <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> ear piece with my track playing. Loads of people were stopping and looking at me like I'd lost it, jumping up and down to what they thought was no music playing! Gotta do what you gotta do! Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E

During a quarrel over whose child should be using the playground's swing, Wiens began shouting verbal abuse at El-Sherbini. El-Sherbini who <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> Islamic headscarf, was called [...] "Islamist", [...] "terrorist" [...] and (according to one report) [...] "slut". Other people present tried to intervene, but Wiens vehemently continued the verbal abuse for several minutes, directing epithets in Russian and German at the Russian-speaking bystanders who attempted to reason with him. El-Sherbini called the police on a bystander's mobile phone {{and within a few}} minutes four police officers arrived in two vehicles at the scene. El-Sherbini and Wiens were questioned; El-Sherbini was subsequently driven away in one of the police vehicles.|$|E

500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E

Most other reviewers also noted how good their voices sounded together, including Chaney, {{who gave the}} song a [...] "B−", and Bell, who called their harmonies [...] "out-of-this-world amazing". Lynch and Slezak each praised the tenderness in Riley's vocals; Lynch gave the song an [...] "A", and Slezak an [...] "A−". [...] "Ben", however, received far more mixed commentary, and several reviewers felt it was odd to, as Chaney put it, sing a song about a rat [...] "to a guy who isn't named Ben and <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> eye patch", which Futterman called [...] "a little creepy" [...] and VanDerWerff, more bluntly, [...] "fucking weird". Despite this, Chaney gave the song a [...] "B", one of her highest grades of the night, {{in part because it}} gave Colfer [...] "an excuse to hit those 'You’ve got a friend in me' high notes", while Futterman noted that he [...] "does well in the high range", and praised the verses by Rachel and Finn. Bell, however, called the song [...] "a snooze-fest", and Slezak was very unhappy with the [...] "interminable rendition" [...] which he graded a [...] "D". In December 2012, TV Guide listed the rendition as one of Glee worst performances.|$|E

500|$|It was {{whispered in}} society that Rasputin had seduced {{not only the}} Tsarina but also the four Grand Duchesses. Rasputin had {{released}} ardent, though by all accounts completely innocent in nature, letters written by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses to him. They circulated throughout society, fueling rumors. Pornographic cartoons circulated depicting Rasputin having relations with the empress, with her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova nude in the background. Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time, much to Alexandra's displeasure, and Rasputin went {{on a pilgrimage to}} Palestine. Despite the rumors, the imperial family's association with Rasputin continued until Rasputin was murdered on December 17, 1916. [...] "Our Friend is so contented with our girlies, says they have gone through heavy 'courses' for their age and their souls have much developed", Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6, 1916, a few weeks before Rasputin was killed. However, as she grew older, Olga was less inclined to see Rasputin as her friend and was more aware of how his friendship with her parents affected the stability of her country. Olga wrote in her diary the day after the murder that she suspected Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed and the man she had at one time been expected to marry, was the murderer of [...] "Father Grigory." [...] Dmitri and Felix Yussupov, the husband of her first cousin Princess Irina of Russia, were among the murderers. In his memoirs, A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared [...] "cold and visibly terribly upset" [...] by Rasputin's death and sat [...] "huddled up closely together" [...] on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news. Mordvinov reported that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed. Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on the reverse side by Olga, her sisters and mother. However, Olga was {{the only member of the}} family who did not attend Rasputin's funeral, according to the diary of her first cousin once removed Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia. According to the memoirs of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a woman who nursed with Olga during World War I, Olga said in February 1917, about a month after the murder, that while it might have been necessary for Rasputin to be killed, it should never have been done [...] "so terribly." [...] She was ashamed that the murderers were her relatives. After Olga and her sisters had been killed, the Bolsheviks found that each <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> amulet bearing Rasputin's image and a prayer around their necks.|$|E

2500|$|When Sutcliffe was {{stripped}} {{at the police}} station he <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> inverted V-neck sweater under his trousers. The sleeves had been pulled over his legs and the V-neck exposed his genital area. The front of the elbows were padded to protect his knees as, presumably, he knelt over his victims' corpses. The sexual implications of this outfit were considered obvious, but it was not made public until the 2003 book, Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper, by Michael Bilton was published. After two days of intensive questioning, on the afternoon of 4 January 1981 Sutcliffe suddenly declared he was the Ripper. Over the next day, Sutcliffe calmly described his many attacks. Weeks later he claimed God had told him to murder the women. He displayed emotion only when telling of the killing of his youngest victim, Jayne MacDonald, and when questioned about the murder of Joan Harrison, which he vehemently denied committing. Harrison's murder had been linked to the Ripper killings by the [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] claim, and in 2011, DNA evidence proved it had been committed by convicted sex offender Christopher Smith, who died in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the time}} when the X-Men were based in the Australian outback, Psylocke gained {{possession}} of a unique suit of armor. Made of an unknown metal, it was lightweight and form-fitting, yet extremely resistant to physical damage, giving Psylocke an added protection to her physical body. The armor was also resistant to projectiles and energy weapons. Wolverine had the armor custom-ordered through a weapons and technology firm named Landau, Luckman, and Lake for [...] "a colleague". Mr. Chang, an agent of Landau, Luckman, and Lake, loaned the armor to Lindsay McCabe since Wolverine had sent her to him. Tyger Tiger also wore the body armor for a short time, and she was briefly trapped in the armor due to a built-in security mechanism, which Wolverine managed to free her from. After traveling through the Siege Perilous and trading bodies with Kwannon, Psylocke no longer used the body armor. When Kwannon, in Betsy's original body, returned to Xavier's mansion, she <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> armor that was similar to the one Betsy used to wear, but it has never been officially stated whether or not this armor had the same capabilities as Psylocke’s original one. The same can be said for the armor worn by Psylocke's resurrected original body, after it was brought back during by Madelyne's sisterhood, wearing armor of the same coloring.|$|E
2500|$|According to James Mellaart, he {{encountered}} {{a young lady}} called Anna Papastrati on a train from Istanbul to Izmir and noticed that she <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> unusual armband. She is meant to have told him that this armband {{was part of a}} collection of antiquities, which was in the possession of her family. He therefore went to the house of Papastrati, who according to him was a young Greek lady and spoke good English with a slight American accent. There she showed him numerous pieces which were stylistically associated with the Yortan culture. The Yortan culture was one of the cultures which neighboured ancient Troy. Mellaart stayed several days in the house at Izmir, making sketches and notes. Photography of the pieces was forbidden, according to Mellaart. Papastrati promised to photograph the pieces herself at the next opportunity and send the photos to him. The items were said to have been found in shallow graves near the city of Dorak, south of the Sea of Marmara, during the Greco-Turkish War. Mellaart reported that he had seen photographs of the graves in which the Dorak treasure had been found and that there was a description of the discovery in Modern Greek, which he had also seen. Mellaart claimed that he left the house after a few days without correctly noting its location, although he noted a name and address (Anna Papastrati, 217 Kazim Direk Street, Izmir) on a piece of notepaper. No communication was received subsequently from Papastrati. Mellaart said that he did not make the discovery public at first because he was waiting for the photos and consent to publication. He claimed to have written to Izmir twice without receiving an answer.|$|E

Lynch feels that Sue has the ability to be both [...] "horrible and really delightful at the same time", assessing that she continually speaks her mind as she enjoys appalling people with the things she says. She encapsulates Sue's world view as being about [...] "power and winning", stating that she will do anything to win. Sue's softer side manifests following the revelation that her sister has Down syndrome. She is depicted as kind and loving towards Jean, though Lynch stated that exploration of Sue's humanity would be limited. Sue is an atheist, but according to Murphy, does not want to be. He explained, [...] "She [...] saying to the world, 'Prove [...] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.'" [...] The second-season episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] focuses on the characters' differing approaches to religion. Sue lobbies against the performance of spiritual songs in school, engaging in a philosophical argument on the matter with school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), which Murphy describes as the scene he is [...] "most proud to have been involved with in [...] entire career." [...] On the fifth-season episode [...] "Puppet Master", the reason behind Sue's track suit outfit was revealed. It was because she felt that she never received the respect she deserved as a teacher and even the then Principal Figgins [...] "insulted" [...] her and said that she was a cheerleading coach so she needed to [...] "try some pants" [...] because she <b>was</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>an</b> office skirt and that she had long hair.
