5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect his people and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town's defences. Over the next two generations Worcester was transformed from an ecclesiastical settlement to a town with a diverse population of craftsmen.|$|E
5|$|In 359, Julian {{restored}} seven forts {{and town}} <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle Rhine, including Bonna (Bonn) and Bingium (Bingen), obliging his new tributary Alamanni {{to provide the}} supplies and labour needed. He then crossed the Rhine, marched through {{the territory of the}} tributaries and devastated the lands of the other kings who had fought at Strasbourg, including Westralp. All were forced to submit and return the thousands of Roman civilians they had abducted and enslaved during the years of easy plunder.|$|E
5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} projection of the north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time. The different thickness of the <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present church suggests that the wall {{for the length of}} the first three bays of the arcade was taken down and rebuilt in the 13th century. The church underwent a restoration in 1839, with £370 being spent, and in 1875 at a cost of £2,377.|$|E

5|$|The {{deterioration}} of the Ming military position in the steppe transitional zone gave rise to nomadic raids into Ming territory, including the crucial Ordos region, on a level unprecedented since the dynasty's founding. After decades of deliberation between an offensive strategy and an accommodative policy, the decision to build the first major Ming <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Ordos was agreed upon as an acceptable compromise the 1470s.|$|E
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of Mecca.|$|E

5|$|The {{photovoltaic}} modules {{generate electricity}} to power {{much of the}} pavilions' lighting. The North Pavilions are the first Chicago buildings to use building integrated photovoltaic cells, which are a solar energy system incorporated into the building's structural elements.

5|$|Though major {{locations}} held up {{well against}} the earthquake, most villages did not. From Qeshm Island came reports of power outage and minor damage; 100 houses {{in all of}} Qeshm were damaged between 30 and 50 percent. Two-hundred villages were devastated by the earthquake's velocity. <b>Walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village of Zeynabi were leveled; all were reduced by the earthquake to debris. Relief workers were sent to rescue any residents from their homes {{if they had been}} caught under debris.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft {{requires}} {{players to}} collect resources, and to produce buildings and units {{in order to}} defeat an opponent in combat. Non-combatant builders deliver the resources to the Town Center from mines, from which gold is dug, and forests, where wood is chopped. As both are limited resources which become exhausted during the game, players must collect them efficiently, and also retain forests as defensive <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early game when combat forces are small.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the <b>walls,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E
5|$|A {{second wave}} of work {{took place on the}} city <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 15th century. Backed by {{substantial}} communal effort and financial contributions, Newingate was rebuilt between 1450 and 1470, and probably closely resembled the West Gate in style. Burgate was rebuilt in brick from 1475 onwards, again thanks to public contributions, but it was not completed until 1525, furnished with gunports and anachronistic battlements. Queningate was closed up at shortly after the 15th century, probably following {{the construction of a new}} postern gate nearby. West Gate was appointed the city gaol in 1453 by Henry VI, with Canterbury Castle serving as the county gaol.|$|E
5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> material realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> splash zone.|$|E
5|$|In {{medieval times}} trades {{were carried out}} in {{workshops}} {{in and around the}} owners' premises in the City. By the time of the Great Fire these were becoming industries and some were particularly noisome, such as the processing of urine to perform tanning; or required large amounts of space, such as drying clothes after process and dying in fields known as tentergrounds; and rope making. Some were dangerous, such as the manufacture of gunpowder or the proving of guns. These activities came to be performed outside the City <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> near suburbs of the East End. Later when lead making and bone processing for soap and china came to be established, they too located in the East End rather than the crowded streets of the City.|$|E
5|$|It was {{maintained}} throughout the 15th century, {{and played a}} role in Kett's Rebellion of 1549, when the rebels attacked Norwich, deploying artillery and damaging the tower's parapets. Repairs to the tower's <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century inadvertently caused long-term damage, and in 1953 it was taken into the guardianship of the Ministry of Works, who stabilised its condition in a five-year conservation project. In the 21st century, Cow Tower is managed by English Heritage and Norwich City Council; the tower is now only a shell, however, as the floors and the roof of the building have been lost.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the rocks}} and {{minerals}} are housed in glass cases along the <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement. Before opening to the public an elevator {{was added to the}} home. The museum includes a lapidary and arts gallery, agate gallery, petrified wood gallery, oddities gallery, crystal gallery, Northwest gallery, and fossil gallery. There is also an educational room and gift shop, while the outside grounds include a walk that features sandstone, columns of basalt, and a pile of rocks for children to climb over to find stones. This walk includes a 1,200 pound (540kg) rock made of pumice.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the <b>walls.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> latter, gold leaf has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Fremantle Prison, a former Australian prison in Fremantle, Western Australia, extends from its {{construction}} as a prison for convicts, using convict labour, in the 1850s, through to its modern-day usage {{as a tourist}} attraction. The design for Fremantle Prison {{was based on the}} Pentonville Prison in Britain, and it would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and was completed by the end of 1859. The prison was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally sentenced prisoners. Following a Royal Commission held in 1898−99, some changes were made to Fremantle Prison, including knocking down the inner wall between two cells, introducing a prisoner classification system, and constructing internal <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main block to create four separate divisions. A new cell block, New Division, was completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908.|$|E
