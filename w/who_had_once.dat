5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs {{made their way into}} The Well of Loneliness.|$|E
5|$|A pretrial show cause {{hearing in}} the Green case began in January 1996, with Green {{represented}} by Dennis Moore and Kevin Moriarty. Green's defense claimed that {{the fire in the}} family home had been set not by Debora Green, but by her son, Tim Farrar, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been caught by local police setting off Molotov cocktails. The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E

5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
5|$|Hoping to {{establish}} his credentials {{once and for all}} as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work Life-Histories of Northern Animals, which was published in 1909. After an enlarged edition of the book was published as Lives of Game Animals, Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> so criticized Seton's work.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, Don Nelson, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> {{coached the}} Bucks, had an {{outstanding}} trade instinct, essentially trading future career underachievers Traylor and Garrity for two future NBA MVPs in Nowitzki and Nash; in addition, the new recruits quickly became close friends. Nowitzki became only the fourth German player in NBA history, following pivots Uwe Blab and Christian Welp and All-Star swingman Detlef Schrempf, {{who was a}} 35-year-old veteran of the Seattle SuperSonics when his young compatriot arrived. Nowitzki finished his DJK career as the only Würzburg player to have ever made the NBA.|$|E

5|$|On December 30, 1905, Frank Steunenberg {{was killed}} by an {{explosion}} {{in front of his}} Caldwell, Idaho home. A former governor of Idaho, Steunenberg had clashed with the WFM in previous strikes. Harry Orchard, a former WFM member <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> acted as WFM President Charles Moyer's bodyguard was arrested for the crime, and evidence was found in his hotel room. Famed Pinkerton detective James McParland, who had infiltrated and helped to destroy the Molly Maguires, was placed in charge of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|In winter 546/7, {{when the}} new Byzantine {{governor}} and commander-in-chief, John Troglita, arrived in Africa, Cutzinas and his followers joined him, and participated in the expedition that saw the defeat and submission of Antalas. Shortly after, Cutzinas received the supreme Roman military rank of magister militum from Troglita. In the summer of 547 Cutzinas accompanied Troglita in his campaign against the Tripolitanian tribes under Carcasan. Before the Battle of Marta he advocated attacking the rebel forces, but the Byzantine army was heavily defeated by Carcasan and Antalas, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> more risen in revolt. In the same winter, Cutzinas quarreled with another pro-Byzantine Berber leader, Ifisdaias. Their dispute threatened to spill over into open armed conflict, but the intervention of Troglita prevented this and the official John effected a reconciliation between the two.|$|E
5|$|The 1972–73 saw {{upheaval}} at the Bruins. Coach Sinden {{became the}} general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson and Johnny McKenzie joined the upstart World Hockey Association. Coach Tom Johnson was fired fifty-two games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> coached Orr. The Adams family, which had owned the team {{since its founding}} in the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins' season came to a premature end in a first-round loss in the 1973 playoffs, losing Esposito to injury in that first round. Orr amassed 101 points during the regular season (he only played 63 games to due injury) but had only two points in the playoff loss.|$|E

5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify {{who was supposed to}} have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely that he had heard it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E
5|$|Honório Hermeto {{departed}} for Montevideo, {{the capital of}} Uruguay, on 23 October. He chose José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to assist him. Paranhos was a brilliant young man <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been a Liberal Party member and protégé of the disgraced Aureliano Coutinho. This surprising choice was a clear signal from Honório Hermeto to {{his colleagues in the}} cabinet of his independence. On 21 November, Honório Hermeto signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. As a reward for his role, the Emperor granted Honório Hermeto the title of Visconde de Paraná (Viscount of Paraná) in July 1852. The title was derived from the Paraná River, a tributary of the Río de la Plata, upon which free passage rights for Brazilian shipping was secured after Rosas' downfall.|$|E
5|$|John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open {{rebellion}} against the rule of Mary and her mother {{in the spring of}} 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia. The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary's position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> been engaged to Mary's sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year. Queen Elizabeth replaced Stephen Lackfi with Thomas Szentgyörgyi, who used draconian measures {{to put an end to}} a conspiracy against the queens in Zadar in May 1384.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{more was}} said between the happy pair. Perhaps conspirators <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>once</b> {{established}} an understanding, {{may not be}} over-fond of repeating the terms and objects of their conspiracy. Next day came; came Georgiana; and came Fledgeby.|$|R

5|$|Manuel is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in 978, when he led the defence of Nicaea against the rebel general Bardas Skleros, who had risen up against Emperor Basil II (reigned 976–1025). Although his great-granddaughter, the princess Anna Komnene, claims in her Alexiad that he had been named strategos autokrator (commander-in-chief) of the East and sent with full powers to deal with the revolt, it is far more likely that he was merely a local commander. Manuel maintained the city's defence with some success, even though the besiegers managed to undermine and collapse one of its towers, until the lack of food became acute. At that point Manuel was able to fool Skleros, by pretending that he had mountains of wheat and was considering joining him, into allowing him and the inhabitants to depart freely for Constantinople. Manuel re-appears in 989, when he was sent as an envoy to Skleros, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> more risen in revolt against Basil II, to persuade him to surrender. Manuel was successful in his task, and the elderly rebel ended his revolt and gave himself up on 11 October. The titles by which he is recorded were patrikios, anthypatos, and vestes.|$|E

5000|$|Later in {{the seventeenth}} century, Sir Francis Bacon {{identified}} the addictive consequences of tobacco use, observing that it [...] "is growing greatly and conquers men with a certain secret pleasure, so that those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>once</b> become accustomed thereto can later hardly be restrained therefrom".|$|R
50|$|For Shank it was faulty {{to assume}} that final {{salvation}} with God is inevitable for everyone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>once</b> entered into a saving relationship with Christ since this ignores the many explicit warnings found not only elsewhere in the Scriptures, but in the Colossians passage just quoted.|$|R

25|$|The 1940 census led to {{redistricting}} which pitted Houston against Edward Herbert Rees, {{the incumbent}} Republican in Kansas' 4th congressional district. Rees easily defeated Houston, 55,612 to 44,333. Republican Clifford R. Hope, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> held the 7th congressional district (it had been eliminated due to redistricting) won the new 5th district seat once held by Houston.|$|E
