5|$|Before the {{adoption}} of Christianity in territory, which is today Poland, {{there were a number}} of different a pagan tribes. Svetovid was among the most widespread pagan gods worshiped in Poland. Christianity arrived around the late 9th century, most likely around the time when the Vistulan tribe encountered the Christian rite in dealings <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> the Great Moravia (Bohemian) state.|$|E
5|$|The Lawton PD is {{especially}} pleased that “prominent crimes”, such as robbery and homicide have declined nearly 50%. Sergeants Stephanie Crawford and Tim Jenkins credit the marked improvement {{to not only}} the outstanding work of the LPD, {{but also to the}} involvement of Lawton’s citizens. One of the key contributing factors is local Neighborhood Watch groups, which act as the eyes and ears of the police department in the areas they represent. They also share tips on how to protect themselves <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> at regular neighborhood meetings.|$|E
5|$|The Eskayas speak a Boholano dialect of Cebuano {{in daily}} life. Boholano-Bisaya is the dominantly used {{language}} among the languages spoken {{by the members}} of the Eskayan tribe. This variety is used in their close familial interactions, in their conversations <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> in the community, in their transactions in the barangay, school meetings, social gatherings, church rituals and in the trade and commerce. However, they are better known for an auxiliary language, known as Eskayan, or Ineskaya, which is used for prayers, songs, and formal speeches. Lexically, Eskayan shows no clear relationship with any known language (however, considered to be an encryption of Cebuano) although there is strong but inconsistent Spanish influence. A striking feature of the language is its unusual phonotactics.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of waves. Mechanical waves {{propagate}} through a medium, and the substance of this medium is deformed. Restoring forces then reverse the deformation. For example, sound waves propagate via air molecules colliding <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors.</b> When the molecules collide, they also bounce {{away from each other}} (a restoring force). This keeps the molecules from continuing to travel {{in the direction of the}} wave.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Iron Age {{is roughly}} dated to between AD 50 and 450, the era that was {{affected}} by {{the influence of the}} Roman Empire. In material culture this is reflected by few Roman coins, some jewellery and artifacts.

25|$|The Opatas are {{location}} {{in a number}} of communities in the center and northwest of the state, but have been disappearing as a distinct ethnicity. This group has lost its traditional rituals, and the language died out in the 1950s. The name means “hostile people” and was given to them by the Pimas, as the Opatas were generally in conflict <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors.</b> They were especially hostile to the Tohono O’odham, who they depreciatingly refer to as the Papawi O’otham, or “bean people.” Today’s Opatas have completely adopted the Catholic religion with Isidore the Laboror as the ethnicity’s patron saint.|$|E
25|$|When the Spanish {{arrived in}} the area, trade between the long {{established}} Pueblo peoples and the Southern Athabaskan was well established. They reported the Pueblo exchanged maize and woven cotton goods for bison meat, and hides and materials for stone tools. Coronado observed the Plains people wintering near the Pueblo in established camps. Later Spanish sovereignty over the area disrupted trade between the Pueblo and the diverging Apache and Navajo groups. The Apache quickly acquired horses, improving their mobility for quick raids on settlements. In addition, the Pueblo were forced to work Spanish mission lands and care for mission flocks; they had fewer surplus goods to trade <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Roman Iron Age in Estonia {{is roughly}} dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was {{affected}} by {{the influence of the}} Roman Empire.

The abundance of iron artefacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas, while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas—Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia including the islands—had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.|$|E

25|$|Oral history {{provides}} {{evidence for}} how housewives {{in a modern}} industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.|$|E
25|$|There {{seemed very}} {{little hope of}} native Christians {{receiving}} anything through the instrumentality of their officials, nor did the foreign powers think they were called upon to provide indemnity for these. All {{the survivors of the}} churches were reduced to absolute poverty. They were harmless, inoffensive people who had no feuds <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> and had not intruded their religion on any one. This at least was true of the Protestant Christians. If a missionary, by means of his personal influence and by the assistance of the local official who might be friendly to him, could bring the neighbors of his persecuted people to see the error of their ways, and persuade them to contribute money for the rebuilding of destroyed houses and for the support of the survivors of the families, I think he was justified in so doing.|$|E
25|$|Housewives updated {{strategies}} {{their mothers}} used {{when they were}} growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles.

They sewed and patched clothing, traded <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors</b> for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies show that women's domestic labor—cooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare—was essential to the economic maintenance {{of the family and}} offered room for economies. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.|$|E
30|$|Many complex {{networks}} {{in the real world}} can be described by evolutionary models. As a typical complex network, WSN has its own unique characteristics.

25|$|When Huberty and {{his family}} moved from Ohio to Tijuana, Mexico in October 1983, he left {{all but the most}} {{essential}} of his family's possessions in storage, but ensured he brought his gun arsenal with him. According to published reports, Huberty's wife and daughters embraced their new environs and became friendly <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> although Huberty—who spoke little Spanish—was sullen and taciturn. Within three months, the Hubertys had relocated to the San Diego neighborhood of San Ysidro, where they rented a two-bedroom apartment in the Cottonwood Apartments. In San Ysidro, Huberty was able to find work as a security guard, and the family relocated to an apartment on Averil Road, just one block from the McDonald's restaurant Huberty would select as the site of his murder spree on July 18. He was dismissed from this position on July 10, one week before the shooting.|$|E
25|$|South India {{during the}} British colonial rule {{was divided into}} the Madras Presidency and Hyderabad, Mysore, Thiruvithamcoore (also known as Travancore), Cochin, Vizianagaram {{and a number of}} other minor princely states. The Madras Presidency was ruled {{directly}} by the British, while the rulers of the princely states enjoyed considerable internal autonomy. British Residents were stationed in the capitals of the important states to supervise and report on the activities of the rulers. British troops were stationed in cantonments near the capitals to curb the potential of rebellion. The rulers of these states accepted the principle of paramountcy of the British Crown. The larger princely states issued their own currency and built their own railroads—with non-standard gauges which would be incompatible <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors.</b> The cultivation of coffee and tea was introduced to the mountainous regions of South India during the British period, and both remain important cash crops.|$|E
25|$|However, the city-states {{were often}} troubled by violent {{disagreements}} among their citizens. The most famous division {{was between the}} Guelphs and Ghibellines. The Guelphs supported supreme rule by the pope, and the Ghibellines favored the emperor. City-states often took sides and waged war against each other. During the Renaissance, Italy became an even more attractive prize to foreign conquerors. After some city-states asked for outside help in settling disputes <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighbors,</b> King Charles VIII of France marched into Italy in 1494. Charles soon withdrew, but he had shown that the Italian peninsula could be conquered {{because they were not}} united. After the Italian Wars, Spain emerged as the dominant force in the region. Venice, Milan, and other city-states retained at least some of their former greatness during this period, as did Savoy-Piedmont, protected by the Alps and well defended by its vigorous rulers.|$|E
