5|$|While the Doctor works, Amy {{sees the}} mysterious figure again, and excuses {{herself to the}} restroom. There, the figure, {{a member of a}} species known as the Silence, waits for her and kills an {{innocent}} woman despite Amy's pleas. Realising the alien is <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> memory of their encounters, Amy takes a picture of the alien. When she leaves the restroom, however, she yet again forgets the encounter. By then the Doctor has found the girl's location, a building near Cape Canaveral, Florida, at the intersection to streets named Jefferson, Adams, and Hamilton. The Doctor and his companions leave in the TARDIS, followed closely by a curious Delaware.|$|E
25|$|Bayonetta {{was born}} in Vigrid from the {{forbidden}} union of a Lumen Sage called Father Balder and an Umbran Witch called Rosa: the Witch was imprisoned and the Sage exiled from his clan. Bayonetta's birth caused a rift between the formally peaceful clans and eventually led to them engaging in a war. Bayonetta became a black sheep among the Umbran Witches, and during the war, Jeanne, a former childhood friend and rival, seals {{her away from the}} world while <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> memory to protect her from those who would exploit her power. For the next five hundred years, she is sealed in a coffin {{at the bottom of a}} lake near Eggman's grave. She is later rescued, at Father Balder's instructions, by a journalist, who is then murdered by Balder's angels as his son, Luka, looks on.|$|E
500|$|Victoria {{is driven}} {{back to the}} {{compound}} past a crowd who, encouraged by the staff, are baying for her blood, and returned to where she awoke. As Victoria is shown footage of Jemima, Baxter places electrodes on her head, <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> memory of the day's events, a procedure that is agonizing. Over the end credits, the new day's events are seen {{from the point of}} view of the [...] "White Bear Justice Park" [...] staff and the park visitors who play the part of those filming Victoria.|$|E
60|$|But Juno tells <b>her</b> to <b>wipe</b> <b>her</b> splashed boots. The child gropes for a {{piece of}} paper. Juno tells her to take her pocket handkerchief. Feebly the sick girl-child <b>wipes</b> <b>her</b> boots, then leans back. But no good. She has to go in the {{corridor}} and be sick again.|$|R

500|$|When Blackout was released, Spears' {{behavior}} in public began to clash with her image. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that Spears {{was an artist}} that always relied on her [...] "carefully sculpted sexpot-next-door persona", but for Blackout [...] "those images re replaced by images of Britney beating cars up with umbrellas, <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> greasy fingers on designer dresses, and nodding off on-stage, each new disaster stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image." [...] Erlewine added that the album served as a soundtrack [...] "for Britney's hazy, drunken days, reflecting the excess that's splashed all over the tabloids", while noting that the album had a coherence that the public Spears lacked.|$|E
2500|$|... "having {{dismounted}} {{from his}} horse in an unguarded moment, [...] was espied and {{singled out by}} an old lady of Amazonian proportions, just from the wash tub, who, <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> hands and mouth on her apron as she approached, seized him around the neck with the hug of a bruin, and bestowed upon him half a dozen kisses that were heard by nearly every man in the command, and when at length she relaxed her hold the Colonel {{looked as if he}} had just come out a vapor bath".|$|E
2500|$|Empress Dowager Longyu {{endorsed}} the [...] "Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor" [...] (清帝退位詔書) on 12 February 1912 under a deal brokered by Prime Minister Yuan Shikai (a {{general of the}} Beiyang Army) with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China. At the crucial meeting in the Forbidden City, Puyi watched the meeting between Longyu and Yuan, which he remembered as: [...] "The Dowager Empress {{was sitting on a}} kang [...] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> eyes with a handkerchief while a fat old man [...] knelt on a red cushion before her, tears rolling down his face. I was sitting {{to the right of the}} Dowager and wondering why the two adults were crying. There was nobody in the room besides us three and it was very quiet; the fat man was sniffing while he talked and I could not understand what he was saying ... This was the occasion Yuan directly brought up the question of abdication". Under the [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication" [...] (清帝退位 優待條件), signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. This was similar to Italy's Law of Guarantees (1870) which accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi himself was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic and continued to believe that he was the still the Emperor for sometime afterwards. In 1913, when the Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan Shikai arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afloat.|$|E
