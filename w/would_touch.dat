5|$|Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Ridley Scott {{asked him to}} play Millburn. Trying to {{duplicate}} {{the reaction of the}} Alien cast to the chestburster scene, the director did not tell the Prometheus cast that a Hammerpede puppet was in the silicon replica of Spall's body; Kate Dickie's scream is genuine. The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} shown a {{difference}} between the sexes on who touches when. In the initial stages of a relationship, men often follow socially prescribed gender roles. Patterson indicated that men fulfilling this social role <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> more and after initial touch in casual relationships and as the relationship became more intimate during serious dating or marriage relationships, women <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> more. American culture still dictates that men ‘make the first move’ {{in the context of a}} dating relationship.|$|E

As {{he looked in}} to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. Reggie Jackson was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
25|$|The WWF had {{effectively}} {{doubled the}} size of its roster through its acquisition of WCW, and as a result, there was not enough screen time for everyone. The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity. Polls were even put up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show. These plans fell through when no TV station <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> WCW because of its reputation for losing money. The WWF eventually carried out a brand extension, effectively reviving WCW under its own auspices and running two separate promotions, each with one of the WWF's two existing televised shows, Raw and SmackDown!.|$|E
25|$|Norman Hartnell was {{commissioned}} by the Queen to design the outfits for {{all the members of}} the Royal Family and especially the gown Elizabeth would wear at the coronation; Hartnell's design for the latter evolved through nine proposals. The final version was the result of his own research as well as numerous personal meetings with the Queen: it was a white silk dress embroidered with the floral emblems of the countries of the Commonwealth at the time: the Tudor rose of England, the Scots thistle, the Welsh leek, the shamrock for Northern Ireland, the wattle of Australia, the maple leaf of Canada, the New Zealand silver fern, South Africa's protea, two lotus flowers for India and Ceylon and Pakistan's wheat, cotton and jute; unknown to the Queen at the time of the gown's delivery, though, was the unique four-leaf clover embroidered on the dress' left side, where Elizabeth's hand <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> throughout the day.|$|E

25|$|Other common {{styles of}} {{clothing}} popularly worn with a niqab in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with {{an opening for}} the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the niqab. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many munaqqabāt believe {{no part of the}} skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because {{they do not want to}} be put in a position where they <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most munaqqabāt also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{touching}} {{ceremony was}} an informal process. Sickly individuals could petition {{the court for}} a royal touch and the touch would be performed at the King's earliest convenience. At times, the King of France <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> afflicted subjects during his royal walkabout. The rapid spread of tuberculosis across France and England, however, necessitated a more formal and efficient touching process. By the time of Louis XIV of France, placards indicating the days and times the King would be available for royal touches were posted regularly; sums of money were doled out as charitable support. In England, the process was extremely formal and efficient. As late as 1633, the Book of Common Prayer of the Anglican Church contained a Royal Touch ceremony. The monarch (king or queen), sitting upon a canopied throne, touched the afflicted individual, and presented that individual with a coin – usually an Angel, a gold coin the value of which varied from about 6 shillings to about 10 shillings – by pressing it against the afflicted's neck.|$|E
25|$|Hoover {{was best}} known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to {{demonstrate}} the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast {{all the way back to}} his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.|$|E

25|$|After Bolts {{returned}} from India in May 1781, {{he developed the}} idea for a voyage to the North West Coast of America to engage in the trade in sea otter furs to China and Japan. He apparently heard from John Reid, his agent at Canton (Guangzhou), of the success the crew of James Cook’s ships had had there in November 1779 in selling the sea otter pelts they had obtained for trinkets on the American coast in the course of Cook’s third expedition to the Pacific. Bolts's ship, the Kaunitz (not {{to be confused with the}} Proli group's vessel of the same name), arrived back at Leghorn (Livorno) from Canton with this news on 8 July 1781. Bolts afterwards wrote that he had the ambition of wishing to be the first to profit from this new branch of trade. At an audience in Vienna in May 1782, Bolts discussed his plan with Emperor Joseph II, for which he had bought a ship in England in November 1781. The ship was called the Cobenzell (or Cobenzl) in honour of the Vice-Chancellor of State, Count Philipp Cobenzl (Kobenzl), a patron of the Imperial Company. Bolts’s plan called for the ship to round Cape Horn, take on furs at Nootka, sell or trade them in China and Japan, and return by the Cape of Good Hope. He engaged four sailors who had served under Cook, including George Dixon, who subsequently commanded the Queen Charlotte on a voyage to the North West coast for the Etches Company of London, and Heinrich Zimmermann, who had written an account in German of Cook's final voyage. He bought a sloop, the Trieste, as a tender, and obtained letters of credence from the Emperor to various rulers at whose ports the ship <b>would</b> <b>touch.</b>|$|E
500|$|The two volume {{biography}} of Whitehead by Victor Lowe {{is the most}} definitive presentation {{of the life of}} Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no Nachlass; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death. Additionally, Whitehead was known for his [...] "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life. [...] This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, [...] "No professional biographer in his right mind <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> him." ...|$|E

500|$|After the war, Harlan {{claimed that}} no other {{director}} <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> the project and that he himself had tried to decline the role of director. The filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, in her 1987 memoir, confirmed that Harlan had told her of Goebbels's insistence that he direct the film and of his ardent desire {{to get out of}} the project. Harlan had even written to Goebbels volunteering for military service in order to avoid making the film. Goebbels' responded to this by informing Harlan that, if he enlisted, he would do his military service at the front. According to Harlan, Goebbels screamed at him, [...] "I can crush you like a bug on the wall!" [...] When Harlan asked Riefenstahl to intercede for him with Goebbels, she demurred citing her own conflicts with the propaganda minister. Instead of intervening on his behalf, Riefenstahl advised Harlan to move to Switzerland; however, Harlan expressed fear for his life and the impact it would have on his wife.|$|E
500|$|Breaking {{from the}} theme of the natural {{environment}} after humans, Weisman considers what could lead to the sudden, complete demise of humans without serious damage to the built and natural environment. That scenario, he concludes, is extremely unlikely. He also considers transhumanism, the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, the Church of Euthanasia and John A. Leslie's The End of the World: the Science and Ethics of Human Extinction. Weisman concludes the book considering {{a new version of the}} one-child policy. While he admits it is a [...] "draconian measure", he states, [...] "The bottom line is that any species that overstretches its resource base suffers a population crash. Limiting our reproduction would be damn hard, but limiting our consumptive instincts may be even harder." [...] He responded to criticism of this saying [...] "I knew in advance that I <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> some people's sensitive spots by bringing up the population issue, but I did so because it's been missing too long from the discussion of how we must deal with the situation our economic and demographic growth have driven us too (sic)".|$|E
500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1994, the K Foundation {{attempted}} to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. The Tate, in Liverpool, {{wanted to be part of}} the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. [...] "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do." [...] Cauty: [...] "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the first}} two decades, along with {{thousands}} of immigrants from the surrounding area, Hull House attracted many female residents who later became prominent and influential reformers at various levels. At the beginning, Addams and Starr volunteered as on-call doctors when the real doctors either didn't show up or weren't available. They acted as midwives, saved babies from neglect, prepared the dead for burial, nursed the sick, and sheltered domestic violence victims. For example, one Italian bride had lost her wedding ring and in turn was beaten by her husband for a week. She sought shelter at the settlement and it was granted to her. Also, a baby born with a cleft palate was unwanted by his mother so he was kept at the Hull House for six weeks after an operation. In another case, a woman {{was about to give}} birth to an illegitimate baby, so none of the Irish matrons <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> it. Addams and Starr stepped in and delivered this helpless little one. Finally, a female Italian immigrant was so thrilled about fresh roses at one of the Hull House receptions that she insisted they had come from Italy. She had never seen anything as beautiful in America {{despite the fact that she}} lived within ten blocks of a florist shop. Her limited view of America came from the untidy street she lived on and the long struggle to adapt to American ways. The settlement was also gradually drawn into advocating for legislative reforms at the municipal, state and federal levels, addressing issues such as child labor, women's suffrage, healthcare reform and immigration policy. Some claim that the work of the Hull House marked the beginning of what we know today as [...] "Social Welfare".|$|E
500|$|By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, {{constant}} touring, and well-received record releases {{had made}} him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer {{to the attention of}} Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was now working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour. When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw Presley for the first time: [...] "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing.... I just didn't {{know what to make of}} it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it." [...] Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to [...] "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like [...] "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the [...] "R idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were [...] "more in the country field", [...] "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both". This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because he sounded too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations <b>would</b> <b>touch</b> him because [...] "he sounded too much like a hillbilly." [...] The blend came to be known as rockabilly. At the time, Presley was variously billed as [...] "The King of Western Bop", [...] "The Hillbilly Cat", and [...] "The Memphis Flash".|$|E
