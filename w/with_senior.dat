40|$|People {{communicate}} to understand {{one another and}} share information. Speaking is crucial {{in the course of}} everyone's entire life. In this thesis, we have focused on the issues related to communication <b>with</b> <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder. It is necessary to properly diagnose the hearing disorder using suitable methods of examination, and subsequently propose possible means of therapy and train the patient on use of the hearing aid if necessary. Two objectives were set out, both of which were achieved. Objective 1 : Map the effective skills used by nurses when communicating <b>with</b> <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder. Objective 2 : Determine how unsuitable communication by nurses affects <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder. A quantitative and qualitative examination was performed. Within the quantitative examination, 200 questionnaires were handed out, of which 178 properly completed were returned for processing. The qualitative examination consisted of a semi-structured interview of ten <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder with the help of technology. We defined three hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : The type of education affects nurses' communication skills <b>with</b> <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder. Hypothesis 2 : Nurses adhere to the principles of communication <b>with</b> <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder. Both hypotheses were confirmed. Hypothesis 3 : Nurses consider care for <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder to be a burden. The last hypothesis was not confirmed. Three research questions were also defined. Research question 1 : How does the current manner of communication by nurses affect <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder? Answer 1 : The current manner of communication of nurses <b>with</b> <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder has a positive effect. Research question 2 : How do <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder perceive non-verbal communication by nurses? Answer 2 : <b>Seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder consider the non-verbal communication of nurses to be adequate. Research question 3 : What problems do <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder encounter when communicating with nurses? Answer 3 : The most common problem mentioned by <b>seniors</b> <b>with</b> a hearing disorder was lack of eye contact...|$|R

Thus, he was selected by USA Today to its Preseason All-American second team and by CBS Sports to its Preseason All-American third team. In its preseason top 100 player ranking, Jones was listed at number 45 by ESPN. Jones was named to the 36-man Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List. He was also listed as a John R.

5|$|Blount {{entered his}} junior year at Oregon sharing the running back role <b>with</b> <b>senior</b> Jeremiah Johnson. The two backs lived together, and the talkative Johnson advised Blount in his first Pac-10 season. For Blount, {{it was the first}} season in which he split time with another running back, and his {{reaction}} was mixed. The two backs each contributed nearly 100 yards and three touchdowns in an early 63–14 win over the Washington State Cougars, and both again performed well in a late season victory over the Oregon State Beavers. However, Blount would record lackluster performances in games against USC and Cal. Overall, Blount rushed for 17 touchdowns, setting a single-season school record, and 1,002 yards. Blount and Johnson became only the second duo in team history to both clear 1,000 rushing yards in the same season; Johnson led the team with 1,201 yards.|$|E
5|$|Hannah's planned three-year term as Chief of the Air Staff was {{cut short}} by some ten months when he {{accepted}} an offer to serve as Governor of Queensland, becoming the first officer in the RAAF to receive a vice-regal appointment.

Hannah {{did not have a}} strong connection with Queensland {{at the time of his}} appointment, and had only lived in the state during his period as commander of RAAF Station Amberley between 1949 and 1951. He claimed not to have actively sought the governorship, and was criticised for failing to consult <b>with</b> <b>senior</b> colleagues before making his decision to retire early from his position as head of the Air Force. He was replaced as CAS by his deputy, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Marshal Sir) Charles Read.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} a mixed-methods knowledge synthesis {{to assess the}} effectiveness of interventions to improve caregivers' involvement in decision making <b>with</b> <b>seniors,</b> and to describe caregivers' experiences of decision making {{in the absence of}} interventions. We analyzed forty-nine qualitative, fourteen quantitative, and three mixed-methods studies. The qualitative studies indicated that caregivers had unmet needs for information, discussions of values and needs, and decision support, which led to negative sentiments after decision making. Our results indicate that there have been insufficient quantitative evaluations of interventions to involve caregivers in decision making <b>with</b> <b>seniors</b> and that the evaluations that do exist found few clinically significant effects. Elements of usual care that received positive evaluations were the availability of a decision coach and a supportive decision-making environment. Additional rigorously evaluated interventions are needed to help caregivers be more involved in decision making <b>with</b> <b>seniors...</b>|$|R

5|$|Henry's {{network of}} allies in Normandy became {{stronger}} during 1103. Henry married Juliana, {{one of his}} illegitimate daughters, to Eustace of Breteuil, and another illegitimate daughter, Matilda, to Rotrou, the Count of Perche, on the Normandy border. Henry attempted to win over {{other members of the}} Normandy nobility and gave other English estates and lucrative offers to key Norman lords. Duke Robert continued to fight Robert of Bellême, but the Duke's position worsened, until by 1104, he had to ally himself formally with Bellême to survive. Arguing that Duke Robert had broken the terms of their treaty, Henry crossed over the Channel to Domfront, where he met <b>with</b> <b>senior</b> barons from across Normandy, eager to ally themselves with the King. Henry confronted his brother and accused him of siding with his enemies, before returning to England.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Model {{was posted}} to the 3rd Infantry Division, an elite {{formation}} of the Reichswehr and one that was heavily involved in testing the technical innovations of that era. From 1928, he lectured in tactics and war studies for the basic General Staff training course, and in 1930 he {{was transferred to the}} Training Branch of the Truppenamt. He became known both for his enthusiastic support of military modernisation and for his complete lack of tact. In 1938, the year he became a major general (Generalmajor), he led a testfiring of the Mörser 18 on mocked-up Czech fortifications, which did not impress Hitler. As were many army officers at the time, Model was a supporter of the National Socialist government; his time in Berlin also brought him into contact <b>with</b> <b>senior</b> members of the Nazi regime.

5|$|In August 1944 Sayyid Abd al-Rahman met <b>with</b> <b>senior</b> Congress {{members and}} tribal leaders to discuss {{formation}} of a pro-independence political party that {{was not associated with}} Mahdism. The first step taken was to launch a new daily newspaper, al-Umma (The Community). In February 1945 the Umma party had been organized and the party's first secretary, Abdullah Khalil, applied for a government license. The constitution of the party made no mention of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman or of the Ansar; the only visible link to Abd al-Rahman was the party's reliance on him for funding. However, there were rumors that the Umma party had been created by the colonial government and aimed to place Sayyid Abd al-Rahman on the throne. These rumors persisted until June 1945, when the government publicly said it would not support a Mahdist monarchy.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of the 3rd Air Division and later the Third Air Force, he was subordinate to United States Air Forces in Europe, but also {{had to deal with}} USAF headquarters and the Strategic Air Command. He was also designated the point of contact for dealing with the British government. Despite his lowly rank of major general, he was able to hold his own in dealings with more senior British officers, and <b>with</b> <b>senior</b> British officials, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Clement Attlee. His command was understaffed, lacked a clear mission, and there was no agreement with the British government regarding base rights or financial responsibilities. Nor was it easy dealing with his Strategic Air Command colleagues like Archie J. Old, Jr., who were not renowned for diplomatic skill. Johnson's deft touch was perhaps exemplified by his order that the Royal Air Force Ensign be flown over US bases in the UK alongside the flag of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Buczynski's {{continuing}} disagreements <b>with</b> <b>senior</b> {{members of}} the CES led him to resign from the priesthood on August 1, 1975. The New York Temple that he had led subsequently folded. Returning his interest to Wicca, he befriended a Gardnerian high priestess named Sheila Saperton, who had been initiated into the Craft years before by Raymond Buckland. Saperton had become increasingly interested in Buckland's newly developed tradition of Seax-Wica, and founded a Seax coven {{from her home in}} Huntington Station on Long Island. Although never initiated into Seax-Wica, Buczynksi associated with the group, and attended many of their rites. Eventually however, the group tired of the practices of Seax-Wica, and instead transformed into a Gardnerian coven, with Buczynski becoming high priest. Claiming that a mysterious witch known only as Jana, who had been involved in the New Forest coven back in Hampshire, England, had been communicating with him and providing him with a legitimate lineage, he began making further changes to the coven structure. Both Buczynski biographer Michael Lloyd and researcher Philip Heselton have expressed doubt that Jana was ever a real figure operating in England, instead suggesting that she was perhaps an invention of Buczynski's to legitimize his practice of Gardnerian Wica.|$|E

The plans included the 12,000 Chetniks under Jevđević's command, and on 23 February 1943 he concluded an agreement with the Germans that they would not cross the Neretva River and that contact between German and Chetnik troops would be avoided. Early in the operation, Jevđević concluded an agreement for cooperation with the commander of NDH troops in Mostar. Later in the operation Jevđević requested, through the Italians, the assistance of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen in defending Nevesinje, which faced severe pressure from Partisan forces that had broken through the Chetnik lines at the Battle of the Neretva River. Although the Italians also made this request themselves, the Germans declined, stating that the division was reserved for other tasks.|$|E
