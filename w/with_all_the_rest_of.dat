5|$|On June 27, 1955, the Howard Beach station, along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the Rockaway Beach Branch {{stations}} {{south of}} the now defunct Ozone Park station, {{was taken out of}} service for eight months for restructuring and upgrading of the tracks, so that they could accommodate subway service. During the project, the Howard Beach station, along with the Broad Channel and Far Rockaway stations, was completely rebuilt utilizing a modern design, which included a new overhead passageway between the two platforms. The design was created by architect J. Harold Sandifer, a native of the Rockaways. Many of the parts for the station were prefabricated, speeding construction. On June 28, 1956, the station reopened as a subway station {{along with the rest of}} the line. The previous Long Island Rail Road station at this location was razed. Inauguration ceremonies were held at the station as well as at Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn.|$|E

60|$|The native {{inhabitants}} of Regos and Coregos {{consisted of the}} warriors, who did nothing but fight and ravage, and the trembling servants who waited on them.

60|$|The {{next day}} the King took leave of Nottingham Town; so Robin Hood and Little John and Will Scarlet and Allan a Dale shook hands <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the band, kissing the cheeks of each man, and {{swearing}} that they would often come to Sherwood and see them. Then each mounted his horse and rode away in the train of the King.|$|E
60|$|I must here mention, as {{some relief}} to the {{impression}} which Jackson's character must have made upon the reader, that in several ways he at first befriended this boy; but the boy always shrunk from him; till, at last, stung by his conduct, Jackson spoke to him no more; and seemed to hate him, harmless as he was, along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the world.|$|E

60|$|Mountain had not {{mentioned}} his own weakness or the Master's disconcerting gaze upon the thicket, so that (<b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest)</b> his return appeared spontaneous. For all that, a hubbub arose; oaths flew, fists were shaken, and guns pointed.|$|R

60|$|Horatia, {{in common}} <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the womankind, was {{prostrate}} on the cabin floor, treating Cilly's smiles and roses as aggravations of her misery. Had {{there been a}} sharer in her exultation, the gay pitching and dancing of the steamer would have been charming to Lucy, but when she retreated {{from the scene of}} wretchedness below, she felt herself lonely, and was conscious of some surprise among the surviving gentlemen at her reappearance.|$|E
60|$|He then quitted the cabin, {{leaving the}} rest of the party {{wondering}} that they could have been already so lost to the situation of one of their late companions, however different from themselves he might be in opinions and character. But in this they merely showed their common connexion <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the great family of man, who uniformly forget sorrows that do not press too hard on self, in the reaction of their feelings.|$|E
60|$|It may be doubted if the {{increasing}} collective organisation of society {{to which the}} United States of America, in common <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the world, seem to be tending will be to any very large extent a national organisation. The constitution is an immense and complicated barrier to effectual centralisation. There are many reasons for supposing the national government will always remain a little ineffectual and detached from the full flow of American life, and this notwithstanding the very great powers with which the President is endowed.|$|E

60|$|As {{he threw}} down his book, {{stretched}} his legs towards the embers in the grate, and {{clasped his hands}} {{at the back of}} his head, in that agreeable afterglow of excitement when thought lapses from examination of a specific object into a suffusive sense of its connections <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> our existence--seems, as it were, to throw itself on its back after vigorous swimming and float with the repose of unexhausted strength--Lydgate felt a triumphant delight in his studies, and something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his profession.|$|E

"In Anglia King Guthrum {{has divided}} the land among his jarls, {{and there they}} seem {{disposed}} to settle down; but elsewhere they care not for the land, preferring to leave it {{in the hands of}} its former owners to till, and after to wring from the cultivators the fruits of the harvest; then, as the country becomes thoroughly impoverished, they must move elsewhere. Mercia they can overrun whensoever they choose, and after that there is nothing for them to do but to sweep down again upon Wessex, and <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> England at their feet it is hopeless to think that we alone can withstand their united power." ...|$|E
6000|$|Milly {{tried to}} be amused, so as not--it was too absurd--to be fairly frightened. Strange enough indeed--if not natural enough--that, late at night thus, in a mere {{mercenary}} house, with Susie away, a want of confidence should possess her. She recalled, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> it, the next day, piecing things together in the dawn, that she had felt herself alone with a creature who paced like a panther. That was a violent image, but it made her a little less ashamed of having been scared. For all her scare, none the less, she had now the sense to find words. [...] "And yet without Susie I shouldn't have had you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{the steamer}} {{was sent to}} Hay and Wright’s {{shipyard}} at Oakland Creek.

60|$|Particularly to {{be noted}} in Lady Byron was her {{peculiar}} interest in reclaiming fallen women. Among her letters to Mrs. Prof. Follen, of Cambridge, was one addressed to {{a society of}} ladies who had undertaken this difficult work. It was full of heavenly wisdom and of a large and tolerant charity. Fenelon truly says, it is only perfection that can tolerate imperfection; and the very purity of Lady Byron's nature made her most forbearing and most tender towards the weak and the guilty. This letter, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> Lady Byron's, was returned to the hands of her executors after her death. Its publication would greatly assist the world in understanding the peculiarities of its writer's character.|$|E
60|$|Three {{days after}} her return to the ranch Madeline could not {{discover}} any physical discomfort {{as a reminder of}} her adventurous experiences. This surprised her, but not nearly so much as the fact that after a few weeks she found she scarcely remembered the adventures at all. If it had not been for the quiet and persistent guardianship of her cowboys she might almost have forgotten Don Carlos and the raiders. Madeline was assured of the splendid physical fitness to which this ranch life had developed her, and that she was assimilating something of the Western disregard of danger. A hard ride, an accident, a day in the sun and dust, an adventure with outlaws--these might once have been matters of large import, but now for Madeline they were in order <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> her changed life.|$|E
60|$|But Martin forgave him the sneer, for he {{had begun}} to {{discover}} that Olney was not in love with Ruth. Later, he was dumfounded to learn from various little happenings not only that Olney did not care for Ruth, but that he had a positive dislike for her. Martin could not understand this. It was a bit of phenomena that he could not correlate <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> the phenomena in the universe. But nevertheless he felt sorry for the young fellow because of the great lack in his nature that prevented him from a proper appreciation of Ruth's fineness and beauty. They rode out into the hills several Sundays on their wheels, and Martin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed between Ruth and Olney. The latter chummed with Norman, throwing Arthur and Martin into company with Ruth, for which Martin was duly grateful.|$|E
60|$|The Imperialists, eager in the pursuit, {{left him}} unbroken, till the Spanish brigade {{came up and}} charged him. These he bravely repulsed with a great slaughter, and after them a body of dragoons; till being laid at on every side, {{and most of his}} men killed, the brave old general, <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> who were left, were made prisoners.|$|R

6000|$|... "So do I," [...] said Moonlight firmly. But Moonlight was wrong, for {{she hated}} the man with {{only a very small}} portion of her heart, and loved him <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest.</b> It was {{probably}} some faint recognition of this fact that induced her to add with the intense energy of one who is resolved to walk in the path of duty--"I hate <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Blackfeet!" ...|$|R
