5|$|Mary Dudley {{said that}} if this were not true, I might be sure she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> {{such a thing as}} it might cost her her life and she was acting now with the Queen's consent, but she (the Queen) would not speak to the Emperor's {{ambassador}} about it.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{database}} {{would not}} hold case or assessment material or any subjective observations. The database could include information of a 'sensitive' nature, defined as {{issues relating to}} sexual health, mental health and substance abuse, although consent from the child or the child’s guardians would have been needed, {{and it would not}} have appeared as such on the database; it would only note that the child was receiving help from 'sensitive services' and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> what this was. Refusal of consent could be overridden if this could be justified. Margaret Hodge, then children’s minister, had said that drug or alcohol use by parents, relatives and neighbours, together with other aspects of their behaviour, may be recorded. Government guidelines reveal that other information recorded may have included 'family routines', evidence of a 'disorgan-ised/chaotic lifestyle', 'ways in which the family’s income was used', signs of mental illness or alcohol misuse by relatives, and 'any serious difficulties in the parents’ relationship'.|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>say</b> such things, for if {{anything}} {{should happen to}} either of you, the other one would feel so sorry. Every cross word I ever said to Jimmy comes back now, and makes me wish I had n't." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{the other}} <b>would</b> <b>not,</b> <b>saying</b> {{that it was}} better that things should take their course. Notwithstanding that Swetman importuned him, he only added, 'If I never come again, do with my {{belongings}} as you list. In the pocket you will find a gold snuff-box, and in the snuff-box fifty gold pieces.' ...|$|R
25|$|While most Pentecostals and Charismatics {{believe the}} Bible {{to be the}} {{ultimate}} authority and <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they do believe that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible.|$|E
25|$|She {{started with}} John, Paul, and Luke, and then laid {{them in her}} bed. She then drowned Mary, whom she left {{floating}} in the tub. Noah came in and asked {{what was wrong with}} Mary. He then ran, but she soon caught and drowned him. She left him floating in the tub and laid Mary in John's arms in the bed. She then called the police repeatedly saying she needed an officer but <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> why. Then she called Rusty, telling him to come home right away.|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2010, Albuquerque police {{released}} six {{photos of}} seven unidentified women who {{may also be}} linked to West Mesa. Some of the women appear to be unconscious, and many share the same physical characteristics as the original 11 victims. The following day the police released an additional photograph of another woman; this woman was subsequently identified by family members, who reported that she had {{died of natural causes}} several years ago. On December 13, 2010, police reported that two {{of the women in the}} photos had been identified as alive, and could have valuable information if they can be located. Police <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> how or where they had obtained the photos.|$|E
60|$|MRS. JONES. [Twisting her hands.] Of course I <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>say</b> I had <b>n't</b> {{taken it}} if I had--and I {{did n't take}} it, indeed I did n't. Of course I know {{appearances}} are against me, and I can't tell you what really happened: But my children are at school, and they'll be coming home--and I don't know what they'll do without me.|$|R

6000|$|... "In with you, Tars Tarkas," [...] I cried, but he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> go; <b>saying</b> {{that his}} bulk was too {{great for the}} little aperture, while I might slip in easily.|$|R
500|$|Nina was {{initially}} {{meant to be}} a [...] "bad girl", but the writers rewrote the part for Goodrem, and the character became a [...] "painfully shy schoolgirl" [...] who gets a job in the Coffee Shop. The Age described Nina as the [...] "quintessential girl next door". Goodrem described her character as [...] "a quiet, unassuming type of girl", who did not think anything of her amazing gift. When Goodrem was asked if she was similar to Nina, she replied [...] "I think I am in some ways and in some ways I'm not. Nina's very shy, I really like the character Nina but I think she'd probably walk out of a room and I'd probably chat all day I think that's probably the difference, she'd sneak out of a room and I'd stay!" [...] The BBC agreed with Goodrem and said that Nina <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> [...] "boo to a goose" [...] and would flee if anyone looked her way.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{had been}} warned before he began his work that he would face difficulties, but was {{unprepared}} for the level of harassment that he endured. While researching the book in the U.S., he was spied upon and was constantly followed. His friends and business associates also received hostile visits from Scientologists and private detectives trying to find [...] "dirt" [...] on him. In October 1987, Miller commented: [...] "There are teams of private detectives in the U.S. and this country questioning my friends and trying to discredit me." [...] Attempts were made to implicate him {{in the murder of}} a private detective in South London, for a fire in a Wiltshire aircraft factory and for the murder of American singer Dean Reed. Reed had died the day before Miller had arrived in East Berlin to interview him. Miller's family was approached by private detectives seeking to implicate him in Reed's death, although they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> who their client was. Another private investigator interviewed Miller's friends and associates, claiming to be acting for Reed's family, though they denied employing him. A former Scientology insider told the Sunday Times that Miller [...] "is kept under constant watch. Every time he goes abroad a two-man mission will be waiting for him at the airport when he arrives. They will monitor where he goes, who he sees, where he stays. This information will be added to his file, which is already more than 100 pages thick." ...|$|E
500|$|The press heard rumours about Lennon's {{wife and}} child {{at the end of}} 1963—after Beatlemania had already swept the UK and Europe—and descended on her mother's house in Hoylake (where mother and son were staying), in November and December. Friends and {{neighbours}} protected their anonymity, but she was often approached by journalists. In November she had her son christened at the Hoylake parish church, but didn't tell Lennon (who was on tour at the time), because she feared a media circus. She told him two days after, and he was angry as he hadn't wanted his son to be christened, even though Epstein had asked to be Julian's godfather. Not long after the christening, every newspaper was full of the story about Lennon's secret wife and baby boy. Epstein told the other Beatles {{to make the best of}} the situation, and hoped newspapers <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> Cynthia was pregnant before marrying him. [...] After living at Lennon's aunt's house for some months, the couple [...] moved to London and found a three-bedroomed flat at 13 Emperor's Gate, off Cromwell Road. The top floor flat was the third of three, which were each built over two floors. This meant climbing six flights of stairs, as the building had no lift. Cynthia firstly had to carry Julian up to the flat, and then go back down to collect shopping bags. The Beatles' fans soon found out where they were living, and she would find them camping out in the hallway, and have to push through them when leaving or arriving.|$|E
6000|$|We are {{now come}} to another of his postures. He <b>would</b> <b>not,</b> <b>says</b> the text, so much as lift up his eyes to heaven. Here, therefore, was another gesture added to that which went before; and a gesture that a great while before had been {{condemned}} by the Holy Ghost himself. [...] "Is it such a fast that I have chosen, {{a day for a}} man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a bulrush?" [...] Isa. lviii. 5.|$|R
60|$|Now Pharaoh {{whispered to}} Tua {{to put on}} one of the necklaces, but she <b>would</b> <b>not,</b> <b>saying</b> that the colour of the stones did not match her white robe and the blue lotus flowers which she wore. Instead, she thanked Amathel coldly but courteously, and without looking at his gifts, told the royal Nurse, Asti, who stood behind her, to bear them away and to place them at a distance, as the {{perfumes}} that had been poured over them, oppressed her. Only, as though by an afterthought, she bade them leave the ivory harp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>not.</b> Better women <b>would</b> <b>not.</b> People <b>say</b> I must be cold-natured--sexless--on {{account of}} it. But I won't have it! Some {{of the most}} passionately erotic poets {{have been the most}} {{self-contained}} in their daily lives." ...|$|R

2500|$|Valerie Wilson {{also told}} the committee: [...] "For {{those of us}} that were {{undercover}} in the CIA, we tended to use 'covert' or 'undercover' interchangeably. I'm not—we typically <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> of ourselves {{we were in a}} 'classified' position. You're kind of undercover or overt employees." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Brings Plenty, {{chairman}} of the Cheyenne River Lakota, agreed that the Lakota Freedom Delegation [...] "are not representative of the nation I represent" [...] but <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> whether he agreed or disagreed with their goals and message, noting some value in the group's actions in raising awareness {{for the history of}} the Lakota people.|$|E
60|$|Now {{when she}} had sobbed her fill of joy, Umslopogaas brought Nada the Lily mass to eat and mealie {{porridge}}. She ate the curdled milk, but the porridge she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> eat, <b>saying</b> that she was too weary.|$|R
60|$|What {{would you}} say of a dramatist who would take nobody but virtuous people as {{characters}} in his play? <b>Would</b> you <b>not</b> <b>say</b> he was missing half of life? Well, of the young artist who paints nothing but beautiful things, I say he misses {{one half of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|On 15 January 2014, Bamanga Tukur {{resigned}} as Chairman of the PDP. Tukur {{had insisted that}} he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> resign, <b>saying</b> {{that it was only}} the party's convention that could remove him, but he was said to have been pressured to resign by his son, Anwal.|$|R
2500|$|A worshiper who {{has joined}} a {{congregation}} prayer late after missing rakats {{is called a}} masbuq. [...] The masbuq would join {{with the rest of}} the group in prayer, however, when the taslim is said at the end, he or she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> the taslim but would instead stand up and continue for the number of rakats missed. If he or she joined after the bowing stage of a rakat, then he or she would have considered to have missed that rakat.|$|E
2500|$|The PAC took {{in about}} $113,700 between February 2005, when it registered, and June 2006. [...] Of that, more than $42,000 {{was used to}} pay the salary and {{expenses}} of Willis-Leon. (Willis-Leon has disputed the amount of her compensation — which was calculated from government records by the Center for Responsive Politics, a political watchdog group — but <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> what the correct amount was). [...] Of the $113,700 in revenues, $46,000 came from Letitia White, her husband Richard, and small defense contractors represented by Copeland Lowery.|$|E
2500|$|He had courage {{amounting to}} insanity, {{as well as}} {{displays}} {{of a lack of}} responsibility. I <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> the same about his civil courage. Once Ben Gurion had asked me—what do I think of the decision to appoint Dayan as the Minister of Agriculture in his government. I said that it is important that Dayan sits in every government because of his brilliant mind—but never as prime minister. Ben Gurion asked: [...] "why not as prime minister?". I replied then: [...] "because he does not accept responsibility".|$|E
6000|$|... "That, general, is a {{point that}} I <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} about.

6000|$|... 'I <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> <b>say</b> them,' {{she murmured}} first. It struck her then that this declining {{altogether}} {{was the same}} cowardice in another dress, and was delivering her poor Edward over to Satan just as unceremoniously as before. 'Yes; I will say my prayers, and you shall hear me,' she added firmly.|$|R
2500|$|Though the Luke and Noah romance {{garnered}} positive reaction, Tharrington and CBS {{officials said}} they heard complaints from viewers opposed to the storyline. They <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> which side draws a bigger response. The American Family Association, a conservative group based in Tupelo, Mississippi, had received hundreds of complaints about the Luke and Noah romance [...] particularly their kisses, said Randy Sharp, the group's spokesman. [...] "It was a big turnoff for them," [...] Sharp said. [...] "The word 'repulsive' was used once or twice. 'Offensive' was used more than once.... It was overtly gratuitous. It's not necessary to the storyline itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, January 13, 2012, Dish CEO Aaron Kask {{announced}} that while Dish {{had planned to}} keep 90% of the stores in operation, meaning around 15,000 employees would remain employed, because of market factors [...] "there are ones that aren't going to make it. We will close unprofitable stores. We will close additional stores." [...] Kask did not say when these additional closings would happen and only remarked that some stores were unprofitable. The Dish chief <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> which stores the company was planning to close, but that each potential closing was to be assessed on a [...] "case by case basis".|$|E
2500|$|In his essay, [...] "On Referring", P. F. Strawson criticised Russell's {{characterisation}} {{of statements}} where the object does not exist, such as [...] "the present King of France", as being false. Such statements, Strawson held, are neither true nor false but, rather, absurd. Strawson believed that, contrary to Russell, use does determine {{the meaning of}} a sentence. To give {{the meaning of a}}n expression is to [...] "give general directions for its use." [...] Because of this, Strawson argued that, were someone to say the King of France was wise, we <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> their statement is true or false, but, rather, decide they must be under a misapprehension since, normally, the question would not arise as there is no King of France.|$|E
