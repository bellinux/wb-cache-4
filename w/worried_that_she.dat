When she is unable to help someone, she gets terribly <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing {{him or her to}} someone who can. Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders to make sure no human is harmed when in her care.|$|E
5|$|Corder {{wished to}} keep his {{relationship}} with Marten a secret, but {{she gave birth to}} their child in 1827 at the age of 25, and she was apparently keen that she and Corder should marry. The child died (later reports suggested that it may have been murdered), but Corder apparently still intended to marry Marten. That summer, in the presence of her stepmother, Ann Marten, he suggested that she meet him at the Red Barn, from where he proposed that they elope to Ipswich. Corder claimed that he had heard rumours that the parish officers were going to prosecute Maria for having bastard children. He initially suggested that they elope on the Wednesday evening, but later decided to delay until the Thursday evening. On Thursday, he was again delayed; his brother falling ill is mentioned as the reason in some sources, although most claim that all his brothers were dead by this time. On Friday, 18 May 1827, he appeared at the Martens' cottage during the day and, according to Ann Marten, he told Maria that they must leave at once, as he had heard that the local constable had obtained a warrant to prosecute her (no warrant had been obtained, but it is not known if Corder was lying or was mistaken). Maria was <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not leave in broad daylight, but Corder told her that she should dress in men's clothing so as to avert suspicion, and he would carry her things to the barn where she could meet him and change before they continued on to Ipswich.|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{he murdered}} {{a student at}} the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind in Talladega and her two children. Sherri Weathers had missed classes for over a week, and the school had <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had not {{contacted}} them with an explanation. A search of her apartment found her dead body, along with those of her two children. Investigation also revealed another student who was missing from the institute. Linda Jarman was found dead in her apartment, also murdered. He was also charged with the murder of Linda Odum, a waitress who he had been dating. She was reported missing in February and her remains discovered in March. Fingerprints linked Siebert to her stolen car. Police believed Siebert was also involved in the death of Sheryl Evans of Calhoun County, whose body was found around the same time. Finally, Siebert was charged with the death of Beatrice McDougall in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1986. In custody, Siebert said he had committed 12 or more murders.|$|E
25|$|As {{this is all}} happening, Greenlee and Leo's {{feelings}} for each other continue to deepen and they finally admit that they have {{fallen in love with}} each other. The road to romance starts out rocky, with the two of them ending up in many misunderstandings. During one of Greenlee's attempts to win him back after a fight, Greenlee and Leo inadvertently learn that Leo's friend, Bianca Montgomery is a lesbian. Greenlee promptly nicknames the young woman LesBianca. Jealous of his friendships with Bianca and Laura English, a drugged Greenlee pushes Laura off a yacht, while a horrified Bianca looks on. In order to silence her, Greenlee threatens to tell Bianca's mother, Erica Kane, that Bianca is gay. Greenlee later makes good on her threat and publicly outs Bianca. Leo finds out and ends his relationship with Greenlee, although the two eventually reconcile. When Greenlee proposes to Leo, he accepts, though he is <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will find out that his original interest in her was to steal her trust fund. Although he no longer cares about the money and is truly in love with her, Greenlee feels too betrayed to believe Leo when she learns the truth and breaks up with him.|$|E
25|$|Richard and Susan's Mexican nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), {{tends to}} their {{children}}, Debbie (Elle Fanning) and Mike (Nathan Gamble), in their San Diego, California home {{while they are}} in Morocco. When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced {{to take care of}} the children longer than planned and becomes <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she has to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near Tijuana, Mexico. Her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) offers to take her and the kids to the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her to take them out of the United States. Intoxicated and worried, Santiago trespasses the border. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, attempting to lead off the police; his fate after this is unknown.|$|E

500|$|The Kedara Khanda {{chapter of}} the Skanda Purana {{presents}} a very different version. In this version, after the burning of Kama, Parvati is <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not achieve Shiva in absence of Kama. Parvati is consoled by Rati, who asserts that she will revive Kama and starts severe austerities to achieve her goal. Once, the divine sage Narada asks her [...] "whose she was". Agitated, Rati insults Narada. The spiteful Narada provokes the demon Sambara to kidnap Rati. Sambara takes her to his house, but is unable to touch her as the goddess decreed {{that he would be}} reduced to ashes if he touches her. There, Rati becomes the [...] "kitchen in-charge" [...] and is known as Mayavati ("mistress of illusion – Maya").|$|E
500|$|Evaluation of the {{strategic}} results is likewise disputed. The blockade was maintained, even strengthened, and Virginia was bottled up in Hampton Roads. [...] Because a decisive Confederate weapon was negated, some {{have concluded that the}} Union could claim a strategic victory. Confederate advocates can counter, however, by arguing that Virginia had a military significance larger than the blockade, which was {{only a small part of}} the war in Tidewater Virginia. Her mere presence was sufficient to close the James River to Federal incursions. She also imposed other constraints on the Peninsula Campaign then being mounted by the Union Army under General George B. McClellan, who <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could interfere with his positions on the York River. [...] Although his fears were baseless, they continued to affect the movements of his army until Virginia was destroyed.|$|E

500|$|Series writer Simon Ashdown {{explained}} that Danielle initially chose to conceal her identity from Ronnie {{due to her}} fear of being rejected.

Crace observed that Danielle was intrigued by Ronnie and the Mitchells, but also <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was too different from them and may be a disappointment to Ronnie. Danielle's pregnancy {{was used as a}} plot-device to bring the two closer together. Crace deemed the development [...] "a huge thing" [...] for Danielle, as contrary to her constant rejection, the one person she most desired support from was finally showing her affection. However, Ronnie's failure to attend Danielle's second clinic appointment signified [...] "a step back" [...] for the character, leaving her [...] "hurt and distraught" [...] and less willing to confide the truth in Ronnie than ever.|$|E
500|$|Other {{times on}} the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous {{experience}} that [...] "cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'.

Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. [...] "There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe," [...] she said. [...] "'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'" [...] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds," [...] he said. The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him [...] "Mij" [...] (Jim spelt backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, [...] "Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics." ...|$|E

She burnt all the letters of Philippe's lovers through the years lest they fall into [...] "the wrong hands", noting that the scent of the perfumed letters nauseated her. Louis XIV assured the new Duke of Orléans, formerly the Duke of Chartres, that the past was forgotten and that henceforth he was to look on him as his father. The court was devastated and his old friend, Louis XIV's discarded mistress Madame de Montespan, was also greatly affected, the two having been very close.|$|E
2500|$|In 688, Empress Dowager Wu {{was set to}} {{make sacrifices}} to the deity of the Luo River (洛水, flowing through the Henan {{province}} city of Luoyang, then the [...] "Eastern Capital"). Wu summoned senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan to Luoyang. The imperial princes <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> planned to slaughter them and secure the throne for herself: thus, they plotted to resist her. Before a rebellion could be comprehensively planned out, however, Li Zhen and his son Li Chong, the Prince of Langye rose first, at their respective posts as prefects of Yu Prefecture (豫州, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan) and Bo Prefecture (博州, roughly modern Liaocheng, Shandong). The other princes were not yet ready, however, and did not rise, and forces sent by Empress Dowager Wu and the local forces crushed Li Chong and Li Zhen's forces quickly. Empress Dowager Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong's granduncles Li Yuanjia (李元嘉) the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui (李靈夔) the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, {{as well as many}} other members of the Li clan and she forced them to commit suicide. Even Princess Taiping's husband Xue Shao was implicated and starved to death. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members.|$|E
2500|$|In a plot twist, it was {{revealed}} to viewers that Archie had lied, and that Amy was alive. She {{was introduced to the}} series under her adopted name, Danielle Jones, in August 2008. Danielle arrived in Walford seeking Ronnie, but kept her true identity a secret through fear of rejection. Series writer Simon Ashdown described her as [...] "hurt and broken by her life", and hoping to charm Ronnie into liking her before revealing the truth. Crace observed that Danielle was intrigued by Ronnie and the Mitchells, but also <b>worried</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was too different from them and might be a disappointment to Ronnie. Danielle became pregnant, which was used as a plot-device to bring the two closer together, with Ronnie supporting her when she chose to have an abortion. The writers deliberately played on the tragedy of Ronnie being unaware that she was encouraging the abortion of her own grandchild. Ronnie failed to attend Danielle's second clinic appointment, which Crace stated left her character [...] "hurt and distraught" [...] and less willing to confide the truth in Ronnie than ever. On Ronnie's part, Womack assessed that her character was unaware why she had bonded with Danielle. She deemed her totally unaware of any physical resemblance between herself and Danielle, and stated that she had never entertained the notion that Danielle might be her daughter.|$|E
