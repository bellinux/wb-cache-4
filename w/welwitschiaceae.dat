50|$|German naturalist Friedrich Markgraf {{coined the}} name <b>Welwitschiaceae</b> in 1926, which {{appeared}} in Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien.|$|E
50|$|Most botanists {{have treated}} Welwitschia as a {{distinct}} monotypic genus in a monotypic family or even order. Most recent systems place Welwitschia mirabilis in its own family <b>Welwitschiaceae</b> in the gymnosperm order Gnetales.|$|E
50|$|As a taxonomist, he {{circumscribed}} {{the plant}} families Sarcolaenaceae, Stemonaceae and <b>Welwitschiaceae,</b> {{and was the}} botanical authority of several genera and numerous species. The genus Caruelina (family Rubiaceae) was named in his honor by Otto Kuntze.|$|E
50|$|<b>Welwitschiaceae</b> is {{a family}} of plants of the order Gnetales with one living species, Welwitschia mirabilis, found in southwestern Africa. Three fossil species have been {{recovered}} from the Crato Formation - late Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) strata located in the Araripe Basin in northeastern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|The paleotropical flora is {{characterized}} by about 40 endemic plant families, the most famous being Nepenthaceae, Musaceae, Pandanaceae and Flagellariaceae, but including also Matoniaceae, Dipteridaceae, Stangeriaceae, <b>Welwitschiaceae,</b> Degeneriaceae, Rafflesiaceae, Didiereaceae, Didymelaceae, Ancistrocladaceae, Dioncophyllaceae, Scytopetalaceae (Scytopetalum), Medusagynaceae, Scyphostegiaceae (Scyphostegia), Sarcolaenaceae, Sphaerosepalaceae, Huaceae, Pandaceae, Crypteroniaceae, Duabangaceae, Strephonemataceae (Strephonema), Psiloxylaceae, Dirachmaceae, Phellinaceae, Lophopyxidaceae, Salvadoraceae, Medusandraceae, Mastixiaceae (Mastixia), Hoplestigmataceae (Hoplestigma) and Lowiaceae.|$|E
5000|$|Most recent systems {{place the}} <b>Welwitschiaceae</b> in the {{gymnosperm}} order Gnetales. This order is most {{closely related to}} the order Pinales, which includes pines, spruces, larches and firs. [...] Genetic analyses indicate that the Gnetales arose from within the conifer group, and any morphological similarities between angiosperms and Gnetales have evolved separately. [...] The ancestors of the extant gymnosperm orders—Gnetales, Coniferales, Cycadales and Ginkgoales—arose during the Late Paleozoic, and became the dominant component of the Late Permian and Mesozoic flora.|$|E
5000|$|Welwitschia is a {{monotypic}} gymnosperm genus, comprising solely {{the distinctive}} Welwitschia mirabilis. The plant is commonly {{known simply as}} welwitschia in English, but the name tree tumbo is also used. It is called kharos or khurub in Nama, tweeblaarkanniedood in Afrikaans, nyanka in Damara, and onyanga in Herero. Welwitschia is the only living genus of the family <b>Welwitschiaceae</b> and order Welwitschiales, in the division Gnetophyta. Informal sources commonly refer to the plant as a [...] "living fossil". Welwitschia mirabilis is endemic to the Namib desert within Namibia and Angola.|$|E
50|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates {{that members of the}} <b>Welwitschiaceae</b> were present in South America during the Early Cretaceous (Mesozoic era). Priscowelwitschia austroamericana (initially named Welwitschiella but illegitimate due to the daisy genus Welwitschiella) is a fossil taxon referring to some seedlings with cotyledon leaves. These have many features in common with Welwitschia seedlings. Welwitschiophyllum brasiliense is a taxon known from thick triangular to linear leaves that range from 8.9 to 70 cm long and 2.8-5 cm wide. Welwitschiostrobus murili is a fossil taxon known from some cones that resemble the living Welwitschia, but are longer and thinner.|$|E
50|$|Gnetophyta is a {{division}} of plants, grouped within the gymnosperms (which also includes conifers, cycads, and ginkgos), that consists of some 70 species across the three relict genera: Gnetum (family Gnetaceae), Welwitschia (family <b>Welwitschiaceae),</b> and Ephedra (family Ephedraceae). Fossilized pollen attributed to a close relative of Ephedra has been dated {{as far back as}} the Early Cretaceous. Though diverse and dominant in the Tertiary, only three families, each containing a single genus, are still alive today. The primary difference between gnetophytes and other gymnosperms is the presence of vessel elements, a system of conduits that transport water within the plant, similar to those found in flowering plants. Because of this, gnetophytes were once thought to be the closest gymnosperm relatives to flowering plants, but more recent molecular studies have largely disproven this hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Welwitschia mirabilis is {{the only}} extant {{member of the family}} <b>Welwitschiaceae,</b> one of three {{lineages}} of gnetophytes, an enigmatic group of gymnosperms variously allied with flowering plants or conifers. Limited sequence data and rapid divergence rates have precluded consensus on the evolutionary placement of gnetophytes based on molecular characters. Here we report on the first complete gnetophyte chloroplast genome sequence, from Welwitschia mirabilis, as well as analyses on divergence rates of protein-coding genes, comparisons of gene content and order, and phylogenetic implications. Results The chloroplast genome of Welwitschia mirabilis [GenBank: EU 342371] is comprised of 119, 726 base pairs and exhibits large and small single copy regions and two copies of the large inverted repeat (IR). Only 101 unique gene species are encoded. The Welwitschia plastome is the most compact photosynthetic land plant plastome sequenced to date; 66 % of the sequence codes for product. The genome also exhibits a slightly expanded IR, a minimum of 9 inversions that modify gene order, and 19 genes that are lost or present as pseudogenes. Phylogenetic analyses, including one representative of each extant seed plant lineage and based on 57 concatenated protein-coding sequences, place Welwitschia at the base of all seed plants (distance, maximum parsimony) or as the sister to Pinus (the only conifer representative) in a monophyletic gymnosperm clade (maximum likelihood, bayesian). Relative rate tests on these gene sequences show the Welwitschia sequences to be evolving at faster rates than other seed plants. For these genes individually, a comparison of average pairwise distances indicates that relative divergence in Welwitschia ranges from amounts about equal to other seed plants to amounts almost three times greater than the average for non-gnetophyte seed plants. Conclusion Although the basic organization of the Welwitschia plastome is typical, its compactness, gene content and high nucleotide divergence rates are atypical. The current lack of additional conifer plastome sequences precludes any discrimination between the gnetifer and gnepine hypotheses of seed plant relationships. However, both phylogenetic analyses and shared genome features identified here are consistent with either of the hypotheses that link gnetophytes with conifers, but are inconsistent with the anthophyte hypothesis. </p...|$|E
