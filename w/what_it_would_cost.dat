25|$|The {{second meeting}} in New York was {{attended}} by Levine, Bellanca, and Chamberlin. With check in hand, Levine added a stipulation that Columbia Aircraft would select the crew on the flight, which Lindbergh objected to. Reminding Lindbergh that the WB-2 was the only plane that could make the flight at the time, they made him leave and call {{back the next day}} to reconsider. The terms did not change, and Lindbergh returned to St. Louis without an airplane. Lindbergh then approached Travel Air Manufacturing Company, asking for a Travel Air 5000 modified with a Wright Whirlwind motor and was declined. Lindbergh also inquired <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> to buy a Fokker for the attempt; he was given a quote of $100,000 for a custom trimotor, and was told that Fokker would not build a single-engine craft for a transatlantic flight. Lindbergh instead purchased a single-place aircraft from Ryan aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, for $6000.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{has argued}} {{that it needs to}} {{increase}} capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years. However, despite an initial request for more than $2.1 billion in funding for the year, the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations, dropping to under $1.4 billion {{for the first time in}} several years. Amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the Northeast Corridor included over 200 bridges, most dating to the 19th century, tunnels under Baltimore dating to the American Civil War Era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost $5.2 billion to repair (more than triple Amtrak's total annual budget). Amtrak's budget is only allocated on a yearly basis, and it has been argued by Joseph Vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossible.|$|E

This is the only agreement that a country ever signed with Nazi Germany for deportation of Jews. Bulgaria had to pay all transportation costs and promise never to claim those Jews as citizens!

According to Chuck Jones, Disney was able to complete the film for about half of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>cost</b> if they had had to animate all the dogs and spots. To achieve the spotted dalmatians, the animators used to think of the spot pattern as a constellation. Once they had an [...] "anchor spot", the next was placed in relation to that one spot, and so on until the full pattern was achieved. All totaled, the film featured 6,469,952 spots, with Pongo sporting 72 spots, Perdita 68, and each puppy 32.|$|R
2500|$|The Kaldor {{criterion}} is that {{an activity}} moves the economy closer to Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the gainers are prepared to pay to the losers {{to agree to the}} change is greater than the minimum amount losers are prepared to accept; the Hicks criterion {{is that an}} activity moves the economy toward Pareto optimality if the maximum amount the losers would pay the gainers to forgo the change is less than the minimum amount the gainers would accept to so agree. Thus, the Kaldor test supposes that losers could prevent the arrangement and asks whether gainers value their gain so much they would and could pay losers to accept the arrangement, whereas the Hicks test supposes that gainers are able to proceed with the change and asks whether losers consider their loss to be worth less than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>cost</b> them to pay gainers to agree not to proceed with the change. After several technical problems with each separate criterion were discovered, they were combined into the Scitovsky criterion, more commonly known as the [...] "Kaldor–Hicks criterion", which does not share the same flaws.|$|E

50|$|There {{was some}} disquiet in Australia over this {{challenge}} as many felt that Jim Paddon {{was a better}} sculler and as a previous world title challenger he had more right to a race than Felton did. However, Felton was on the spot as {{he had not yet}} been repatriated home, and the cost of his challenge was only about half of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>cost</b> to send an Australian to England. Felton also had the advantage of being acclimatised to the Northern conditions. There was some difficulty in Felton raising the stake and expenses but eventually the Australian Prime Minister and the general public who were both keen to see the title return to Australia came to his aide and provided the cash.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{is famous}} for its enormous, {{specially}} constructed set and background stage, known as 'Tativille', which contributed significantly to the film's large budget, said to be 17 million francs. The set required a hundred construction workers to construct along with its own power plant. Budget crises and other disasters stretched the shooting schedule to three years, including 1.4 million francs in repairs after the set was damaged by storms. [...] Tati observed, perhaps correctly, that the cost of building the set was no greater than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>cost</b> to have hired Elizabeth Taylor or Sophia Loren for the leading role. Budget overruns forced Tati to take out large loans and personal overdrafts to cover ever-increasing production costs.|$|R

We consider two media planning scenarios: <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>cost</b> for the TV ad campaign to have delivered the equivalent of the online incremental reach, and what saving could have been achieved by having spent less on TV ads and complementing them with online ads for a given reach goal. ...|$|R

40|$|Academic {{libraries}} will be circulating print {{books for}} a long time to come. But circulation stats continue to fall in tandem with budget allocations for print resources, and students and faculty increasingly demand access to books online. So what would happen if we stopped buying print books altogether? Could a small to medium-sized academic library adequately support existing student and faculty research with an entirely electronic book collection? In an attempt to answer these questions, circulation statistics for print books will be examined in relation to market availability of equivalent ebook titles. The presentation will focus on the availability in electronic format of a sample of print titles circulated in the past year at Royal Roads University Library, what that electronic access actually looks like, and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> all <b>cost</b> compared to purchasing and maintaining the equivalent in print.

50|$|In 1860, {{damage caused}} by {{repeated}} frost heave after water leaked through the puddling of the trough had to be urgently repaired by Charles Sacré, chief engineer of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, which then owned the canal. He tied together the two faces above the central arch by 2-inch bolts through the structure, secured by the plates that can still be seen. A hundred years later a similar problem was ignored by British Waterways (BW) and {{on the night of}} 9 January 1962 the outer face of the north-east arch collapsed. BW, supported by the Ministry of Transport, thought that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be 'a complete waste of money' to do other than demolish the aqueduct and formally close the lower Peak Forest and Ashton Canals. However, it was saved by the intervention of Mr Geoffrey Rippon, the Minister of Public Buildings and Works, who facilitated an agreement whereby a sympathetic Cheshire County Council funded the extra cost of full restoration, over and above <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>cost</b> BW to demolish it, {{under the terms of the}} Local Authorities (Historic Buildings) Act 1962, which Rippon himself had steered through Parliament.

5000|$|The {{proposal}} to increase local content {{had long been}} advocated local producers, writers and actors, but it was bitterly opposed by the networks, who relied {{on being able to}} buy large blocks of American programming at a fraction of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>cost</b> to produce similar shows locally. The problem was compounded by the Whitlam government's far-reaching 1973 decision to reduce tariffs across the board by 25% in the first move towards today's highly successful [...] "free trade" [...] policies. The immediate result of the tariff reduction was that overseas programming became even cheaper. Also at this time, the networks were being targeted by the [...] "TV - Make It Australian" [...] campaign, which involved a number of prominent Australian actors and TV personalities including Kennedy and several leading actors from the popular police shows made by Crawford Productions, notably Gerard Kennedy and Charles [...] "Bud" [...] Tingwell. The cancellation of all three major Crawford Productions police shows within months of each other during 1975 has been portrayed by Tingwell and others as an act of revenge by the networks for Crawford's active support for the campaign and the participation of its contract players. Following this logic, Blundell suggests that Kennedy too was a victim of the Nine TV network's sensitivity about the local content issue. It has also been suggested that, with a federal election looming, Nine used the crow call incident as a pretext to remove the politically vocal Kennedy, who was known to support the ALP.|$|R
