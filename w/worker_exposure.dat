5000|$|While Stellite {{remains the}} {{material}} of choice for certain internal parts in industrial process valves (valve seat hardfacing), its use has been discouraged in nuclear power plants. In piping that can communicate with the reactor, tiny amounts of Stellite would be released into the process fluid and eventually enter the reactor.

OBJECTIVES: The main {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize relationships between levels of albumin adducts of these electrophiles in blood and the corresponding benzene exposures in benzeneexposed and control workers, after adjusting for important covariates. Because second blood samples were obtained from a subset of exposed workers, we also desired to estimate within-person and between-person variance components for the three adducts. METHODS: We measured albumin adducts and benzene exposures in 250 benzene-exposed <b>workers</b> (<b>exposure</b> range, 0. 26 – 54. 5 ppm) and 140 control <b>workers</b> (<b>exposure</b> range < 0. 01 – 0. 53 ppm) from Tianjin, China. Separate multiple linear regression models were fitted to the logged adduct levels for workers exposed to benzene < 1 ppm and ≥ 1 ppm. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate within-person and between-person variance components of adduct levels. RESULTS: We observed nonlinear (hockey-stick shaped) exposure–adduct relationships in log-scale, with inflection points between about 0. 5 and 5 ppm. These inflection points represent air concentration...|$|R
