American parents are less prone to influencing their children's actual sexual experiences than they are simply telling their children what they should not do. They promote abstinence while educating their children <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> may make their adolescents not want to engage in sexual activity.|$|E
500|$|On {{his first}} day for filming series three, Penry-Jones participated in a fight scene {{in the middle of}} the first episode. He felt a little wary {{replacing}} Matthew Macfadyen. After two months of filming, Penry-Jones began to feel more at ease with the role. He felt especially so after he started working for the fourth series. He returned to the fourth series because he thought his character took off by the end of the last series, and wanted to see which direction he would go to next. The crew wanted Adam to go from a [...] "happy-go-lucky" [...] figure to wanting him to deal <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would make it hard for Adam to be jokey towards the end of the fourth series; this involved Fiona's death.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with SoulCulture, Usher told that the inspiration for writing [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] is about dealing <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> people can't understand. He further stated that the past can bring people [...] "down a road" [...] {{because they are not}} aware of it. According to him, [...] "The time spent with a father will teach you a certain understanding of live and how to cope and deal with things. The lack of a father being there can also teach you how to deal with life – and that’s what 'Sins Of The Father' is about... That statement was made because that’s something that I felt." [...] Usher added that the song itself is a [...] "kind of testament" [...] for the father he is.|$|E

500|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{discussed}} its sinister, sexual, youthful feel. LeMay wrote that Deal's singing is spooky, and suggests a mythical siren or a young girl hiding a weapon. Steve Albini said that [...] "there was a simultaneous charm to Kim's presentation to her music that's both childlike and giddy and also completely mature and kind of dirty... sort of girlish fascination <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were pretty {{but it was also}} kind of horny. That was a juxtaposition that, at the time, was unusual. You didn't get a lot of knowing winks from female artists at the time." [...] Subjects reviewers have heard in the songs include menstruation ("Iris"), [...] "weird/bad sex" [...] ("When I Was a Painter" [...] and [...] "Only in 3's"), the demise of a lover ("Fortunately Gone"), and a fetus that lives on after an abortion ("Hellbound").|$|E
500|$|Johansson {{attended}} PS 41, {{an elementary}} school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Growing up, her family {{did not have much}} money. Her parents divorced when she was 13. Johansson was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher; they often spent time together and Johansson considered Sloan her best friend. Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, Johansson often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands. She took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. Describing her childhood, she says it [...] "was filled <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I loved to do, and also very normal things: I lived in New York, I have a family life and went to a regular school." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd {{assembled}} for {{an upcoming}} tour of Britain, Japan and the United States in December of that year. Rehearsing in Broadhurst Gardens in London, there was the looming prospect of a new album, although their priority {{at that time was}} the creation of new material. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> [...] "make people mad", focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: [...] "I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – {{that a lot of the}} lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the American film Jaws, a {{proposition}} came from the [...] Toho film studio for Nobuhiko Obayashi to develop a similar script. To find inspiration for the story, Obayashi discussed ideas with his pre-teen daughter Chigumi Obayashi. Nobuhiko sought her ideas, believing that adults [...] "only think about things they understand ... everything stays on that boring human level" [...] while [...] "children can come up <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can't be explained". Several of Chigumi's ideas were included in House such as a reflection in a mirror attacking the viewer, a watermelon being pulled out of a well appearing like a human head, and a house that eats girls. Other themes Chigumi suggested drew upon her own childhood fears. These fears included a pile of futons falling on her that felt like a monster attacking her, a large loud clock at her grandparents home, and getting her fingers caught in between her piano keys. Nobuhiko shared these story ideas with screenwriter Chiho Katsura. These ideas reminded Katsura of a short story by Walter de la Mare about an old woman who is visited by her granddaughters who then puts them in a trunk.|$|E
500|$|Brangwyn Hall in Swansea {{was used}} as the museum. Haynes wanted the museum to feel [...] "massive and eerie", and coached Blackwood to [...] "live in the moment". The opening {{sequence}} featuring young Amelia is filmed from her height, and was inspired by Steven Spielberg films in which people would look at things in awe. During this scene Haynes played appropriate music to help Blackwood get into the mood, as he had done during similar scenes when directing [...] "The Pandorica Opens". The set was filled <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> would seem like typical exhibits in the daytime, but appeared spooky at night. The exhibits also included historical anomalies which were the result of history collapsing, such as penguins on the Nile. Though Blackwood appeared as the seven-year-old version of Amy in [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the episode marked the first time Gillan and Blackwood—who are actually cousins—acted together. Gillan initially found this [...] "weird", but she commented that they quickly got used to it. The two versions of Amy were purposely dressed in similar colours. The cold open ends with Amy telling her younger self [...] "Okay kid, this is where it gets complicated" [...] after she has been revealed in the Pandorica. Moffat, after viewing the rushes, ordered the sequence to be reshot as Gillan had said [...] "really complicated", which conveyed a different meaning. As they had run out of time filming in the museum, all of the shots looking into the Pandorica were filmed three weeks later in the Pandorica chamber set.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{although most}} reviewers found {{some of the}} storylines more effective than others. Robert Canning of IGN wrote that [...] "the main portion of this episode was quite funny, even if the ending lacked bite." [...] Similarly, Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly found that the episode was [...] "another strong showing for 30 Rock... although Jenna's plotline was pretty tired." [...] TV Squad's Bob Sassone was similarly positive about [...] "The Bubble", calling it [...] "another good episode." [...] James Poniewozik of Time, also responded favorably to the episode {{with the exception of}} the Jenna storyline, writing that it [...] "was the first one in a long time that I enjoyed almost completely without reservation (Jenna's subplot was off, but it was barely a blip)." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger disliked the bubble concept, reporting, [...] "he idea that attractive people get away <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the more average-looking can't is an old joke, even on 30 Rock (with Cerie)", but nonetheless enjoyed the [...] "variations" [...] of the joke saying they were [...] "well-conceived". Sepinwall concluded, [...] "this was one of the funniest 30 Rocks of the season. Zap2it's Rick Porter was also favorable to [...] "The Bubble" [...] in his recap, opining that 30 Rock [...] "gave us a very well-done episode". As with Lyons and Poniewozik, Porter felt Jenna's story [...] "didn't really click", but liked the scene with Jenna and her stylist team firing off words to describe Jenna's beauty as [...] "scathingly funny." ...|$|E

500|$|The major-label debut sold {{strongly}} {{and nearly}} {{four times as}} fast as Dude Ranch, and shipped gold to stores, unlike its predecessor, which took seven months to achieve that certification. Enema of the State went platinum in October 1999 and went triple platinum in January 2000; in February 2001, the album was certified five times platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America. The record performed well in international markets as well. Enema of the State went quadruple platinum in Canada and triple platinum in Australia. It peaked at number seven on the Canadian Albums Chart, but peaked the highest worldwide on the New Zealand Albums Chart (number two), where it was certified double platinum. It was also certified double platinum in Italy, platinum in the United Kingdom, and gold in six other territories (Austria, Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Switzerland). In Europe, the album sold over one million copies. To further promote Enema of the State, the trio made a cameo appearance in American Pie, a teen comedy released several weeks following the album release. Hoppus, DeLonge and Barker appear in a scene in which they are interrupted rehearsing to see a webcast on a computer. Music from Enema of the State was also used in the film and on its soundtrack. The cameo appearance was well-received, with New York Nitsuh Abebe commending the common sensibility and humor between the two: [...] "green grass, sun, swimming pools, teen boys obsessed with and mildly terrified by sex, jokes about having sex <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> are not other humans, and a healthy side of toilet-oriented gags." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ereignis is {{translated}} {{often as}} [...] "an event," [...] but is better {{understood in terms}} of something [...] "coming into view." [...] It comes from the German prefix, er-, comparable to 're-' in English, and Auge, eye. It is a noun coming from a reflexive verb. Note that the German prefix er- also can connote an end or a fatality. A recent translation of the word by Kenneth Maly and Parvis Emad renders the word as [...] "enowning"; that in connection <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> arise and appear, that they are arising 'into their own'. Hubert Dreyfus defined the term as [...] "things coming into themselves by belonging together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kenneth Kitchen, {{author of}} the seven-volume [...] "Ramesside Inscriptions," [...] {{described}} Omm Sety as a [...] "true Ramesside" [...] who [...] "came {{to all sorts of}} conclusions about the actual objective material of the Sety Temple – which may have also coincided <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> she felt she knew some other way...and that paid dividends. Donald Redford invited Omm Sety to appear in the documentary [...] "The Lost Pharaoh," [...] in which she gives her description of Akhenaton, including a negative view of the religious revolution he attempted (comparing him to the Ayatollah Khomeini – [...] "a fanatic"), a viewpoint broadly shared by scholars such as Seton-Williams and Redford.|$|E

[...] Glynn walked in, took over this mess, and he just brought calm to the situation. [...] I've never seen such an extraordinary example of leadership in my entire career. [...] Absolutely magnificent. [...] No general or admiral in wartime could ever be more magnificent than Glynn was that night. [...] He and he alone brought all of the scared people together. [...] And you've got to remember that the flight controllers in those days were -- they were kids in their thirties. [...] They were good, but very few of them had ever run into these kinds of choices in life, and they weren't used to that. [...] All of a sudden, their confidence had been shaken. [...] They were faced <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they didn't understand, and Glynn walked in there, and he just kind of took charge." ...|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up <b>with</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E
