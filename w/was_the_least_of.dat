25|$|On 14 July 1950, Almond formed his own {{targeting}} {{section in}} his headquarters, {{to compete with}} the Air Force target system. On 23 July, General Otto P. Weyland, who had commanded forward air control support for General George S. Patton during World War II, submitted a memo claiming that Almond's targeting section was incompetent. In a staff meeting the following day, Almond unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Weyland into changing his views. Though Almond's targeting section was dissolved on 2 August, it was emblematic of his belief that forward air control <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> the Air Force's concerns. Almond's belief that tactical air squadrons should be parceled out to support individual infantry divisions harked back to the doctrine of early World War II. Almond largely commandeered the 1st Marine Air Wing and its auxiliary U.S. Navy aviation to fly close air support for his X Corps.|$|E

He answered little to the questions of Hudson, and returning to his bed, heard, in silence, a long studied oration {{on the merits of}} Saint Bridget, which comprehended the greater part of her long-winded legend, and concluded with the assurance, that, from all accounts preserved of her, that holy saint <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> all possible women, except those of the pigmy kind.|$|E

The advance was stopped as soon as it had been begun. At the moment when every military reason demanded speed and suddenness, a hideous delay became inevitable.|$|E

60|$|I {{should have}} added that, {{shortly after the}} death of the Countess, an {{excellent}} sermon was preached by the Dean of Melchester, the subject of which, though names were not mentioned, was unquestionably suggested by the aforesaid events. He dwelt upon the folly of indulgence in sensuous love for a handsome form merely; and showed that the only rational and virtuous growths of that affection were those based upon intrinsic worth. In the case of the tender but somewhat shallow lady whose life I have related, {{there is no doubt that}} an infatuation for the person of young Willowes was the chief feeling that induced her to marry him; which was the more deplorable in that his beauty, by all tradition, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> his recommendations, every report bearing out the inference that he must have been a man of steadfast nature, bright intelligence, and promising life.|$|E

But all too soon he packed his knapsack, and promising to bring each of his friends the nose or ear of one of the shattered saints from the great cathedral at Strasbourg, the 'Peri' vanished from Paradis, and left them all lamenting.|$|E
60|$|In {{old days}} {{we had a}} great name as organisers. Then came a long period when we {{deliberately}} adopted a policy of individuality and 'go as you please.' Now once again in our sore need we have called on all our power of administration and direction. But it has not deserted us. We still have it in a supreme degree. Even in peace time we have shown it in that vast, well-oiled, swift-running, noiseless machine called the British Navy. But now our powers have risen with the need of them. The expansion of the Navy has been a miracle, the management of the transport a greater one, the formation of the new Army the greatest of all time. To get the men <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> the difficulties. To put them here, with everything down to the lid of the last field saucepan in its place, that is the marvel. The tools of the gunners, and of the sappers, {{to say nothing of the}} knowledge of how to use them, are in themselves a huge problem. But it has all been met and mastered, and will be to the end. But don't let us talk any more about the muddling of the War Office. It has become just a little ridiculous.|$|E

60|$|Let {{the reader}} picture to himself {{the hall of}} the vastest cathedral he ever stood in, {{windowless}} indeed, but dimly lighted from above, presumably by shafts connected with the outer air and driven in the roof, which arched away a hundred feet above our heads, and he will get {{some idea of the}} size of the enormous cave in which we found ourselves, with the difference that this cathedral designed by nature was loftier and wider than any built by man. But its stupendous size <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> the wonders of the place, for running in rows adown its length were gigantic pillars of what looked like ice, but were, in reality, huge stalactites. It is impossible for me to convey any idea of the overpowering beauty and grandeur of these pillars of white spar, some of which were not less than twenty feet in diameter at the base, and sprang up in lofty and yet delicate beauty sheer to the distant roof. Others again were in process of formation. On the rock floor there was in these cases what looked, Sir Henry said, exactly like a broken column in an old Grecian temple, whilst high above, depending from the roof, the point of a huge icicle could be dimly seen.|$|E
60|$|In {{the same}} manner, Charles's evenings, unless such as {{were destined to}} more secret pleasures, were {{frequently}} spent amongst all who had any pretence to approach a courtly circle; and thus it was upon the night which we are treating of. Queen Catherine, reconciled or humbled to her fate, had long ceased to express any feelings of jealousy, nay, seemed so absolutely dead to such a passion, that she received at her drawing-room, without scruple, and even with encouragement, the Duchesses of Portsmouth and Cleveland, and others, who enjoyed, though in a less avowed character, the credit of having been royal favourites. Constraint of every kind was banished from a circle so composed, and which was frequented at the same time, if not by the wisest, at least by the wittiest courtiers, who ever assembled round a monarch, and who, {{as many of them}} had shared the wants, and shifts, and frolics of his exile, had then acquired a sort of prescriptive licence, which the good-natured prince, when he attained his period of prosperity, could hardly have restrained had it suited his temper to do so. This, however, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> Charles's thoughts. His manners were such as secured him from indelicate obtrusion; and he sought no other protection from over-familiarity, than what these and his ready wit afforded him.|$|E
60|$|As she thus resolved, she {{was leaning}} over the gate looking into the churchyard, not much observing the graves or the monuments or the {{beautiful}} old ivy-covered tower, or thinking of the dead that were lying there, or of the living who prayed there; but swearing to herself that {{for the rest of}} her life she would keep clear of, what she called, girlish messes. Like other young ladies she had read much poetry and many novels; but her sympathies had never been with young ladies who could not go straight through with their love affairs, from the beginning to the end, without flirtation of either an inward or an outward nature. Of all her heroines, Rosalind was the one she liked the best, because from the first moment of her passion she knew herself and what she was about, and loved her lover right heartily. Of all girls in prose or poetry she declared that Rosalind <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> <b>of</b> a flirt. She meant to have the man, and never had a doubt about it. But with such a one as Flora MacIvor she had no patience;--a girl who did and who didn't, who would and who wouldn't, who could and who couldn't, and who of all flirts was to her the most nauseous! As she was taking herself to task, accusing herself of being a Flora without the poetry and romance to excuse her, Mr. Fenwick came round from Farmer Trumbull's side of the church, and got over the stile into the churchyard.|$|E
