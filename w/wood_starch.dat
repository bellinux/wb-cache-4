50|$|Human needs such as shelter, food, transport, or {{communication}} require materials like <b>wood,</b> <b>starch,</b> sugar, {{iron and}} steel, copper, or semiconductors. As society develops and economic activity expands, material production, use, and disposal increase {{to a level}} where unwanted impacts on environment and society cannot be neglected anymore, neither locally nor globally. Material flows are {{at the core of}} local environmental problems such as leaching from landfills or oil spills. Rising concern about global warming puts a previously unimportant waste flow, carbon dioxide, on top of the political and scientific agenda. The gradual shift from primary material production to urban mining in developed countries requires a detailed assessment of in-use and obsolete stocks of materials within human society.Scientists, industries, government bodies, and NGOs therefore need a tool that complements economic accounting and modelling. They need a systematic method to keep track of and display stocks and flows of the materials entering, staying within, and leaving the different processes in the anthroposphere. Material flow analysis is such a method.|$|E
40|$|Hylotrupes bajulus (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae), a wood-boring beetle attacking softwood, utilises both <b>wood</b> <b>starch</b> and {{cellulose}} as food. The fibre is digested in variable percentages, {{depending on}} the starch content. A role for symbiotic bacteria was presumed {{as well as the}} presence of endogenous cellulases. The aim of our investigation was to verify the presence of endogenous endoglucanase genes in H. bajulus larvae. After performing an online search, three sequences for the endoglucanases of the class GHF 5 and four for the endoglucanases of the class GHF 45 were recovered and aligned in order to develop some primers on the most conserved regions and try the amplification of the genes in H. bajulus. Seven degenerated primers for GHF 5 endoglucanase and five for GHF 45 endoglucanase were tested. By using two different primer combinations we obtained two fragments: both of them showed homology with significant identity with insect endoglucanases of the GHF 45 family available online, and one also with microbial cellulases. The first fragment is undoubtedly of endogenous origin while we cannot exclude that the second one is of microbial origin. No results were obtained for the endoglucanase of the class GHF 5...|$|E
40|$|Starch is {{the most}} {{important}} long-term reserve in trees, and the analysis of starch is therefore useful source of physiological information. Currently published protocols for <b>wood</b> <b>starch</b> analysis impose several limitations, such as long procedures and a neutralization step. The high-throughput standard protocols for starch analysis in food and feed represent a valuable alternative. However, they have not been optimised or tested with woody samples. These have particular chemical and structural characteristics, including the presence of interfering secondary metabolites, low reactivity of starch, and low starch content. In this study, a standard method for starch analysis used for food and feed (AOAC standard method 996. 11) was optimised to improve precision and accuracy for the analysis of starch in wood. Key modifications were introduced in the digestion conditions and in the glucose assay. The optimised protocol was then evaluated through 430 starch analyses of standards at known starch content, matrix polysaccharides, and wood collected from three organs (roots, twigs, mature wood) of four species (coniferous and flowering plants). The optimised protocol proved to be remarkably precise and accurate (3 %), suitable for a high throughput routine analysis (35 samples a day) of specimens with a starch content between 40 mg and 21 µg. Samples may include lignified organs of coniferous and flowering plants and non-lignified organs, such as leaves, fruits and rhizomes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWater is an {{integral}} part of the structure in biological porous materials such as <b>wood</b> and <b>starch.</b> A problem often encountered in the preparation of samples for, e. g., electron microscopy is that removal of water leads to a decreasing distance between supermolecular structural elements and a distortion of the structure. It is, therefore, of interest to find methods to investigate these materials in the native water-swollen state. We present a method to study water-swollen biological porous structures using NMR to determine the amount and self-diffusion of water within the porous objects. The contribution of bulk water to the NMR signal is eliminated by performing experiments below the bulk freezing temperature. Further decrease of the temperature leads to a gradual freezing of water within the porous objects. The contribution of the freezing water fraction to the migration of water through the porous network is, thus, estimated. The results are rationalized in terms of the ultrastructure of the samples studied, namely, wood pulp fibers and potato starch granules...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{concerns}} have {{brought about a}} push to replace non-biodegradable products that are made from non-renewable resources. Investigations regarding use of wood fibers and other biomass as a raw material for biodegradable foams and sponges are an {{example of such a}} replacement. Foams made at least partially of biomass can be created using cellulose from wood fibers once the cellulose is converted into a fluid form. Polyurethane foams can be made from polyols containing as much as 50 % biomass by combined dissolution of <b>wood</b> and <b>starch.</b> Sponges can be made completely from cellulose regenerated from a viscose rayon solution, and the effect of using wood fibers as reinforcement material within the cellulose matrix of such sponges was studied. The effect of fiber content and fiber length on absorbance, swelling, density, air to cellulose ratios, bound water, and tensile was determined. M. S.

40|$|Problem statement: The Heterobostrychus aequalis Waterhouse was {{a serious}} pest lumber&# 13; of timber heveawood. The H. aequalis infest and tunnel along the wood grain, {{depositing}} eggs, which&# 13; concomitantly turn into larvae and reduces the <b>wood</b> <b>starch</b> to a soft powder. The objectives of the&# 13; study were to establish a suitable method for preservative trials on the wood borer and access the&# 13; toxicity levels of boric acid for controlling the H. aequalis infestation. Approach: The voracious H. &# 13; aequalis was collected from infested heveawood, mated and cultured on cassava. The adult beetles&# 13; were exposed to boric acid treated cassava blocks as pilot trials. The boric acid concentration used was&# 13; 1 - 5 % including a control. Each treatment consists of five replicates. The voracious of H. aequalis &# 13; generation was cultured for obtaining its freshly new emerged adult by exposing a number of H. &# 13; aequalis directly from infested heveawood into artificial diet block and cassava. The mortality, weight&# 13; loss of the test blocks, frass discharge duration and numbers of holes caused by H. aequalis were&# 13; observed. Results: The {{results showed that the}} H. aequalis infested tended to penetrate the film after&# 13; wrapping the heveawood with a layer of transparent cling film for 24 h experiment. The H. aequalis &# 13; larvae stock cultured collected from infested heveawood exhibited differences in colour, activeness and&# 13; aggression among males and females. The suitable test block size used was (2. 0 × 5. 0 × 1. 5) cm 3. The&# 13; freshly emerged voracious of H. aequalis adults was more suitable than the larvae for boric acid&# 13; toxicity trials. The 2 % concentration was sufficiently killed the 4 % boric acid treated test blocks. There&# 13; was no hole observed on 5 % boric acid treated test block and hence these concentrations were not&# 13; infested by H. aequalis due to absence of frass in exposed blocks. Conclusion/Recommendations: &# 13; There are noticeable physical and behavioural differences between voracious of H. aequalis collected&# 13; from infested heveawood. The freshly emerged of H. aequalis adults were found suitable than the&# 13; larvae as an indicator for determining the boric acid toxicity trials. The 5 % of boric acid concentration&# 13; was sufficient to control the infection of H. aequalis on heveawood. Further studies focusing on&# 13; interaction between larvae, adults and population growth of H. aequalis with different hosts need to be&# 13; carried out towards clarifying the predisposing factors that induce the infestation processes...|$|E

40|$|Oils, fats, carbohydrates, lignin, and {{amino acids}} are all {{important}} {{raw materials for}} the production of biorenewables. These compounds already {{play an important role in}} everyday life in the form of <b>wood,</b> fabrics, <b>starch,</b> paper and rubber. Enzymatic reactions do, in principle, allow the transformation of these raw materials into biorenewables under mild and sustainable conditions. There are a few examples of processes using immobilised enzymes that are already applied on an industrial scale, such as the production of High-Fructose Corn Syrup, but these are still rather rare. Fortunately, there is a rapid expansion in the research efforts that try to improve this, driven by a combination of economic and ecological reasons. This review focusses on those efforts, by looking at attempts to use fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins and lignin (and their building blocks), as substrates in the synthesis of biorenewables using immobilised enzymes. Therefore, many examples (390 references) from the recent literature are discussed, in which we look both at the specific reactions as well as to the methods of immobilisation of the enzymes, as the latter are shown to be a crucial factor with respect to stability and reuse. The applications of the renewables produced in this way range from building blocks for the pharmaceutical and polymer industry, transport fuels, to additives for the food industry. A critical evaluation of the relevant factors that need to be improved for large-scale use of these examples is presented in the outlook of this review...|$|R

The exodermis cells are closely adjoined, {{but they are not}} junctioned at the side. They form a very large contact surface. The surface area which is formed by this structure is 2 to 2. 5 time larger than the corresponding surface of a root cylinder.

40|$|The micromechanical {{properties}} of injection molded starch–wood particle composites were investigated {{as a function}} of particle content and humidity conditions. The composite materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction methods. The microhardness of the composites was shown to increase notably with the concentration of the wood particles. In addition,creep behavior under the indenter and temperature dependence were evaluated in terms of the independent contribution of the starch matrix and the wood microparticles to the hardness value. The influence of drying time on the density and weight uptake of the injection-molded composites was highlighted. The results revealed the role of the mechanism of water evaporation, showing that the dependence of water uptake and temperature was greater for the starch–wood composites than for the pure starch sample. Experiments performed during the drying process at 70 °C indicated that the <b>wood</b> in the <b>starch</b> composites did not prevent water loss from the samples. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The term “biorefinery” {{appeared}} in the 1990 ’s {{in response to a}} least four industry trends. First, there was an increased awareness in industry of the need to use biomass resources in a more rational way both economically and environmentally. The environmental issue was both policy and consumer driven. Second, there was a growing interest in upgrading more low-quality lignocellulosic biomass to valuable products. Third, there was an increased attention to the production of starch for energy applications. Finally, there was a perceived need to develop more high-value products and diversify the product mix in order to meet global competi- tion and, in some cases, utilise an excess of biomass (especially in the pulp and paper industry). In a biorefinery, biomass is upgraded to one or more valuable products such as transport fuels, materials, chemicals, electricity and, as byproduct, heat. In principle all types of biomass can be used, e. g. <b>wood,</b> straw, <b>starch,</b> sugars, waste and algae. But there is more to it than that. The aim of this chapter is to explain in some more detail what a biorefinery is or could be. There have been many attempts to determine what should be meant by a “biorefinery” and in the next section we provide some of the definitions and additional meaning that has been attached to the concept. To give a more in-depth understanding of what a biorefinery might be, the following sections describe process technologies that are often considered as key constituent parts of biorefineries and some opportunities for integration in existing processing industry that also can be viewed as biorefining...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{polymers}} such as <b>wood,</b> cotton, wool, <b>starch,</b> {{and rubber}} {{have been known}} and used {{for a long time}} even though their composition and structure were unknown. At {{the beginning of this century}} systematic efforts were started to analyze these materials, elucidate their molecular pattern, and fit them into the framework of organic chemistry. It was found that they all are characterized by the presence of chain-like molecules with very high molecular weights ranging from 10000 to several millions. It was also found that these chains can be oriented by mechanical deformations and assume a laterally ordered crystal-like supermolecular arrangement. As soon as these facts become known as systematic search for synthetic counterparts of natural polymers was started which led to the laboratory preparation and large scale production of many synthetic materials which cover a wide range of properties and applications and which are becoming an increasingly important factor in science and industry. With growing understanding and know-how it also became possible to synthesize polymers with biochemically interesting properties such as the polyelectrolytes and other biopolymers...|$|R
40|$|Vapam(r) (NaMDC) is the {{fumigant}} {{most commonly}} used to arrest and control decay of utility poles. While volatile fungitoxins are detectable only 1 to 2 years after treatment, poles treated with Vapam(r) remain free of decay fungi for 6 to 17 years. Vapam(r) decomposes to produce volatile fungicides {{as well as a}} number of nonvolatile products that may provide long-term protection. The degree and rate of decomposition of NaMDC were evaluated by using a gas chromatograph and a high-performance liquid chromatograph to analyze extracts from Vapam(r) mixtures with <b>wood,</b> cellulose, vanillin, <b>starch</b> and glass. Compounds similar to those produced from Vapam(r) -soil mixtures were found in the mixtures tested. Of the materials identified, sulfur was the most abundant nonvolatile product in wood mixtures and may play a role in long-term wood protection. Sulfur was present only at low levels in cellulose mixtures. These results, coupled with the low levels of volatile MIT produced in the cellulose mixtures, suggest that lignin is an important site for Vapam(r) decomposition reactions. Further studies are suggested to determine the role of nonvolatile decomposition products in arresting decay away from the point of application...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a new sustainable approach in additive manufacturing adapted on a Numerical Control (NC) machining. Wood has several advantages that are transferable to various derivatives allowing the introduction of sustainable material into the product lifecycle. The application involves the integration of wood pulp into rapid prototyping solutions. Wood is the main material studied for its ecological aspect. The primary goal was to create reconstituted wood objects through a rapid manufacturing. Additive manufacturing technology is most commonly used for modeling, prototyping, tooling through an exclusive machine or 3 D printer. An overall review and an analysis of technologies show that the additive manufacturing presents some little independent solutions [9] [12]. The problem studied especially the additive manufacturing limits to produce an ecological product with materials from biomass. The study developed a 3 d printing head as solution for shaping wood pulp or powder materials. Some technological problematic require enslavement to the NC controller, the programming building of model, and the realization of wood pulp.

40|$|Hylotrupes bajulus, attacks {{softwood}} utilising the cellulose {{contained in}} wood walls as food. The fibre is digested in variable percentages, {{depending on the}} type of analysis, 20 to 48 % and, according to some authors, without the assistance of intestinal symbiotic microorganisms. Furthermore, there is published work referring to Hylotrupes, concluding that "starch” … “plays no role in the nutrition of the larvae". Nevertheless, considering that attacks of this species decrease with wood seasoning increasing and having been demonstrated, and that “lignin degradation products of spruce wood do not influence larvae development”, it is possible to suppose that cell walls alone are not sufficient to feed this wood boring species. Furthermore, Hylotrupes larvae have chisel shaped mandibles, similar to those of powder post beetle larvae that feed on starch and need to pulverise the wood to access the cellular content. Preliminary research suggests an utilization of wood fibre as well as of starch by larvae of H. bajulus. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to test the degree of digestion of wood fibre from different sources (sapwood or heartwood) and the possible role of symbiotic microorganisms. Larvae of H. bajulus were grown on synthetic diets made of purified <b>wood</b> fibre and/or <b>starch</b> as main components supplied with mineral and vitamin. Substrates and frass were analysed for fibre fractions, starch and acid insoluble ash, the latter used as an indigestible marker. Larvae purified DNA was analysed by means of metagenomics approaches carried out by direct retrieval and analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences free of cultural bias in order to discover the bacterial diversity from larva alimentary channel alone.

40|$|Starch grains were {{isolated}} from parenchyma cells of poplar wood (Populus x canadensis Moench 'robusta'). The grains contained tightly bound amylase activity, which {{was classified as}} a-amylase (EC 3. 2. 1. 1) by sub-strate specificity. The enzyme differs in some kinetic properties and the native electrophoresis profile from soluble amylase forms of the same material. The bind-ing of a-amylase to isolated grains was affected by temperature and by maltose and malto-oligo-saccharides in high concentrations. The amylase-content of the grains was reduced to 18 % as the temperature was increased from 1 °C to 31 °C, and 97 % of the activity was released by a treatment with maltose at 20 °C. The binding was fully reversible. The release of oligoglucans from starch grains was inhib-ited by removing the starch-associated amylase or by preventing the binding by addition of exogenous glu-cans, while the degradation of a soluble substrate — starch azure — was not affected by carbohydrates. These observations indicate that the granule-bound amylase {{is involved in the}} dissolution of starch and that binding to the grains is a prerequisite of the amyl-olytic activity. The results are consistent with the assumption that the amylase contains a raw starch binding site in addition to the active site. The exposure of excised twigs harvested in late autumn or winter to a low temperature regime led to an increase of the granule-bound amylase activity and to a simultaneous decrease of the starch level. It is therefore suggested that the reversible binding of the a-amylase to starch granules as affected by temper-ature and glucans might take part in the regulation of the starch content.
