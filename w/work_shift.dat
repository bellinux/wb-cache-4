25|$|Analysis {{revealed}} {{a significant relationship between}} the number of extended-duration <b>work</b> <b>shifts</b> and the reported rates of fatigue-related noteworthy medical errors. Specifically, the number of reported fatigue-related medical errors increased as the number of extended-duration shifts per month increased. At least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 3.8% of months with no extended-duration work shifts; and at least one fatigue-related significant medical error was reported in 9.8% of months that had between one and four extended-duration <b>work</b> <b>shifts</b> and in 16% of months that had five or more extended-duration <b>work</b> <b>shifts.</b> Furthermore, the frequency of attentional failures was strongly associated with the frequency of extended-duration <b>work</b> <b>shifts.</b> Evidence from this study further corroborates the negative impact that extended-duration <b>work</b> <b>shifts</b> may have on performance, as well as increased accidents and injuries.|$|R

500|$|Circadian rhythm effects {{describe}} {{the tendency for}} humans to experience a normal cycle in attentiveness and sleepiness through the 24-hour day. Those with a conventional sleep pattern (sleeping for seven or eighthours at night) experience periods of maximum fatigue {{in the early hours}} of the morning and a lesser period in the early afternoon. During the low points of this cycle, one experiences reduced attentiveness. During the high points, it is difficult to sleep soundly. The cycle is anchored in part by ambient lighting (darkness causes a person's body to release the hormone melatonin, which induces sleep), and by a person's imposed pattern of regular sleeping and waking times. The influence of the day-night cycle is never fully displaced (standard artificial lighting is not strong enough to inhibit the release of melatonin), and the performance of night shift workers usually suffers. Circadian rhythms are persistent, and can only be shifted by one to twohours forward or backward per day. Changing the starting time of a <b>work</b> <b>shift</b> by more than these amounts will reduce attentiveness, which is common after the first night shift following a [...] "weekend" [...] break during which conventional sleep times were followed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{coffee break}} {{originated}} in the late 19th century in Stoughton, Wisconsin, with the wives of Norwegian immigrants. The city celebrates this every year with the Stoughton Coffee Break Festival. In 1951, Time noted that [...] "ince the war, the coffee break has been written into union contracts". The term subsequently became popular through a Pan-American Coffee Bureau ad campaign of 1952 which urged consumers, [...] "Give yourself a Coffee-Break – and Get What Coffee Gives to You." [...] John B. Watson, a behavioral psychologist who worked with Maxwell House later in his career, helped to popularize coffee breaks within the American culture.

In some places, a cart with hot and cold beverages and cakes, breads and pastries arrives at the same time morning and afternoon, an employer may contract with an outside caterer for daily service, or coffee breaks may take place away from the actual work-area in a designated cafeteria or tea room. More generally, the phrase [...] "coffee break" [...] has also come to denote any break from work.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} find out the work load of matrons under <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in a special nursing home for the elderly (SNH), six healthy female matrons volunteered to {{participate}} in the present study. For each subject, care working time, heart rate, walking steps, estimated energy expenditure and working time in different postures were determined during day <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (540 min) and night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> (960 min). Although the time on duty, working and recess were significantly longer in night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> than day <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> the percentages of working and recess time to duty time were nearly the same regardless of <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> The longest care <b>work</b> in each <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> was individual care of residents in the SNH. The maximum, minimum and mean heart rate and percentages to estimated maximal heart rate were similar in each <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> Although total walking steps in night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> were significantly larger than those in day <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> steps per hour did not differ between them. The estimated total energy expenditure (kcal) was significantly higher in night <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> than in day shift work; however, the work intensity (kcal/kg/min) was significantly higher in day <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> The longest length and larger percentage of working time were observed in standing posture in each <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> These findings suggest that physical activity and energy expenditure of matrons under either <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in the SNH seem to be high. Further studies are needed to clarify the work load of matrons engaged in SNH to formulate countermeasures...|$|R

Insulin treated subjects who underwent a change in their pattern of <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> had diabetic control assessed before and six months after a change in shifts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Random plasma glucose, serum fructosamine, and haemoglobin A 1 while at work. RESULTS [...] Diabetic control of insulin treated subjects who <b>worked</b> <b>shifts</b> was not significantly different from insulin treated subjects who worked days only. Diabetic control was poor in both groups and similar to that of diabetic subjects treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents. In those subjects that moved to a more rapidly rotating shift pattern there was a significant deterioration in control (serum fructosamine concentration before, 405 (SD 68); after, 481 (SD 90) mumol/l, p less than 0. 01).

40|$|Objective: To prospectively {{study the}} {{association}} of night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change and lifestyle behaviors. Methods: Workers participating in the Netherlands Working Conditions Cohort Study (2008 and 2009) (N = 5951) reported night and <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> weight and height. Groups included stable night or <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> from day work to night or <b>shift</b> <b>work,</b> from night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> to day work, and no night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> in 2008 and 2009. Regression analyses were used to study association changes in night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change and changes in lifestyle behaviors. Results: A larger weight change was seen in normal-weight workers changing from day to <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> ([beta] = 0. 93 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 01 to 1. 85) compared with stable no shift workers. No further associations of night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change were observed, neither in normal-weight, overweight, and obese workers. Conclusions: Despite the fact that starting night or <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> is associated with some unhealthy lifestyle habits, {{this study did not}} confirm a positive association of night and <b>shift</b> <b>work</b> with weight change over 1 year, except for normal-weight workers moving from day to <b>shift</b> <b>work.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R
