5|$|Several enzymes can <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> a {{specific}} order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes {{the product of}} another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E

5|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{the team}} encountered was converting all game elements into a fully-3D world, including {{the sound and}} radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world; producer Dan Houser {{said that there was}} about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 50 people <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> animating and {{producing}} {{an episode of}} SpongeBob SquarePants. Throughout its run, production of the series has been handled domestically at Nickelodeon Animation Studio in Burbank, California, while the finished animation has been created overseas at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea.

The storyboards are then used as templates by the crew in Korea, who animate by hand, color cels on computers, and paint backgrounds. Episodes are finished in California, where they are edited and have music added. Every season, character designs are updated or modified to solve technical issues in the animation.|$|E

5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and spandrels. The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them to <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E

5|$|Although McGregor envisaged the League as a {{friendly}} union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues and <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football {{came to be}} treated as a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime. All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899. The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators. Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by {{the early years of the}} twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League. In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition. McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA. The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890.|$|E
