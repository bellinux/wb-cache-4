25|$|In 2006, the BDMLR placed for auction on eBay {{the small}} red <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> {{used during the}} attempt to keep {{the body of the}} whale wet on its journey down the Thames. The can was autographed by the rescue team. Following a 10-day auction {{attracting}} 50 genuine bids a total of £2,050 was raised. The auction was marred by dozens of spoof bids, several exceeding £1 million.|$|E
25|$|Members of {{the plant}} family Cucurbitacea, which {{includes}} zucchini/marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are chemically classified as steroids; they defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can {{have high levels of}} cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilize edible cucurbitaceae—any such cross-fertilized seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Also, dry weather conditions/irregular <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> stress the plant and favor the production of the toxin. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Humans with an impaired sense of taste (particularly among the elderly) should therefore ask a younger person to taste the zucchini for them.|$|E

50|$|Immunity Challenge: The {{individual}} castaways {{have to fill}} a <b>water</b> <b>can</b> suspended on a fulcrum, however {{there are}} five leaking holes {{at the bottom of}} the can. Inside the fulcrum is a small cannonball. If the castaway fills their <b>water</b> <b>can</b> with enough <b>water,</b> it will tip the cannonball to fall onto a tile and into the <b>water</b> <b>can.</b> First castaway to tip their fulcrum, and break their plate with the cannonball wins Immunity.|$|R

500|$|Strawberry soon {{arrives at}} the venue to see her friends, who greet her with [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] {{and give her a}} present: the Pieman's <b>watering</b> <b>can.</b> The device fails to grow {{anything}} and spills over instead, flooding the Park and much of Strawberryland. The children are dismayed that the Pieman tricked them for his berry-stealing plot, and soon they harvest every bit of that supply over to him.|$|E
500|$|Another inter-title {{announces that}} [...] "Shep makes daily {{visit to the}} florist" [...] and shows Shep {{approach}} the shop and grabs a bunch of flower in his mouth before running away. Shep returns to her grave and he drops his flowers with the others. Shep looks {{to the left and}} sees a woman watering the flowers. Shep takes her <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> and runs back to Helen's grave. The woman picks up the <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> and waters the flowers and picks up the flower bouquet brought by Shep. An inter-title announces that night has come and it shows Shep lying asleep near the hedge. A ghostly image of Helen, superimposed on the film, appears through hedge and awakens Shep. Helen leads Shep through the cemetery and to her grave. Shep crawls to her grave and lies across the flowers as Helen's form disappears down into the grave. The camera lingers on Shep before fading. The final inter-title of the film announces [...] "Don't cry, it's only make believe" [...] showing Helen, holding flowers and leaning against Shep. This sequence and title may have served as a reminder to children in the audience it was all simply a dramatic story.|$|E

500|$|While {{fighting}} Milhouse, Bart {{picks up}} a robotic toy which unfolds into an axe. Milhouse {{picks up a}} similar toy, but it instead unfolds into a <b>watering</b> <b>can.</b> The toys {{are based on the}} franchise Transformers. While fighting, Milhouse and Bart fall through a poster that hides a room in The Android's Dungeon. While the poster depicts American actress Rita Hayworth as the Marvel Comics superheroine She-Hulk, the scene is a reference to the 1994 drama film The Shawshank Redemption, in which the main character escapes a prison by digging a tunnel in his wall behind a poster. One of the tapes that Bart and Milhouse watch shows Fred Rogers intoxicated. Executive producer and current showrunner Al Jean later met Rogers' wife at a hall of fame, and said that he was [...] "really embarrassed" [...] when he found out that she had seen the episode.|$|E
500|$|In May 2014, Copeland {{performed}} {{the lead role}} of Swanilda in Coppélia at the Met. According to Los Angeles Times writer Jevon Phillips, {{she is the first}} African American woman to dance the role. The same month, she was praised in the dual role of Queen of the Dryads and Mercedes in Don Quixote by Brian Seibert of The New York Times, although Jerry Hochman of Critical Dance felt that she was not as impressive in the former role as in the latter. Later in May, the Met staged a program of one-act ballets consisting of Theme and Variations, Duo Concertant and Gaîté Parisienne, featuring Copeland in all three. Siebert praised her work as the lead in Balanchine's choreography of Igor Stravinsky's Duo Concertant for violin and piano performed by Benjamin Bowman and Emily Wong. Of her Flower Girl in Gaîté Parisienne, Apollinaire Scherr of The Financial Times wrote that she [...] "tips like a brimming <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> into the bouquets her wooers hold out to her". Copeland was a [...] "flawless" [...] demi-soloist in Theme and Variations, according to Colleen Boresta of Critical Dance.|$|E
500|$|The story {{focuses on}} a family of {{anthropomorphic}} rabbits. The widowed mother rabbit cautions her young against entering the vegetable garden of a man named Mr. McGregor, telling them: [...] "your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor". Her three daughters obediently refrain from entering the garden, going down the lane to pick blackberries, but her rebellious son Peter enters the garden to snack on some vegetables. Peter ends up eating more than is good for him and goes looking for parsley to cure his stomach ache. Peter is spotted by Mr. McGregor and loses his jacket and shoes while trying to escape. He hides in a <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> in a shed, but then has to run away again when Mr. McGregor finds him, and ends up completely lost. After sneaking past a cat, Peter sees the gate where he entered the garden from a distance and heads for it, despite being spotted and chased by Mr. McGregor again. With difficulty he wriggles under the gate, and escapes from the garden, but he spots his abandoned clothing being used to dress Mr. McGregor's scarecrow. After returning home, a sick Peter is sent to bed by his mother, while his well-behaved sisters receive a sumptuous dinner of milk and berries as opposed to Peter's supper of chamomile tea.|$|E

2500|$|As head groundsman at Taunton from 1946, Buttle {{was also}} called on {{when there were}} {{problems}} with other cricket pitches in Somerset: in 1953, he was forced into emergency action after the newly-relaid pitch at the Recreation Ground, Bath produced a farcical one-day result {{on the first day}} of what was meant to be a three-match festival of three-day games– the match, against Lancashire, was Bertie Buse's benefit match and was finished before six o'clock on the opening day. Buttle told Foot: [...] "I had to take drastic action, and I decided on plenty of liquid marl and cow manure. We used a <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> to spread it across the wicket. The problem was knowing how to camouflage what we'd done. Then I hit on the use of cut grass. I sprinkled it all over the top and gave it a good roll." [...] The other matches in the Bath cricket festival were saved.|$|E
2500|$|Acidity is a {{dominant}} player in any {{food and wine}} pairing due to the pronounced and complex ways that it can heighten the perception of flavors. In wine tasting, acidity is perceived by a mouth watering response by the salivary glands. This mouth <b>watering</b> <b>can</b> also serve to stimulate the appetite. In wine there are three main acids that have their own associated flavors-malic (green apples), lactic (milky) and tartaric (bitter). In dishes that are fatty, oily, rich or salty, acidity in wine can [...] "cut" [...] (or standout and contrast) through the heaviness and be a refreshing change of pace on the palate. In cooking, acidity is often used in similar fashions such as a lemon wedges with a briny seafood dish such as oysters. The acidity of the lemon juices can make the oysters seem less briny. A wine that is less tart than the dish it is served with will taste thin and weak. A wine that comes across as [...] "too tart" [...] on its own may seem softer when paired with an acidic and tart dish. The complementing [...] "tartness" [...] {{of the food and}} wine cancels each other out and allows the other components (fruit of the wine, other flavors of the food) to be more noticeable.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not long}} before the {{expected}} happened. A girl in a white gown appeared in the garden immediately below him, singing softly to herself and wielding a <b>watering</b> <b>can.</b> Presently she saw Jacob and paused in her task. Jacob raised his hat and she came slowly towards him. His heart thumped against his ribs. He thought of [...] "Maud" [...] and other sentimental poems, where the heroine was scornful and of high degree, and the lover very much her slave. Sybil Bultiwell's expression was certainly not encouraging.|$|E
50|$|Heating is {{therefore}} only necessary later, since warm <b>water</b> <b>can</b> {{be taken from}} above for longer, as opposed to mixed storage. In addition, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be drawn with almost the same temperature very quickly after filling with hot water, since {{not all of the}} storage tank has to be heated. This optimises energy efficiency.|$|R
50|$|Altruism {{does not}} require {{self-sacrifice}} but sacrifice, such as time or energy, is shown to be of greater significance. Second, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> {{be said to be}} modest since naturally water always goes to the lowest position. Instead of competing for a high position, water is yielding moving to a position below others. Again, one <b>can</b> learn from <b>water</b> to be humble and modest. Third, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be described as adaptable and flexible as it matches the shape of any container. <b>Water</b> <b>can</b> not be broken and is able to adjust to pressure and work around it. The lesson, according to Lee, is to be flexible and adaptable to different people in different situations. Fourth, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be very clear and transparent. Being clear shows others that you are trustworthy, as you have nothing to hide. Gentle and persistent force will complete the task overtime, rather than forcing a task and creating more problems. In other words, human beings should be honest and transparent with others. Finally, <b>water</b> <b>can</b> be very soft and gentle (making it difficult to catch) but also strong and persistent (even the hardest rock will yield to continuous drips of water).|$|R
