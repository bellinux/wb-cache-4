50|$|Twenty {{months before}} the flight, the British Airline Pilots' Association had {{recommended}} to the Civil Aviation Authority that <b>weather</b> <b>minima</b> for visual flights were unsatisfactory, but the recommendations were still being reviewed {{at the time of}} the flight. The minima listed in the British Airways Helicopters operating manual was similar to other helicopter operators, though Cooper noted that too much discretion was allowed to the flight crew regarding how much they monitored flight instruments during a visual flight.|$|E
50|$|Visual {{flight rules}} (VFR) are {{a set of}} {{regulations}} under which a pilot operates an aircraft in weather conditions generally clear enough to allow the pilot {{to see where the}} aircraft is going. Specifically, the weather must be better than basic VFR <b>weather</b> <b>minima,</b> i.e. in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), as specified in the rules of the relevant aviation authority. The pilot must be able to operate the aircraft with visual reference to the ground, and by visually avoiding obstructions and other aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the {{recommendations}} to the FAA were closed {{as a result of}} the June 20, 1991, issuance of Advisory Circular (AC) 135-14A, [...] "Emergency Medical Services/Helicopter (EMS/H)," [...] which addressed equipment, training, crew resource management (CRM), decision-making, flight-following procedures, <b>weather</b> <b>minimums,</b> and the development of safety programs for EMS helicopter flights operating under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135. Although the Safety Board expressed concern at the time that the FAA chose to issue an AC instead of regulations, the number of EMS accidents was decreasing, thus {{the recommendations}} were closed.|$|R
500|$|Midway is {{surrounded}} by buildings and other development, so the landing thresholds of the runways are displaced to provide obstacle clearance. The FAA and the airlines ensure safety by adhering to calculated load limits and various <b>weather</b> <b>minimums.</b> Because of the displaced landing thresholds, the runways have shorter distances available for landings than for takeoffs. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has an available landing distance of [...] in the southeast direction, and [...] to the northwest. The largest aircraft normally seen at Midway is the Boeing 757. Normally, commercial planes only take off from and land on runways 4R/22L and 13C/31C. The other runways are used by smaller aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{a course}} {{projected}} by localizer {{is at an}} angle to the runway (usually due to obstructions near the airport). It is then referred to as a localizer type directional aid (LDA). The localizer system is placed about 1,000 feet from {{the far end of the}} approached runway. Usable volume extends to 18 NM for a path up to 10° either side of runway centerline. At an angle of 35° either side of runway centerline, the useful volume extends up to 10 NM. Horizontal accuracy increases as distance between the aircraft and localizer decreases. Localizer approach specific <b>weather</b> <b>minimums</b> are found on approach plates.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{unlike the}} United States, unless {{specifically}} exempted {{by a company}} Operating Certificate, IFR flight plans require an alternate airport, regardless of the forecast destination weather. In order to {{be considered as a}} legally valid alternate, the airport must be forecast to be at or above certain <b>weather</b> <b>minima</b> at the estimated time of arrival (at the alternate). The minimum weather conditions vary based on the type of approach(es) available at the alternate airport, and may be found in the General section of the Canada Air Pilot (CAP).|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to other operations, CAT III <b>weather</b> <b>minima</b> {{do not provide}} sufficient visual references to allow a manual landing to be made. CAT III minima depend on roll-out control and redundancy of the autopilot, because they give only enough time for the pilot {{to decide whether the}} aircraft will land in the touchdown zone (basically CAT IIIa) and to ensure safety during rollout (basically CAT IIIb). Therefore, an automatic landing system is mandatory to perform Category III operations. Its reliability must be sufficient to control the aircraft to touchdown in CAT IIIa operations and through rollout to a safe taxi speed in CAT IIIb (and CAT IIIc when authorized). [...] However, special approval has been granted to some operators for hand-flown CAT III approaches using a head-up display (HUD) guidance which provides the pilot with an image viewed through the windshield with eyes focused at infinity, of necessary electronic guidance to land the airplane with no true outside visual references.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} in question, VT-EGD, {{had been involved}} in an earlier accident. On January 15, 1986, the pilot of flight 529 attempted to land at Tiruchirapalli in conditions below <b>weather</b> <b>minima</b> (reported Wx was exactly the minima). During a go-around (wave-off, just before touch down) the wing contacted the runway due to an excessive bank angle (the delay in spool up times for both engines were more than 5 seconds apart with the right engine slow). The HIALS was not switched on at the time 529 was approaching and the ATC anemometer was unserviceable. The wing was substantially damaged, but there were no injuries among the 6 crew and 122 passengers. The pilot displayed great skill in manually flying the B737 at FL100 and diverted to Chennai and landed safely with flight controls in [...] "manual reversion" [...] on runway 07 [...] The aircraft was to be phased out {{by the end of the}} year per Indian government guidelines which do not allow aircraft over 20 years old to operate in Indian airspace.|$|E

40|$|A 75 flight-hour {{operational}} evaluation {{was conducted with}} a representative four-engine fan-jet transport in a representative airport environment. The flight instrument systems were modified to automatically provide pilots with smooth and continuous pitch steering command information during two-segment approaches. Considering adverse <b>weather,</b> <b>minimum</b> ceiling and flight crew experience criteria, a transition initiation altitude of approximately 800 feet AFL would have broadest acceptance for initiating two-segment approach procedures in scheduled service. The profile defined by the system gave an upper glidepath of approximately 6 1 / 2 degrees. This was 1 / 2 degree greater than inserted into the area navigation system.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of radar {{approach}}es: Precision (PAR) and Surveillance (ASR).A radar approach may be given to any aircraft upon request and may be offered to pilots of aircraft in distress or to expedite traffic; however, an ASR might not be approved unless there is an ATC operational requirement, or in an unusual situation or emergency. Acceptance of a PAR or ASR by a pilot does not waive the prescribed <b>weather</b> <b>minimums</b> for the airport or for the particular aircraft operator concerned. The decision to make a radar approach when the reported weather is below the established minimums rests with the pilot. PAR and ASR minimums are published on separate pages in the FAA's terminal procedures publication.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} carried out to assess the {{feasibility}} of piloted steep curved, and decelerating approach profiles in powered lift STOL aircraft.

The results suggest that such moderately complex piloted instrument approaches may indeed be feasible from a pilot acceptance point of view, given an acceptable navigation environment.

40|$|Summary. The {{factors are}} {{considered}} which influence the landing flare, especially of large aircraft. The height {{required for the}} flare {{is a function of}} the performance and the dynamic response characteristics of an aircraft but, in practice, limitations of pilots ' judgement may make it more difficult, especially on large aircraft, to realise fully the theoretically available flare capability and, also, the desired precision in control over touchdown. These limitations may increase the required <b>weather</b> <b>minima</b> and also the margins in runway-length to accommodate the increased scatter of touchdown, unless aids are provided to assist the pilot in more positive touchdown control. Recovery from disturbances due to gusts during the landing flare is also shown to become marginal for the larger aircraft with more sluggish elevator response. Manoeuvre boost offers scope for significant improvement but for the very large aircraft direct lift control appears the most promising technique capable of overcoming this and other problems raised in this Report.

2500|$|There {{are a large}} {{variety of}} {{helicopter}} makes that are used for the civilian HEMS models. The commonly used types are the Bell 206, 407, and 429, Eurocopter AS350, BK117, EC130, EC135, EC145, and the Agusta Westland 109 & 149 and Sikorsky S-76. [...] Fixed wing aircraft varieties commonly include the Learjet 35, Learjet 36, Learjet 31, King Air 90, King Air 200, Pilatus PC-12, and Piper Cheyenne. [...] Due to {{the configuration of the}} medical crew and patient compartments, these aircraft are normally configured to only transport one patient but some can be configured to transport two patients if so needed. Additionally, helicopters have stricter <b>weather</b> <b>minimums</b> that they can operate in and commonly do not fly at altitudes over 10,000 feet above sea level.|$|R
5000|$|Naval flight {{officers}} operate some of {{the advanced}} systems on board most multi-crew naval aircraft, and some may also act as the overall tactical mission commanders of single or multiple aircraft assets during a given mission.

Some current and recently retired naval aircraft with side-by-side seating are also authorized to operate under dual-piloted <b>weather</b> <b>minimums</b> with one pilot and one NFO. However, in the unlikely event that the pilot of a single piloted naval aircraft becomes incapacitated, the crew would likely eject or bail out, if possible, as NFOs are not normally qualified to land the aircraft, especially in the carrier-based shipboard environment.|$|R
50|$|Dirt, pollution, salt, and {{particularly}} {{water on the}} surface of a high voltage insulator can create a conductive path across it, causing leakage currents and flashovers. The flashover voltage can be reduced by more than 50% when the insulator is wet. High voltage insulators for outdoor use are shaped to maximise the length of the leakage path along the surface {{from one end to the}} other, called the creepage length, to minimise these leakage currents. To accomplish this the surface is moulded into a series of corrugations or concentric disc shapes. These usually include one or more sheds; downward facing cup-shaped surfaces that act as umbrellas to ensure that the part of the surface leakage path under the 'cup' stays dry in wet <b>weather.</b> <b>Minimum</b> creepage distances are 20-25 mm/kV, but must be increased in high pollution or airborne sea-salt areas.|$|R
