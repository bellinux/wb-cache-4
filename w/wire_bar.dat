2500|$|Drawing is a {{metalworking}} {{process which}} uses tensile forces to stretch metal or glass. As the metal is drawn (pulled), it stretches thinner, into a desired shape and thickness. Drawing is classified in two types: sheet metal drawing and <b>wire,</b> <b>bar,</b> and tube drawing. The specific definition for sheet metal drawing {{is that it}} involves plastic deformation over a curved axis. For <b>wire,</b> <b>bar,</b> and tube drawing the starting stock is drawn through a die to reduce its diameter and increase its length. Drawing is usually done at room temperature, thus classified a cold working process, however it may be performed at elevated temperatures to hot work large wires, rods or hollow sections {{in order to reduce}} forces.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was the {{optimization}} of wire drawing process parameters. Design/methodology/approach: The hard binding material determined according to American standard ANSI/AWSA 5. 8 - 92 as High-temp 095 was chosen to the analysis of wire drawing process. It is hard solder with high fluidity properties. Findings: <b>Wires,</b> <b>bars</b> and strips are the most often use forms of this solder on the base of copper with low deformability properties, which shows crack sensitivity during cold plastic working processes so there was the necessity to determining optimal parameters of initial material use to the later cold plastic working processes. Research limitations/implications: To the numerical analysis of Hi-temp 095 wire drawing process the Drawing 2 d programme based of finite element method, has been use, for initial materials obtained on the casting and extrusion way. Practical implications: The optimal properties of basic material use for further plastic working processes were determined. Originality/value: The rheology of materials after casting and extrusion processes were determined...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-roll}} {{process is}} a significant technique {{in the production of}} <b>wire</b> rod, round <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles for structural applications. Better mechanical properties of <b>wire</b> rod, round <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles can be achieved due to large plastic deformation by the three-roll process. Asymmetric rolling is a novel technique characterised by a kinematic asymmetry linked to the difference in peripheral speed of the rolls, able to introduce additional shear strains through the bar thickness. In order to achieve this, asymmetrical three-roll rolling process was investigated to better control the deformation compared to the conventional three-roll rolling process in a stand with two three-roll calibers located very close to each other. Simulation of round-triangle-triangle pass rolling was performed. FEM simulations were carried out with using software DEFORM 3 D. The influence of the friction coefficient and speed asymmetry on the shear strain and material flow was discussed. The results of simulation can be used to optimize the asymmetric three-roll rolling process to improve the mechanical properties of <b>wire</b> rod, round <b>bars</b> and hexagonal profiles...|$|R
