Blacks arrived at white churches to integrate services. They were accepted in Roman Catholic, Episcopal, and Presbyterian churches but turned away at others, where they knelt and prayed until they were arrested. Well-known national figures arrived to show support. Singer Joan Baez arrived to perform for free at Miles College and stayed at the black-owned and integrated Gaston Motel. Comedian Dick Gregory and Barbara Deming, a writer for The Nation, were both arrested. The young Dan Rather reported for CBS News. The car of Fannie Flagg, a local television personality and recent Miss Alabama finalist, was surrounded by teenagers who recognized her. Flagg worked at Channel 6 on the morning show, and after asking her producers why the show was not covering the demonstrations, she received orders never to mention them on air. She {{rolled down the window}} and shouted to the children, [...] "I'm <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> the way!" ...|$|E

She then introduces [...] "Be with You" [...] as one of her favorite slow jams and starts singing it. For the beginning of [...] "Speechless" [...] she sits on a chair singing the song. She asks the fans in the arena to cheer and announced [...] "Well, this is my very first solo tour as an artist and I'm very happy to share this wonderful experience <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> tonight in London". She then starts performing a short Destiny's Child medley beginning with [...] "Bug a Boo". Beyoncé then tells the story about the group's first single [...] "No, No, No Part 2" [...] and continues performing the song. [...] "Bootylicious", [...] "Jumpin' Jumpin'", [...] "Say My Name", [...] "Independent Women Part I", [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and [...] "Survivor" [...] are performed afterwards as part of the medley. She introduces the next song [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] saying that she wrote it for all the ladies, [...] "I thought it was something we all need to hear. When we get in these relationships they don't work out. Sometimes we blame the man, we blame another girl, we blame ourselves. But I think we should take every experience and learn a lesson out of it, even the bad experiences and I want all the ladies to know that we will never disappoint ourselves. You'll always have yourself." [...] She introduces the next song [...] "Summertime" [...] as one of her favorite songs asking from the crowd to dance further performing a step dance while footage of flowers was projected on the screen. The lights go out again and Beyoncé appears wearing a grey, sparkly dress for an extended performance of [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] surrounded by smoke. After the word [...] "Beyoncé" [...] is written on the screen several times, she appears on a staircase wearing a long shirt as the opening lines of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] start and the song's music video is projected on the screen. Beyoncé then continues singing the song and performing its choreography with her female background dancers and confetti are dropped on stage during the end of the performance.|$|E

2500|$|Zangwill {{endorsed}} {{feminism and}} pacifism, but his greatest effect {{may have been}} as a writer who popularised {{the idea of the}} combination of ethnicities into a single, American nation. The hero of his widely produced play, The Melting Pot, proclaims: [...] "America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and reforming... Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russians – into the Crucible <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>all!</b> God is making the American." ...|$|E
2500|$|After nine weeks, Gilman {{was sent}} home with Mitchell's instructions, [...] "Live as {{domestic}} a life as possible. Have your child <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> the time... Lie down an hour after each meal. Have but two hours' intellectual life a day. And never touch pen, brush or pencil {{as long as you}} live." [...] She tried for a few months to follow Mitchell's advice, but her depression deepened, and Gilman came perilously close to a full emotional collapse. Her remaining sanity was on the line and she began to display suicidal behavior that involved talk of pistols and chloroform, as recorded in her husband's diaries. By early summer the couple had decided that a divorce was necessary for her to regain sanity without affecting the lives of her husband and daughter.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} the hire of persons, animals, or {{utensils}} were all {{subject to the}} law of [...] that [...] "in the same day you shall give him his hire" [...] and the law of [...] that [...] "the wages of a hired servant shall not abide <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> night until the morning." [...] The employer became liable only when the worker or vendor demanded payment from the employer. Otherwise, the employer did not infringe the law. If the employer gave the worker or vendor a draft on a shopkeeper or a money changer, the employer complied with the law. A worker who claimed the wages within the set time could collect payment if the worker merely swore that the employer had not yet paid. But if the set time had passed, the worker’s oath was insufficient to collect payment. Yet if the worker had witnesses that the worker had demanded payment (within the set time), the worker could still swear and receive payment.|$|E
2500|$|Book of Leviticus: [...] "God {{spoke to}} Moses at Mount Sinai, {{telling him to}} speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you come to the land that I am giving you, the land must be given a rest period, a sabbath to God. For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops, but the seventh year is a sabbath of sabbaths for the land. It is God's sabbath during which you may not plant your fields, nor prune your vineyards. Do not harvest crops that grow on their own and do not gather the grapes on your unpruned vines, since it is a year of rest for the land. [...] the land is resting may be eaten by you, by your male and female slaves, and by the {{employees}} and resident hands who live <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>All</b> the crops shall be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land." [...] (Leviticus 25:1–7) [...] "And if ye shall say: 'What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase'; then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store." [...] (Leviticus 25:20–22) [...] " [...] I will scatter you among the nations, and keep the sword drawn against you. Your land will remain desolate, and your cities in ruins. Then, as long as the land is desolate and you are in your enemies' land, the land will enjoy its sabbaths. The land will rest and enjoy its sabbatical years. Thus, {{as long as it is}} desolate, [...] will enjoy the sabbatical rest that you would not give it when you lived there." [...] (Leviticus 26:33-35) ...|$|E
