500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Liz Lemon having a dream {{in which she}} is married to Jack Donaghy and is giving birth to their child. Since its beginning, the series has {{occasionally}} hinted at a romantic relationship between Liz and Jack. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, {{and in the same}} episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, series creator Tina Fey said that one of the plots the show will never do is have Liz and Jack get together. [...] "Let me put the Internet at ease: Liz and Jack will never be together." [...] Alec Baldwin was asked if the two characters will ever hook up; he responded [...] "I sincerely doubt it, and I think the show is better off that way.

Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I am not going to respond to that question out of privacy for myself and Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E

500|$|In the episode, it is {{revealed}} that Jack Donaghy accidentally married Liz Lemon {{instead of his}} girlfriend Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks). At the wedding, Liz was Jack's best man and wore a white shirt with a head net, while Avery wore a black cocktail dress. As {{a result of what}} Liz was wearing, the minister (Jean Brassard) instead married Jack and Liz. The two decide to get a divorce, however, they use their marriage to get the upper hand over one another. Ultimately, Jack and Liz decide to stop their feud and get a divorce. Since beginning, the series has occasionally hinted at a romantic relationship between the two characters. In one episode, Jack passes Liz off as his live-in girlfriend to his ex-wife Bianca (Isabella Rossellini) to make her jealous. In another episode, Jack's mother Colleen Donaghy (Elaine Stritch) tells him that Liz is a perfect match for him, and in the same episode he has Liz listed as his emergency contact. In an April 2010 Esquire interview, Fey said that one of the plots that 30 Rock will never do is have Liz and Jack get together.

2500|$|On June 18, Rowley {{addressed}} Bolden's {{allegations in}} testimony {{provided to the}} Warren Commission. Rowley explained that Bolden was selected to rotate through the White House detail for 30 days {{in the summer of}} 1961 as part of an orientation program, and that Bolden's allegations referred to a 5-day span in Hyannis Port. When J. Lee Rankin, general counsel for the Warren Commission, asked him when he received Bolden's complaint, Rowley replied: [...] "The fact is he never informed me. He never informed any of his supervisors or anyone on the detail." [...] Rankin then interrupted his questioning of Rowley to state: [...] "I think the record should show, Mr. Chairman, that we were never advised that he wanted to testify, nor had we any inquiry or anything about the matter, until after <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> it in the newspapers. And, even then, he didn't ask to testify. And we asked the FBI to check into it, and he had counsel and they refused to tell anything about the matter at that time." [...] Rowley later stated that there was [...] "no truth to the charges of misconduct". He added that Bolden had leveled eleven charges and that there was partial truth to one of the charges (that the agents had purchased two or three cases of beer which were available to agents coming off duty), but that his investigation found that there were no violations of Secret Service regulations. In response to Rankin's questioning, Rowley answered that Bolden's indictment {{was the first time he}} could recall that a criminal complaint was lodged against a Secret Service agent.|$|E

6000|$|Now Biedenbach, {{after he}} left Glen Ellen, had invented a most {{powerful}} explosive--"expedite" [...] he called it. This was the weapon the balloons used. They were only hot-air balloons, clumsily and hastily made, but they did the work. I saw it all {{from the top of}} an office building. The first balloon missed the fortresses completely and disappeared into the country; but <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> it afterward. Burton and O'Sullivan were in it. As they were descending they swept across a railroad directly over a troop-train that was heading at full speed for Chicago. They dropped their whole supply of expedite upon the locomotive. The resulting wreck tied the line up for days. And the best of it was that, released from the weight of expedite, the balloon shot up into the air and did not come down for half a dozen miles, both heroes escaping unharmed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Eeldrop, [...] "was {{that fat}} Spaniard, who {{sat at the}} table with us this evening, and listened to our {{conversation}} with occasional curiosity, why was he himself for a moment an object of interest to us? He wore his napkin tucked into his chin, he made unpleasant noises while eating, and while not eating, his way of crumbling bread between fat fingers made me extremely nervous: he wore a waistcoat cafe au lait, and black boots with brown tops. He was oppressively gross and vulgar; he belonged to a type, he could easily be classified in any town of provincial Spain. Yet under the circumstances--when we had been discussing marriage, and he suddenly leaned forward and exclaimed: 'I was married once myself'--we were able to detach him from his classification and regard him for a moment as an unique being, a soul, however insignificant, with a history of its own, once for all. It is these moments which we prize, and which alone are revealing. For any vital truth is incapable of being applied to another case: the essential is unique. Perhaps that is why it is so neglected: because it is useless. What <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> that Spaniard is incapable of being applied to any other Spaniard, or even recalled in words. With the decline of orthodox theology and its admirable theory of the soul, the unique importance of events has vanished. A man is only important as he is classed. Hence there is no tragedy, or no appreciation of tragedy, which is the same thing. We had been talking of young Bistwick, who three months ago married his mother's housemaid and now is aware of the fact. Who appreciates the truth of the matter? Not the relatives, for they are only moved by affection, by regard for Bistwick's interests, and chiefly by their collective feeling of family disgrace. Not the generous minded and thoughtful outsider, who regards it merely as evidence for the necessity of divorce law reform. Bistwick is classed among the unhappily married. But what Bistwick feels when he wakes up in the morning, which is the great important fact, no detached outsider conceives. The awful importance of the ruin of a life is overlooked. Men are only allowed to be happy or miserable in classes. In Gopsum Street a man murders his mistress. The important fact is that for the man the act is eternal, and that for the brief space he has to live, he is already dead. He is already in a different world from ours. He has crossed the frontier. The important fact is that something is done which can not be undone--a possibility which none of us realize until we face it ourselves. For the man's neighbors the important fact is what the man killed her with? And at precisely what time? And who found the body? For the 'enlightened public' the case is merely evidence for the Drink question, or Unemployment, or some other category of things to be reformed. But the mediaeval world, insisting on the eternity of punishment, expressed something nearer the truth." ...|$|E
