Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should see if we can find him." ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{months after}} the episode aired, Bill Clinton, who served as {{president}} of the United States at the time, held the first ever White House conference on Mental Health. Scripps Howard News Service columnist Deroy Murdock mentioned the timeliness of the conference in connection with the episode as being an instance of The Simpsons [...] "clairvoyantly predict the news". In 2007, the fictional word [...] "exorcism tongs" [...] appeared in Cracked.com's list [...] "From Cromulent to Craptacular: The Top 12 Simpsons Created Words", ranking in at number 10. The word is used in a scene in which Homer eats a mixture of taffy and Focusyn, which puts him in a [...] "mildly hallucinogenic state". Seeing this, Todd Flanders asks his father, Ned, [...] "Does Mr. Simpson have a demon, daddy?" [...] To which Ned replies, [...] "Looks like it. Run and get daddy's exorcism tongs." [...] About the word, Mark Peters and Daniel O' Brien of Cracked.com wrote [...] "We'd be lying if <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> didn't go out to every Christian-themed general store in the country hoping to acquire our very own set of exorcism tongs the day this episode aired." ...|$|E

500|$|Homesick was {{produced}} by Gilbert, and was mixed by Adam Dutkiewicz of Killswitch Engage, with mixing taking place in December 2008, at Zing Studios. Mastering took place at West West Side Studios, by Alan Douches. The album features three guesting vocalists: Mike Hranica of The Devil Wears Prada on [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?", Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain on [...] "Welcome to the Family", and Sierra Kusterbeck of VersaEmerge on [...] "If It Means a Lot to You". The latter featured harmonica played by Dave Guynn. One of the tracks written for Homesick was held over for What Separates Me from You (2010). An instrumental entitled [...] "Money Maker" [...] was also recorded during the sessions, but McKinnon had difficulties with it. He later explained: [...] "when {{it came down to}} writing vocal parts [...] I just couldn't get that song done. [...] I think it was the best music for the whole record. The music was just so catchy on its own [...] so <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> will just set this aside for next time around." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten {{and we did not}} lose a single game in Europe. And, though <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> would do it again next year, we all knew it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 February 2015, US General Lloyd Austin {{stated that}} over 8,500 ISIL militants {{had been killed}} by Coalition airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.

2500|$|The Dust Brothers had a {{bunch of}} music {{together}}, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they'd planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – [...] "Shake Your Rump," [...] for example. They'd put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, but we wanted all of that stuff on there. I think half of the tracks were written when we got there, and the other half we wrote together." ...|$|E

Pete Laurie of theMusic website found [...] "isn't about reinventing the wheel, but it never sounds like a lazy rehash of {{the good old days}} either". Lewis explained to The Ages Martin Boulton [...] "We got to a point after the re-formation where we decided not to put an end date on it [...] <b>we</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> can't keep playing that same period [...] {{for the rest of our}} lives [...] While we love it and we know our fans love it … in order to be a relevant, creative unit [...] for our own personal satisfaction more than anything, we've got to try writing again and doing something new together and that's been really interesting and amazing". The group announced an Australian tour to promote the album during November and December 2013.|$|E
5000|$|A {{couple of}} months ago, those fascist motherfuckers at the Fox News Network {{attempted}} to pin this band into a corner by suggesting that <b>we</b> <b>said</b> {{that the president should}} be assassinated.
