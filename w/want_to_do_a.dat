5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now founded as id Software, {{used some of}} these games to {{prototype}} ideas for their own games, including in late spring of 1991 Keen Dreams, which they used to develop new systems for their next set of major episodes of the series. They did not initially <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping to improve the next full set of games for Apogee. The team reprised their roles from the first game, and prototyped an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, {{was designed to be}} a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel. Once the parallax scrolling and design changes were completed, Keen Dreams was completed {{in less than a month}} even as the team simultaneously worked on another game.|$|E
5|$|In October—December 1990, {{a team of}} {{employees}} from programming studio Softdisk, calling themselves Ideas from the Deep, developed the three-part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons. The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the Gamer's Edge video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After {{the release of the}} game in December, and the arrival of the first US$10,500 royalty check from shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game—the team had created the game on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends—the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months. Ideas from the Deep, now founded as id Software, used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own releases, such as Catacomb 3-D. In late spring of 1991 they worked on a new Keen game in order to develop new systems for their next major release in the Commander Keen series. They did not initially <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping improve the next full set of games for Apogee.|$|E

25|$|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, {{the third}} {{film in the}} popular Indiana Jones series, went through a flimsy {{scripting}} process before Boam was hired to write a draft. As early as 1984, George Lucas was playing {{with the concept of}} having the fictional archeologist-adventurer encounter the fabled Holy Grail, the cup said to have been used by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper. Director Steven Spielberg rejected Lucas's script outlines, disliking the Grail idea. Screenwriter Diane Thomas wrote a haunted house story for Indiana Jones, but Spielberg said that after producing Poltergeist, he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> similar film. Lucas hired Chris Columbus to write a draft for the film, and he submitted Indiana Jones and the Lost City of Sun Wu Kung, a story with evil spirits, ghosts, and demons. Again, Spielberg rejected the story as not believable enough. Lucas convinced him {{to go back to the}} Holy Grail idea, and Menno Meyjes was hired to develop another screenplay. The new script focused on the Arthurian legend aspect of the Holy Grail. Although the script was not to the liking of Lucas and Spielberg, it had elements that eventually became part of the finished film: the Holy Grail, and the introduction of Indiana Jones' father, Henry Jones, Sr.|$|E

She agreed, but only if he recorded a song with her, to which he in turn agreed. Lopez recalled the events on her [...] video album by stating: [...] "So at that time I called Tommy [...] and I'm like 'Look, so Marc Anthony said he would do a song and I really don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> duet with just anybody, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> duet with him.

500|$|The {{songs for}} Frozen were written and {{composed}} by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, {{both of whom}} had previously worked with Disney Animation on Winnie the Pooh (2011) (also produced by Del Vecho, who then hired them for Frozen) and before that, with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo– The Musical (2007). Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters). Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent. The decision, of course, was easy: [...] "Whenever Disney asks if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> fairy tale musical, you say yes." ...|$|E

When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that [...] "illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret." [...] For Barker, the song's drum track was [...] "super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse.
