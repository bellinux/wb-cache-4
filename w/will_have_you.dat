500|$|Critical {{reception}} {{for the character}} from both professionals and fans has been positive. In his DVD review for DVD Verdict, Bill Treadway called Patrick [...] "the village idiot, who sometimes gives SpongeBob some really bad advice, {{but he is a}} loyal friend and that's something we don't see much of these days." [...] He said, [...] "Patrick is the definition of stupid and his antics <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> laughing out loud." [...] In a review published in 2007, Peter Keepnews of The New York Times said, [...] "Patrick is a popular character, and the new episodes illustrate why: He is unfailingly enthusiastic, touchingly loyal and absolutely undeterred by his intellectual limitations. Hilariously voiced by Bill Fagerbakke, he is not just an endearing comic creation but a role model for idiots everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Can I Have It Like That" [...] {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Entertainment Weekly {{called it an}} [...] "odd opener" [...] to In My Mind and remarked that Williams [...] "never commits to putting his hips into it", leaving the track without any climax. [...] The Observers Luke Bainbridge, however, referred to the song as [...] "a grinding instant smash". For IGN, Spence Abbott described Williams' rapping as [...] "a little sticky, but…ruggedly appealing {{in a manner of}} speaking", and commented that [...] "it's the shuffling and infectious beat…that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> swerving and slinking like a cobra with epilepsy." [...] In his review for Slant Magazine, Preston Jones characterized the song as [...] "curiously inert", adding that it sounded better as a sample on Girl Talk's 2006 mashup album Night Ripper.|$|E

500|$|Super Mario Strikers {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with reviewers lauding the game's characterisation and visual style, being reminiscent {{to that of}} Kazuto Nakazawa. GameSpot's Brian Ekberg praised the game's accessibility, stating that [...] "Strikers' pick-up-and-play design <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> playing like a cartoon Pele in no time". Similarly, critics welcomed the developers' choice to forgo traditional football rules in the favour of a more arcade-like style of gameplay. Despite this, IGN complained of a [...] "disappointingly slim" [...] variety of modes, {{as well as the}} perceived small roster of characters and inflexibility when choosing teams. On a similar note, Eurogamer criticised the vague presentation of characters attributes, making it difficult to determine what their respective strengths and weaknesses are. Despite enjoying the variety and appearance of Strikers stadia, GameSpot noted only cosmetic differences among them, and criticised a lack of physical features to make them more interesting.|$|E
500|$|... "Breakaway" [...] is a folk pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and fifty-seven seconds. It is {{composed}} in the key of C major, with a tempo of 160 beats per minute. T.U. Dawood of Dawn lauded the song for being the best track on the album, writing [...] ""Breakaway" [...] is an enchanting single that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> humming along to its infectious, gentle chorus and the inspiring lyrics." [...] It has a chord progression of Am7–GB–C-F(9) and Clarkson's vocal range in the song spans two octaves from the low note of G3 to the note of D5. Sam Lansky of PopCrush.com thought that Clarkson's vocal floated over strummed guitars and airy drums, a combination which elevated the inspirational message of the song. Dave Donelly of Sputnikmusic noted that [...] "Breakaway" [...] successfully contrasted typical acoustic verse with a soaring pop chorus which was interspersed by Clarkson’s controlled but powerful voice.|$|E
500|$|Club Life: Volume Two Miami {{has been}} well {{received}} by music critics. The album provoked Elektro Daily Cynthia Conte to conclude that Tiësto [...] "drops some serious fierce beats that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> dancing all day and all night". Analogous sentiments were echoed by Sanam Wadhwani, who concluded: [...] "Overall, Club Life Volume Two: Miami is a perfect symphony of sound for all listeners of music and is a must buy." [...] iEnlive commended the album's bombastic approach, and asserted that it accurately embodied Miami's electronic music scene. [...] "As the time is finally here, the international DJ maestro presents his finest work as the album is a home to stellar productions, including collaborations with Wolfgang Gartner and unique remixes of Afrojack's latest hit 'Can’t Stop Me Now' as well as Gotye's 'Somebody I Used To Know'. It’s big, and it’s here."

500|$|Portal 2s {{additional}} gameplay elements, like light bridges, lasers, and the gels, were praised {{as appropriate}} {{additions to the}} game. Reviewers were pleased with {{the difficulty of the}} puzzles throughout the game, which appeared visually complicated at first but had uncomplicated solutions. Times Evan Narcisse said that he feared the addition of new gameplay elements would [...] "dilute the purity of the experience, but everything's still executed with Valve's high level of charm and panache." [...] Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph praised the manner with which these elements were introduced through a [...] "brilliant learning curve of direction, rather than instruction", and considered it a [...] "design ethos that is supremely generous, but dealt with marvellous economy". Chris Kohler of Wired wrote that the game's puzzles [...] "never require excessively complicated solutions", and that much of the puzzle solving is [...] "filled with moments that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> slapping your forehead and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm such an idiotwhy didn't I see that before?. Stapleton was not as pleased with the gel additions as with the other new mechanics, calling it [...] "difficult to control". He felt that they have [...] "only a couple of uses at most".

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reception.

[...] Monica Collins of the Boston Herald {{said that the}} episode [...] "is {{one of the best}} of the series so far". The Dallas Morning News writer Ed Bark noted that [...] "Grace, Replaced" [...] was [...] "another energetic, generally amusing" [...] episode. Bark, in regards to Jack and Karen, said that the two together [...] "sometimes are almost more than the scenery can bear." [...] Aaron Barnhart for The Kansas City Star called the episode riotous, and said that the show [...] "with [...] pop-culture jokes delivered at blistering speed, outsized performances from 'supporting' players Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally, and a camaraderie between platonic pals Eric McCormack and Debra Massing that would make even Plato blush." [...] Ted Cox of the Daily Herald was less positive about the episode, reporting that this episode [...] "looked like more of the same", recounting the show's past story lines, and past NBC programs. Chicago Tribunes Steve Johnson opined that the episode [...] "starts strong and then goes awry [...] It's funny for a while [...] But then it takes it to a ludicrous level, selling out its own internal logic by conspiring to put [...] Shannon and Messing into a... catfight. At its best this series works a groove of pop-culture savvy; this visit from The Three Stooges by way of Dynasty <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> rolling your eyes in dismay." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott Matthewman, {{writing for}} The Stage, gave a mixed {{review of the}} episode. He thought that [...] "pretty much the only {{surprise}} {{in the way the}} humans who made up the Ood Corporation were presented came as PR girl Solana (Ayesha Dharker) escaped with the Doctor and Donna, only to betray their position by calling for the guards," [...] and [...] "the revelation that Ryder (Adrian Rawlins) has been working to infiltrate the Corporation is thrown away... as quickly as it is revealed." [...] However, he thought Donna was becoming [...] "fast... one of the strongest and most well-rounded companions in the series’ history", and [...] "there were some nice interpretations of the Ood’s natural development". Caitlin Moran of The Times thought the episode was [...] "really really good... – one that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> staring at your screen and asking, once again, 'How can something so good be happening so early on a Saturday night, in my own front room?'". She enjoyed the scene where the Doctor and Donna talk about slaves in contemporary culture, saying that Tate [...] "really, really isn’t that bad when she says [...] ". Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode five stars out of five. Rawson-Jones opened his review by saying [...] "Doctor Who can occasionally transcend the properties of a mere family television show to reach out and give viewers a poignant, beautiful epiphany and greater sense of the world they inhabit," [...] citing Donna's reaction on seeing the uncultivated Ood as the moving part of the episode.|$|E

The film currently scores a 95% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals." [...] Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it [...] "could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as [...] "a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines" [...] Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, [...] "Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as [...] "a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling." [...] Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that [...] "Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is [...] "an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it {{to the level of}} an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view." [...] Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that [...] "the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be." [...] The Times of India wrote, [...] "Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping." [...] Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote [...] "a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn a bit about India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giving Beowulf {{three out}} of four stars, Roger Ebert argues that the film is a satire of the {{original}} poem. Time magazine critic Richard Corliss describes the film as one with [...] "power and depth" [...] and suggests that the [...] "effects scenes look realer , more integrated into the visual fabric, because they meet the traced-over live-action elements halfway. It all suggests that this kind of a moviemaking is more than a stunt. By imagining the distant past so vividly, Zemeckis and his team prove that character capture has a future." [...] Corliss later named it the 10th best film of 2007. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers argues that “The eighth-century Beowulf, goosed into twenty-first century life by a screenplay from sci-fi guru Neil Gaiman and Pulp Fictions Roger Avary, <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> jumping out of your skin and begging for more... I've never seen a 3-D movie pop with this kind of clarity and oomph. It's outrageously entertaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpy's William Cassidy {{scored the}} Game Boy Advance version 4.5 out of 5, praising the graphics, sound, combat {{system and the}} {{differentiation}} between the controllable characters. His only complaint was that [...] "the amount of sometimes pointless wandering." [...] He called the game [...] "an engaging, action-packed adventure that admirably re-creates the captivating atmosphere of the films. The characters, the locales, and even the music draw you in and create an exciting experience that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> playing through the entire quest several times." [...] IGN's Craig Harris scored it 8 out of 10, comparing it to Diablo and Gaunlet, and praising the co-op mode. He concluded [...] "even though The Two Towers is far from [...] "boring," [...] it does get a little repetitive in its hack-and-slash design." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 7.5 out of 10, writing [...] "it's mainly a Diablo or Gaunlet clone with story elements from the movie sprinkled throughout. With that in mind, it's surprisingly fun to roam throughout the lands of Middle-earth, slaying orcs and goblins." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dragon Ball Super {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} fans and critics alike.

[...] Jamieson Cox of The Verge also praised the title sequence and said that [...] "Dragon Ball Supers intro <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> begging for its North American release". Cox was also surprised that, considering how popular the franchise is, the series did not launch internationally at the same time. He called it [...] "a move that wouldn't be unprecedented" [...] giving Sailor Moon Crystal as an example. Lucas Siegel of Comicbook.com praised the debut episode for its [...] "laid back plotline" [...] and animation style and said that the debut was [...] "very much put out as a [...] "slice of life" [...] episode".

She {{played the role of}} a traffic accident victim in the film, which entered into the top five highest-grossing films of the year. Her performance in the film won her favourable reviews. Film critic M. Ali Ikram wrote about her performance: [...] "If there is a respite for Manisha's innumerable fans of late, this flick is it. We may not care about hits and flops, but it is painful to watch this acting virtuoso in the innumerable side roles she has been seen in of late. Indra Kumar's decision to cast Manisha here is a case of perfect casting, and she never lets him or the audience down. This lady is truly the Meena Kumari of her generation. It is great fun watching Manisha and Aamir Khan's perfect chemistry opposite one another. The film's climax has both stars permanently molding a spot for themselves in Bollywood history, and it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> shedding tears by the bucketful.The film was considered 'Average' at the box office." ...|$|E

[...] Rajeev Masand gave the film two out of five stars, calling it [...] "spectacularly boring", and wrote [...] "Don 2 is nicely shot, and there are moments where Shah Rukh Khan is riveting. But that’s not enough to hold your interest for well over two hours…even the actor’s most loyal fans will find themselves yawning." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave 2.5 out of 5, feeling that the original film was better as compared to the sequel but praised the action sequences, writing [...] "The car chases are superb and <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> at the edge of your seat. For the rest of the film though, you'll be slouching on that very seat, waiting for the thrills that the Don series promises."
