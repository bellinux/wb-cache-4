We then propose a method for leveraging domain knowledge in Information Extraction tasks, scoring candidate document labellings as one-value-per-field templates according to domain feasibility after generating sample labellings from a trained sequence classifier. Our relational models evaluate these templates according to our intuitions about agreement in the domain: workshop acronyms should resemble their names, <b>workshop</b> <b>dates</b> occur after paper submission dates. These methods see a 5 % f-score improvement in fields retrieved when sampling labellings from a Maximum-Entropy Markov Model, however we do not observe improvement over a CRF model. We discuss reasons for this, including the problem of recovering all field instances from a best template, and propose future work in adapting such a model to the CRF, a better standalone system. ...|$|E
40|$|The Community Pedestrian Safety Engagement Workshops are a {{community}} capacity building program to involve local residents in community pedestrian safety. The focus of these workshops is to engage, educate and empower residents {{to ensure they}} have the skills, knowledge and resources they need to become active in improving pedestrian safety in their neighborhood, district, city or county. This program uses pedestrian planning and community engagement curriculums {{as a framework for}} the content, and goes beyond this to tailor each workshop to the individual community needs, ensuring genuine resident engagement and continued involvement. This paper highlights the processes and strategies used to engage community residents with local professionals in pedestrian safety workshops throughout California. Several case studies are highlighted focusing on a variety of engagement techniques from obtaining elected official’s participation, outreaching and working with existing collaboratives and groups, working with youth volunteers, Video Voice, and peer learning and sharing. All of the workshops result in group-identified pedestrian safety priorities and actions for continued resident involvement and have connected previously inactive community members (both adults and youth) with community pedestrian activists.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. This {{small-scale}} study {{sought to}} investigate "The effectiveness of the training of School Governing Bodies provided by the KZN Department of Education: perceptions of parentmembers at three Phoenix West Ward schools of the Kwa-Mashu Circuit in the Ethekwini Region". This qualit ative study gathered data through the case study approach guided by the following key questions: 1. What are the parents ' perceptions regarding the training methods used at SGB workshops? 2. What are their perceptions regarding the adequacy and appropriateness of the training content? 3. What are their views {{in terms of how}} the training of SGBs can be made more fruitful ? The study entailed interviewing parent members of the SGBs at three Phoenix West schools, analysing training documents as well as observation of training workshops. The findings of the study revealed that the KZN Education Department basically uses the workshops approach and cascading method to train SGBs. It was also found that the cascade model used alone has problems. A lot of vital information gets distorted or lost as the information is cascaded to the lower levels. The cascade model also may lead to increased monopoly in attending workshops and consequently, marginalisation of other SGB members. In the light of the above challenges, I recommend that radio broadcasts be used to compliment the cascading model and other methods to transmit information to as many SGB members as possible. In addition to the written manuals that are provided to schools, it is recommended that other visual and audio resources such as training videos cassettes and CD materials be provided as part of the SGB training resource packs. This is possible now because most schools, even in rural areas, have electricity and television sets. The use of two different actors in the training field did not seem to add value to the objectives of training. These programmes were run by the School Governance Training Unit (SGTU) based at the Pinetown District Office and School Effectiveness Programme based at Ulundi (and later Pietermaritzburg) Head Office. They had separate programmes, budgets and officials. Instead of bringing development to the SGBs, these programmes seemed to have brought clashes of <b>workshop</b> <b>dates</b> and confusion to the SGBs. It is suggested that these programmes be amalgamated as they serve the same purpose for the SGBs...|$|E
40|$|This {{special issue}} of the Wiley International Journal of Satellite Communications and Networking hosts a {{selection}} of papers from the seventh Advanced Satellite Multimedia Systems (ASMS) Conference and the 13 th Signal Processing for Space Communications (SPSC) Workshop held in Livorno, Italy on 8 to 10 September 2014. The joint event was organized through a collaborative effort of the University of Bologna, the Institute of Communications and Navigation of DLR (German Aerospace Center), the European Space Agency (ESA), {{under the auspices of}} the Association ‘Toscana Spazio’ and the SatNEx III Network of Experts and in cooperation with the University of Pisa. The ASMS conference and SPSC workshop have become recognized events for industry and research institutions to exchange up-to-date information about recent advances and emerging technologies in the field of mobile satellite communication systems. The ESA's SPSC <b>workshop</b> <b>dates</b> back to 1988 when pioneering work in digital signal processing for satellite communications was first presented by worldwide authorities in the field. In addition, following the successful path opened by the 2006 edition of ASMS and continued with the 2008, 2010 and 2012 editions, the scope of the conference has been further widened, as the small though important change in its name by replacing the word ‘mobile’ with ‘multimedia’ testifies. This is remarkable not only because the major part of the SATCOM market belongs to broadcasting and broadband access operators but also fundamentally because the convergence of broadcast, mobile and fixed satellite communications is essential to offer seamless connectivity anywhere at any time, which is recognized as the key element for the successful deployment of future satellite systems. This issue collects the extended versions of six of the best papers presented at the last ASMS/SPSC joint event. The papers have been selected with the aim of providing an insight into the developments and findings in this exciting field. In the first paper, the authors investigate different techniques to improve the spectral efficiency of systems based on the DVB-S 2 standard, whenever the transmitted signal bandwidth cannot be increased because it has already been optimized to the maximum value allowed by transponder filters. The second paper deals with the design of packet-level forward error correction (FEC) coding technique and pre-distortion adaptive optics technology for a digital transmission scheme to be employed in optical feeder links in a geostationary satellite communication system. Performances are evaluated in both up and downlink. The third paper proposes a new approach for blind feedforward and feedback recovery of the symbol timing, which needs just one or two samples per symbol. The method is characterized by a second filter operated in parallel to the receiver matched filter and allows avoiding the typical jitter floor irrespective of the selected modulation scheme. The fourth paper deals with the issue of boosting the capacity of xDSL networks in the presence of geographical gaps by exploiting the downlink of multibeam satellites for the delivering of packed-based traffic. To cope with time-varying channel and interference, the paper proposes a novel link resource adaptation scheme. The fifth paper addresses the problem of modulation and coding scheme selection in the return link of a mobile satellite system and proposes to use an affine combination of both open loop and closed loop signal quality indicators to perform this selection. The combination weights are dynamically adapted according to the ACK/NAK exchange between both ends, without making any assumptions on the channel distribution Last but not least, the sixth paper analyses the performance of two Contact Graph Routing (CGR) enhancements, namely CGR-ETO and Overbooking Management. These two enhancements have been recently included in the official CGR version as part of the Interplanetary Overlay Network DTN implementation maintained by NASA. In closing, the guest editors would like to thank all individuals and organizations that made this issue possible, including the European Commission, the Association ‘Toscana Spazio’, Wiley Interscience, the ASMS/SPSC 2014 Technical and Scientific Committees, all anonymous reviewers and all authors. In particular, we are grateful to Prof. Barry Evans, the Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal on Satellite Communications and Networking, for kindly inviting us once more to conduct this editorial process, as already done for past events. Given the great success of the join event, we are finally pleased to announce that the next ASMS/SPSC Conference is in fact supposed to take place in Palma de Mallorca (Spain) from 5 to 7 September 2016.
