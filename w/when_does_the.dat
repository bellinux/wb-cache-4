2500|$|A final {{question}} of [...] {{on the possibility}} of an analogue of FÃ¡ry's theorem for linkless graphs appears not to have been answered: <b>when</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> existence of a linkless or flat embedding with curved or piecewise linear edges imply the existence of a linkless or flat embedding in which the edges are straight line segments? ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the concept}} of personhood entailed the soul, a metaphysical concept {{referring}} to a non-corporeal or extra-corporeal dimension of human being which is absent in other creatures. Today, the concepts of subjectivity and intersubjectivity, personhood, mind, and self have come to encompass a number of aspects of human being previously considered {{the domain of the}} [...] "soul". [...] Thus, while the historical question has been: <b>when</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> soul enter the body, in modern terms, the question could be put instead: at what point does the developing individual develop personhood or selfhood.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{interpretation}} of quantum physics that says a photon is either in its guise as a wave or in its guise as a particle, the question arises: <b>When</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> photon decide whether {{it is going to}} travel as a wave or as a particle? Suppose that a traditional double-slit experiment is prepared so that either of the slits can be blocked. If both slits are open and a series of photons are emitted by the laser then an interference pattern will quickly emerge on the detection screen. The interference pattern can only be explained as a consequence of wave phenomena, so experimenters can conclude that each photon [...] "decides" [...] to travel as a wave as soon as it is emitted. If only one slit is available then there will be no interference pattern, so experimenters may conclude that each photon [...] "decides" [...] to travel as a particle as soon as it is emitted.|$|E
