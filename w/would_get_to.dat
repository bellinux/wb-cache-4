5|$|At WrestleMania XIX, Stratus ended her {{feud with}} Victoria by {{defeating}} her and Jazz to capture her fourth Women's Championship, only {{to lose the}} title to Jazz at the following pay-per-view, Backlash. The Raw after Backlash, Eric Bischoff ordered a No Disqualification match between him and Stratus. If Stratus won, she would get a championship rematch the next week; if Bischoff won, he <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> spend a night with her. Bischoff {{would go on to}} win the match, though the stipulation was nulified when Linda McMahon confronted him after the match.|$|E

After Leeds posted a fourth-place finish in the league, his {{teammates}} {{then went on to}} lose to Charlton Athletic in the play-off final – Swan missed the game due to his knee injury – this would be as close as Swan <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> reaching the top-flight of English football.|$|E
5|$|Many equestrians were publicans, {{in charge}} of tax-collecting in Asia (Asia in Roman times meant {{essentially}} the Roman-dominated area that is now referred to as western Anatolia), and of contracting for construction projects. The equestrian class <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> control a court that tried senators for misconduct in provincial administration. In effect, the equestrians replaced senators already serving at the court. Thus, Gaius became an opponent of senatorial influence. Other reforms implemented by Gaius included fixing prices on grain for the urban population and granting improvements in citizenship for Latins and others outside the city of Rome.|$|E

The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score was the closest they <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> a lead as Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Bedell {{put forward}} an {{agricultural}} plan {{that he thought}} would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then {{be used to determine}} what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was twofold: production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more (which would benefit farmers, who {{were in the middle of}} an acute debt crisis.) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> decide the severity of the controls.|$|E

5|$|The 1894 Championship {{began with}} a loss for the {{defending}} champions against England, during {{a game in which}} Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so it <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the backs quickly and allow them to run at the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all his might into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of Jim Hannan, who was trying to follow his captain's wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by Dai Fitzgerald in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by Jack Elliott from Cardiff RFC.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Mexico, Stock signed with Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), AAA's rival promotion. She began working regularly for CMLL as Dark Angel in the promotion's newly-rebuilt women's division, while also working for various independent promotions. On March 25, 2005, she defeated Princesa Sujei to win Federación Internacional de Lucha Libre Women's Championship. On September 9, Stock {{was one of}} two winners, along with Marcela, of a Torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine who <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> battle for the vacant CMLL World Women's Championship. However, on September 16, at CMLL's 72nd Anniversary Show, Marcela defeated Stock to win the title. Afterwards, Stock entered a feud with La Amapola, which concluded on April 14, 2006, when Stock put her hair on the line against Amapola's mask. Stock ended up winning the match and forcing Amapola to unmask herself.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his meeting}} with al-Muttaqi, al-Ikhshid {{returned}} to Egypt, leaving the field open for the ambitious Sayf al-Dawla. The Ikhshidid forces left behind in Syria were relatively weak, and the Hamdanid leader, having gained {{the support of the}} Banu Kilab, had little difficulty in capturing Aleppo on 29 October 944. He then began extending his control over the provinces of northern Syria down to Hims. Al-Ikhshid sent an army under the eunuchs Abu al-Misk Kafur and Fatik against the Hamdanid, but it was defeated near Hama and retreated back to Egypt, abandoning Damascus and Palestine to the Hamdanids. Al-Ikhshid was then forced to once again campaign in person in April 945, {{but at the same time}} he sent envoys proposing to Sayf al-Dawla an agreement along the lines of the one with Ibn Ra'iq: the Hamdanid prince <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> keep northern Syria, while al-Ikhshid would pay him an annual tribute for the possession of Palestine and Damascus. Sayf al-Dawla refused and reportedly even boasted that he would conquer Egypt itself, but al-Ikhshid held the upper hand: his agents managed to bribe several Hamdanid leaders, and he won over the citizens of Damascus, who barred their gates before the Hamdanid and opened them for al-Ikhshid. The two armies met near Qinnasrin in May, where the Hamdanids were defeated. Sayf al-Dawla fled to Raqqa, leaving his capital Aleppo to be captured by al-Ikhshid.|$|E

5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we <b>would</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E
