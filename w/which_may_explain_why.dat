5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic number being even. Lead has a magic number of protons (82), for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.|$|E
5|$|Stress has {{effects on}} the immune system, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> some cases {{directly}} correlate with stress. It is often stated that ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested}} that oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods of stress, and hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> its provenance remains unknown.|$|E

50|$|Nutritional {{epidemiology}} is {{a relatively}} new field of medical research that studies the relationship between nutrition and health.

5|$|In the aye-aye, {{which has}} {{replaced}} the toothcomb by evolving continually growing, rodent-like incisors, the hook-shaped tip of the sublingua fits precisely within {{the gap between the}} two lower incisors and keeps the area clean. Tarsiers lack a toothcomb, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> their sublingua lacks the serrations typically found on the sublingua of lemuriforms. Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of serrated edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has serrated edges at the front that match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E
5|$|Because of its poor flying ability, {{large size}} and {{possible}} island tameness, the broad-billed parrot was easy prey for sailors who visited Mauritius, and their nests {{would have been}} extremely vulnerable to predation by introduced crab-eating macaques and rats. Various sources indicate the bird was aggressive, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> it held out so long against introduced animals after all. The bird {{is believed to have}} become extinct by the 1680s, when the palms it may have sustained itself on were harvested on a large scale. Unlike other parrot species, which were often taken as pets by sailors, there are no records of broad-billed parrots being transported from Mauritius either live or dead, perhaps because of the stigma associated with ravens. The birds would not in any case have survived such a journey if they refused to eat anything but seeds.|$|E
5|$|One of {{his major}} prophetic sources was evidently the Mirabilis Liber of 1522, which {{contained}} a range of prophecies by Pseudo-Methodius, the Tiburtine Sibyl, Joachim of Fiore, Savonarola and others (his Preface contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus {{was one of the}} first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they are credited to him. It should be noted that modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used bibliomancy for this—randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page it happened to fall open at.|$|E
50|$|The right {{amygdala}} is also {{linked with}} taking action {{as well as}} being linked to negative emotions, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> help <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> males tend to respond to emotionally stressful stimuli physically.

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{assembled}} {{largely in the}} 1970s, a period when Marker {{was part of a}} political commune and preferred to downplay his authorial signature, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> partly <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> he is represented in the film by Sandor Krasna's letters. The title [...] "Conception and editing: Chris Marker," [...] {{at the end of the}} credits, is the only indication that Sans Soleil is his film.|$|R
5|$|Charig and Milner {{presented}} a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during fossilisation) of the B. walkeri holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, {{and the fact}} that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of fossilisation and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment). The disarticulation of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the three}} kings, Máel Coluim {{appears to have}} been the most powerful, and it is {{possible}} that Mac Bethad and Echmarcach were underkings or clientkings of his. Mac Bethad appears to have become Mormaer of Moray in 1032 after the slaying of his kinsman, Gilla Comgáin mac Máel Brigti, Mormaer of Moray (died 1032). Previous rulers of Moray are sometimes styled as kings by various Irish annals, a fact <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Mac Bethad was called a king when he met Knútr. Although the apparent date of Mac Bethad's accession to the mormaership (1032) appears to contradict the date of the kings' meeting (1031), this discrepancy can be accounted for in two ways. One possibility is that Gilla Comgáin was actually slain in 1031 but only recorded in 1032. Another possibility is that Knútr merely returned from Rome in 1031, but actually met with the kings in 1032, after Gilla Comgáin's demise and Mac Bethad's accession. There is further evidence that could cast doubt on the date of the meeting. Although the aforesaid versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date Knútr's pilgrimage to 1031, he is otherwise known to have visited Rome in 1027. Whilst it is possible he undertook two pilgrimages during his career, {{it is more likely that}} the chronicle has misdated his journey. In fact, it possible that the chronicle failed to account for the time in which Knútr spent on the continent and Scandinavia after having visited Rome.|$|E
5|$|Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal {{columns of}} rising hot air {{to enable them}} to soar. These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great {{difficulty}} crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.|$|E
40|$|In Europe, most frozen {{white fish}} fillets operate in an {{undifferentiated}} market. Although differences in quality and processing affect pricing, {{there is also}} competition across species and exporting countries. Analysis showed that prices for tilapia from the leading exporter China were not affected by any competitor, but pricing for tilapia from other countries was highly related. Low Pangasius prices affected the market share of tilapia, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> help <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Pangasius is a most popular fish in the European Union...|$|R
50|$|Almost as soon {{as human}} vessels with {{operating}} Fields jumped into the Mote system, Motie engineers {{were aware of the}} Field's existence and quickly built Fields of their own. Motie engineers are incredibly effective at building and using tools, but they display a rather marked lack of original thinking and creativity, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> partly <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they never developed the Field in the first place. Given that an expanding Field is obviously far more effective at protecting a ship than a static one, all Motie Field generators were designed to expand as necessary.|$|R
50|$|This stork's {{habitat is}} {{primarily}} dense lowland riverine forest and peat swamp forest, at altitudes not exceeding 240 metres above sea level. The density of large trees in this habitat exceeding 10 cm at breast height {{is estimated to}} range from 500 to 800 trees per hectare, and typical tree genera include Dipterocarpus and Ficus. The forest undergrowth predominantly comprises rattans, bamboos, shrubs and climbers. Because these habitats are largely inaccessible to humans, collecting data on this species is logistically difficult, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> partly <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> {{little is known about}} this stork's natural history.|$|R

25|$|In the 7th century Northumbria {{was ruled}} by the pagan leader Oswald who, upon {{converting}} to Christianity, established, {{with the help of}} St Aidan, a monastery at Lindisfarne. Under his leadership a monastery was built at Old Melrose. One of the monks from this new religious centre was Boisil, and it was he who gave his name to the village and parish of Saint Boswells. It is suggested that some of the dwellings were on the flat haugh below Benrig - a good site but prone to flooding, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> they eventually moved to the higher ground at Lessudden (the place of Aidan) and the present site of St Boswells.|$|E

30|$|In {{a recent}} review of {{superior}} face identification studies, Noyes et al. (2017) proposed {{that a number of}} factors may combine to produce high levels of performance. These included natural ability, motivation, formal training, and professional experience. Indeed, recent work has shown that motivation (Moore & Johnston, 2013), training (Towler, White, & Kemp, 2017), and experience collaborating with high performers (Dowsett & Burton, 2015) can all improve accuracy in face identification task. Thus, it appears likely that these factors also contribute to professional accuracy, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> also <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> we observed comparatively modest gains of selection in the current study relative to tests of professional specialist teams.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} a number of {{compositions}} which {{do not conform to}} this stylistic pattern. They include three motets which employ the old-fashioned cantus firmus technique as well as the most famous item in the 1589 collection, Ne irascaris Domine. the second part of which is closely modelled on Philip van Wilder's popular Aspice Domine. A few motets, especially in the 1591 set, abandon traditional motet style and resort to vivid word painting which reflects the growing popularity of the madrigal (Haec dies, 1591). A famous passage from Thomas Morley's A Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke (1597) supports the view that the madrigal had superseded the motet in the favour of Catholic patrons, a fact <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> Byrd composed few non-liturgical motets after 1591.|$|E
25|$|The breed is {{strikingly similar}} to the English Mastiff, with which it shares a common {{ancestor}} known as the Alpine Mastiff. The modern St. Bernard breed is radically different than the original dogs kept at the St. Bernard hospice, most notably by being much larger in size and build. Since the late 1800s, the St. Bernard breed has been ever refined and improved using many different large Molosser breeds, including the Newfoundland, Great Pyrenees, Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, Bernese Mountain Dog, Great Dane, English Mastiff, and possibly the Tibetan Mastiff and Caucasian Ovcharka. Other breeds such as the Rottweiler, Boxer, and English Bulldog {{may have contributed to}} the St. Bernard's bloodline as well. It is suspected that many of these large breeds were used to redevelop each other to combat the threat of their extinction after World War II, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> all of them played a part in the creation of the St. Bernard as seen today.|$|E
25|$|William Mycroft (1 February 1841 – 19 June 1894) was an English cricketer {{who played}} first class cricket for Derbyshire and MCC between 1873 and 1886. He was a left-arm fast bowler {{with a great}} deal of spin and a {{dangerous}} yorker that was often believed to be unfair – <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> he was not considered for the earliest Test Matches despite being in his prime. He took 863 first class wickets at an average of 12.09 with 87 five-wicket innings and 28 ten-wicket matches in his career. His first ten-wicket match in 1875 against Nottinghamshire became the first of six in only nine games that season. He holds the Derbyshire record for most wickets in a single match, with figures of 17–103 against Hampshire at the Antelope Ground, Southampton in July 1876. This is one of only two times a player has taken seventeen wickets in a match and finished on the losing side – the other, by Walter Mead in 1895 was also against Hampshire. Mycroft had no pretensions as a right-handed tail end batsman: he scored only 791 first class runs at an average of 5.34 and prior to Alf Hall and Father Marriott remained the last significant cricketer who took more wickets than he scored runs.|$|E

However, his coach {{instructed}} him to play defence, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> help <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> he led the NHL in blocked shots in 2006-07 by a large margin. He is consistently amongst the top shot blockers and hitters. Volchenkov was voted as the fifth-best defensive defenceman by The Hockey News in June 2007. With the defensive help of Volchenkov and Phillips, the Senators made their 2007 Stanley Cup run to the finals, where they were defeated by the Anaheim Ducks in another five-game series.
