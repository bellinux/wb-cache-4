Local officials of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency (BMG), however, did not ban the vessel from sailing, and the official at the Kumai port issued a sailing permit based on the weather report.

It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> my neck out on the chopping block because now I would have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but at the same time I thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E

[...] By the time Freak Out! was edited and shaped into an album, Wilson had spent $25–35,000 of MGM's money. In Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that [...] "Wilson <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album. MGM felt that they had spent too much money on the album." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{en route}} to Samoa {{on the night of}} 2324 March 1899, Cormoran ran aground on the Whirlwind Reef, north of the western tip of New Pomerania. She was stuck on the reef amidships, so that her bow <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> about a meter out of the water. The crew {{attempted}} to lighten the ship by removing coal and ammunition, but she remained grounded on the reef. The ship's commander, Korvettenkapitän Hugo Emsmann, sent the steam pinnace and a dinghy with two officers and eleven men, towing a load of coal, to Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen, some [...] away. There, they met the steamer , which arrived on the scene on 29 March. Emsmann then decided to remove all unnecessary coal and ammunitionsome of which was put ashore and the rest simply thrown overboardto cut away the fore and mainmast, and to move the stern guns forward. These measures allowed the ship to float free from the reef. The crew then re-stowed the supplies that had been sent ashore before returning to Friedrich-Wilhelmshafen. There, her seaworthiness was inspected, and additional supplies were brought aboard. Cormoran then steamed to Sydney for dry-docking; a full inspection of her hull revealed that it had only been slightly damaged. Repairs lasted until early June.|$|E

He later remarked that [...] "I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work, for fear that I would just be given other work by their rivals. So everybody was offering me things." [...] It was an era when comic books were increasing in popularity in Britain, and according to Lance Parkin, [...] "the British comics scene was cohering as never before, and {{it was clear that the}} audience <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> with the title as they grew up.

2500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "Not Guilty" [...] in 1968 {{following}} the Beatles' Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. As the Beatle {{who had been}} most interested in attending teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's course, Harrison felt responsible for his bandmates' experience there. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney had each left the ashram early and returned to England, while Harrison and John Lennon stayed on, only to then depart hurriedly after hearing of alleged impropriety between the Maharishi and a female student. In an interview with Billboard editor Timothy White in 1999, Harrison referred to [...] "the grief I was catching" [...] from Lennon and McCartney post-India, and explained the message behind the song: [...] "I said I wasn't guilty of {{getting in the way}} of their career. I said I wasn't guilty of leading them astray in our going to Rishikesh to see the Maharishi. I <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> up for myself…" ...|$|E
2500|$|The race {{started at}} 15:30 local time. The {{conditions}} on the grid {{at the beginning of}} the race were dry and sunny with an air temperature of [...] and a track temperature at [...] When the race began from its standing start, it was Auer who moved into the lead going into Lisboa corner for the second day running from the slow-starting Rosenqvist who fell to fourth with Blomqvist and Ocon moving ahead of him. Blomqvist and Ocon were alongside Auer on both sides of the track, but Auer braked too late and left a gap for cars behind to pass through by running wide onto the run-off area. Blomqvist took avoiding action when he steered to take the corner but made contact with Ocon's wheel in the process at the turn's apex. Ocon's front suspension was damaged and he understeered into the San Francisco Bend barriers taking Blomqvist with him. Ocon's car <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> out across the circuit, but drivers such as Rosenqvist, Auer and Cassidy passed by safely. This triggered a multi-car pileup that started when King braked too late and Kanamaru was launched airborne over his teammate's car. Kanamaru landed on top of the wall with his right-rear wheel inches from clouting Ocon's helmet.|$|E

2500|$|At about 11:15am, Bravo {{entered a}} house in the town to take cover. The Iraqi family who lived in the house were told to lie on the floor; not because they were hostages, but for their own safety in case anyone outside had seen Bravo {{entering}} and tried to shoot into the house. Alpha were pinned down by effective fire [...] from the police station on the northern side of town. The Officer in Charge (OIC) of Alpha, Lieutenant Ross Kennedy, was being targeted by a sniper, and so {{the decision was made to}} hold until the QRF (Quick Reaction Force) arrived from Abu Naji to help. Bravo deployed mini-flares on the roof of the house that they were occupying to alert the Chinook to their presence. Unfortunately, because of damage and casualties, the Chinook had to return to Abu Naji. The setting off of the mini-flares did alert the Iraqi gunmen to Bravo's position, who now found themselves having to shoot out of the house at the armed Iraqis clambering over the walls to get to them. At 11:30am, Bravo split into two sections so that one section stayed behind and provided covering fire for the other section. They manouevred and fired in turn until both sections met up again to form just one. Bravo managed to get clear just as the mob had encircled the house they were in. Bravo maintained a northwards direction along an irrigation ditch, which slowed them down because of the mud that <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> to their boots. They could hear the engines of the Scimitars and the Land Rovers of the QRF. Sgt Robertson launched mini-flares to alert the QRF to his position, but he was unable to know if the QRF had seen them. Therefore, Private Freddy Ellis was tasked to cover [...] of dead ground between them and the QRF wagons. Ellis stripped off his webbing and ran, zigzagging all the way to the QRF column to relate the position of Bravo Company.|$|E
2500|$|Flying Hawk {{was born}} about full moon of March 1854, {{a few miles}} south of Rapid Creek, Lakota Territory. His father was Oglala Lakota Chief Black Fox, also known as Chief Black Fox I, Cut Forehead and Great Kicking Bear. Chief Black Fox (c. 1800-c. 1880) had two wives who were sisters who bore him {{thirteen}} children. Iron Cedar Woman, the youngest sister, was Flying Hawk's mother and had five children. The other wife had eight children. [...] "In a fight with the Crows, Chief Black Fox was shot below the right eye with an arrow. [...] It was so deep {{that it could not}} be pulled out, but had to be pushed through the ear." [...] Chief Black Fox died when he was eighty years old. [...] "When my father was dead a long time we went to see how he was on the scaffold where we put him. [...] His bones were all that was left. [...] The arrow-point <b>was</b> <b>sticking</b> {{in the back of his}} skull. [...] It was rusted. [...] We took it home with us." [...] Kicking Bear (c. 1846-c. 1880) was Flying Hawk's full and older brother. Kicking Bear was a noted warrior and leader of the Ghost Dance. [...] Black Fox II ("Young Black Fox") was Flying Hawk's half-brother and named for his father. Crazy Horse was the first cousin of Flying Hawk. [...] "Though nine years the senior of Flying Hawk, Crazy Horse and Flying Hawk were constant close friends and associates, and they were cousins." [...] Rattling Blanket Woman, the mother of Crazy Horse, was the sister of Iron Cedar Woman, the mother of Flying Hawk and Kicking Bear. [...] They would have addressed Crazy Horse as ciye, or 'elder brother'. Sitting Bull was Flying Hawk's uncle, Chief Flying Hawk’s mother Iron Cedar Woman and Sitting Bull’s wife being sisters. [...] At the age of 26, Flying Hawk married two sisters, [...] Goes Out Looking and White Day. Goes Out Looking bore him one son, Felix Flying Hawk. White Day had no child.|$|E
