50|$|Furthermore, the Selangor State Government's <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> (under Pakatan Rakyat) on the Sagong Tasi case in April 2009 signalled an {{increased}} recognition of Orang Asli land rights. Following this case, the Selangor State government was {{aided by the}} Sabah-based organisation PACOS Trust which trained the Orang Asli in Selangor to map their territories using the Global Positioning System (GPS). The State Government also pledged to gazette some 25 Orang Asli villages by August 2010 in an ongoing effort to protect Orang Asli territories. For example, Kampung Jambu in Selangor was originally slated for commercial development, but in February 2011, the Selangor State government decided to return the premium to the developer and gazette it as a protected Orang Asli reserve.|$|E
50|$|The {{position}} {{advanced by}} the Selangor State government (before the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal)</b> in the Sagong Tasi case {{was that the}} Orang Asli are generally considered mere tenants of their unregistered ancestral land, since under the 1965 National Land Code, all land belongs to the respective states, or in case of federal territories, the federal government. However, the High Court dismissed the Selangor State Government’s argument and confirmed the existence of Orang Asli native title under common law, even without private ownership registration in the land registry - a decision that was upheld by other courts during subsequent appeals by the defendants. This is an important legal precedent for future land rights cases concerning the Orang Asli in Malaysia. Although this court ruling failed to prevent the government acquisition of the Kampong Bukit Tampoi land, and the eventual settlement of RM6.5 million was below market value (according to Dr Colin Nicholas, coordinator of the Center for Orang Asli Concerns (COAC) in Malaysia), Orang Asli civil society actors {{hope that it will}} help to protect other Orang Asli land in future.|$|E

50|$|On 23 August 2009, ex-CIA analyst, Robert Baer, {{claimed that}} the CIA had known {{throughout}} that the bombing of Flight 103 had been orchestrated by Iran, and that a secret dossier was to be presented as evidence in Megrahi's final appeal which was to prove this, suggesting that the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appeal</b> to allow release on compassionate grounds was encouraged to prevent this information from being presented in court.|$|R

The memorandum was criticized by both Israel and Argentina's Jewish community, as Iran was long suspected {{of being involved in}} the attack. The memorandum had been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court during Kirchner's administration, and along with the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appeal,</b> the memorandum was voided by Macri's administration.

25|$|The {{development}} of the Spring District, and its use of public funding to build roads and a light rail station to serve it, was opposed by Downtown Bellevue real estate developer Kemper Freeman. Freeman funded the campaigns {{of a set of}} Bellevue City Council candidates in the 2011 elections, while Spring District developer Wright Runstad funded a set of opposing candidates. Freeman had filed an appeal with the city prior to the election, arguing that the environmental impact of additional automobile traffic generated by the Spring District would require further study than the current master plan. It was settled in 2012, with the city requiring a future study of traffic impacts in exchange for the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appeal.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} reviews {{recent developments}} in the administrative justice system; in particular, it considers three key themes: improving initial decisions; administrative review; {{and the future of}} tribunals. In each of these areas, some aspects of administrative justice work well, but austerity has presented acute challenges in ensuring the fair and just treatment of people through restrictions upon legal aid; the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> some <b>appeal</b> rights; and the expansion of administrative review. Consequently, the system is moving away from a ‘legal’ model of administrative justice to the ‘bureaucratic rationality’ model, which focuses upon accurate and efficient implementation. However, the reality does not correspond with the goals of the model. Rather than accurate and efficient implementation of policy, what we find is poor decision-making made by junior officials with insufficient quality controls. Digitising tribunals may have potential benefits in terms of increased accessibility. Nonetheless, the prospects for administrative justice are weak...|$|R

In particular, the Boards have held that the [...] "withdrawal of a European patent application can only be retracted as long as the public has not been officially informed about the withdrawal". In other words, in the interests of legal certainty, it is generally too late to request retraction of a notice <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> after the withdrawal has been registered and notified to the public in the European Patent Bulletin, since in that case the retraction <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> would adversely affect the public interest or the interests of third parties.|$|R

In April 2004 an Immigration Judge in Boston issued an order granting Akhmadov asylum in the United States; that ruling became effective in August 2004 following the U.S. Government's abrupt <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> its notice <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> <b>of</b> the Immigration Judge's decision.|$|R
50|$|Removing Toca as counsel Titlow {{appealed to}} the Michigan Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeals.</b> She argued that Toca had advised her to {{withdraw}} her plea without doing any research on her case therefore providing her with ineffective counsel.

5000|$|O'Rell {{had always}} {{considered}} himself a mediator between England, the United States and France and believed {{the press to}} be the most efficient tool to achieve a political rapprochement. Throughout his career, however, he was wary of journalists who thrived on nationalism and xenophobia, particularly in the context of Anglo-French relations. He acknowledged the great power of the daily press, compared to circulation of his books: [...] "The Press alone … has the power to destroy international prejudices. The writer, the lecturer, is read or heard by a few hundreds a day, the journalist is read by millions." [...] (Advocate of Peace, March 1898, 58).At the height of the Zola-Dreyfus affair, O'Rell made a public statement {{in a letter to the}} London Chronicle, which was reprinted in several American newspapers, urging foreigners to abstain from showing sympathy for the Jewish officer. This was not because O'Rell considered Dreyfus to be guilty; as he wrote in the letter, he personally believed the French officer to be innocent. Rather, he argued that an overseas campaign in favour of Dreyfus would only result in anti-Semitism increasing in France. A notice in the Times shows that his advice was taken seriously. David Christie Murray, one of the leaders of the pro-Dreyfus movement in England, mentioned O'Rell's letter and announced a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> an <b>appeal</b> to French journalists, because it might offend the French amour-propre. At the height of the Fashoda crisis a short time later, the London Times published a letter by O'Rell to the editor in which he presented himself as a member of the Committee of the Entente Cordiale for the Better Relations between England and France and argued that despite the current tensions, the relations between Britain and France had a solid basis of respect and goodwill. He also commented on the Boer War, but his critical comments about Boers' brave resistance to the English Goliath led to a marked decline of his popularity in Britain.|$|R
