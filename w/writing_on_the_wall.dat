5|$|In 1933, H.D. {{traveled}} to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud. She {{had an interest}} in Freud's theories as far back as 1909, when she read some of his works in the original German. H.D. was referred by Bryher's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war, an idea that H.D. found intolerable. The Great War (World War I) had left her feeling shattered. She had lost her brother in action, while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences, and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington: she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn. <b>Writing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> her memoir about this psychoanalysis, was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944; in 1956 it was republished with Advent, a journal of the analysis, under the title Tribute to Freud.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} novel, The <b>Writing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> an anti-war {{novel and}} roman à clef {{based on a}} possible John McCain presidency in 2008, warns against war with Iran by portraying a worst-case scenario of its outcomes.

The story shows them eventually leading to a ground invasion and a military draft in the United States. The book ends with the Iran war escalating into a conflagration seizing the entire Middle East and ultimately culminates in a nuclear showdown between Pakistan and India after an Islamist coup in Pakistan.|$|E

The Spectator was dismissive, comparing the novel unfavourably to The Invasion of 1910 ("many useful hints are given as to practical lessons... the general plot entirely destroys any value it might otherwise possess") and noting that the suggestions were [...] "highly typical", {{but that it was}} counterproductive to simply malign the Army and encourage the country to adopt German military policies.
