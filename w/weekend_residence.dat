50|$|There was saw milling in the {{locality}} in the 1890s and {{the wide}} beach was a popular venue, particularly as buggies could be driven onto the beach. It became a holiday destination, and <b>weekend</b> <b>residences</b> were built, notably on Round Hill where the Town of 1770 was officially named in 1936. However, the town was regarded as somewhat remote, {{and it was not}} until the road into the town was completely sealed in the mid 1990s that development really took off.|$|R

5000|$|The Brown {{family was}} unable to survive the {{economic}} downturn. In July 1988, Lillian Brown filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy citing US $11.7 million in debt and assets of US $21.5 million. The Times Herald-Record, a local newspaper in the Tri-State area, gave an optimistic report in early September 1988 heralding the Catskills’ best summer in years. Catskills Resort Association president Paul Carlucci predicted that Brown’s would rebound from its difficulties. Brown’s Hotel president Bruce Turiansky was equally encouraged. The hotel that had blossomed into a 570-room mountain retreat closed for the season on November 11, 1988. It would never reopen.Eighteen days later, all buildings on the property were sold at a foreclosure auction with 160 acres of land for US $5.3 million [...] to Brooklyn-based Vista Environments Inc. President Rubin Margules, a real-estate developer, had planned to continue operating the facility as a hotel. The sale was used to pay a US $5.2 million mortgage debt.Renovation finally began in 1997. The resort was converted into the 396-unit Grandview Palace condominiums. The swimming pools, tennis courts, miniature golf course, chapel, synagogue, and the bar were all preserved. Even the Jerry Lewis theater remained intact, but the former hotel’s restaurant remained closed. The property attracted a diverse crowd of inhabitants, some seeking <b>weekend</b> <b>residences</b> and others moving in for good as the renovation seemed promising with nearly 75% of the units being sold {{in the first few}} years.|$|R

50|$|Dating to {{the reign}} of the Staufer {{emperors}} Friedrich Barbarossa or Friedrich II (12th-13th century), of the Palatium (Kaiserpfalz) on the Main’s banks, also known as the Rotes Schloss ("Red Palace""), only the Main façade is still standing with double and triple arcades with arches of red sandstone. With a ground area of 47 m × 14 m, this rectangular Kaiserpfalz was among the smaller ones. Perhaps the Emperor used it as a <b>weekend</b> <b>residence</b> or a small hunting lodge. The first restoration work took place in 1938; restoration work on the south and west walls has been ongoing since 1996.|$|E
50|$|Given {{that there}} is no {{constitutional}} office of Deputy Prime Minister, with the position being recreated on a case by case basis, the person who holds the post has no official residence.

50|$|De Rham {{owned and}} {{operated}} the farm as a summer and <b>weekend</b> <b>residence</b> {{until his death in}} 1874, renaming it Giez, after the town of his birth in Switzerland. He was responsible for three major renovations to the main house in the 19th century, which added the Greek Revival porch, the enlargement of the east wing and the addition of a west wing and the mansard roofs on the whole house. The orchard house was remodeled and expanded in 1929. The de Rham family continued to own the farm until 1949, when it was subdivided into the current four parcels, one of which the family kept.

Of the 26 people on board, 23 survived after the pilot, Captain Bill Pettet, {{managed to get the}} passenger door open in time. The three deceased victims were unaccompanied infant children. The cause of the crash was fuel starvation after the wrong fuel line cutover switch was activated. When the problem was noticed an attempt to restart the engines failed as the aircraft hit macrocarpa trees and plunged onto the road below Dr. Stevenson-Wright's <b>weekend</b> <b>residence,</b> where miraculously the fuselage rested {{right in the middle of}} the road without further collision. The doctor and his visitors ran to the passengers' aid, and fortunately most of them were able to walk out relatively unharmed. The doctor and visitors had been enjoying a coffee break while looking out to the sea when they saw the plane heading straight for their house, which it would have hit if not for the tree. As a result of the death of the three children, NAC was ordered to have a stewardess on board all DC-3s with a ban on unaccompanied children under 12 years of age until then.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{day after}} the {{personal}} instruction session, the student begins a series of three 90 to 120 minute [...] "teaching sessions", held on three consecutive days, called [...] "three days of checking". Their stated purpose is to [...] "verify the correctness of the practice" [...] and to receive further instruction. The first day's checking meeting takes place in a group on the day following personal instruction, and gives information about correct practice based on each student's own experience. The second day of checking uses the same group format, and gives more details of the mechanics of the practice and potential results of the practice, based on student experiences. The third day of checking focuses on subjective growth and the potential development of higher stages of human consciousness, and outlines the follow-up programs available as part of the course. New meditators later return for private follow-up sessions to confirm that they are practicing the technique properly, a process called [...] "personal checking". The preferred schedule for follow up classes is 30 minutes, once per week for one month, and once per month thereafter. The purpose of the follow-up, or [...] "checking sessions", is to verify the practice, give an opportunity for one-on-one contact with a TM teacher, and to address any problems or questions. Course graduates may access a lifetime follow-up program which includes consultations, [...] "refresher courses", advanced lectures and group meditations. Advanced courses include <b>weekend</b> <b>Residence</b> Courses and the TM-Sidhi program.|$|E
40|$|The {{catchment}} of the Groot Marico River in the North West Province has {{for centuries}} been a highly desirable {{tract of land}} for human settlement purposes. In many respects the river and its valuable water supplies, situated in a semi-arid region of South Africa, is an artefact that has been changed by human hands {{in the course of}} long history. Recently local residents were once again made aware of how important the river is for their existence when a mine prospecting company started exploring the catchment region for potential deposits of nickel. Geologists had been surveying the region for probably as long as three years before the local residents were told that the search was on for mineral deposits in a region that had become a desirable place of <b>weekend</b> <b>residence</b> for professional people from Gauteng. Civil society was mobilised to take strong stand against the 'evil' agents of mining activities. Once local residents organised themselves into activist groups, they sought support from previously disadvantaged people resident in the local informal settlement at Groot Marico, to support their case. For a number of understandable reasons the locals were not of the same intent as local property owners. They saw job prospects in the area. Only once the activists started explaining to the people and brought them into the ambit of negotiations, did the previously disadvantaged people realise what they stood to lose. This paper deals with aspects of an ethnic class divide in the local community. It is argued that in order to get all the residents to appreciate the river as an important artefact that needs to be protected and used responsibly, {{there is a need to}} develop a space of social learning where different forms of communication strategies are used to make people aware of the importance of the river and that it needs to be nurtured and protected for posterity.

In 1965, the college implemented a Degree Completion Program for women who {{had dropped out of}} college before receiving their degrees. Beginning with the academic year 1970-71, the college offered students a self-directed course of study, within a group known as [...] "Mandala."
