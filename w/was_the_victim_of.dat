At the hospital, where Amir is being treated by Pardi, Tati learns the truth behind Amir's absence. On his deathbed, Amir asks Pardi {{to take care of}} Tati; the two are later married.|$|E
5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn to vote for a political party at multiple locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E

5|$|Boisselier {{became the}} {{scientific}} director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël {{that sought to}} clone humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier was interviewed by Le Monde about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position with Air Liquide after the company learned of this. Air Liquide stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, {{and that she was}} strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air Liquide, arguing that she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> religious discrimination. Her suit was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized for not having led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.|$|E
5|$|In 1862, Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaievich was {{appointed}} viceroy of Russian Poland {{by his brother}} and moved to Warsaw {{with his wife and}} children. The stay in Poland proved difficult for the Grand Duke, who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a nationalist assassination attempt the day after his arrival in the Polish capital. Although Constantine embarked on a program of liberalization and re-instated Polish as an official language, Polish nationalists agitating for reform were not appeased. Finally, an uprising in January 1863 and the radicalization of the separatists pushed the Tsar to recall his brother in August. Olga's difficult experiences in Poland marked her profoundly.|$|E

5|$|In February 1828, Martin Harris {{arrived to}} assist Smith by transcribing his dictation. Harris {{also took a}} sample of the {{characters}} to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. Harris said Anthon initially authenticated the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that he had tried to convince Harris that he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900 Edward <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> an {{attempted}} assassination, when fifteen-year-old Jean-Baptiste Sipido shot at him in protest over the Boer War. Sipido, though obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage. The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the Congo, worsened the already poor relations between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, {{as well as his}} use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.|$|E

5|$|After John Firth's death, Arthur {{moved with}} his family to London. According to Richardson they lived in the area around Liverpool Street in the east of the city, {{although}} Knight gives a different account, stating that they lived first in Bedford Park and then Kensington, both in the west of the city. From January 1911 to December 1912 Fortune studied at Studley Agricultural College in Warwickshire, a horticultural institution which advertised itself as being ideal for girls with psychological problems. Her proficiency with poultry led her to become a staff member at the college from January to April 1913. She later claimed that at the college she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> mental manipulation from her employer, the college warden Lillias Hamilton, resulting in a mental breakdown that made her abandon the institution and return to her parental home.|$|E
5|$|Donald Maynard Brashear (born January 7, 1972) is a Canadian-American former {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} player {{who played for}} five organizations in the National Hockey League (NHL), {{in which he was}} {{considered one of the most}} effective enforcers. His aggressive style led to being among the League leaders in penalty minutes for six seasons, while currently ranking 15th all-time in NHL history, and resulted in multiple suspensions as well. He remains the Vancouver Canucks all-time single season leader in penalty minutes, which he set in the 1997–98 season. He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> one most publicized incidents of on-ice violence in NHL history, when he was slashed in the head by Marty McSorley, during the 1999–2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{propensity}} of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned {{the theory that}} Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication, while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only {{for the sake of}} completeness. The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, {{as the head of the}} alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence, and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas, Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer. There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.|$|E

5|$|The TSR-2 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> ever-rising {{costs and}} inter-service squabbling over Britain's future defence needs, {{which led to}} the {{controversial}} decision to scrap the programme in 1965. With the election of a new government, the TSR-2 was cancelled due to rising costs, in favour of purchasing an adapted version of the General Dynamics F-111, a decision that itself was later rescinded as costs and development times increased. The replacements included the Blackburn Buccaneer and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, both of which had previously been considered and rejected early in the TSR-2 procurement process. Eventually, the smaller swing-wing Panavia Tornado was developed and adopted by a European consortium to fulfil broadly similar requirements to the TSR-2.|$|E
5|$|Waleed al-Shehri was {{reported}} to have been found alive by a BBC News article on September 23, 2001, and other news reports {{in the aftermath of the}} September 11 attacks. Reports said that the Shehri brothers were the sons of a Saudi diplomat stationed in New Delhi, Ahmed al-Shehri. The diplomat's son was trained as a pilot at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and was working as a pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines. At the time of the attacks, he was in Morocco for a training program. There were also reports that Wail al-Shehri was a trained pilot. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Saudi officials suggested that Wail and Waleed al-Shehri were victims of identity theft, but the diplomat's son <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> mistaken identity.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> <b>of</b> a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force his way past a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
