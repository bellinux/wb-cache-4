Leading up to the potential championship decider against Manchester United on 16 April 2003, Wenger was adamant his team were mentally ready to retain the title: [...] "We {{want to be a}} team who makes history. That's what's really driving us on. We are not worrying about United too much. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> concentrating on expressing our togetherness, our mental strength and our qualities.
