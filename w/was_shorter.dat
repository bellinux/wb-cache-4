5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused {{to each other and}} to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E

Sivaji 3D is the first Indian film to be launched with the new Dolby Atmos platform. The trailer of 3D version was launched on 13 August 2012 at Prasad Labs along with Rajinikanth. The 3D version released on 12 December 2012, coinciding with Rajinikanth's birthday. The runtime of 3D version <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than original, cut to two hours and thirty-five minutes.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Johnson {{began to}} write a weekly series, The Idler, which ran from 15 April 1758 to 5 April 1760, {{as a way to}} avoid {{finishing}} his Shakespeare.

The screenplay and dialogue were written by Javar Seetharaman, who also played a prominent role as an investigative officer in the film. Cinematography was handled by S. Maruti Rao, and the background score was composed by AVM Productions' own music troupe, Saraswathy Stores Orchestra. The film <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than most contemporaneous Tamil films. It was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E
5|$|The {{post-production}} {{schedule for}} Up in the Air <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than Jason Reitman's previous two films. The editing team had only 16 to 17 weeks post-schedule, whereas an editing deadline is usually from 22 to 26 weeks. Reitman {{was involved in}} post-production while shooting. The film was shot entirely on location and Glauberman stayed in Los Angeles to cut. She would send him scenes every day or every other day as she finished them, and he would view them. He flew home every weekend {{to work with her}} for a few hours on Saturday or Sunday in order to stay on schedule.|$|E

5|$|Even before {{planning}} of the Hell–Sunnan Line was completed, there arose disagreement {{as to the}} route onwards. In a plan from the 1870s, there was consensus that the towns of Stjørdal, Levanger, Steinkjer and Namsos should receive a line, {{but there was a}} disagreement as to the route. The Beitstad Line would run from Steinkjer via Beitstad and Namdalseid to Namsos and from there to Grong, while the Snåsa Line would run from Sunnan via Snåsa to Grong, with a branch from Grong to Namsos. The Beitstad Line would run through the most densely populated areas, while the Snåsa Line <b>was</b> <b>shorter.</b> Parliament decided on the Snåsa Line in 1900. The railway was extended from Sunnan to Snåsa Station on 30 October 1926, with the section from Hell to Sunnan becoming classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway was completed to Bodø on 7 June 1962.|$|E
5|$|Fifty {{people are}} interviewed in the film, {{including}} investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project, and Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions {{says that all}} of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to Richard Young, its cinematographer and co-director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close. The version of the film that was aired by CNN International as part of the CNN Freedom Project <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released.|$|E
5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling <b>was</b> <b>shorter,</b> less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E

30|$|The {{amplitude}} of the PI is larger when the rise time <b>is</b> <b>shorter.</b> This <b>is</b> {{consistent with the}} relationship between the rise time and {{amplitude of}} the DL, and the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL because the effective length of the PI, i.e., the dynamo region, <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> than that of the DL. Also, the rise time of the PI <b>is</b> <b>shorter</b> at an enhanced speed than at an enhanced density. It is therefore suggested that a high-speed solar wind is needed to create a rapid magnetic variation.|$|R

5|$|In 2007, {{analysis}} of an audio tape {{recording of the}} shooting made by freelance reporter Stanislaw Pruszynski appeared to indicate, according to forensic expert Philip Van Praag, that thirteen shots were fired, even though Sirhan's gun held only eight rounds. Van Praag states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than physically possible. The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul Pegas of Audio Engineering Associates in Pasadena, California, forensic audio and ballistics expert Eddy B. Brixen in Copenhagen, Denmark, and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Some other acoustic experts, however, have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the audio tape.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E

5|$|In Major League Baseball, the 300win club is {{the group}} of {{pitchers}} who have won 300 or more games. Twenty-four pitchers have reached this milestone. The New York Gothams/Giants/San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: those players are Tim Keefe, Mickey Welch, Christy Mathewson, and Randy Johnson. Early {{in the history of}} professional baseball, many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter; the distance pitchers threw to home plate <b>was</b> <b>shorter</b> than today, and pitchers were able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball. The first player to win 300games was Pud Galvin in 1888. Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of their career wins in the 19thcentury: Galvin, Cy Young, Kid Nichols, Tim Keefe, John Clarkson, Charley Radbourn, and Mickey Welch. Four more pitchers joined the club {{in the first quarter of}} the 20thcentury: Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Eddie Plank, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. Young is the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered unbreakable. If a modern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 seasons, he would still be 11 games short of Young's mark.|$|E
