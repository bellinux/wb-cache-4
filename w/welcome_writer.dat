40|$|In 1921 {{a circle}} of writers formed a dinner club in London to <b>welcome</b> foreign <b>writers</b> visiting from abroad. Punningly dubbed the "P. E. N.

Over the years, PEN survived a series of onslaughts that undermined this humanistic idea: fascist infiltration, yet another World War, revelations of Holocaust, the shock of atomic warfare, and CIA meddling. By 1970 PEN had become global, transforming from a British club into an organization devoted to protecting freedom of expression and facilitating communication worldwide. In doing so, its members strove to create an institutionalized form of the Republic of Letters, a federation that aimed to model cultural civility to the wider world. PEN survived challenges to its existence because it molded itself to evolving contexts while insisting on the stability of its core values. PEN justified its existence by arguing that its definition of literary values were universal. Yet PEN's ideals needed to be protected and promoted by an institution precisely because they were neither universally accepted nor secure. PEN promoted a distinctly liberal, humanistic, and aesthetically middlebrow definition of literature and its social role. By claiming its values were universal, giving them institutional expression, and attracting the attention of funders and competing governments during the Cold War, PEN helped make liberal humanism seem synonymous with internationalism...|$|R
40|$|To {{present this}} new Division to {{reference}} librarians and others interested in reference services {{is an opportunity}} that this <b>writer</b> <b>welcomes</b> with the greatest enthusiasm. The Reference Services Division is the fulfillment of a dream {{which has been in}} the minds of many reference librarians for a very long time. It is hard to imagine any group of people more zealous in their interest in the library profession and what it can mean to the general public, particularly as applied to the reference function, or a group more talented; yet, until the new Division was formed, they had no over-all meeting place of minds, where they could pool their ideas, discuss mutual problems, and make genuine contributions in the field. Since the founding of the American Library Association in 1876, a period of eighty-one years, reference librarians have more or less gone their several ways, making wonderful contributions, to be sure, as individuals, through publications, professional papers and articles, editing and compiling reference tools, administering units of reference service, and above all, that day-byday aid to the library's clientele, which can never be adequately assessed or measured.

40|$|The {{history of}} Orkney {{literature}} {{is the first}} full survey of {{the literature of the}} Orkney Islands. It examines fiction, non-fiction and poetry that is uncomplicatedly Orcadian, as well as that which has been written about Orkney by authors from outside the islands. Necessarily, the work begins with the great Icelandic chronicle Orkneyinga Saga. Literary aspects of the saga are examined, as well as its place within the wider sphere of saga writing. Most significantly, this study examines how the saga imposes itself on the work of subsequent writers. The book goes on to focua on the significance of Orkney and Orkney history in the work of a number of key nineteenth- and twentieth-century figures, including Sir Walter Scott, Edwin Muir, Eric Linklater, Robert Rendall and George Mackay Brown. The Victorian folklorist and short story writer Walter Traill Dennison is re-evaluated: The History of Orkney Literature demonstrates his central significance to the Orcadian tradition and argues for the relevance of his work to the wider Scottish canon. A fixation with Orkney history is common to all the writers considered herein. This preoccupation necessitates a detailed consideration of the core historiography of J. Storer Clouston. Other non-fiction works which are significant in the creation of this distinctly Orcadian literary identity include Samuel Laing's translation of Heimskringla; the polemical writings of David Balfour; and the historical and folklore studies of Ernest Walker Marwick. The study <b>welcomes</b> many <b>writers</b> into the fold, seeking to map and define a distinctly Orcadian tradition. This tradition can be considered a cousin of Scottish Literature. Although the writing of Orkney is a significant component of Scottish Literature at various historical stages, it nevertheless follows a divergent course. Both the eighteenth century Vernacular Revival and the twentieth century Literary Renaissance facilitate literary work in the islands which nevertheless remains distinctly independent in character. Indigenous Orcadian writers consider themselves to be Orcadians first and Scots or Britons second. Regardless of what they view as their national or political identity, their sense of insular cultural belonging is uniformly and pervasively Orcadian. What emerges is a robust, distinctive and very tight-knit minor literature. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Does content, and layout and design differ from newspaper to newspaper?Can a random selection of ten Indiana {{daily newspapers}} find the answers to the questions above? These questions and others will hopefully be answerd by this study. An analysis of ten Indiana daily newspapers is an extremely important undertaking. At no other time in recent history has the press been under such watchful scrutiny. And what part of the daily newspaper is mare important that the editorial page? It is here that decisions vital to the existence of the newspaper are made every single day the paper is in operation. The editorial page is an arm of the paper that can make or break an individual, a corporation, a candidate for public office, a politician in office, or even a community social. The powers of the editorial page are immense, if used in the proper way. How are Indiana's daily newspapers utilizing this great power that they posses? Are they putting it to good use, or are they squandering it on some worthless scheme?It will be an exhaustive task to dig into the editorial "closets" of ten Indiana daily newspapers to exactly determine what type of editorial pages the papers are publishing for public consumption. However, this <b>writer</b> <b>welcomes</b> the task with high hopes that {{the results of the study}} will answer many questions that he has concerning the editorial page.
