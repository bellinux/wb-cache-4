40|$|AbstractTriple-negative breast cancers have a poor {{prognosis}} {{and are not}} amenable to endocrine- or HER 2 -targeted therapies. The prevailing view is that targeting the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signal transduction pathway will not be beneficial for triple-negative breast cancers because their growth is not IGF-responsive. The present study investigates the importance of IGFs in the proliferation and survival of triple-negative breast cancer cells. Estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER 2, type I IGF, and insulin receptors were measured by <b>Western</b> <b>transfer</b> analysis. The effects of IGF- 1 on proliferation were assessed by DNA quantitation and on cell survival by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. The effect of IGF- 1 on phosphorylation of the IGF receptors, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase, was measured by <b>Western</b> <b>transfer</b> analysis. Seven cell lines were identified as models of triple-negative breast cancer and shown to express IGF receptors at levels similar to those present in estrogen-responsive cell lines known to respond to IGFs. IGF- 1 increased the proliferation and cell survival of all triple-negative cell lines. Proliferation was attenuated after reduction of type I IGF receptor expression. Cells that express higher levels of receptor were more sensitive to subnanomolar IGF- 1 concentrations, but {{the magnitude of the}} effects was not correlated simply with the absolute amount or phosphorylation of the IGF receptors, Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results show that IGFs stimulate cell proliferation and promote cell survival in triple-negative breast cancer cells and warrant investigation of the IGF signal transduction pathway as a therapeutic target for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer...|$|E

40|$|Type 4 fimbriae {{are found}} {{in a range of}} {{pathogenic}} bacteria, including Bacteroides nodosus, Moraxella bovis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The structural subunits of these fimbriae all contain a highly conserved hydrophobic amino-terminal sequence preceding a variable hydrophilic carboxy-terminal region. We show here that recombinant P. aeruginosa cells containing the B. nodosus fimbrial subunit gene under the control of a strong promoter (pL, from bacteriophage lambda) produced large amounts of fimbriae that were structurally and antigenically indistinguishable from those produced by B. nodosus. This was demonstrated by fimbrial isolation and purification, electrophoretic and <b>Western</b> <b>transfer</b> analyses, and immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. These results suggest that type 4 fimbriated bacteria use a common mechanism for fimbrial assembly and that the structural subunits are interchangeable, thereby providing a basis for the development of multivalent vaccines...|$|E

The cultured erythrocytes were treated with trypsin to prevent reinvasion (6), and the released merozoites that accumulated extracellularly were harvested by differential centrifugation. The total biosynthetically labeled proteins of schizonts and merozoites, and those immunoprecipitated by human immune serum were analyzed and compared. The surface antigens of free merozoites, labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, were also described.

40|$|AbstractMVM NS 2 is {{essential}} for viral DNA amplification, but its mechanism of action is unknown. A classification scheme for autonomous parvovirus-associated replication (APAR) center development, based on NS 1 distribution, was used to characterize abnormal APAR body maturation in NS 2 null mutant infections, and their organization examined for defects in host protein recruitment. Since acquisition of known replication factors appeared normal, we looked for differences in invoked DNA damage responses. We observed widespread association of H 2 AX/MDC 1 damage response foci with viral replication centers, and sequestration and complex hyperphosphorylation of RPA 32, which occurred in wildtype and mutant infections. Quantifying these responses by <b>western</b> <b>transfer</b> indicated that both wildtype and NS 2 mutant MVM elicited ATM activation, while phosphorylation of ATR, already basally activated in asynchronous A 9 cells, was downregulated. We conclude that MVM infection invokes multiple damage responses that influence the APAR environment, but that NS 2 does not modify the recruitment of cellular proteins...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the presence of}} a proton gradient-dependent efflux of fluoroquinolone drugs in Serratia marcescens. Methods: Thirteen clinical isolates of S. marcescens were screened for resistance to four fluoro-quinolones: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid by determining MICs. The presence of a proton gradient-dependent efflux mechanism was assessed using ethidium bromide accumulation assays.

40|$|Capacitative calcium {{entry and}} calcium wave {{propagation}} were studied in keratinocytes cultured from control persons and patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis. The cells were stimulated mechanically {{in the presence}} of inhibitors of gap-junctional or ATP-mediated communication to determine which pathways are operative in Ca 2 + signaling between these cells. Keratinocytes cultured from patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis (NF 1) had a tendency to form cultures with markedly altered calcium-related signaling characteristics. Specifically, the resting Ca 2 + levels, intracellular Ca 2 + stores, capacitative calcium influx, and gap-junctional signal transduction were defective in NF 1 keratinocytes. <b>Western</b> <b>transfer</b> analysis revealed apparently equal connexin 43 protein levels in normal control and in NF 1 keratinocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence, however, demonstrated that connexin 43 was relatively evenly distributed in NF 1 cells and did not form typical gap-junctional plaques between keratinocytes.

Study of this molecule has been hindered by a relative lack of specific immunological reagents. This study reports the generation and characterisation of specific polyclonal antibodies. The purification of gH and the generation of polyclonal serum is described. Antigenic determinants reactive with polyclonal antibodies were determined using synthetic peptides derived from the primary amino acid sequence of the molecule and a similar aproach was applied using available monoclonal antibodies. A series of 833 hexapeptides, with five residue overlap, were synthesised representing all potential continuous epitopes comprised of six residues or less. Peptides, displaying structural homology with epitopes of the native molecule were identified by screening for antibody binding.

40|$|ABSTRACT The body wall muscle {{cells of}} Caenorhabitis elegans contain an obliquely {{striated}} myofibrillar lattice that {{is associated with}} the cell membrane through two structures: an M-line analogue in the A-band and a Z-disc analogue, or dense-body, in the I-band. By using a fraction enriched in these structures as an immunogen for hybridoma production, we prepared monoclonal antibodies that identify four components of the I-band as determined by immunofluorescence and <b>Western</b> <b>transfer</b> analysis. A major constituent of the dense-body is a 107, 000 -D polypeptide that shares determinants with vertebrate a-actinin. A second densebody constituent is a more basic and antigenically distinct 107, 000 -D polypeptide that is localized to a narrow domain of the dense-body at or subjacent to the plasma membrane. This basic dense-body polypeptide is also found at certain cell boundaries where thin filaments in half-bands terminate at membrane-associated structures termed attachment plaques. A third, unidentified antigen is also found closely apposed to the cell membrane in regions of not only the dense-body and attachment plaque, but also the M-line analogue. Finally, a fourth high molecular weight antigen, composed of two polypeptides of ~ 400, 000 -D, is localized to the I-band regions surrounding the dense-body. The attachment of the densebod...|$|E

Class III Î²-tubulin has been widely used as a neuron-specific marker, but it has been detected also in association with breast and pancreatic cancers. In this study, we describe a novel finding of Class III Î²-tubulin in a subpopulation of cells in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
