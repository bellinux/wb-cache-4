5|$|The ballet {{was staged}} by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911 at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, with Tamara Karsavina and Nijinsky as Giselle and Albrecht. Anna Pavlova danced Giselle {{with her own}} company in 1913. Alicia Markova danced the role with the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1934, and Margot Fonteyn took the role in 1937 when Markova left the company. The English loved Giselle. In 1942, for example, three {{different}} companies <b>were</b> <b>dancing</b> the ballet in London.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, Mona Best decided to open a club in her cellar, and offered the Les Stewart Quartet a {{residency}} if they would help convert the cellar. Harrison and fellow Quartet guitarist Ken Brown, however, missed a show, causing Les Stewart to fire the two and drop the residency. This caused distress to Best, but Harrison offered a solution: he recruited Lennon and McCartney to play, and they returned to calling themselves the Quarrymen. After helping Best finish converting the cellar, the new four guitarist line-up of the Quarrymen (Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Brown) opened the Casbah Coffee Club on 29 August 1959. The opening night performance was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air conditioning and people <b>were</b> <b>dancing,</b> the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. The Quarrymen were afforded the use of Brown's three input amplifier (which, along with McCartney's Elpico, meant that all four guitarists were electric), and sang through one microphone connected to the club's small PA system.|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen {{played a}} series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each, {{starting}} on 29 August to October 1959, featuring Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Brown, but without a drummer, and only one microphone connected to the club's small PA system. The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people <b>were</b> <b>dancing,</b> the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. After {{the success of the}} first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group £3 a night. Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened onto the street, which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee. As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his 40-Watt amplifier.|$|E

Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids <b>were</b> <b>dancing</b> together and holding hands.|$|E

Harris also recalled watching pop group, the Spice Girls, who she believed <b>were</b> <b>dancing</b> moves of a standard which preschoolers could replicate.

500|$|The novel {{opens in}} 1954 {{in the small}} logging {{settlement}} of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed {{the life of a}} young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, <b>were</b> <b>dancing</b> on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. [...] "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it on the kitchen floor of Carl's house, knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo first {{revealed}} WarioWare: Smooth Moves for the Wii at the 2006 E3 convention. The {{game was}} co-developed by Intelligent Systems and the Software Planning Development department of Nintendo. Development {{on the game}} began in late 2005 {{with a team of}} 20 people, directed by Goro Abe and produced by Yoshio Sakamoto. Abe first {{came up with the idea}} for the game when the Wii Remote was revealed to him. Since the developers believed that holding the controller in only one way limited the game's entertainment value, they decided to introduce new positions and motions to the game for the Remote to be held. The software used to register the Remote's movements was written from scratch because of the unique movements required for the game. Similar to previous games in the WarioWare series, the game's subtitle, [...] "Smooth Moves", was used to represent the basic movement that players perform in the game. The developers wanted players to move as if they <b>were</b> <b>dancing</b> when playing the game, so they decided that Smooth Moves was the best phrase to use to describe the game's actions. Because of its party genre, the developers made the game's multiplayer mode its [...] "best point".|$|E

The video premiered on BET's 106 & Park on March 31, 2010 [...] The video {{comprises}} a helicopter chase and militaristic desert and jungle scenes. The music video begins with Birdman giving Minaj a stack of money to carry to an unknown area in the desert. As the song begins Minaj appears in a blonde wig with a pink background which than cuts to Minaj riding in a pink Lamborghini with Amber Rose driving as a potential new take on Thelma & Louise in a helicopter chase. Shots of desert creatures and Minaj in her Barbie wig are shown during the first hook. As the helicopter chase progresses, Minaj is seen singing to the camera in military gear and is later shown walking in an attacking line with her Harajuku Army, which are all dressed in the same gear with pink wigs under helmets. During the chorus of the song, a shirtless Garrett is shown singing into the camera while clips of the helicopter chase are interpreted. During the second verse Minaj is in the jungle as a ninja with a long pink braid running down her back as she crawls {{on the ground and}} walks around the jungle. Some clips of two men (from Ringmasters) dancing with double-jointed shoulders are also shown. During the climax of the song Minaj is still in the jungle this time with a green wig <b>were</b> <b>dancing</b> in the mud and comes out of the water, crawling through the forest. The video ends as clips of the entire video are shown and closes with Minaj and Rose escaping in the pink Lamborghini.|$|E
