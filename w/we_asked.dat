Abu Iyad (Arafat's deputy) and Mahmoud Abbas (later President of the Palestinian Authority), flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage-taking harmed the movement. Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said: [...] "Why are you attacking Abu Nidal? The operation was ours! <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> him to mount it for us." [...] Abbas was furious and left the meeting with the other PLO delegates. From that point on, Seale writes, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as {{under the control of}} the Iraqi government.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness of this woman in this horrible, horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her.

And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.'

500|$|Their {{subsequent}} recording for {{the album}} was influenced by their experiences in Trinidad and Caribbean musical styles, including the rhythms and festive atmosphere of the local music scene. They enlisted Trinidadian dancehall artist General Grant, a regular at Caribbean Sound Basin, to perform a ragga rap on [...] "What Goes Around Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Dance Hall", songs they developed in Trinidad. Raphael Wiggins recalled this in an interview for the Toronto Star: [...] " [...] was just hanging around the studio. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> him to come freestyle on [...] After that, he just kept hanging around. Then we had the song 'Dance Hall' playing one night and he started again, so we just turned on the mic." [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend" [...] was also recorded there. According to D'wayne, they recorded [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] in the studio at 3a.m., and Raphael was [...] "quite snookered" [...] on an alcoholic beverage when delivering his vocals.

500|$|John Slattery, who {{was later}} cast as Roger Sterling, {{originally}} auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, [...] "I really did prepare {{the thing and}} went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here’s the deal. We have a guy. The reason <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> {{you to come in}} and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you’d come in a read for Roger because there wasn’t that much Roger in the script.'" [...] During production of [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," [...] Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. [...] "I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we’re not jerking you around here.

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on construction paper. This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's favorite part of the episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him around all the time, (so <b>we</b> <b>asked)</b> how do we not make him a character each week".|$|E

500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we {{had to figure out}} how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E
