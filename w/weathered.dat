5000|$|According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), severe <b>weather</b> can be {{categorized}} into two groups: general severe <b>weather</b> and localized severe <b>weather.</b> Nor'easters, European wind storms, and the phenomena that accompany them form over wide geographic areas.

These forms of <b>weather</b> are classified as localized severe <b>weather.</b> The term severe <b>weather</b> is technically not the same phenomenon as extreme <b>weather.</b> Extreme <b>weather</b> describes unusual <b>weather</b> events {{that are at the}} extremes of the historical distribution for a given area.|$|R

40|$|<b>Weather</b> related {{disruptions}} {{account for}} {{seventy percent of}} the delays in the National Airspace System (NAS). A key component in the <b>weather</b> plan of the Next Generation of Air Transportation System (NextGen) is to assimilate observed <b>weather</b> information and probabilistic forecasts into the decision process of flight crews and air traffic controllers. In this research we explore supporting flight crew <b>weather</b> decision making through the development of a flight deck predicted <b>weather</b> display system that utilizes <b>weather</b> predictions generated by ground-based radar. This system integrates and presents this <b>weather</b> information, together with in-flight trajectory modification tools, within a cockpit display of traffic information (CDTI) prototype. that the CDTI features 2 D and perspective 3 D visualization models of <b>weather.</b> The <b>weather</b> forecast products that we implemented were the Corridor Integrated <b>Weather</b> System (CIWS) and the Convective <b>Weather</b> Avoidance Model (CWAM), both developed by MIT Lincoln Lab. We evaluated the use of CIWS and CWAM for flight deck <b>weather</b> avoidance in two part-task experiments. Experiment 1 compared pilots' en route <b>weather</b> avoidance performance in four <b>weather</b> information conditions that differed in the type and amount of predicted forecast (CIWS current <b>weather</b> only, CIWS current and historical <b>weather,</b> CIWS current and forecast <b>weather,</b> CIWS current and forecast <b>weather</b> and CWAM predictions). Experiment 2 compared the use of perspective 3 D and 21 / 2 D presentations of <b>weather</b> for flight deck <b>weather</b> avoidance.

30|$|According to the <b>weather</b> and outage data of {{transmission}} lines, appropriate <b>weather</b> factors are determined in the method and denoted as w 1, w 2, …, wp respectively. Due to the {{temporal and spatial}} variations of <b>weather</b> factors, temporal and spatial splits are needed. Distribution of <b>weather</b> factors is uneven over a vast area, such as a province. A transmission line might be in multiple areas with a different meteorological environment. A spatial split is the division of <b>weather</b> areas. Assuming that the meteorological environment in each <b>weather</b> area is consistent, the divided <b>weather</b> areas are denoted as WA 1, WA 2, …,WAq respectively. According to {{the data from the}} meteorological department, the <b>weather</b> area is divided the same as the administrative area. There are several lines in one <b>weather</b> area, which are in the same meteorological environment. All transmission lines with the same voltage level are taken as the basic samples for the estimation of one <b>weather</b> area. Temporal treatment of <b>weather</b> data contains both split and aggregation. First <b>weather</b> and outage data are split by a step of one day and the <b>weather</b> data is classified into several intensities. Based on the intensity classification, the <b>weather</b> and outage data with the same intensity are aggregated. Both temporal and spatial aggregation result in data smoothing and provides more meaningful patterns and it converts the time distribution of the <b>weather</b> factors to the intensity distribution. There are several <b>weather</b> factors in one area and the combination of different <b>weather</b> factors is defined as a <b>weather</b> block. As the <b>weather</b> factor w 1 and w 2 in a <b>weather</b> area is at level k and m respectively, the <b>weather</b> block is defined as WBkm.
