40|$|Our {{daily life}} aspects {{are full of}} signs {{including}} icon, index, and symbol. The aims of this research are to describe the meanings and the reasons of <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> icons used on foods and b everages cartons. The theories used are the Saussure’s theories and The Barthes’ theories. Saussure emphasized his theory in analyzing the sign using the signifier and signified criteria. Then, Barthes emphasized his theory on the myth that derived from th e denotative and connotative levels. The type {{of this research is}} qualitative interpretative type. In collecting the data, the writer applied the documentation and observation methods. The several steps are done to analyze the data. In analyzing the meaning, the steps are: analyzing the signifier, analyzing the signified, and analyzing the text. In analyzing the reasons, the steps are: analyzing the denotation level, analyzing the connotation level, and analyzing the myth. This research shows the variety of the meanings and the reasons of <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> icons used on the foods and beverages icons. The meanings are: 1) referring to the cartons, such as: <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> to avoid <b>the</b> cartons from the wet or moisture and <b>the</b> heat, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> to avoid <b>the</b> cartons from the strong smell, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> that <b>the</b> cartons should be bought carefully, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> that <b>the</b> carton are not allowed to tread and give the load amount, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> not to put the carton facing backwards, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> of <b>the</b> maximum amount piles, <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> to avoid <b>the</b> cartons from the direct contact to the floor, and <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> that <b>the</b> cartons should be put in the right order; 2) referring to <b>the</b> users: <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> of <b>the</b> maximum amount piles; 3) referring to both cartons and users: <b>the</b> <b>warning</b> of <b>the</b> maximum amount piles.

5|$|Although Dean's {{landfall}} in Mexico {{occurred in}} a relatively uninhabited area and the storm's well-predicted track gave ample <b>warning,</b> <b>the</b> storm inflicted extreme damage.

Quintana Roo Governor Félix González Canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of Chetumal was completed within three weeks, it took more than six months to fix all of the region's more rural roads. Unable to handle the hurricane's aftermath, the state government appealed to federal authorities for aid. Together, they established a housing-repair fund which contributed to the reconstruction of over 37,000residences.|$|E
