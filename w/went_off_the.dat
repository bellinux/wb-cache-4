5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air.|$|E

5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and traction control.|$|E
5|$|As per his contract, Webber {{started the}} year in Melbourne with Red Bull Racing. He {{recorded}} top-six lap times {{in each of the}} three practice sessions, and was on his way to the top ten in the qualifying session when the front right brake disc in his car failed going into turn 6 during Q2, sending him spinning off into the sand trap ending his qualifying session, and resulting in 15th position on the grid. Although starting well, he momentarily <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track at turn 1 to avoid being involved in contact that had already erupted. Webber made several positions by turn 3 but an incident involving himself, Kazuki Nakajima and Anthony Davidson when he was slightly contacted by Davidson whilst trying to avoid the struggle between the other two drivers, ended his race.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E
5|$|During {{the yellow}} flag period, some cars elected to make pit stops, and Ricardo González spun the No. 43 RGR Sport Ligier. The No. 7 Audi rejoined the race after repairs to its floor which was damaged {{when the car}} drove over a kerb and its ducts {{required}} cleaning after rubber picked up from the circuit caused the vehicle to overheat. The entry rejoined in 15th place overall. The race restarted 12 minutes later with Davidson leading the field, ahead of the No. 8 Audi. Kobayashi immediately got ahead of Dumas to move into third position. Manor's No. 31 entry driven by Richard Bradley overtook the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorsports car of Chris Cumming at Eau Rouge for fourth place in LMP2. Nathanaël Berthon's No. 26 vehicle had its left-rear tyre punctured following contact with Abu Dhabi Proton's No. 88 Porsche at La Source, while Andy Priaulx in the No. 67 Ford passed Dempsey-Proton's No. 77 car for fifth place in LMGTE Pro. Berthon <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track at the Bus Stop chicane while attempting to drive into the pit lane.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28 {{although}} he <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{track in the}} process. Herbert made his only pit stop on the same lap {{although he}} stalled and rejoined in twelfth place. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve tried to retake fourth position from Häkkinen on the 30th lap but overshot the manoeuvre. Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second pit stop on lap 38. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on the following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his pit stop on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta pulled off the race track with an blown engine two laps later.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too fast for the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E
5|$|King {{made contact}} with Canamasas in the fourth corner while driving {{alongside}} him during lap four. Both <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> circuit, with Canamasas sustaining front wing damage, which stopped his car. He became the race's second (and final) retirement. King continued but rejoined in 12th. Leal's pace had slowed due to tyre degradation. This allowed Haryanto to close up to Leal who passed him by deploying DRS {{to move into the}} lead around the inside on lap eight in turn one. Evans attempted to move in front of Leal but ran wide, allowing the latter to retake the second position. Visoiu took advantage and overtook Leal for second place. Evans again drove aggressively but Leal was defensive and his front wing endplate glanced Evans' front-left tyre at the turn eight hairpin. Evans drove to the pit lane for replacement tyres. Leal remained on the track, but was overtaken by Visoiu for second at the first corner on lap 10. Rossi moved ahead of Leal for sixth place, while King recovered to run in ninth position.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, {{occurred}} in Kuwait and Spain. The Kuwaiti show, Iftah Ya Simsim, which ran until 1990, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Arab world. It used Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it <b>went</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, including the use of MSA. Barrio Sésamo, made in Spain, featured a snail character who was able to hide a thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. Valentin Fuster, a native Spaniard who worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.|$|E
