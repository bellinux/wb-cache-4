5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme <b>were</b> <b>smart</b> and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, {{largely due to the}} nature of analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as they were unable to avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people <b>were</b> <b>smart</b> enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
500|$|While the {{original}} level geometry was kept, the levels received new textures, characters and weapons were recreated, and skyboxes were rebuilt. Lobb explained that [...] "things {{are large and}} blocky because that's what [...] looks like", meaning that the sharper textures and higher resolution simply make the game look clearer. He also observed that, as character and weapon models were remodeled from their original low hundreds polygon count to polygons in the thousands, {{he was worried about}} them looking awkward in the low-poly geometry level design. According to him, [...] "it's one of the areas that I give a lot of credit to the developer on. It just looks right. They <b>were</b> <b>smart</b> about the way they up-resed the models so they still feel like they're kind of retro, but they're clean." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Mandarino, coach Greasy Neale {{reportedly}} {{told him to}} play tackle after Vic Sears was injured. Neale stated that [...] "If you <b>are</b> <b>smart</b> enough to <b>be</b> a doctor, you <b>are</b> <b>smart</b> enough to learn two sets of plays". The following week, both of Eagles' centers, Bap Manzini and Vic Lindskog, were injured, so Greasy came back and told Mandarino that he [...] "should <b>be</b> <b>smart</b> enough to learn three sets of plays".|$|R
500|$|At this time, {{the priests}} who {{were part of}} St. Peter were doing the best they could to keep the faith alive in their congregation. The priests <b>were</b> <b>smart</b> men who had {{attended}} school in Italy prior to their immigration, but most were unable to speak fluent English. At a time when immigrants were desperately trying to fit into the American life and be as American as possible, going to a church where the congregation was Italian was not the most desirable choice. [...] Therefore, many Catholic Italians began going to churches and many others changed their religion altogether. Many of these Italians were becoming Protestant. [...] The priests were poorly paid and most lived on about twenty-five cents per day. They had no permanent housing: many slept in the church itself, and preferred the altar floor {{because it was the only}} place in the church that had carpeting. It was also common for the priests to say Mass several churches on the same day. These circuits trips were sometimes as much as twenty-five miles away.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Josh Modell said [...] "Medicinal Fried Chicken" [...] {{served as}} a good social satire without {{becoming}} too preachy. Modell particularly enjoyed that the other South Park men joined Randy in his absurd testicular cancer scheme, but said the Cartman subplot and drug film parody [...] "fell a little flat". Ramsley Isler of IGN said the giant testes jokes were [...] "brilliantly ludicrous", and did not grow old despite running throughout {{the length of the}} episode. Isler praised the ending scene with the scrotum skin coat, and said when Cartman snorted chicken skin like cocaine, [...] "the episode reached a whole new level [...] hilarity". TV Fanatic declared the episode [...] "perfection" [...] and felt it was an improvement over the previous fourteenth season episodes [...] "Sexual Healing" [...] and [...] "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs". The site also praised the episode for use gross-out comedy like enlarged testicles for social satire as well as humor. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine praised the humor, the references to Scarface and the social commentary, of which he said: [...] "The points <b>were</b> <b>smart,</b> articulate, and, in true South Park style, completely off the wall".|$|E
2500|$|Aleksey {{remained}} {{the only child}} in the family, four infants dying before his birth and five after. Years later he described himself (to which other people attested) as a weak, capricious and whimsical boy who for some reason loved to mock clergymen and suffered from sleepwalking at one time. Pisemsky remembered his father as a military service man {{in every sense of}} the word, strict and duty-bound, a man of honesty in terms of money, severe and strict. [...] "Some of our serfs were horrified by him, not all of them, though, only those who were foolish and lazy; those who <b>were</b> <b>smart</b> and industrious were favoured by him," [...] he remarked.|$|E

2500|$|The Gossip Girl book {{series was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} adapted into a film starring Lindsay Lohan with head Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. When the film project did not get off the ground, Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz took over the project to create a television series. As of October 2006, Schwartz {{was working on the}} pilot. He said: [...] "I was very skeptical. I don't want to do The O.C. NYC. But I thought the books <b>were</b> <b>smart.</b> The characters are worldly in a way that Orange County kids aren't." [...] The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on the first Gossip Girl book. In January 2007, the show was given the green light by The CW.|$|E

60|$|The area {{formed by}} the wall {{in that part of}} the Fleet in which Mr. Pickwick stood was just wide enough to make a good racket-court; one side being formed, of course, by the wall itself, and the other by that portion of the prison which looked (or rather would have looked, but for the wall) towards St. Paul's Cathedral. Sauntering or sitting about, in every {{possible}} attitude of listless idleness, were a great number of debtors, the major part of whom were waiting in prison until their day of 'going up' before the Insolvent Court should arrive; while others had been remanded for various terms, which they were idling away as they best could.

Pretty soon they were renting the orchards on long leases. And now, they are beginning to buy the land. It won't be long before they own the whole valley, and the last American will be gone.|$|E
