The studies were of a simulation character and were targeted at the detection of welding defects and imperfections thatshould be eliminated in a real structure. A model was designed and on this model the tests and examinations were carried out. The modelwas made under the same conditions as the conditions adopted for repair. It corresponded to the real object in shape and dimensions, and in the proposed technique of welding and welding parameters. The model was composed of five plates joined together with twelve beads. The destructive and non-destructive tests were carried out; the whole structure and the respective welds were also examined visually. Thedefects and imperfections in welds were detected by surface methods of inspection, penetration tests and magnetic particle flaw detection. The model of the welded joint was prepared by destructive methods, a technique that would never be permitted in the case of a realstructure. For the investigations it was necessary to cut out the specimens from the welded joint in direction transverse to the <b>weld</b> <b>run.</b> The specimens were subjected to metallographic examinations and hardness measurements. Additionally, the joint cross-section was examined by destructive testing methods to enable precise determination of the internal defects and imperfections. The surface methods were applied again, this time to determine the severity of welding defects. The analysis has proved that, fabricated under proper conditions and with parameters of the welding process duly observed, the welded joint has good properties and repairs of this type are possible in practice...|$|E

The thermal cycles used for simulation had peak temperatures of 1275 °C, 930 °C, 7650 C and 6500 C and corresponded to those experienced in the parent material during the submerged arc welding of 1. 5 in. thick plate using a nominal heat input of 54 kJ. in and a preheat temperature of 120 °C. Double cycling utilized specific combinations of these thermal cycles. Half {{the total number of}} simulated specimens received post cycle heat treatment at 650 °C. Charpy V-notch impact transition curves and tensile and hardness data have been obtained for each condition studied and structural examination has employed the carbon extraction replica technique in the electron microscope. The results indicate that the properties of the weld heat affected zone in HY- 80 steel are superior to those obtained for QT- 35 steel but inferior to those of the HY- 80 parent material. The tempering bead technique has been shown to have, at best, only a limited tempering effect on the grain coarsened region of an edge bead heat affected zone and can also cause an increase in the susceptibility of this region to brittle fracture. Post weld heat treatment at 6500 C is recommended, wherever possible, for HY- 80 weldments. The calculation of weld heat affected zone thermal cycles, which correlate well with the practical situation, has been made possible by the development of a series of computer programs. These programs include functions to account for the release of latent heat from the solidifying weld pool and the variation of thermal conductivity with temperature...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{to achieve}} deep penetration welding {{of stainless steel}} utilising a 15 kW laserline® diode laser has been studied. This was approached by first characterising the properties of melt run welds on stainless steel 304 L plates and then transferring the gained knowledge to perform the butt welds. The results from the melt run analysis {{indicated that there was}} an increase in penetration and weld width with heat input, i. e. with either increasing the laser power (9 – 15 kW) or decreasing the welding velocity (3 m/min– 1 m/min). Melt run penetrations up to 12 mm were achieved. The increased welding velocity was shown to reduce the solidification grain and subgrain size. Cracks along the weld centreline were observed at the higher heat inputs and sinking at the crowns at the lower. Good melt run welds were obtained at laser powers of 9 – 13 kW and a welding velocity of 1. 5 m/min. Butt welding of 10 mm thick plates was successfully achieved with full penetration {{along the length of the}} weld at a laser power of 12 kW and a welding velocity of 1. 5 m/min. The weld properties were comparable to the corresponding melt run welds using a similar parameter set of laser power and welding velocity. No detrimental subsurface defects were recorded with only the presence of a negligible amount of porosity. Oxidisation on the surface of the cap and sinking towards the end of the <b>weld</b> <b>run</b> was observed. It was demonstrated that high powered diode lasers are capable of deep penetration welding. Keyhole mode welding was achieved and the weld properties are comparable to that of other high energy density welding processes.

This then allows systematic examination {{of the influence of}} weld process parameters on the fatigue life of butt welds made from RQT 701 steel plates. This process is complex in the sense that a lot of pre-calculation and analysis is required in order to find out the residual strain gradients and microhardness gradients and also to figure out the fatigue data from nominal stress, hot spot stress and hot spot strain analysis. The hardness testing was done on all the 12 weld samples at a series of points either 1 mm or at mid-depth on planes perpendicular to the <b>weld</b> <b>run.</b> Welds were made from three types of filler metals as mentioned earlier, two heat input values (high heat input (HI) and low heat input (LI)) and two types of wall thicknesses. This project forms a part of an ongoing programme, whose main objective is to conrelate residual strain and hardness gradients, and their positions relative to the weld toe with the process parameters. The residual strain analysis on the weld samples were already done using neutron diffraction and the results were published in a paper earlier. The results obtained from that programme were used in this project to correlate the results obtained and for further analysis. The fatigue data for the weld samples were obtained from four point bending and the data obtained for the weld conditions were ranked using nominal applied stress, weld toe hot spot stress and weld toe hot spot strain. The hardness data and residual strain data were also ranked using depth of the weld as a parameter. Physically meaningful combinations of strain and hardness gradients, in terms of their individual effects on fatigue life, were then developed and were linked to the process parameters to assess their capability of predicting observed fatigue ranking order of welded joints at lives of 10 ^ cycles and 2 x 10 ^ cycles. Fractography of the fatigue samples were performed using optical microscopy to find out the locations and possible reasons of crack growth and propagation in the weld samples.

40|$|Due to {{functional}} requirement of a structural detail brackets {{with and without}} scallop are frequently used in bridges, decks, ships and offshore structure. Scallops are designed to serve as passage way for fluids, to reduce weld length and plate distortions. Moreover, scallops are used to avoid intersection {{of two or more}} welds for {{the fact that there is}} the presence of inventible inherent initial crack except for full penetrated weld and the formation of multi-axial stress state at the weld intersection. Welding all around the scallop corner increase the possibility of brittle fracture even for the case the bracket is not loaded by primary load. Avoiding of scallop will establish an initial crack in the corner if bracket is welded by fillet welds. If the two <b>weld</b> <b>run</b> pass had crossed, this would have given a 3 D residual stress situation. Therefore the presences and absence of scallop necessitates the 3 D FEA fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using effective notch stress approach (). FEMAP 10. 1 with NX NASTRAN was used for the 3 D FEA. The first and main objective of this research was to investigate and compare the fatigue resistance of brackets with and without scallop. The secondary goal was the fatigue design of scallops in case they cannot be avoided for some reason. The fatigue resistance for both types of brackets was determined based on approach using 1 mm fictitiously rounded radius based on IIW recommendation. Identical geometrical, boundary and loading conditions were used for the determination and comparison of fatigue resistance of both types of brackets using linear 3 D FEA. Moreover the size effect of bracket length was also studied using 2 D SHELL element FEA. In the case of brackets with scallop the flange plate weld toe at the corner of the scallop was found to exhibit the highest and made the flange plate weld toe critical for fatigue failure. Whereas weld root and weld toe at the weld intersections were the highly stressed location for brackets without scallop. Thus weld toe for brackets with scallop, and weld root and weld toe for brackets without scallop were found to be the critical area for fatigue failure. Employing identical parameters on both types of brackets, brackets without scallop had the highest except for full penetrated weld. Furthermore the fatigue resistance of brackets without scallop was highly affected by the lack of weld penetration length and it was found out that decreased as the weld penetration was increased. Despite the fact that the very presence of scallop reduces the stiffness and also same time induce stress concentration, based on the 3 D FEA it is worth concluding that using scallop provided better fatigue resistance when both types of brackets were fillet welded. However brackets without scallop had the highest fatigue resistance when full penetration weld was used. This thesis also showed that weld toe for brackets with scallop was the only highly stressed area unlike brackets without scallop in which both weld toe and weld root were the critical locations for fatigue failure when different types of boundary conditions were used. Weld throat thickness, plate thickness, scallop radius, lack of weld penetration length, boundary condition and weld quality affected the fatigue resistance of both types of brackets. And as a result, bracket design procedure, especially welding quality and post weld treatment techniques significantly affect the fatigue resistance of both type of brackets...|$|E

It is {{the aim of this}} paper to develop mathematical models to assess residual stresses in the heat-affected zone of dissimilar butt jointed welds of AISI 304 and AISI 1016. These models determine the effect of process parameters on maximum residual stress. Laser power, travel speed and focal position are the process input parameters. Plates of 3 mm thick of both materials were laser welded using a 1. 5 kW CW CO 2 Rofin laser as a welding source. Hole-drilling method was used to compute the maximum principal stress in and around the HAZ of both sides of the joint. The experiment was designed based on a three factors five levels full central composite design (CCD). Twenty different <b>welding</b> <b>runs</b> were performed in a random order, 6 of them were centre point replicates and the maximum residual stresses were calculated for each sample.

There is a continuing need to expand this network but this must be achieved within increasingly stringent cost targets and in accordance with changing environmental constraints. The pipeline industry in Australia has traditionally employed smaller diameter and thinner wall pipe materials than are common in many other parts of the world. In order to improve cost effectiveness there is also a trend to increase the yield strength of the material and to further reduce wall thickness. Girth welding of pipelines in the field represents a significant proportion of the installation cost and is currently performed by highly skilled manual welders using the shielded metal arc process (SMAW), cellulosic electrodes and a 2 ̆ 7 stovepipe 2 ̆ 7 technique. The use of lower wall thickness has the potential {{to reduce the number of}} <b>weld</b> <b>runs</b> and the overall cost. The higher yield strength low alloy pipe materials have been shown to have excellent weldability but as yield strength increases there may be an increased risk of weld metal cracking, particularly if overmatching welds are required. The current Australian field welding practice has been analysed and the local constraints identified. Based on this review a list of desirable attributes for suitable processes was drawn up. The international literature on process options for mechanised girth welding was reviewed and techniques, which fitted the Australian requirements were identified. The most attractive mechanised girth welding options for further investigation were identified as: • GMAW (New technology controlled transfer) • Pulsed plasma keyhole welding • High current (buried arc/keyhole) GTAW 3 ̆c• MIAB welding The rationale behind these suggestions is discussed and the implications for the pipeline industry in adopting mechanised girth welding are explored.

40|$|AbstractFillet weld is the {{predominant}} weld type used for connecting different elements e. g. in shipbuilding, offshore and bridge structures. One of prevalent research questions is the structural {{integrity of the}} welded joint. Post weld improvement techniques are being actively researched, as high stress areas like an incomplete penetration on the root side or fluctuations in penetration depth cannot be avoided. Development of laser and laser-arc hybrid welding processes have greatly contributed to increase of production capacity and reduction of heat-induced distortions by producing single pass full penetration welds in thin- and medium thickness structural steel parts. Present study addresses {{the issue of how}} {{to improve the quality of}} the fillet welds by <b>welding</b> the sealing <b>run</b> on the root side with defocused laser beam. Welds having incomplete or excessive penetration were produced with several beam angles and laser beam spot sizes on surface. As a conclusion, significant decrease or even complete elimination of the seam irregularities, which act as the failure starting points during service, is achieved...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of the 60 -W Isotopic Heat Source (IHS), a {{tantalum}} alloy (T- 111) strength member serves as the primary containment shell for the IHS during operation (He-gas internal environment and inert gas or vacuum external environment). An outer Hastelloy S clad is used to protect the T- 111 from oxidation, and both the Hastelloy S clad and the T- 111 strength member are sealed by automatic gas tungsten arc (GTA) welding. The expected life of the IHS is 5 years at about 650 C preceded by up to 5 years of storage at approximately 300 C. For this application, one important concern is failure of the T- 111 strength member due to capsule pressurization arising from helium generation as a fuel decay product. To provide specific data on the mechanical behavior of base and solid metal T- 111 under conditions appropriate to the IHS use conditions, a testing program was formulated and carried out. Three types of mechanical tests were conducted. Tensile properties were measured over the temperature range of 25 to 1100 C on T- 111 base metal and samples with either longitudinal or transverse autogenous welds. Creep tests on base metal and samples with transverse <b>welds</b> were <b>run</b> to failure over the temperature range of 1100 to 850 C. Creep tests were also run on several transverse weld samples over the temperature range of 500 to 900 C at stresses where failure did not occur, and the creep rates were measured. Two prototypical capsules of the T- 111 strength member were fabricated by EG and G Mound Applied Technologies (Mound Laboratories). To verify the mechanical properties design data developed above, these were tested to failure (leak) in a vacuum chamber with the inside of the capsule pressurized by either argon or helium...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{corrosion}} {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the corrosivity of moist plutonium oxide/chloride (PuO{sub 2 }/Cl-) salt mixtures on 304 L and 316 L stainless steel coupons. The tests exposed flat coupons for pitting evaluation and 'teardrop' stressed coupons for stress corrosion cracking (SCC) evaluation at room temperature to various mixtures of PuO{sub 2 } and chloride-bearing salts for periods up to 500 days. The two flat coupons were placed so that the solid oxide/salt mixture contacted about {{one half of the}} coupon surface. One teardrop coupon was placed in contact with solid mixture; the second teardrop was in contact with the headspace gas only. The mixtures were loaded with nominally 0. 5 wt % water under a helium atmosphere. Observations of corrosion ranged from superficial staining to pitting and SCC. The extent of corrosion depended on the total salt concentration and on the composition of the salt. The most significant corrosion was found in coupons that were exposed to 98 wt % PuO{sub 2 }, 2 wt % chloride salt mixtures that contained calcium chloride. SCC was observed in two 304 L stainless steel teardrop coupons exposed in solid contact to a mixture of 98 wt % PuO{sub 2 }, 0. 9 wt % NaCl, 0. 9 wt % KCl, and 0. 2 wt % CaCl{sub 2 }. The cracking was associated with the heat-affected zone of an autogenous <b>weld</b> that <b>ran</b> across the center of the coupon. Cracking was not observed in coupons exposed to the headspace gas, nor in coupons exposed to other mixtures with either 0. 92 wt% CaCl{sub 2 } or no CaCl{sub 2 }. The corrosion results point to the significance of the interaction between water loading and the concentration of the hydrating salt CaCl{sub 2 } in the susceptibility of austenitic stainless steels to corrosion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this investigation, a nickel-base powder {{mixed with}} {{tungsten}} carbide particles was applied by Plasma Transferred Arc welding (PTA) {{on the surface}} of the D 2 cold work tool steel to improve surface quality and to extend its lifetime during applications. The Design of Experiment (DoE) method was applied to obtain the appropriate combination of hardfacing parameters and to run the minimum number of tests. Current, travel speed and preheat were considered as variable parameters. These parameters are important to reach a final layer with an appropriate bead geometry accompanied with good metallurgical properties. All samples were prepared for metallurgical investigations and the effect of process parameters on the weld bead geometry was considered. For each experiment <b>run,</b> <b>weld</b> bead geometry parameters were measured including dilution, penetration and reinforcement. Microstructures and the distribution of tungsten carbide particles after welding were analyzed by Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) equipped with an EDS microprobe. In addition, hardness tests were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of the weld bead layers. Finally, among all the experiments, the best sample with appropriate bead geometry and microstructure was selected...|$|R
