5|$|In Japan, {{the threat}} of the typhoon caused {{airlines}} to cancel 145flights, mostly in and around Okinawa. About 50American army bases in Okinawa <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> non-essential workers were told to remain home.|$|E

30|$|Clearly, K_ 1 =K <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex. Assume K_n <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex {{for some}} n≥ 1. It {{is easy to}} see that K_n+ 1 ={v∈ K _n: 2 〈 v, Ju_n-Jz_n〉≤ u_n - z_n +ω _n}. Consequently, it <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex. Hence, Step  1 is completed.|$|R

5|$|October 24, 2005– A nor'easter fed by Hurricane Wilma brought heavy rain, wind, {{and snow}} to the state. Dozens of schools <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> 12 {{inches of snow}} fell in western Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupiers}} looted {{and destroyed}} much of Poland's {{cultural and historical}} heritage, while persecuting and murdering members of the Polish cultural elite.

30|$|By Lemmas 2.4 and 2.8 we obtain that SGEP(F_ 1,φ_ 1,F_ 2,φ_ 2) and _i= 1 ^∞F(S_i) <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex subsets of C. Hence Γ <b>is</b> a <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex {{subset of}} C. It follows by Lemma  2.5 that C_n+ 1 <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex for each n∈N.|$|R
30|$|From Theorem  3.1 in [26], we {{see that}} _i= 1 ^∞F(T_i) <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex, which {{combines}} with Lemma  2.3 shows that the common element set F <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> convex.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, Reeb {{stability}} theorem, {{named after}} Georges Reeb, asserts {{that if one}} leaf of a codimension-one foliation <b>is</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> has finite fundamental group, then all the leaves <b>are</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> have finite fundamental group.|$|R
5|$|After the Romanian Revolution, many firing ranges and {{training}} areas <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> abandoned {{due to lack}} of funds. Currently, the military schools {{and training}} units of the Romanian Land Forces are directly subordinated to the central headquarters. There are 3 military high schools (Câmpulung Moldovenesc, Alba Iulia and Breaza), five military academies , one officers school (Piteşti), 3 training schools (Sibiu, Piteşti, Buzău) and 9 training battalions.|$|E
5|$|Early in Saomai's {{developmental}} history, the rainbands {{associated with}} the storm dropped heavy rain across the Northern Mariana Islands. Schools across the archipelago nation <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> ferry service between Saipan and Tinian was cancelled. Reports of flooding were widespread, including in Saipan. In Tianan, some banana trees were damaged by the storm's affects. Damage from the islands amounted to US$650,000, with $600,000to infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, {{the threat}} of Glenda {{prompted}} officials to close oil, representing a lack of production of 154,000barrels of oil. Additionally, natural gas fields <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> several ports along the coastline were shut down during {{the passage of the}} storm. Prior to the storm's landfall, officials issued a Red Alert for several communities. Storm shelters were opened in Karratha and Onslow, while a few hundred people evacuated along the coastline.|$|E

5|$|When {{the hall}} opened in 1932 {{a number of}} smaller residences for women: Belgrave House, Elton House, Heathside and Royal Park, <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> their {{residents}} moved to the new building.

5|$|As Lane {{came closer}} to the coastline, all the {{seaports}} between Michoacán and Sinaloa <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (Mexico) (National Meteorological Service, in Spanish) warned the general population about the threat of flooding and landslides. When the hurricane made landfall, {{the government of the}} state of Sinaloa issued a state of emergency for the municipalities of Ahome, Guasave, Angostura, Salvador Alvarado, Culiacán, Navolato, Elota, San Ignacio and Mazatlán. The arrival of the hurricane forced the closure of several flights at the General Rafael Buelna International Airport in Mazatlán, Sinaloa.|$|E

5|$|During World War II civil {{aerodromes}} {{were taken}} over for military use, existing military airfields were expanded, and new ones were built. This {{resulted in a}} significant inventory of facilities becoming available after the war. Pre-war civil aerodromes, for example Sywell, were returned to civilian use. Surplus military airfields <b>were</b> <b>closed,</b> <b>and</b> in some cases, for example Beccles, subsequently re-opened as civil aerodromes. The Ministry of Civil Aviation was created to regulate all civil aviation in the UK, and this task remained the responsibility of government departments until {{the establishment of the}} independent CAA in 1972.|$|E
5|$|On August 11, 1658 Charles X and {{his forces}} reached Valby hill (current day Frederiksberg) {{from where they}} could {{overlook}} the Danish capital. His arrival was expected and the Danish king Frederick III had already ordered every building outside the city walls burnt, {{even though it had}} housed a third {{of the population of the}} city. That same day the city gates <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> would not open again for another 22 months. A Swedish fleet of 28 ships blocked the harbor, preventing resupply by sea. The siege had begun.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 2005, {{the park}} officially {{announced}} Goliath, a $20,000,000 steel Hyper Coaster. By {{the end of}} the 2005 season, the rides Great Gasp and Looping Starship <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> removed from the park {{to make room for the}} new roller coaster. Foundations for Goliath's supports began to be poured in September 2005. In early October, track began to arrive at the park; erection of the supports and track began soon after. In November and December, construction on the lift hill was complete. In March 2006, Goliath's trains were delivered to the park. After construction on the track and testing was complete, the roller coaster opened to the public on April 1, 2006.|$|E

5|$|The United States Coast Guard urged marine {{interests}} and boaters in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina to take precaution {{to protect their}} lives and vessels. In Florida, the Gulf Islands National Seashore closed their campground and a beach front road. Additionally, several states parks <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> campers were evacuated. At Pensacola Beach, condominium associations asked residents to remove furniture from high balconies due to the anticipation of strong winds. A state of emergency was issued for Taylor County, where two shelters were opened.|$|E
5|$|The site, a {{steeply sloping}} {{hillside}} between a main railway line {{and one of}} Brighton's main roads, had been {{the home of a}} railway locomotive works and goods yard for more than a century. High-density housing was built {{at the same time and}} surrounded the railway buildings. From the 1960s, the area fell into decline: the works and goods yard <b>were</b> <b>closed</b> <b>and</b> demolished, and most of the housing was cleared. This left large areas of derelict land which attracted small-scale redevelopment and transient commercial enterprises. Proposals for redevelopment were made from the 1980s onwards; in 2001 a master plan was granted planning permission by Brighton and Hove City Council. Site clearance work followed, and construction began in 2004.|$|E
