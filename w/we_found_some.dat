He explained, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> other dude, I'd love to move on, write some cool tunes and change the name and go on like that. I don't see continuing as Alice and replacing somebody. ... We're not trying to replace Layne. We want to play these songs one more time, and if it seems like the right thing to do, it'll happen. I don't know how long it will go or where it will take us. It's kind of a tribute to Layne and our fans, the people who love these songs. It's not some 'I'm broke and I need the money' situation. We love playing together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Barger, the HSCA's {{acoustics}} expert, {{when asked}} about this discovery and the NAS analysis, replied,Barber discovered a very weak spoken phrase on the DPD Dictabelt recording that is heard at {{about the time of}} the sound impulses we concluded were probably caused by the fourth shot. The NAS Committee has shown to our satisfaction that this phrase has the same origin as the same phrase heard also on the Audograph recording. The Audograph recording was originally made from the channel 2 radio. The common phrase is heard on channel 2 about a minute after the assassination would appear, from the context, to have taken place. Therefore, it would seem [...] [...] [...] that the sounds that we connected with gunfire were made about a minute after the assassination shots were fired. Upon reading the NAS report, we did a brief analysis of the Audograph dub that was made by the NAS Committee and loaned to us by them. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> enigmatic features of this recording that occur at about the time that individuals react to the assassination. Therefore, we have doubt about the time synchronization of events on that recording, and so we doubt that the Barber hypothesis is proven. The NAS Committee did not examine the several items of evidence that corroborated our original findings, so that we still agree with the House Select Committee on Assassinations conclusion that our findings were corroborated ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. On {{the way back to}} pit lane, Buemi declared to commentator Dario Franchitti his satisfaction with his success but admitted the victory was handed to him [...] "on a plate" [...] He later felt Rosenqvist was the deserving victor but was happy with the pace of his car: [...] "I think we were {{more or less the same}} pace [...] I’m very happy with that result, it just tastes a little bit different than normal." [...] Rosenqvist believed in the short-term he would look back at the whole race weekend positively for himself and Mahindra but was [...] "disappointed" [...] about his second-place result: [...] "Today, we were under pressure from Sébastien, we knew that we would be close as they looked very strong compared to yesterday. I knew that I had to drive a perfect race, every corner we had to drive perfect. I think we did a great job." [...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> pace, which meant we could keep up a little bit with these guys, but we need to improve. There is still a couple of tenths we need to find to be able to fight [...]" ...|$|E

6000|$|In the {{afternoon}} we all visited the garden, which, {{although a good}} deal overgrown with luxuriant weeds, showed marks of fair cultivation.

60|$|Five {{miles through}} the woods, {{gradually}} descending, led us {{into an open}} plain {{where there was a}} grass-bordered pond full of ducks. Here appeared an opportunity to get some meat. R.C. tried with shotgun and I with rifle, all to no avail. These ducks were shy. Romer seemed to evince some disdain at our failure, but he did not voice his feelings. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> wild-turkey tracks, and a few feathers, which put our hopes high.|$|E

60|$|Here {{we found}} the country barren enough, but yet we had by his {{direction}} plenty of food; for the savages round us, upon giving them some of our toys, as I have so often mentioned, brought us in whatever they had; and here <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> maize, or Indian wheat, which the negro women planted, as we sow seeds in a garden, and immediately our new provider ordered some of our negroes to plant it, and it grew up presently, and by watering it often, we had a crop {{in less than three}} months' growth.|$|E

60|$|Notwithstanding all {{the poetry}} of our situation, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> of the ills of life in it.

60|$|The scenery about Nonkreem {{village is}} {{extremely}} picturesque, and we procured many good plants on the rocks, which {{were covered with}} the purple-flowered Orchid, Coelogyne Wallichii. The country is everywhere intersected with trenches for iron-washing, and some large marshes were dammed up for the same purpose: in these <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> beautiful balsams, Hypericum and Parnassia; also a diminutive water-lily, the flower of which is {{no larger than a}} half-crown; it proves to be the Nymphaea pygmaea of China and Siberia--a remarkable fact in the geographical distribution of plants.|$|E

Most curious of all <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> flint-lock muskets made exactly on the models of one hundred years ago, but dated 1883!

60|$|The {{government}} has determined on exhibiting vigour, {{and there was}} a great show of troops the night succeeding the combat. Curious to see the effect of all this, two or three of us got into a carriage and drove through the streets, about nine o'clock. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>some</b> two or three thousand men on the Boulevards, and the Rue St. Denis, in particular, which had been the scene of the late disorder, was watched with jealous caution. In all, there might have been four or five thousand men under arms. They were merely in readiness, leaving a free passage for carriages, though in some of the narrow streets we found the bayonets pretty near our faces.|$|E
60|$|Beyond this, {{the path}} crosses the river, and ascends rapidly over {{a mile of}} steeply sloping landslip, {{composed}} of angular fragments of granite, that are constantly falling from above, and are extremely dangerous.
