In {{the first step of}} the conceptual design process, design window analysis was conducted using the system design code HELIOSCOPE by the “Design Integration Task Group”. On the basis of a parametric scan with the core plasma design based on the DPE (Direct Profile Extrapolation) method, a design point having a major radius of 15. 6 m and averaged magnetic field strength at the helical coil <b>winding</b> <b>center</b> of 4. 7 T was selected as a candidate. The validity of the design was confirmed through the analysis by the related task groups (in-vessel component, blanket, and superconducting magnet) ...|$|E
40|$|We study {{analytically}} and numerically {{the winding}} of directed polymers of length t {{around each other}} or around a rod. Unconfined polymers in pure media have exponentially decaying winding angle distributions, the decay constant {{depending on whether the}} interaction is repulsive or neutral, but not on microscopic details. In the presence of a chiral asymmetry, the exponential tails become non universal. In all these cases the mean winding angle is proportional to t. When the polymer is confined to a finite region around the <b>winding</b> <b>center,</b> e. g. due to an attractive interaction, the winding angle distribution is Gaussian, with a variance proportional to t. We also examine the windings of polymers in random systems. Our results suggest that randomness reduces entanglements, leading to a narrow (Gaussian) distribution with a mean winding angle of the order of √(t).

40|$|The {{transport}} AC losses (Q tr) of YBCO pancake coils wound from n = 1, 2, 4 non-transposed parallel connected (n-tpc) tapes {{have been}} investigated experimentally and theoretically. It {{was found that the}} Q tr AC losses of the coils with several n-tpc tapes consist of hysteresis AC losses (Q h) and coupling AC losses (Q cc). AC losses Q h of these coils are nearly the same as the AC losses of single-tape coils (n = 1). In contrast, Q cc are unique for coils with n > 1 n-tpc tapes. We found that the distribution of the coupling currents in the coil turns is defined by the magnetic flux penetrating between n-tpc tapes. This flux is related to the self-field component of the coil parallel to the tape surface, which is antisymmetrically distributed (an odd function) with respect to the <b>winding</b> <b>center.</b> This antisymmetrical distribution leads to a compensation effect of the coupling currents if n-tpc tapes are insulated along the turn length, in spite of low resistance between n-tpc tapes in the soldered coil ends. Therefore, AC losses Q cc of such coils are negligibly small compared to AC losses Q h. On the other hand, AC losses Q cc per current cycle are frequency dependent and have a maximum defined by the time constant τ eff if tapes are non-insulated along the turn length. In this paper we estimated τ eff for several special cases. In particular, we found that Q tr of YBCO pancake coils wound from several n-tpc tapes are comparable to Q tr of single-tape coils if the operating frequency f is far from the characteristic frequency 1 /τ eff...|$|E
