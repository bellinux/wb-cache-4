25|$|Chimpanzees {{are known}} for {{possessing}} great amount of muscle strength, especially in their arms. However, compared to humans the amount of strength reported in media and popular science is greatly exaggerated with numbers of four to eight times the muscle strength of a human. These numbers stem from two studies in 1923 and 1926 by a biologist named John Bauman. These studies were refuted in 1943 and an adult male chimp was found to pull about the same weight as an adult man. Corrected for their smaller body sizes, chimpanzees {{were found to be}} stronger than humans but not anywhere near four to eight times. In the 1960s these tests were repeated and chimpanzees were found to have twice the strength of a human when it came to pulling weights. The reason for the higher strength seen in chimpanzees compared to humans are thought to come from longer skeletal muscle fibers that can generate twice the <b>work</b> <b>output</b> over a wider range of motion compared to skeletal muscle fibers in humans.|$|E
500|$|Constructing his designs proved {{far more}} {{difficult}} than Evans initially envisaged—with just six working steam engines in the United States at this time, {{and a handful of}} workshops with any experience making them, it took Evans much of his savings and two years to yield a working example to display to the public in 1803. This first engine was powered by a double-acting cylinder six inches in diameter and with a piston stroke length of eighteen inches. Many components, such as the flywheel and crosshead, were made of wood in order to simplify construction. The boiler, the engineering of which was critical to the safe operation of the engine, consisted of a large copper shell encased in wood and cast iron rings in order to contain the pressure. The output of the machine was approximately five horsepower. This <b>work</b> <b>output</b> was modest by contemporary standards—the low-pressure engine of the nearby waterworks produced about twelve horsepower. But his steam engine was just a fraction of the size of pre-existing machines—the waterworks machine was over twenty-five times larger in volume. Evans unveiled his engine at his store and put it to work crushing plaster of Paris and, more sensationally, sawing slabs of marble. The showmanship paid off, and thousands came to see the machine in operation, while the Philadelphia newspaper Aurora declared [...] "a new era {{in the history of the}} steam engine." ...|$|E

40|$|Road {{transportation}} using air as a fuel {{has attracted}} much attention over the past decade. The fuel (air) can be in two forms, compressed gas form and cryogenic liquid form and engines based on both forms of air have been investigated. Prototypes of air powered road vehicles are expected to emerge {{over the next few}} years. However, there have been debates over {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two technologies. This paper aims to compare the two technologies from the technological point of view. Engines for a typical small scale passenger car are used for the analyses and the comparison is based on the shaft work, coolth, efficiency and energy density. It is shown that the shaft <b>work</b> <b>outputs</b> and the coolth available to engines powered by both fuels increase with increasing working pressure and temperature. Given the working pressure and temperature, liquid air powered engines have a slightly lower specific <b>work</b> <b>outputs</b> than compressed air powered engines. The volumetric energy density of liquid air, however, is much higher than that of compressed air, and liquid air has much higher coolth than compressed air. On the other hand, the efficiency of the compressed air powered engines is higher than that of liquid air powered engines mainly because of the higher energy consumption of liquefaction plants. The analyses also suggest that an effective use of coolth be a key to improve the overall efficiency of liquid air powered engines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
