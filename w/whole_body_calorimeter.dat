40|$|Low {{glycaemic}} index (GI) foods minimize large blood glucose fluctuations {{and have been}} advocated to enhance fat oxidation and may contribute to weight management. We determined whether the inclusion of isomaltulose compared to sucrose in a low/high GI meal sequence can modulate the glycaemic response and substrate oxidation in an Asian population. Twenty Chinese men (body mass index (BMI) : 17 – 28 kg/m 2) followed a 24 h low GI (isomaltulose, PalatinoseTM) or high GI (sucrose) diet in a randomized double-blind, controlled cross-over design. Treatment meals included dinner (day 1), breakfast, lunch, and snack (day 2). Continuous glucose monitoring provided incremental area under the curve (iAUC) and mean amplitude of glycaemic excursion (MAGE) and 10 h indirect calorimetry (<b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>calorimeter)</b> (day 2) provided energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Our results demonstrated that the low GI diet resulted in lower 24 h glucose iAUC (502. 5 ± 231. 4 vs. 872. 6 ± 493. 1 mmol/L; p = 0. 002) and lower 24 h glycaemic variability (MAGE: 1. 67 ± 0. 53 vs. 2. 68 ± 1. 13 mmol/L; p < 0. 001). Simultaneously, 10 h respiratory quotient increased more during high GI (p = 0. 014) and fat oxidation was higher after low GI breakfast (p = 0. 026), lunch (p < 0. 001) and snack (p = 0. 013). This indicates that lower GI mixed meals incorporating isomaltulose are able to acutely reduce the glycaemic response and variability and promote fat oxidation...|$|E

Urine collections were obtained throughout the study and {{used to measure the}} specific activity of urea, from which CO 2 production was estimated. It was assumed that the recovery of label in gaseous CO 2 was 95 % of that infused and that the specific activity of urea was 85 % that of expired CO 2. Continuous daily collections of calorimeter air revealed that 95. 6 +/- 1. 3 % (SD) of infused label was recovered as gaseous CO 2, with little daily variation. Another 1. 5 +/- 0. 4 % was recovered as urinary urea. The estimated CO 2 production, calculated from the specific activity of urea in 24 -h urine samples corrected for the small effects due to changes in the size and specific activity of the urea pool, was found to be 100 +/- 5 % of the calorimeter estimate for 1 -day periods (20. 80 +/- 1. 44 mol CO 2 /day) and 100 +/- 2 % for 4 -day periods.

40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine oxygen uptake (VO(2)) and percentage of maximum oxygen uptake (%VO 2 max) in obese and non-obese adolescents during various activities in standardised conditions, and the corresponding %VO 2 max in free-living conditions. METHODS: Twenty-seven obese and 50 non-obese adolescents aged 12 to 16 years participated in this study. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), VO 2 max by treadmill tests, VO 2 corresponding to various activities by <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> calorimetry, and time and % VO 2 max corresponding to various activities in free-living conditions using the heart-rate recording method and a physical activity diary. RESULTS: VO 2 max (l/min) was 27. 4 % higher in obese than in non-obese subjects (p< 0. 001), but not significantly different after adjustment for fat-free mass (FFM). In the <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>calorimeters,</b> with the same activity program, % VO 2 max corresponding to sleep and sedentary activities were lower in obese than in non-obese girls (- 15. 1 % and - 12. 3 %, p< 0. 05), but not significantly different between obese and non-obese boys. However, walking at 4 - 5 - 6 km/h corresponded to 47 - 59 % and 71 % of VO 2 max, respectively, in obese, and 34 - 41 % and 48 % of VO 2 max in non-obese subjects (p< 0. 001). In free-living conditions, moderate physical activities and sports corresponded to 52 % vs 35 %, and 39 % vs 51 % of VO 2 max, respectively, in obese and non-obese adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: In standardised conditions %VO 2 max did not correspond to the same type of physical activity in obese compared to non-obese adolescents. Consequently, % VO 2 max is inadequate for comparing the types of physical activities of obese and non-obese adolescents in free-living conditions...|$|R
40|$|A transportable, <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> {{indirect}} <b>calorimeter,</b> {{designed for}} use in the tropics, is described. The calorimeter was built to study energy expenditure of people having chronically or acutely low levels of food intake, and it will help to determine energy adaptations made by individuals with restricted food intake. The calorimeter comprises two units: a 27 m 3 ventilated chamber connected to an office housing control and monitoring equipment. The system also allows the experimenter to assess the rate of energy expenditure by means of a ventilated hood or a baby respiration chamber. The incoming air flow rate is variable and is typically set at approximately 30 l/min. Carbon dioxide production (VCO 2) and oxygen consumption (VO 2) are continuously monitored by means of differential gas analysers via a computerized data acquisition unit. Gas production/consumption rates are measured with a delay of 80 s, the complete response to step changes in VCO 2 or VO 2 consumption being calculated over 15 min using the rate of change terms in the gas exchange equations. The total electrical power required for the whole system is 12 kW. The calorimeter has been functioning for nearly 4 years in a rural village of The Gambia during which ambient temperatures have ranged from 16 to 44 degrees C and dewpoints from - 8 to 24 degrees C. The performance and accuracy of the calorimeter were tested using 20 per cent CO 2 in N 2 infusion and butane burning.

40|$|Background Farmers {{experience}} {{a high rate}} of low back pain (LBP), with a lifetime prevalence of up to 75 %. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration exposure has been recognized as a significant physical risk factor associated with LBP. The agriculture sector has high <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration exposures related to various machine types; however, little research has assessed vibration exposure in farming due to the inconvenience and cost of direct data collection. Prediction modelling is potentially a cost-efficient way to estimate directly measured exposure. Objectives The objectives of this study are to 1) measure the physical exposure of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration in Saskatchewan farmers and understand its magnitude and variability between farm machinery; and 2) use farm, vehicle, and task characteristics to determine any predictive relationship with directly-measured <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration exposures among Saskatchewan farmers. Methods A 1 -year field study with 3 repeated farm visits was conducted for <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration measurements on 21 farms within a 400 km distance of Saskatoon. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration was assessed using a tri-axial accelerometer embedded in a standard rubber seat pad according to international standards (ISO 2631 - 1). <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration data were summarized by machinery type into standardized metrics of root-mean-squared accelerations (RMS), peak, crest factor, and vibration dose value (VDV). Vehicle characteristics were gathered by on-site observations supplemented by open access vehicle descriptions through manufacturers. Farm characteristics and farmer’s self-reported <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration exposure were collected via questionnaires. A manually stepwise method was conducted to build mixed-effects models for both RMS and VDV outcomes. Results A total of 87 <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration measurements were gathered from 8 machine types: tractor, combine, pickup truck, grain truck, sprayer, swather, all-terrain vehicle, and skid steer. The average measurement duration was 85 minutes. The mean vector sums were RMS 0. 78 m/s², peak 19. 34 m/s², crest factor 27. 64, and VDV 10. 02 m/s 1. 75. The fixed effects of ‘horsepower’, ‘vehicle transmission type’, ‘farm size’, and ‘farm commodity’ explained 44 % of the variance in RMS; while ‘horsepower’, ‘seat suspension type’, ‘loading frequency’, ‘tire tread type’, ‘jerk/jolt frequency’, ‘seat bottom-out frequency’, ‘farm commodity’, and ‘farm size’ explained only 20 % of VDV variance. Conclusion High mechanical vibration and shocks from a range vehicle types call for action to reduce agricultural <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration. Although VDV is relatively difficult to predict through farm and vehicle features collected in the present study, RMS can be predicted to a moderately useful degree.

Multiple alternative treatment methods exist for type 2 diabetes mellitus such as acupuncture, bariatric surgery, yoga, aromatherapy, herbal remedies, etc. <b>Whole</b> <b>Body</b> Vibration is a relatively new area of interest recently utilized as an adjunctive therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus, representing a potentially new and novel treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Objective The primary objective of this study was to summarize current literature regarding the effects of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration on type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review details the effect of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration on areas of high clinical impact in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus such as glycemic control, body composition, renal function, inflammatory indices, peripheral neuropathy, and wound healing. Methods Reviewers independently screened abstracts and full texts in journal articles and books to extract data from multiple studies and literature to compile a current review on the topic of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration and diabetes mellitus. Results Current literature in murine and human models reported an overall improvement in glycemic control, renal function, inflammatory indices, and peripheral neuropathy following <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration therapy. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration effect on body mass composition is controversial with inconsistent reports of the effect on lean mass, bone density, and fat mass. Conclusions <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration has demonstrated significant promise in improving multiple systems related to the sequela of type 2 diabetes mellitus, thereby suggesting a new and novel treatment modification in this patient population. Subsequent studies are needed to further analyze the effect of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration on type 2 diabetes mellitus...|$|R
40|$|<b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> protein {{turnover}} {{and resting}} energy expenditure are measured simultaneously in weight stable and weight losing patients with lung (n = 22) or colorectal cancer (n = 38). These results {{were compared with}} those from weight stable and weight losing non-cancer controls (n = 22). Rates of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> protein turnover were calculated from the plateau isotopic enrichment of urinary ammonia and urea following a primed, continuous, 24 -h infusion of [15 N]glycine. Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. All groups of cancer patients had significantly elevated rates of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> protein turnover (P less than 0. 05) and synthesized, on average, 1. 9 g/kg/day more protein compared with weight stable non-cancer controls. In contrast, the resting energy expenditure of cancer patients and controls was similar. Moreover, there was no correlation between individual rates of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> protein turnover. Thus, although cancer patients had rates of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> protein turnover which were 50 - 70 % greater than controls, this {{did not result in}} a measurable increase in resting energy expenditure. The assumption that elevation of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> protein turnover or resting energy expenditure causes weight loss in cancer patients must be an oversimplification. An acute phase protein response was observed in the majority of cancer patients. Although the presence of such an inflammatory response did not correlate with the rate of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> protein turnover, the role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of disturbed protein metabolism in cancer patients merits further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{progressively}} overload vibration platform frequency to describe sea-saw <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration influence on neuromuscular performance of community-dwelling older adults. Seventy-three community-dwelling older adults (aged 72 ± 8 years) were randomly assigned to 4 groups (zero, one, 2, and 3 <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration sessions per week). Quantifiers of neuromuscular performance such as the 5 -Chair Stands test, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and the Tinetti test were recorded. Furthermore, Health-related quality of life was qualified with the SF- 36 Health Survey. A 6 -week <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration intervention significantly improved the quantifiers of neuromuscular performance in a community-dwelling older adult sample. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration was shown to significantly reduce time taken to complete the 5 -Chair Stands test (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and the TUG test (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Tinetti test scores significantly improved (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). as did all components of health-related quality of life (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Overall, progressively overloaded frequency elicited more beneficial improvement for the 3 <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration sessions per week group. It was concluded that progressively overloaded frequency was effective in improving quantifiable measures of neuromuscular performance in the sample and that practitioners may confidently prescribe 3 <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration sessions per week with more precise knowledge of the effects of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> vibration on neuromuscular performance and health-related quality-of-life effects...|$|R
