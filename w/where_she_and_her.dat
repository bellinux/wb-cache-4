5|$|Ark Royal {{returned}} to base in Loch Ewe, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> crew were inspected by Winston Churchill. The sinking of U-39 {{was hailed as}} important to morale. However, the failed attack on Ark Royal, and the successful attack on Courageous on 17 September, convinced the Admiralty it was too dangerous to risk aircraft carriers in this way, and carrier-centred hunter-killer groups were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In October 1811, Aigle {{was sent}} to the Mediterranean <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> crew raided the island of Elba before being asked to provide naval support during the {{invasion}} and occupation of Genoa. Refitted in January 1820, her square stern was replaced with a circular one, giving her a wider angle of fire and improved protection at the rear. Converted to a corvette in 1831, she returned to the Mediterranean under Lord Paget. From 1852, she became a coal hulk, then a receiving ship before being used as a target for torpedoes and broken up in 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} told in the first-person through the protagonist, Elspeth Gordie, a teenage girl who has secret mental powers such as telepathy {{and the ability to}} {{communicate}} with animals.

5|$|In early 1924, Florida {{took part}} in the Fleet Problem III maneuvers, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> sister Utah acted as stand-ins for the new s. In June 1924, Florida was taken out of service for a {{modernization}} at the Boston Navy Yard, which lasted from 1 April 1925 to 1 November 1926. During the reconstruction, her deck armor was strengthened and anti-torpedo blisters were installed to increase her resistance to underwater damage. Her secondary battery was rearranged to improve its efficiency, and four of her 5-inch guns, which were mounted in sponsons, were removed. She was also reboilered with four White-Forster oil-fired models that had been removed from the battleships and battlecruisers scrapped {{as a result of the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Her Parsons turbines were replaced with new Curtis geared turbines and her two funnels were trunked into one stack. The rear lattice mast was replaced with a pole mast, which was moved further aft. Her two submerged torpedo tubes were also removed.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> sisters enjoyed sitting with him {{in the back of the}} church rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, on {{receiving}} her diploma, de Bourgoing {{joined the}} Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires (SSBM), forerunner of the French Red Cross, {{as a volunteer}} and began working at the Beaujon Hospital in Paris. As {{a result of her}} competence and the understanding she showed both patients and doctors, she was appointed president of the SSBM. In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating the wounded in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided the wounded and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where {{it would be easier to}} provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her nurses were accompanying the wounded on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake.

5|$|Lamont's {{childhood}} was divided between Glasgow and her mother's family home on Tiree, <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> brother David spent their summer holidays. She attended Woodside Secondary School, having declined to take scholarship exams for selective education. Like her parents, {{she was a}} Gaelic speaker, {{but she did not}} believe she spoke it well enough, and she dropped it at school in favour of French and German. It was also at school that she first developed an interest in politics, once entering a Daily Mirror competition with a politically-themed short story. The tale, whose central character discussed her intention to demand a pay rise and was finally revealed to be the Queen, won Lamont third prize. She studied English and History at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MA. Joining the Labour Party in 1975, she was active in the Glasgow University Labour Club where she was a contemporary of fellow Labour politician Margaret Curran, and was also involved with the women's movement. She trained as a teacher for a year at Jordanhill College, gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education, and afterwards joined Rothesay Academy, Isle of Bute, as a teacher in 1979. She taught at Springburn Academy in Glasgow from 1982 to 1989 and at Castlemilk High School, also in Glasgow, from 1990 to 1999. Lamont taught English and worked with social workers and educational psychologists attempting to tackle instances of school truancy.|$|E

They come to a party <b>where</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. Jeffree Star then approaches Kesha. Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling {{over the top of the}} glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.|$|E
