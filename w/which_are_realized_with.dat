40|$|A fast four channel network {{analyzer}} is introduced to measure S -parameters in a frequency range from 10 MHz to 3 GHz. The signal generation {{for this kind}} of analyzer is based on pulse generators, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> bipolar transistors. The output signal of the transistor is differentiated and two short pulses, a slow and a fast one, with opposite polarities are generated. The slow pulse is suppressed with a clipping network. Thus the generation of very short electrical pulses with a duration of about 100 ps is possible. The structure of the following {{network analyzer}} is similar to the structure of a conventional four channel network analyzer. All four pulses, which contain the high frequency information of the device under test, are evaluated after the digitalization of intermediate frequencies. These intermediate frequencies are generated with sampling mixers. The recorded data is evaluated with a special analysis technique, which is based on a Fourier transformation. The calibration techniques used are the same as for conventional four channel network analyzers, no new calibration techniques need to be developed...|$|E
40|$|In some {{languages}} (such as Dutch), speakers produce duration {{differences between}} vowels, {{but it is}} unclear whether they also encode short versus long speech sounds into different phonological categories. To examine whether they have abstract representations for ‘short’ versus ‘long’ contrasts, we assessed Dutch listeners’ perceptual sensitivity to duration in two vowel qualities: [a] and [ɑ], as in the words maan ‘moon’ and man ‘man,’ <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> long and short duration respectively. If Dutch represents this phonetic durational difference as a ‘short’-‘long’ contrast in its phonology, duration changes in [a] and [ɑ] should elicit similar neural responses [specifically, the mismatch negativity (MMN) ]. However, we found that duration changes evoked larger MMN amplitude for [a] than for [ɑ]. This finding indicates that duration is phonemically relevant for the maan-vowel that is represented as ‘long,’ while it is not phonemically specified for the man-vowel. We argue that speakers who in speech production distinguish a given vowel pair on the basis of duration may not necessarily encode this durational distinction as a binary ‘short’-‘long’ contrast in their phonological lexicon...|$|E
40|$|Joint vehicle {{localization}} and categorization in {{high resolution}} aerial images can provide useful information for {{applications such as}} traffic flow structure analysis. To maintain sufficient features to recognize small-scaled vehicles, a regions with convolutional neural network features (R-CNN) -like detection structure is employed. In this setting, cascaded localization error can be averted by equally treating the negatives and differently typed positives as a multi-class classification task, but the problem of class-imbalance remains. To address this issue, a cost-effective network extension scheme is proposed. In it, the correlated convolution and connection costs during extension are reduced by feature map selection and bi-partite main-side network construction, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> {{the assistance of a}} novel feature map class-importance measurement and a new class-imbalance sensitive main-side loss function. By using an image classification dataset established from a set of traditional real-colored aerial images with 0. 13 m ground sampling distance which are taken from the height of 1000 m by an imaging system composed of non-metric cameras, the effectiveness of the proposed network extension is verified by comparing with its similarly shaped strong counter-parts.

40|$|To reduce fuel {{consumption}} {{as well as}} noise and CO 2 emissions, the overall trend in civil aviation is to decrease exhaust velocities associated with an increase of the fan diameter, implying more weight and more drag because of the larger nacelle size. To compensate for the introduced weight increase, the concept of nacelles with short inlet, for which {{the interaction between the}} nacelle and the fan is higher than for current engines, is often considered. This paper proposes to design a short inlet geometry with a length over diameter ratio of l/D� 0. 35 that provides better or equal aerodynamic performances, predominantly for the fan, than conventional long inlet configurations with typical ratios of l/D� 0. 65. To obtain such a design, an optimization process with a flow field covering the entire fan, intake and nacelle system is used. The first step is to define the parameterization of the nacelle which finally contains the nacelle and the intake contour as basics parameters. The next step is to establish a robust and automatic meshing procedure of the entire calculation domain (far field, nacelle, intake and fan), which guarantees a high mesh quality independent of the parameter selected. AutoOpti, which is an optimization tool developed at DLR, is applied, providing an optimization framework based on an evolutionary algorithm with heavy surrogate model enhancements. For the calculations, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>realized</b> <b>with</b> the DLR in-house solver TRACE, three operating conditions are considered: static take-off (OP 1), take-off (OP 2) and cruise (OP 3). The classification of the results is based on the assessment of the fan aerodynamic performances, considering fan total pressure ratio for OP 1 and OP 2 with the aim to increase the fan stability limit and on the isentropic efficiency for OP 3. Among the Paretofront, the best individual is selected and analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, explaining the performance gain and corresponding geometric modifications of the intake and lip section. A new optimization process is realized to minimize the pressure peak observed at static take-off condition on the nacelle’s leading edge. Then, a full annulus nacelle geometry is created in order to study the influence of some asymmetric parameters such as the angle of the nacelle inlet face (droop angle), the thickness in circumferential direction and the inflow angl...|$|E
