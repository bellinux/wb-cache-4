Merchants returning from trade missions to Overhill Cherokee villages in the Tennessee Valley brought back news of the abundance of game west of the range, and began taking hunters along on their trade expeditions. In 1748 and 1750, Thomas Walker crossed the mountains and explored the Holston River valley, recording and <b>widely</b> <b>publicizing</b> the location of Cumberland Gap - [...] a pass near the modern border of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee - [...] which allowed relatively easy access to the headwaters of the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers.|$|R

As the series progressed, a <b>widely</b> <b>publicized</b> feud developed between Conrad, Montag and Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt. Consequently, the conflict became the central focus of the series, and was carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appeared.|$|E
5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One <b>widely</b> <b>publicized</b> incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the guns}} that sank with Kronan were {{salvaged}} in the 1680s, but eventually the wreck fell into obscurity.

50|$|When Cooper left Paramount, {{production}} was delayed, although {{there may have}} been other reasons as well. It's unlikely that any footage was actually shot at that time, but Paramount did {{go so far as to}} check with historians and dental organizations to confirm the screenplay's depiction of Morton, finding that opinion was divided on his character and on his claim to have discovered the first practical anesthesia. In fact, when Rene Fulop-Miller's book Triumph over Pain was published in 1940, it caused a storm of controversy, as many disputed its claims regarding Morton. It is now recognized that Dr. Crawford Long's use of ether predated Dr. Morton's use, although Morton is credited for <b>widely</b> <b>publicizing</b> the technique.|$|R
500|$|Reaction to Kantakouzenos' {{proclamation}} {{caused a}} rift in Byzantine society, {{with the rich}} and powerful land-holding magnates (traditionally called the dynatoi, the [...] "powerful ones") who dominated the countryside quickly rallying to support him, while the ordinary population, often living in abject conditions and suffering under oppressive taxation, supported the Empress-dowager and the Patriarch. Apokaukos was especially quick to capitalize upon this division and foment popular dislike for the aristocracy, by <b>widely</b> <b>publicizing</b> the immense wealth confiscated from Kantakouzenos' and his supporters' houses and estates. In the words of Donald Nicol, [...] "it was against him [...] and everything that he stood for as a millionaire and landowning aristocrat that the people rose up.

2500|$|On June 9, 1953, Hunt's 24-year-old son Lester Jr., {{known as}} [...] "Buddy", {{who was a}} student and {{president}} of the student body at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was arrested in Washington, D.C., for soliciting prostitution from a male undercover police officer in Lafayette Square, just north of and adjacent to the White House property. It was his first offense, which police normally handled quietly as a matter for the offender's family to address, but the arrest became known to Senate Republicans. [...] According to Drew Pearson's Washington Merry-Go-Round column published after Hunt's death, Senators Styles Bridges and Herman Welker threatened that if Hunt did not immediately retire from the Senate and agree not to seek his seat in the 1954 election, they would see that his son was prosecuted and would <b>widely</b> <b>publicize</b> his son's arrest.|$|R
5|$|The arcs in the Adams ring remain unexplained. Their {{existence}} is a puzzle because basic orbital dynamics imply {{that they should}} spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several theories about the arcs' confinement have been suggested, the most <b>widely</b> <b>publicized</b> of which holds that Galatea confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring's orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings' mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led {{to the conclusion that}} the rings are not in CIR with Galatea.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, the ACLU {{opened up}} a major office in Atlanta, Georgia, {{dedicated}} to serving Southern issues. Much of the ACLU's progress in the South was due to Charles Morgan, Jr., the charismatic leader of the Atlanta office. He was responsible for desegregating juries (Whitus v. Georgia), desegregating prisons (Lee v. Washington), and reforming election laws. The ACLU's southern office also defended African-American congressman Julian Bond in Bond v. Floyd, when the Georgia congress refused to formally induct Bond into the legislature. Another <b>widely</b> <b>publicized</b> case defended by Morgan was that of Army doctor Howard Levy, {{who was convicted of}} refusing to train Green Berets. Despite raising the defense that the Green Berets were committing war crimes in Vietnam, Levy lost on appeal in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 (1974).|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{after being}} fired from Uptown, Combs {{established}} his new label Bad Boy Entertainment as {{a joint venture with}} Arista Records, taking then-newcomer The Notorious B.I.G. with him. Both The Notorious B.I.G. and Craig Mack quickly released hit singles, followed by successful LPs, particularly Notorious B.I.G.'s Ready to Die. Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, 112, Total, and Father MC. The Hitmen, his in-house production team, worked with Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others. Mase and the Lox joined Bad Boy just as a <b>widely</b> <b>publicized</b> rivalry with the West Coast's Death Row Records was beginning. Combs and Notorious B.I.G. were criticized and parodied by Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s. During 1994–1995, Combs produced several songs for TLC's CrazySexyCool, which finished the decade as number 25 on Billboard's list of top pop albums of the decade.|$|E
2500|$|Stack {{has been}} noted to employ various methods to make himself {{available}} to Union City citizens, such as <b>widely</b> <b>publicizing</b> his cell phone number. Since 2000, Stack has spent a few dates each quarter away from City Hall in a [...] "mobile office" [...] tent that is set up at various locations in Union City in order {{for people who do}} not have easy access to City Hall to see him.

In July 2010, Stack increased his mobile office appearances to a monthly basis. Among the activities sponsored by his organization, the Brian Stack Civic Association, are annual delivery of free turkeys to the needy and free public Thanksgiving dinners.|$|R
50|$|When her father's {{childhood}} friend arrives for a visit, Jade must juggle her competing identities even more carefully than usual, lest {{her choice of}} professions—and boyfriends—shame her father. Because of its instability, Jade's parents don't understand or <b>widely</b> <b>publicize</b> Jade's aspirations to be an actress. Their main want for Jade is to date and marry a nice Chinese boy, a goal for which Jade's extended family also strives as they are always trying to introduce her to Chinese boys.

Jade has {{to figure out how to}} both please her family, who would not approve of her dating a Caucasian, and be true to herself. Her older brother is already out of the picture for that very reason. Naturally, something must give sooner or later, and the facade of the perfect Chinese daughter soon begins to crumble.|$|R
