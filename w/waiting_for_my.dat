25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E

500|$|After Beebo Brinker, Bannon {{said the}} energy {{to write about the}} {{characters}} left her, but she got so good at her [...] "obsessive fantasies" [...] that even after the books were written she continued to live internally, and suspected it affected her subsequent relationships. [...] "I realize now that I was in a sort of 'holding pattern,' a way of keeping my sanity intact while <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> children to grow up and the freedom door to open", she recalled. Returning to school, Bannon completed her master's degree at Sacramento State University and her doctorate in linguistics at Stanford University. She was an English professor at Sacramento State and later became associate dean of the School of Arts and Sciences—later the College of Arts and Letters.|$|E

500|$|On May 8, General Whiteside's militia brigade was mustered into federal service under Atkinson. Two days later, {{the militia}} and regulars began marching up the Rock River {{in pursuit of}} the British Band, with Governor Reynolds {{accompanying}} the expedition as a major general of militia. Atkinson allowed Reynolds, Whiteside, and the militiamen to take the lead while he brought up the rear with the regular soldiers. In what historian Patrick Jung calls a [...] "serious lapse in judgment", Atkinson directed the militia—his least trained and disciplined men—to [...] "move upon the Indians should they be within striking distance without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> arrival". On May 12, the militiamen learned that Black Hawk's band was only twenty-five miles away. Reynolds wanted to send out a scouting force, but the cautious Whiteside insisted on waiting for Atkinson. Because most of the militia were now under U.S. Army command, Reynolds could not give them orders, but he did have two battalions of mounted militia under Major Isaiah Stillman that had not been federalized. In what would prove to be a controversial decision, Reynolds sent these 260 amateur citizen-soldiers forward to reconnoiter the British Band.|$|E
500|$|After being heavily {{recruited}} by several colleges around the country, Solo attended the University of Washington from 1999 to 2002 where she majored in speech communications. With the Huskies, she switched permanently to goalkeeper under {{the lead of}} head coach Lesle Gallimore and goalkeeper coach and former national team player, Amy Griffin. Solo described the transition in her memoir, [...] "In high school, I had been the forward who won games. It was a huge mental adjustment to learn that {{my job was to}} save games. To anticipate what was needed. Before, I would stand in goal, the ball would come toward me, and I'd use my athletic ability to make the save. But thanks to Amy's tutelage and my time with the national team, I was becoming a much better tactical goalkeeper. I learned how to read my opponents' runs toward goal, how to position my defenders, how to see the angles... The intellectual side also made goalkeeping so much more interesting. It wasn't just ninety minutes of <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> defense to make a mistake. It was ninety minutes of tactics and strategy. The personality traits that had been shaped by my childhood—resilience and toughness—were assets at the position." ...|$|E

2500|$|Asked in a December 2014 {{interview}} if Savatage {{would do}} any more live shows or record new material, guitarist Chris Caffery replied, [...] "I'm gonna put it this way: for 12 years, 13 years, I've been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> band to play again. We're playing again. I don't know what's going to happen after that , but there were people that were putting a fork in it, and we're getting up and not just running a marathon, we're running in the Olympics with this festival being what it is. I'm {{not going to make}} any predictions, but let's just say there's a possibility that something more will happen after Wacken – that's all I can say. And nothing would make me happier." ...|$|E
2500|$|General Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián {{was able}} to become interim {{president}} of Guatemala {{after the death of}} President Justo Rufino Barrios in the Batalla of Chalchuapa in El Salvador in April 1885 and after the resignation of first designate Alejandro Manuel Sinibaldi Castro, by means of a clever scam: [...] he went to the General Cemetery when Barrios was being laid to rest and told the Congress president: [...] "please prepare room and board for the 5,000 troops that I have <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> orders in Mixco". The congress president was scared of this, and declared Barillas interim president on the spot. By the time he realized that it was all a lie, {{it was too late to}} change anything.|$|E
2500|$|Adele {{had said}} that she began writing it on her {{acoustic}} guitar {{in the wake of}} the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. [...] "We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for." [...] She also said that [...] "I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold. I was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eddie's sons, Tyler (Tony Discipline) and Anthony (Matt Lapinskas), were {{announced}} on 10 May 2011, and Kirwood {{said that the}} Moon family were [...] "on their way to becoming an established family in the Square." [...] Writers were banned from getting Essex to sing in the programme, as producers wanted to concentrate on his acting rather than his singing. Kirkwood later said, [...] " [...] is a legend in his own right. I can't wait for the audience reaction when he hits the screens in a few weeks. I'm hoping viewers come to love him." [...] Essex {{said that he was}} determined to show off his acting skills and explained: [...] "It's important to me that Eddie is a character and not David Essex. Because of my track record it might be difficult for some people to differentiate the two, and that's going to be a challenge. But my fans are thrilled I've joined EastEnders—it means that they get to see me on the telly rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>my</b> next tour!" [...] However, Essex admitted, [...] "Eddie Moon is not a million miles from David Essex", saying that he had tweaked the character's accent and had brought some of himself into the role. Essex made his first on-screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 3 June 2011.|$|E
