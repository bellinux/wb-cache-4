Large-scale sea ice model simulations also suggest a context of increasingly deep snow, warm ice, and large brine fractions across the three observational years, {{despite the fact that the}} model is forced with a snowfall climatology.

Although the formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood, there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sea surface temperatures that are warm enough, atmospheric instability, high humidity in lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear.

The AMSU-A's higher spatial and radiometric resolutions provide more useful {{information on the}} strength of the middle and upper tropospheric warm cores associated with tropical cyclones than have previous microwave temperature sounders. The gradient wind relationship suggests that the temperature gradient near the core of tropical cyclones increases nonlinearly with wind speed. We recast the gradient wind equation to include AMSU-A derived variables. Stepwise regression is used to determine which of these variables is most closely related to maximum sustained winds (V(sub max)). The satellite variables investigated include the radially averaged gradients at two spatial resolutions of AMSU-A channels 1 through 10 T(sub b) data (delta(sub r) T(sub b)), the squares of these gradients, a channel 15 based scattering index (SI- 89), and area averaged T(sub b). Calculations of Tb and delta(sub r) T(sub b) from mesoscale model simulations of Andrew reveal the effects of the AMSU spatial sampling on the <b>cyclone</b> <b>warm</b> core presentation.

Model sensitivity to horizontal resolution is investigated using a range of horizontal resolutions comparable to those used in operational and quasi-operational forecasting models. Sensitivity tests are also performed using both the Betts-Miller-Janjic convective scheme (operational at NCEP in 1998) and the Kain-Fritsch scheme. Variations in predicted peak precipitation as resolution is refined are found to be highly case dependent, suggesting forecaster interpretation of increasingly higher resolution model quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) information will not be straightforward.

Fitting an azimuthally symmetric Gaussian function to the surrounding height field provides cyclone depth (difference between the cyclone centre and the synoptic environment), radius (standard deviation), geostrophic wind and vorticity. Analysing ERA- 40 reanalysis data of different resolutions and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario simulations by the coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation model ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM yields mean radii of 300 - 500 km in winter and 300 - 400 km in summer. Depth maxima occur in the storm tracks (determined by the bandpass-filtered variance of the geopotential height), and the smallest radii characterize oceanic cyclogenesis regions. The geostrophic vorticity, derived from the fitted Gaussian model, agrees reasonably well with the observed relative vorticity. Future warmer climate scenarios exhibit smaller radii and weaker depths during winter and summer. An intense growth of the depth is found during the 2 - 10 day cyclone life cycles, while the radii reveal negligible growth. Compositing depths with respect to normalized total lifetime leads to rescaled depth life cycles, which collapse to a simple universal function, (a) over tilde (1 - (a) over tilde), for relative cyclone age (a) over tilde.

40|$|The {{effect of}} latent heat release on the {{development}} of the occluded thermal structure in a major winter storm is examined through comparison of full physics (FP) and no-latent-heat-release (NLHR) simulations of the event performed using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM 5). Though both simulations possess a well-developed occluded thermal ridge near the surface, the 3 D structure of their respective occluded quadrants is quite different. In particular, the FP simulation depicts the canonical, troposphere-deep warm occluded thermal structure, whereas the NLHR simulation produces only a shallow, poorly developed one. Consistent with these differences in tropospheric thermal structure, the FP cyclone displays a robust treble clef potential vorticity (PV) distribution in the upper troposphere in its postmature phase, while a considerably less robust version characterizes the NLHR simulation. The PV minimum of the treble clef overlies a poleward sloping column of warm, weakly stratified air that extends through the depth of the troposphere and is a signature of the trowal, the essential structural feature of <b>warm</b> occluded <b>cyclones.</b> Consequently, examination of the role played by latent heat release in production of the occluded thermal structure in this case is made through consideration of its influence on the evolution of the upper-tropospheric PV morphology.

40|$|Often, late-year, flood-producing {{storms in}} the Mediterranean Alps region arise from {{baroclinic}} disturbances developing on westerly longwaves, with the incipient storm circulations appearing well {{west of the}} flood zone. Regardless of the genesis locations and before the storms begin their flow interactions with the orography of the Mediterranean Alps, a process which can produce intense long-lived rainfall over the mountainous terrain of Italy and France, most of their moisture is drawn from warm Mediterranean waters while important elements of their thermodynamic structure are derived from airmass properties originating in north Africa and the Mediterranean basin itself. In fact, because of strong thermodynamic contrasts between the baroclinic zone producing the incipient disturbance and high potential temperature air from the south advecting into and wrapping around the storm center, a Mediterranean storm whose origins are from an evolving shortwave baroclinic perturbation, can become a quasi-warm core hybrid in term of its energetics composition, a process somewhat akin {{to the development of}} polar lows.

40|$|The {{hurricane}} season of 2005 was the busiest on record and Hurricane Katrina (2005) {{is believed to}} be the costliest hurricane in U. S. history. There are growing concerns regarding whether this increased tropical cyclone activity is a result of global warming, as suggested by Emanuel(2005) and Webster et al. (2005), or just a natural oscillation (Goldenberg et al. 2001). This study examines the changes in tropical cyclone intensity to see what were really responsible for the changes in tropical cyclone activity over the past 30 years. Since the tropical sea surface temperature (SST) warming also leads to the response of atmospheric circulation, which is not solely determined by the local SST warming, this study suggests that it is better to take the tropical cyclone activities in the North Atlantic (NA), western North Pacific (WNP) and eastern North Pacific (ENP) basins as a whole when searching for the influence of the global-scale SST <b>warming</b> on tropical <b>cyclone</b> intensity. Over the past 30 years, as the tropical SST increased by about 0. 5 C, the linear trends indicate 6 %, 16 % and 15 % increases in the overall average intensity and lifetime and the annual frequency. Our analysis shows that the increased annual destructiveness of tropical cyclones reported by Emanuel(2005) resulted mainly from the increases in the average lifetime and annual frequency in the NA basin and from the increases in the average intensity and lifetime in the WNP basin, while the annual destructiveness in the ENP basin generally decreased over the past 30 years. The changes in the proportion of intense tropical cyclones reported by Webster et a 1 (2005) were due mainly to the fact that increasing tropical cyclones took the tracks that favor for the development of intense tropical cyclones in the NA and WNP basins over the past 30 years. The dynamic influence associated with the tropical SST warming can lead to the impact of global <b>warming</b> on tropical <b>cyclone</b> intensity that may be very different from our current assessments, which were mainly based on the thermodynamic theory of tropical cyclone intensity...|$|R

In the context of the economic impacts of tropical cyclones vulnerability has been character-ized in terms of trends in population and wealth that set the stage for storms to cause damage. “Outcome risk ” integrates considerations of vulnerability with event risk to characterize an event that causes losses.
