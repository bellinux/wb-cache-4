40|$|ABSTRACT: Worm gears are {{commonly}} used in windshield wipers and power windows of automobiles. The goal of this work is to study several material problems, such as production bottlenecks and excessive scrap, resulting from the production of steel <b>worm</b> <b>shafts.</b> A possible solution is explored in this work by characterizing material properties of a promising candidate (glass reinforced acetal copolymer) that can replace steel in worm gears. Finite element analysis of the worm thread under static loading and constant temperature is performed in order to calculate {{the size of the}} new composite part. The results obtained in this work support the possibility of manufacturing composite <b>worm</b> <b>shafts</b> that could operate at elevated temperatures without sacrificing part performance, while reducing part weight leading to improved fuel economy, noise reduction, and manufacturing problems associated with the steel part. The finite element analysis shows that compared to a steel gear, the axial pitch of a composite worm gear must be increased by 250 % in order for it to operate without failure for 10 years at a constant temperature of 23 C. This increase in the axial pitch would ramp up to 400 %, if the composite worm gear is expected to operate for 10 years at a constant temperature of 100 C.

5000|$|Her minelaying {{arrangements}} were [...] "highly ingenious, but extremely complicated", filling two aft compartments. A compensating tube {{ran down the}} center of the two spaces, to make up for the lost weight as mines were laid, as well as to store eight additional mines. The other mines were racked in three groups around this tube, two in the fore compartment, one aft, with a hydraulically driven rotating cage between them. Mines were moved by hydraulic <b>worm</b> <b>shafts,</b> the aft racks connecting directly to the launch tubes, which had vertically sliding hydraulic doors (rather than the usual hinged ones of torpedo tubes). Each launch tube was normally loaded with four mines, and a water 'round mines (WRM) tube flooded to compensate as they were laid, then pumped into the compensating tube. Eight mines could be laid in 10 minutes.|$|R

This arrangement allows the exact synchronisation of the four pin gears. The four Leonard controllers each have an output of 55 kilowatts totalling 220 kilowatts.

The DAF YA-328 used walking beams where the axle {{was no more than a}} pivot and the drive was supplied entirely by external longitudinal drive shafts, one on each side. As was usual for heavy vehicles of this period, the final drives and right-angle drive to the stub axles were combined through a worm gear box. This also had he advantage that it is easy to connect such boxes in series, using the rear end of the <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> as an output.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} to produce high precision worm in form rolling {{is described in}} this study {{on the base of}} three-dimensional FE-simulation and its confirmation by experiment. It is important to determine the initial blank diameter in form rolling because it affects tooth quality. The calculation method of the initial blank diameter is suggested and it is verified by two-dimensional FE-simulation. Form rolling process of <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> used as automotive part using the rack die of counter flow type is considered and simulated with the same numerical model as actual process by three-dimensional FE-simulation. Generation process of tooth profile during the form rolling by the rack die of counter flow type is investigated from the result of simulation. The experiments using both the rack die and the round die are performed under the same conditions as those of simulation. The results of simulation and experiment indicate that the form rolling process of <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> using the rack die is decidedly superior to that using the round die from the aspect of the precision of worm such as the surface roughness, the straightness and the profile of worm...|$|E

The company Boston Scientific Costa Rica {{is engaged}} in the {{manufacturing}} of medical products at the areas of urology, cardiology and endoscopy. One is the biopsy catheter, consisting of a handle, a coil and forceps. The coil is a tubular shape and flexible spiral, made of stainless steel and coated {{with a layer of}} polyethylene. Currently, the process of coating the coils with polyethylene is done automatically, in an extrusion line which has three drive shafts that carry the coils through the process phases. However, there are problems of quality because the coating is not remain homogeneous, presenting a thickness less than the acceptable or even exposed areas of the coil’s stainless steel. This forces to discard several batches of the product, generating economic losses to the company, It was determinate that the problem is due the lack of coordination between the principal drive shaft, the extruder machine worm and the other two drive shafts. Thus, it is required to design and implement an automatic control system for the drive shafts speed; using the variable frequency drives (VFD) that handles those shafts, the programmable logic controller (PLC) which governs the entire extrusion line and feeding back the <b>worm’s</b> <b>shaft</b> state through the Profibus communication network.

40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of tilting table driven by worm and worm wheel Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of tilting table behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} tilting table driven by worm and worm wheel in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of tilting table system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of worm and worm wheel, the torsional stiffness of <b>worm</b> wheel <b>shaft,</b> and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings. Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|R
50|$|The Rothensee {{boat lift}} {{utilizes}} floats in float chambers {{in a similar}} manner to that at Henrichenburg. In this case only two float chambers were needed. The lift follows the patented plans of Rudolf Mussaeus.The trough is 85 metres long and 12.2 metres wide and is supported on two 36 metre long 10 metre in diameter cylindrical floats submerged in two 60 metre deep float chambers. The floats are internally sub-divided into three separate chambers. Each of these chambers is filled with air compressed to a pressure appropriate to its depth in the float chamber in order to prevent implosion. The floats provide buoyant lift equivalent to 5,400 tonnes, enough to balance the weight of the trough and its load of water and ship. The trough is set in motion using four <b>worm</b> geared <b>shafts,</b> 27.3 metres long and 42 centimetres in diameter moved by eight 44 kW electric motors. Because the trough and its load are in equilibrium with the floats only the friction opposing the troughs movement needs to be overcome by the motors. A complete lift can be achieved using less than 500 kW of power.|$|R

40|$|Crude oil {{is a major}} natural {{resource}} and the mainstay of any country that have it in abundance; its sole disadvantage is its tendency of spilling to the environment. Kenaf {{has been found to}} be a good absorbent for physical clean-up and treatment of oil spillage both on land and water surfaces. Kenaf absorbs the oil thus making it soaked and the absorbed oil can however be recovered using appropriate technology. The aim of the research work is to design and construct an oil extractor to remove and recover the absorbed oil from kenaf bast and core. The functional parts of the machine are: barrel (80 mm diameter and 1000 mm length), <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> (minimum diameter 50 mm and maximum diameter 65 mm), gear reduction box (20 : 1), prime mover (7 hp, 1420 rpm), oil and cake outlet, hopper, conical restrictor, pulley and transmission belts. The <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> was tapered to build up pressure as it travels across the length of the barrel and it conveys, grinds, presses and squeezes oil out of kenaf into the oil outlet via the oil collection tray. The residual cake from where the oil was extracted is extruded out of the cake outlet in form of briquettes. The oil extractor machine was evaluated in compliance with Philippines Agricultural Engineering Standard PAES 230 and 231 : 2005 and the results showed a percent kenaf recovery of 60 %, extraction efficiency of 62. 2 %, throughput capacity of 36. 5 kg/hr and an extraction loss of 37. 8 %. The extraction efficiency varies with the moisture content of the soaked kenaf bast and core.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the wear rate in conical thrust bearings, which is {{responsible}} for field failures of stepper motors in optical disk drives (ODD). These bearings support the stepper motor <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> and consist of a steel ball supported in a polymer conical bearing cup. The tribological behaviors of polymers used in bearing application has been addressed by using Archard's wear model, a well known classical model for fretting wear in the literature. However, these studies were for planar bearing surfaces and other geometries, not for the conical geometry addressed in this study. Tests were designed and implemented to study the wear rate of the conical bearing cups at with different load levels. The tribological behavior of Delrin in conical thrust bearing applications has been characterized, by quantifying the wear factors used in the modified Archard's model. Distinct reduction of wear rate is observed due to formation of a polymer transfer film on the steel ball. The variability of the wear properties is explored through replication of the test conditions. Destructive physical analysis is conducted to gain insight into the fundamental wear mechanisms as a part of this study. The results of the wear tests are used to develop a life model of the stepper motor as a case study, to demonstrate an application of this approach. The life model is used to study the effect of variability in the initial axial bearing preload (due to manufacturing tolerances), on the wear rate and life of the stepper motor...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} {{to use a}} curve of {{changing}} vibration amplitude of the rotating moment on the <b>worm</b> <b>shaft</b> of reducer {{in the process of}} growing brake (loading) moment as one of criteria of the worm reducer operability. A condition of reducer operability at the nominal moment is lack of vibrations of the rotating moment with a critical value of amplitude. It is shown that vibrations of rotating moment on a shaft of the electric engine, by their nature, are self-vibrations in the system with "negative friction". Values of the brake moment at which there is a sharp increase of vibration amplitude leading to operability loss correspond to the nominal moment for this reducer or to the brake moment, corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is shown that different lubricants differently influence on the generation of self-vibrations. The most efficient damping occurs when using oil with the additive "Striboil", and the reason of falling efficiency at the excess of the nominal moment is essentially increased energy losses at generation of vibrations with "negative friction", especially when approaching to the resonance area. Thus, taking into account a nature of damping vibrations, with using different lubricants, allows us to increase the permissible tension since the more is a damping value the more is a brake moment corresponding to the maximum efficiency. It is noted that, when using the additives to oils, a growth of the permissible tension is caused by the processes of film formation increasing the real contact area, which increases its share of the nominal contact area determined by the Hertz formula. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a screw pressing system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine.

The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp single-phase electric motor, the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs.
