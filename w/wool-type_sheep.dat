XLUMBE is a Microsoft Excel implementation of the model by Finlayson, Cacho, and Bywater (1995), and it simulates daily changes in sheep body condition driven by daily nutrient intake levels. XLUMBE was parameterized for Kazakh Fine Wool sheep managed as generally indicated in figure A 1 on a semi-desert rangeland in southeastern Kazakhstan. Forage production parameters used in XLUMBE are reviewed in Breuer (2000). For sheep parameters, the figures for <b>wool-type</b> <b>sheep</b> found in Finlayson, Cacho, and Bywater (1995) were used since this sheep breed is genetically close to Kazakh Fine Wool sheep. Following Degen and Young (2002), parameter adjustments were made for the impacts of climate factors such as weight losses due to cold weather...|$|E
