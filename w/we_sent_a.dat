500|$|We {{had just}} done with [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] which {{everyone}} was happy with. <b>We</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> rough version of [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes," [...] without any lyrics, to Kelly and Clive Davis. It {{was in part}} an olive branch to Kelly, because there was miscommunication on [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] where Kelly had written some lyrics and Max and I didn't know about it and we had finished the song. So we wanted to write [...] "Behind" [...] with her from the beginning, but we were in different places. She had just won [...] "American Idol" [...] and was on tour, so she'd e-mail me lyrics, and I'd e-mail her my thoughts.|$|E
500|$|Digital Dimension {{took charge}} of the visual effects of the film. CG {{supervisor}} Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. [...] "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. <b>We</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," [...] Crosby indicated. [...] "It began with R on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." [...] Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also inputed for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.|$|E
2500|$|A {{decade after}} the start of the Iraq War a number of human shields were interviewed for an article on the movement.

2500|$|On December 19, 2006, GoDaddy {{received}} {{a third party}} complaint of invalid domain contact information in the WHOIS database for the domain FamilyAlbum.com. GoDaddy {{wrote a letter to}} the owner of FamilyAlbum.com saying, [...] "Whenever we receive a complaint, we are required by ICANN regulations to initiate an investigation as to whether the contact data displaying in the WHOIS database is valid data or not... On 12/19/2006 <b>we</b> <b>sent</b> <b>a</b> notice to you at the admin/tech contact email address and the account email address informing you of invalid data in breach of the domain registration agreement and advising you to update the information or risk cancellation of the domain. The contact information was not updated within the specified period of time and we canceled the domain." [...] The editor of [...] "Domain Name Wire" [...] said that since domain names are valuable it was reasonable to expect that the registrar would try to contact the domain owner by phone or postal mail. On February 28, 2007, GoDaddy offered to get the domain name back for the previous owner if he would indemnify GoDaddy from legal action by the new registrant. GoDaddy stated that the new owner paid $18.99 for the domain, the price of a backorder, not a regular registration. On November 2, 2007, Domain Name Wire reported that it appears that GoDaddy no longer cancels domains for invalid WHOIS. The editor on Domain Name Wire {{received a}} message from a reader who is trying to acquire a domain with obviously false WHOIS information. The message from GoDaddy said, [...] "The domain has been suspended due to invalid WHOIS. The domain will remain in suspension through expiration, including the registry's redemption period, unless the owner updates the contact information before that time." ...|$|E
