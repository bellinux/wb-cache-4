5|$|According to the Syrian authorities, {{the camp}} of archaeologists was looted, {{along with the}} tools and {{ceramics}} kept in it. The site changed hands between the different combatants, mainly the Kurdish People's Protection Units and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

5|$|Essex also rose in {{rebellion}} in June {{and the town}} of Colchester <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Royalists. Sir Thomas Fairfax placed it under siege, and Mersea Fort was taken by Parliamentary forces and used to cut off any assistance reaching the town by river. Meanwhile, Parliament defeated the Kentish insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone at the start of June and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Rich to deal with the castles of the Downs.|$|E

5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired. A {{passenger}} {{is reported to have}} remained on deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded Brussels. The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully. Brussels <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans, and the radio was destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E

5|$|The Mets traded Humber {{along with}} Carlos Gómez, Kevin Mulvey, and Deolis Guerra for two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Johan Santana that offseason. Humber pitched for the Twins in 2008 and 2009 and then signed {{a minor league}} {{contract}} with the Kansas City Royals after the 2009 season. After pitching for Kansas City for 2010, the Oakland Athletics claimed him on waivers from the Royals, but waived him a week later, at which point he <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Chicago White Sox.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was last}} {{referred}} to in active use in 1316, after which it was probably allowed to decay; further stonework <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> keeper of Rockingham Forest in 1373, by which time the castle had probably been abandoned. By the 15th century, Sauvey formed a subsidiary property of Withcote manor - {{a reversal of the}} old land holding pattern. Its structures had mostly been dismantled or destroyed by 1622 and had gone entirely {{by the end of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|While Richard was at Mile End, the Tower <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rebels. A {{force of}} rebels, {{separate}} from those operating under Tyler at Mile End, approached the castle, possibly {{in the late}} morning. The gates were open to receive Richard on his return and a crowd of around 400 rebels entered the fortress, encountering no resistance, possibly because the guards were terrified by them.|$|E

5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and action <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people of Malvern and the Commons Society {{to preserve the}} hills and common land and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor {{indicated that they would}} like to give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E
5|$|Doro's album Fear No Evil was {{released}} in January 2009 and entered in many charts all over Europe. It was her last collaboration with guitarist Joe Taylor, who left to join Cycle of Pain. His place in the band <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Dutch guitarist Bas Maas (ex-After Forever). The line-up of Pesch, Maas, Princiotta, Douglas and Dee went on a world tour for most of 2009 and 2010, reaching North and South America, Russia, China and, for the first time, Japan. Doro supported Saxon in their 2009 UK tour and Motörhead in Germany in 2010. During this prolonged time on the road, guitarist Princiotta was sometimes substituted by Robert Katrikh or by Harrison Young. Doro's band appeared at festivals all over the world, including Wacken Open Air and Metal Female Voices Fest 7 (where she dueted again with Tarja Turunen) in 2009, Hellfest in France, Bang Your Head!!! in Germany and Bloodstock Open Air in Great Britain in 2010.|$|E

5|$|During the First English Civil War {{between the}} {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament, Mersea Fort saw no action; after the victory of Parliament in 1646, the fort's garrison was demobilised. Conflict flared again in 1648 with {{the outbreak of the}} Second English Civil War, and Colchester <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Royalists. The town was immediately besieged by General Thomas Fairfax, who quickly seized Mersea Fort, which controlled the supply route by river into Colchester, before the Royalists could do so. The fort had contained five pieces of artillery: two culverins, two sakers and one drake. A Royalist raiding party of 300 soldiers was sent to recapture the fort, but without success.|$|E
5|$|Engines and {{propellers}} numbers 1 to 3 suffered substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and propeller number 4 suffered much less damage. The investigators determined {{that at the time}} of impact, propellers 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing power but propeller number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> crew to unfeather propeller number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained evidence of any internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the results indicated normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gaozong and the {{emergence}} of the Mongols, the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with the Mongols in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged by years of warfare, lacked economic capacity and yielded little defensibility. This breaking of alliance meant open warfare between the Mongols and the Song Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the slaughter of over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mongols with ease.|$|E

5|$|From 1669, Klis Fortress {{was in the}} {{possession}} of the Venetians, and it remained so until the fall of the Venetian state. The Venetians restored and enlarged the fortress during their rule. After another, the seventh war with the Turks from 1714 to 1718, the Venetians were able to advance up to the present Bosnian/Croatian border, taking in the whole Sinjsko field and Imotski. Thereafter the Turkish menace was laid to rest and Venice had no serious challenge to its authority in Dalmatia, until Napoleon extinguished the republic itself in 1797. The border between Christian and Muslim Europe had been moved further east, and the fortress lost its main strategic importance. Subsequently, Klis <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Austrians. The last military occupation of Klis Fortress was by Axis powers during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Its {{status in}} the history of Danish {{photography}} is rivalled by a portrait of Bertel Thorvaldsen sitting at an easel outside his studio in the garden of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenborg Palace in Copenhagen. This daguerrotype <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> French photographer Aymard Charles Théodore Neubourg, who visited Copenhagen in the summer of 1840. An examination of the circumstances under which it was taken reveals that the date was Sunday, 26 July 1840. It has also been noticed that Thorvaldsen is making the horn sign with what apparently is his left hand although, {{as a result of the}} daguerrotype mirror effect, it is actually his right hand. This has been ascribed to the anxiety he must have experienced while facing the new mechanical device which could reveal even the slightest detail.|$|E
