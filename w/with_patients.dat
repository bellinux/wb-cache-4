5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} <b>with</b> <b>patients</b> and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due to factors such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E
40|$|An {{endogenous}} colony formation assay {{was performed}} on 24 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP), 11 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML-accerelated phase (CML-AP), nine <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML-blastic crisis (CML-BC),nine <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> polycythemia vera, two <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> essential thrombocythemia, two <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> primary myelofibrosis, two <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> juvenile CML (JCML), one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> chronic neutrophillic leukemia, two <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> unclassified myeloproliferative disorder (UMPD), five <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB), 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> RAEB in transformation (RAEBt) or overt leukemia, and 10 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Endogenous colony formation was observed in two <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML-AP, one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> CML-BC, two <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> JCML, one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> UMPD, one <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> RAEBt, and seven <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CMML. All of these endogenous colonies were identified as CFU-C by chemical staining. In some <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CML or RAEBt, endogenous colonies were observed when progression of disease occurred. Endogenous colony formation was partially inhibited by the depletion of phagocytes in five <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> CMML or RAEBt. Four of these patients revealed increased releases of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CFS) to the culture medium, {{and the addition of}} anti-GM-CSF antibody totally inhibited the formation of endogenous colony in one case. Patients who formed endogenous colonies often had chromosomal abnormalities and short survival. These findings suggest that paracrine or autocrine GM-CSF {{plays an important role in}} endogenous colony formation and that such endogenous colony formation is one of the risk factors in hematological malignancies...|$|R

5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be {{as close to the}} fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were undermanned and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed <b>with</b> <b>patients</b> due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{demonstrate}} {{the advantages of}} correlating flow cytometry immunophenotyping with the pathology/ immunohistochemistry of lymph nodes or nodules in the diagnosis of lymphoproliferative diseases. Methods: A retrospective study was carried out of 157 biopsy or fine-needle aspiration lymph nodes/ nodule specimens taken from 142 patients, from 1999 and 2009. The specimens were simultaneously studied with fow cytometry and pathology at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein. The specimens were prepared in hematoxylin/eosin, Giemsa, or monoclonal antibody stained slides for detecting specific antibodies {{for the purposes of}} pathology/immunohistochemical analysis. The samples were hemolyzed and marked with different monoclonal antibody panels for different antigens in fow cytometry immunophenotyping. Results: The diagnostic results of pathology/immunohistochemical studies and flow cytometry immunophenotyping agreed in 115 patients (81 %), corresponding to 127 specimens, as follows according to the pathologic diagnosis: 63 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma; 26 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> reactive lymphoid hyperplasia; 5 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma; 4 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> atypical lymphoid proliferation; 5 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> a chronic granulomatous inflammatory process; 5 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> a non-hematologic diagnosis; 2 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> granulocytic sarcoma; 2 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> thymoma; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> byphenotypic leukemia; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> kappa plasmocytoma; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> Hodgkin's lymphoma. Subtypes of lymphomas could be classified by associating the two techniques: 19 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> follicular lymphoma; 15 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 7 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> small lymphocytic B-cell lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia; 3 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> mantle cell lymphoma; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> Burkitt's lymphoma; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> MALT type lymphoma; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease; 2 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> high grade non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> low grade non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified; 1 <b>patient</b> <b>with</b> Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 12 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma not otherwise specified.

In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 Joseph Fox {{started to}} give a series of lectures on dental surgery at Guy’s Hospital, and was {{appointed}} dental surgeon in the same year. Thomas Bell succeeded Fox as dental surgeon either in 1817 or 1825. Frederick Newland Pedley, who was appointed assistant dental surgeon at Guy’s Hospital in 1885, advocated {{the establishment of a}} dental school within the hospital, and he flooded the two dental schools in London, the Metropolitan School of Dental Science and the London School of Dental Surgery, <b>with</b> <b>patients</b> to prove that a further hospital was needed. In December 1888, Guy’s Hospital Dental School was established. Guy’s Hospital Dental School was recognised as a school of the University of London in 1901. In the 1970s, since there was a decline in the demand for dental services, the Department of Health of the UK suggested {{that there should be a}} decrease in the number of dental undergraduate students as well as the duration of all courses. In response to the recommendations, Royal Dental Hospital of London School of Dental Surgery amalgamated with the Guy’s Hospital Dental School of the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals on 1 August 1983.|$|E

Her next voyage involved transporting a much smaller number of men to Malta and Colombo; only 47 officers and 67 ratings, most of whom left the ship at Malta. When she arrived at Colombo on 15 August, she loaded a full complement of passengers from all three services to return to the UK. The ship arrived at Portsmouth on 9 September and her next voyage involved over 1,200 RN personnel and civilians ferried to Malta, Colombo, and Singapore where almost 1,300 personnel embarked. She returned to Portsmouth on 29 November and began a brief refit in preparation for her final trooping voyage. Indefatigable sailed empty for Norfolk, Virginia, where she loaded RN personnel before returning to Portsmouth on 21 November.

40|$|Background: Standard (qualitative) {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) {{is routinely}} {{used in the}} diagnostic evaluation of psychiatric patients. Quantitative EEG (qEEG) findings differ between <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> depression, but results are not consistent. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} the differences in qEEG parameters between <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> depression, and healthy subjects. Subjects and methods: The study included 30 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia, 33 <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> depression, and 30 healthy subjects. All study participants underwent standard EEG. Artifact-free 100 -second epochs were selected from the recorded material and analyzed with Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) analysis. Results: The results are presented as absolute spectral power values (μV 2) of delta, theta, alpha, and beta components of the EEG spectrum. EEGs were recorded from 12 locations including Fp 1, Fp 2, F 3, F 4, F 7, F 8, T 3, T 4, P 3, P 4, O 1, and O 2. In comparison <b>with</b> healthy subjects, <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia showed increased delta, theta, and beta activity and decreased alpha activity. Similar results were obtained in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> depression, but in fewer regions. In <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia, delta power over Fp 1, Fp 2, F 4, and F 8 regions was increased in comparison <b>with</b> those in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> depression. Interhemispheric asymmetry was found in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia and healthy subjects, but not in <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> depression. Conclusion: The finding that <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> schizophrenia differed from <b>patients</b> <b>with</b> depression in delta power values could be potentially used in differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and depression. The role of qEEG in clinical differentiation between these two mental disorders may be especially important in cases of negative-symptom schizophrenia...|$|R
