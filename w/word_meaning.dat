The scientific name Falco peregrinus is a Medieval Latin phrase {{that was used}} by Albertus Magnus in 1225.

The Latin term for falcon, falco, is related to falx, the Latin <b>word</b> <b>meaning</b> sickle, in reference to the silhouette of the falcon's long, pointed wings in flight.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of how language evolved has received an increasing amount of attention in recent years. Compared to seemingly more complex phenomena such as syntax, <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> are usually seen as relatively easy to explain. Mainstream accounts in psycholinguistics and evolutionary linguistics assume that <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> correspond to stable concepts which are prior to language and derive straightforwardly from human perception of structure in the world. Taking a cognitive linguistic approach based on psycholinguistic evidence, I argue instead that <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> are conventions, grounded, learned and used {{in the context of}} communication. The <b>meaning</b> of a <b>word</b> is the sum of its contexts of use, with particular features of these contexts made more or less salient by mechanisms of attentional learning and communicative inference. Evolutionarily, <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> arise as an emergent product of humans’ adapted tendency to infer each other’s intentions using contextual cues. They are then shaped over cultural evolution by the need to be learnable and useful for communication. This thesis presents a series of experiments that test the effect of these pressures on the origins and development of <b>word</b> <b>meanings.</b> Experiment 1 investigates the origins of strong tendencies for words to specify features on particular dimensions (such as the shape bias). The results show that these tendencies arise via attentional learning effects amplified by iterated learning. Dimensions which are less salient in contexts of learning and use drop out of <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> as they are passed down a chain of learners. Experiments 2, 3 and 4 investigate the structure of <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> produced during either paired communication games or individual labelling of images by similarity. While communication alone leads to <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> that are unstructured and poorly aligned within pairs, communication plus iterated learning leads to <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> that increase in structure and alignment over generations. Finally, Experiment 5 investigates the interaction of event structure and developing conventions in shaping <b>word</b> <b>meanings.</b> The structure of events in an artificial world is shown to influence lexicalisation patterns in the languages conventionalised by communicating pairs. Event features that are less predictable across communicative contexts tend to be more strongly associated with the conventions in the language. Overall, the experiments show that rather than straightforwardly reflecting pre-linguistic conceptualisation, <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> are also dynamically shaped by learning and communication. In addition, these processes are constrained by the conventions that already exist within a language. This illuminates the mixture of convergence and diversity we see in <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> in natural languages, and gives insight into their evolutionary origins...|$|R
40|$|But {{the idea}} that {{categories}} and <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> are single mental entities can also have a distributed connectionist interpretation. In distributed connectionist models an entity is not represented by a single network unit as in localist connectionist models. However, categories or <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> {{can be considered as}} corresponding to some particular pattern of activation on an ensemble of network units and therefore still interpreted as single entities. Categories and <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> tend to be interpreted as single entities that are activated in the mind when an individual categorizes the world or uses language. We argue that this view is mistaken. Connectionist simulations of populations of neural networks that live and reproduce in an environment show that categories and <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> are open and changing collections of activation patterns in the network's internal units rather than single activation patterns. We think that viewing categories and <b>word</b> <b>meanings</b> as single entities in t [...] ...|$|R
