Three campaign shops were opened around Liverpool, asking men {{to vote for}} candidates who supported votes for women, especially Alexander Gordon Cameron. In 1911, Rathbone and Stewart-Brown set up {{a branch of the}} society to educate <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> soon get the vote. When the society disagreed with the NUWSS, it merged with the Municipal Women's Association to create the Liverpool Women's Citizens Association in 1919.|$|E
5|$|CMLL held a 15-woman torneo cibernetico {{elimination}} {{match on}} June 5, 1992 {{to determine the}} two <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> fight for the newly created CMLL World Women's champion the following week. La Diabólica was originally scheduled to work the match, but did not appear {{which led to the}} uneven sides in the elimination match. Several of the participants had recently joined CMLL, leaving the Universal Wrestling Association to join CMLL and its recently restarted women's division. Zuleyma was the reigning UWA World Women's Championship going into the match and CMLL allowed her to keep and defend the UWA championship in the years following Zuleyma's jump to CMLL. The finals came down to Lola Gonzales, a pioneer for women's wrestling in Mexico, and Bull Nakano, a Japanese wrestler that worked regularly for CMLL. The following week, on June 12, 1993 Bull Nakano became the first CMLL World Women's Champion by virtue of her victory over Lola Gonzales.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred younger women who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E

Elaine is very disappointed when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E
25|$|During {{the time}} of the New Comedy (of ancient Greek comedy), prostitute {{characters}} became, after the fashion of slaves, the veritable stars of the comedies. This could be for several reasons: while Old Comedy (of ancient Greek comedy) concerned itself with political subjects, New Comedy dealt with private subjects and the daily life of Athenians. Also, social conventions forbade well-born women from being seen in public; while the plays depicted outside activities. The only <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> normally be seen out in the street were logically the prostitutes.|$|E

25|$|Henry Blackwell {{proposed}} a solution: convince southern political leaders {{that they could}} ensure white supremacy in their region by enfranchising educated <b>women,</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> predominantly be white. Blackwell presented his plan to politicians from Mississippi, who gave it serious consideration, a development that drew the interest of many suffragists. Blackwell's ally in this effort was Laura Clay, who convinced the NAWSA to launch a campaign in the South based on Blackwell's strategy. Clay {{was one of several}} southern NAWSA members who objected to the proposed national women's suffrage amendment {{on the grounds that it}} would impinge on states' rights.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this time, in two {{different}} episodes, that Mandarava led at least 800 women, including her entire personal retinue, to {{the path of the}} Dharma. In the first incident, Mandarava gave teachings to a group of 300 noble women. Based on these teachings, this group of women all took the Bodhisattva vows, began serious meditation practice, and together built a temple where they could practice. On another occasion, Mandarava interceded to end a war and then offered teachings to a group of 500 <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have been affected by the war.

6000|$|All folk {{literature}} has indeed a passion whose like {{is not in}} modern literature and music and art, except where it has come by some straight or crooked way out of ancient times. Love was held to be a fatal sickness in ancient Ireland, {{and there is a}} love-poem in The Songs of Connacht that is like a death cry: 'My love, O she is my love, the <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> is most for destroying me, dearer is she for making me ill than the <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be for making me well. She is my treasure, O she is my treasure, the woman of the grey eyes ... a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not lay a hand under my head.... She is my love, O she is my love, the <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> left no strength in me; a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not breathe a sigh after me, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not raise a stone at my tomb.... She is my secret love, O she is my secret love. A <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> tells me nothing,... a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> does not remember me to be out.... She is my choice, O she is my choice, the <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not look back at me, the <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not make peace with me.... She is my desire, O she is my desire: a woman dearest to me under the sun, a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> not pay me heed, if I were to sit by her side. It is she ruined my heart and left a sigh for ever in me.' There is another song that ends, 'The Erne shall be in strong flood, the hills shall be torn down, and the sea shall have red waves, and blood shall be spilled, and every mountain valley and every moor shall be on high, before you shall perish, my little black rose.' Nor do the old Irish weigh and measure their hatred. The nurse of O'Sullivan Bere in the folk song prays that the bed of his betrayer may be the red hearth-stone of hell for ever. And an Elizabethan Irish poet cries: 'Three things are waiting for my death. The devil, who is waiting for my soul and cares nothing for my body or my wealth; the worms, who are waiting for my body but care nothing for my soul or my wealth; my children, who are waiting for my wealth and care nothing for my body or my soul. O Christ, hang all three in the one noose.' Such love and hatred seek no mortal thing but their own infinity, and such love and hatred soon become love and hatred of the idea. The lover who loves so passionately can soon sing to his beloved like the lover in the poem by 'A. E.,' 'A vast desire awakes and grows into forgetfulness of thee.' ...|$|R

His victims were forced to remain out of doors naked in freezing weather for up to 14 hours, or kept in a tank of icewater for 3 hours, their pulse and internal temperature measured through a series of electrodes. Warming of the victim was then attempted by different methods, most usually and successfully by immersion in very hot water, and also less conventional methods such as placing the subject in bed with <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> try to sexually stimulate him, a method suggested by Himmler.|$|E
25|$|With {{the signing}} of the Concordat of 1801 between France and the Holy See under Napoleon, the Catholic Church was able to resume public activity. Bichier used her {{influence}} to ensure that one of the new missionary centers being established to revive the faith be located in Béthines. Fournet was one of the priests who were based there. After the death of her mother in 1804, he proposed that Bichier recruit a group of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> dedicate their lives to the mission. She found four other companions for this venture, and the following year, she and her servant, Marianne Meunier, went to the Congregation of Divine Providence in Poitiers to learn the fundamentals of consecrated life. When they returned to La Guimetière in 1806, they were joined by two of Bichier's friends, Véronique de Lavergne and Madeleine Moreau.|$|E
25|$|Most {{survival}} strategies {{during the}} siege, though, involved staying {{within the city}} and facing the problems through resourcefulness or luck. One {{way to do this}} was by securing factory employment because many factories became autonomous and possessed more of the tools of survival during the winter, such as food and heat. Workers got larger rations than regular civilians and factories were likely to have electricity if they produced crucial goods. Factories also served as mutual-support centers and had clinics and other services like cleaning crews and teams of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> sew and repair clothes. Factory employees were still driven to desperation on occasion and people resorted to eating glue or horses in factories where food was scarce, but factory employment was the most consistently successful method of survival, and at some food production plants not a single person died.|$|E

25|$|In these New Deal relief programs, Morgan honed {{his skills}} in {{research}} and organization. He acquired a deep understanding of primary source material and information retrieval from {{his work in the}} library of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Within months, he was a major figure in the survey of state and county records, organizing much of the work and completing the writing of surveys done for state and county archives. By 1940 he was overseeing both programs, and by 1942 had supervised the production of histories of Ogden and Provo as well as acting as a primary writer of The WPA Guide To Utah. His work was well received by his superiors in the east and by local historians. Also in 1940, Morgan published the first substantive historical study of the Provisional State of Deseret in the Utah Historical Quarterly, analyzing primary documents dealing with the State of Deseret, including the constitution and early ordinances of the state, with a lengthy editorial introduction explaining their context. He also was involved in other writing projects, including the state contribution to a history of grazing in the western U.S. During this time he began exchanging correspondence with two <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> become well-respected writers, Juanita Brooks and Fawn M. Brodie. Morgan contributed substantively to the work of each as a mentor, critic, and advocate.|$|E
25|$|One {{school of}} {{scholars}} suggest that any birth sex ratio of boys to girls that is {{outside of the}} normal 105-107 range, necessarily implies sex-selective abortion. These scholars claim that both the sex ratio at birth and the population sex ratio are remarkably constant in human populations. Significant deviations in birth sex ratios from the normal range can only be explained by manipulation, that is sex-selective abortion. In a widely cited article, Amartya Sen compared the birth sex ratio in Europe (106) and United States (105) with those in Asia (107+) and argued that the high sex ratios in East Asia, West Asia and South Asia {{may be due to}} excessive female mortality. Sen pointed to research that had shown that if men and women receive similar nutritional and medical attention and good health care then females have better survival rates, and it is the male which is the genetically fragile sex. Sen estimated 'missing women' from extra <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have survived in Asia if it had the same ratio of women to men as Europe and United States. According to Sen, the high birth sex ratio over decades, implies a female shortfall of 11% in Asia, or over 100 million women as missing from the 3 billion combined population of India, other South Asian countries, West Asia, North Africa and China.|$|E

500|$|When the {{government}} targeted women {{early in the}} war focussed on extending their existing roles– helping with Belgian refugees, for example—but also on improving recruitment rates amongst men. They did this both through the so-called [...] "Order of the White Feather" [...] and through the promise of home comforts for the men while {{they were at the}} front. In , groups were set up and a campaign started to get women to help in agriculture and in , the Women's Land Army was set up. One goal was to attract middle-class <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> act as models for patriotic engagement in nontraditional duties. However the uniform of the Women's Land Army included male overalls and trousers, which sparked debate on the propriety of such cross-dressing. The government responded with rhetoric that explicitly feminized the new roles. [...] In 1918, the Board of Trade estimated that there were 148,000 women in agricultural employment, though a figure of nearly 260,000 has also been suggested.|$|E
500|$|Auxiliary Units were a {{specially}} trained and secret organisation that [...] {{would act as}} uniformed commandos to attack the flanks and rear of an enemy advance. They were organised around a core of regular army 'scout sections', supported by patrols [...] of 6 - 8 men recruited [...] from the Home Guard. Although [...] approval for the organisation had been given in June 1940, recruiting only began in early July. Each patrol was a self-contained cell, expected to be self-sufficient. There was, however, no means of communicating with them once {{they had gone to}} ground, which greatly reduced their strategic value. Each patrol was well-equipped and was provided with a concealed underground operational base, usually built in woodland and camouflaged. [...] Auxiliary Units were only expected to operate during an organised military campaign, with an expected lifespan of 14 days. [...] They were not, therefore, intended to operate as a long term resistance organisation. [...] The latter was the responsibility of the Secret Intelligence Service Section VII, which would have only begun to expand its operations once the country had actually been occupied, thus confining knowledge of its existence only to those men and <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> have been available at the time.|$|E
