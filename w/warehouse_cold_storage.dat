40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Increased {{consumer}} demand for fresh fruit {{throughout the year}} has created a need for long term storage. Long term storage of fruit uses more energy than fresh market products, thus increasing production cost. Pacific Northwest energy costs and more competition for markets has made energy conservation an important factor to be considered by the fruit industry. A BASICA computer program, RLSIM, was developed to predict the transient refrigeration load throughout the storage season in apple and pear cold storage warehouses. RLSIM accurately predicted the seasonal and component refrigeration system energy demand curves during the 1985 - 1986 cold storage season. The results also indicated that the largest single energy use component is the continuous operation of evaporator fans. Simulation of a six hours on and six hours off fan cycling technique indicated a reduction of 23. 75 percent could be achieved in overall refrigeration system energy use in the cold storage <b>warehouse.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>storage</b> warehouse management can be improved by using the results of RLSIM. Fan cycling schemes could be properly employed without risk of increasing fruit temperature. Recommendations were made to update research in areas of cooling and respiration rates of various fruits in both controlled atmosphere and common storage...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} the utilization efficiency of LNG cold energy, this paper analyzes LNG regasification process basing on energy-grade analysis. The result shows that comprehensive utilization both of doing work and heat transfer {{is the most}} efficient. Moreover, this paper proposes a chart to select a suitable cold energy utilizaiton way. Instroduction The evolution of global and regional LNGtrande {{over the past twenty}} years has been a story of rapid growth, diversification and increased flexibility in LNG cargo movements[1]. During the last decades the total cost of technology has decreased significantly due to improvements of the liquefaction process. However, the regasfication system has not been considerable improved. It is known that for the regasfication process about 1. 5 % is used[2]. The recovery of the physical exergy of cold available during the regasfication of LNG in Regasfication Plant is of capital interest. The cold contained in LNG has a large environmental impact, usually on the sea near the regasfication site. Some studies[3, 4] have been carried out on the possibility of cold energy recovery in cold technology application facilities (e. g. air liquefaction producing Notrogen, Oxygen, Argon, deep freeze <b>warehouses,</b> <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>warehouse</b> and the freezing process of foods etc.). Exergy analysis is an important method in energy fields. A previous research made by many researchers deal with the exergy utilization in the process of LNG regasfication[5 - 8]. Exergy analysis can predict the distribution, sources and magnitude of irreversible losses in energy systems, and hence, provide guidelines for efficient energy usage[9]. However, exergy analysis only focuses on the exergy utilization, without the anergy utilization. Although anergy {{can not be used to}} produce power through driving turbine, it can provide thermal energy to heat exchanger. In 1986, Professor Yang...|$|R

Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a <b>warehouse</b> and a <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Sanford A. Klein and Douglas T. Reindl; 156 pp. We take for granted the abundance and variety of food that is available to us all year round. Grocery stores around the U. S and the world sell {{a wide variety of}} fruits and vegetables throughout the year no matter when the harvesting season took place; this in large part due to <b>cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>warehouses.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>storage</b> <b>warehouses</b> place otherwise perishable food items into freezers and coolers where they can be stored for months, or even years, until they are ready for sale. Many food items placed in storage require the temperature to be held at low temperatures. Though the low temperatures are needed to maintain the quality of stored products, it has an adverse effect on the refrigeration system. By operating warehouses at temperatures below the freezing point, water (in the form of frost) will accumulate on the air- cooling evaporators used to cool the space. As frost builds up on an evaporator, the resistance to heat transfer between air and the refrigerant increases, airflow through the evaporator decreases, and the overall efficiency of the evaporator decreases. The goal of this research project is to develop {{a better understanding of the}} factors that influence defrost performance as well as the parasitic impacts on system energy consumption by generating a transient computer model of the processes involved in a hot gas defrost cycle on an evaporator coil of known geometry. This study focuses on utilizing different refrigerant temperatures for melting frost accumulated on the evaporator's coils. To evaluate an evaporator undergoing a defrost process; models of a dry coil as well as a frosted coil were developed using EES (Engineering Equation Solver). The models approximated the coil by representing it as a tube with a radial fin. The models themselves are made up of multiple nodes which are defined by energy boundaries. The nodes in the models are transient and are temperature driven. Freezer conditions as well as frost properties are also implemented in the programs to simulate different environments. The frosted fin model was used to record the time to melt a given mass of frost as well as find the distribution of energy associated with defrosting. The dry fin model was created to record the excess amount of energy that goes into a defrost process that lasts longer than the time required to melt the accumulated frost. The last part of the study focuses on the estimating costs associated with the parasitic loads created by initiating a defrost cycle. Since the energy that is lost from convection, evaporation, and stored energy in the metal coils of the evaporator has to be reclaimed, the compressors in the refrigeration system are analyzed to estimate the energy costs associated with operating a compressor to circulate the refrigerant in order to capture the energy from the surroundings. The compressor cost evaluation is based on a single stage and a two stage system using different operating head pressures to simulate the effects of defrosting throughout a typical year.
