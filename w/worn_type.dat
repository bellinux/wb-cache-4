It does appear to me wonderfully and mournfully wrong, when men of letters, as it is too much the fashion for them to do, take to dishonoring their profession by fruitless bewailings and gnashings of teeth; when, all the time, it must be their own fault {{if it is not}} the noblest in the world. Miss Mitford treats me as a blind witness in this case; because I have seen nothing of the literary world, or any other sort of world, and yet cry against her 'pen and ink' cry. It is the cry I least like to hear from her lips, of all others; and it is unworthy of them altogether. On the lips of a woman of letters, it sounds like jealousy (which it cannot be with her), as on the lips of a woman of the world, like ingratitude. Madame Girardin's 'Ecole des Journalistes' deserved Jules Janin's reproof of it; and there is something noble and touching in that feeling of brotherhood among men of letters, which he invokes. I am so glad to hear you say that I am right, glad for your sake and glad for mine. In fact, there is something which is attractive to me, and which has been attractive ever since I was as high as this table, even in the old <b>worn</b> <b>type</b> of Grub Street authors and garret poets. Men and women of letters are the first in the whole world to me, and I would rather be the least among them, than 'dwell in the courts of princes.' ...|$|E

30|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the systematic study of wear, many classification schemes have been devised. However, though covering the whole field in sum, they stay only loosely connected to each other and do not build a complete general picture. To this end, here we try to combine and integrate existing approaches into a general simple scheme unifying known <b>wear</b> <b>types</b> into a consistent system. The suggested scheme is based on three classifying criterions answering the questions “why”, “how” and “where” and defining a 3 -D space filled with the known <b>wear</b> <b>types.</b> The system can be used in teaching to introduce students to such complex phenomena as wear and also in engineering practice to guide wear mitigation initiatives.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The frictional-work wear {{model has}} been used popularly for the {{prediction}} of wear phenomena such as rai l corrugation. The accuracy of such models depends on the value chosen for the empirical wear coefficient in this wear model. Experimental results have widely shown that this wear coefficient is strongly dependent upon the <b>type</b> of <b>wear</b> process involved. The wear coefficient in the frictional-work wear model under two-disc contact and dry friction conditions proposed is a multi-step function of the friction power density corresponding to three <b>types</b> of <b>wear.</b> However, at present {{there is no clear}} means of predicting the transitions between <b>wear</b> <b>types.</b> This paper investigates wear transitions between the <b>wear</b> <b>types</b> are predicted using analytical models based on the wear mechanics involved...|$|R

The lambahoany is presently the most commonly <b>worn</b> <b>type</b> of lamba.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} meant to serve {{as part of a}} {{competence}} platform for future product development projects at Sandvik Coromant AB, Solid Round Tools Department, Västberga, Sweden. The project objective is to gain generic knowledge of the wear mechanisms that restrict tool lifetime when drilling austenitic stainless steel. Thus, identifying if the weakest link of the tool is located within the coating, the coating adherence or in the strength of the substrate. A theoretical review of the work-piece and tool materials has been conducted as a background, along with definition of tool geometry and process parameters. Furthermore, the review includes chemical and process design effect on mechanical properties of the austenitic stainless steel, TiAlN coatings and cemented carbide substrates. Additionally, the basic principles of the wear mechanisms and <b>wear</b> <b>types</b> that are specific to drilling have been reviewed. During the experimental procedures both solid and exchangeable tip drills from cemented carbide with multilayered PVD TiAlN coatings were tested. Two series of tests were conducted, the first series aimed to identify <b>wear</b> <b>type</b> dependency on cutting speed, focusing on wear of the tool margin. The second test series was performed to map the wear progression depending on distance. Analyses including identification the main wear mechanism, quantification the amount of wear, identify wear location on the tool, crack investigation and WDS analysis of chemical wear. Adhesive coating wear was found on the tool margin at an early stage. The adhesive wear rapidly progressed into a stable intermediate stage. Leaving the substrate exposed and more susceptible to other <b>wear</b> <b>types</b> resulting in crack and oxide layer formation. ...|$|R

40|$|Scale-sensitive fractal {{analysis}} of high-resolution 3 -dimensional surface reconstructions of wear patterns has advanced our knowledge in evolutionary biology, and {{has opened up}} opportunities for translatory applications in clinical practice. To elucidate the microwear characteristics of attrition and erosion in worn natural teeth, we scanned 50 extracted human teeth using a confocal profiler at a high optical resolution (X–Y, 0. 17 μm; Z < 3 nm). Our hypothesis was that microwear complexity would be greater in erosion and that anisotropy would be greater in attrition. The teeth were divided into 4 groups, including 2 <b>wear</b> <b>types</b> (attrition and erosion) and 2 locations (anterior and posterior teeth; n = 12 for each anterior group, n = 13 for each posterior group) for 2 tissue types (enamel and dentine). The raw 3 -dimensional data cloud was subjected to a newly developed rigorous standardization technique to reduce interscanner variability {{as well as to}} filter anomalous scanning data. Linear mixed effects (regression) analyses conducted separately for the dependent variables, complexity and anisotropy, showed the following effects of the independent variables: significant interactions between <b>wear</b> <b>type</b> and tissue type (P = 0. 0157 and P = 0. 0003, respectively) and significant effects of location (P < 0. 0001 and P = 0. 0035, respectively). There were significant associations between complexity and anisotropy when the dependent variable was either complexity (P = 0. 0003) or anisotropy (P = 0. 0014). Our findings of greater complexity in erosion and greater anisotropy in attrition confirm our hypothesis. The greatest geometric means were noted in dentine erosion for complexity and dentine attrition for anisotropy. Dentine also exhibited microwear characteristics that were more consistent with <b>wear</b> <b>types</b> than enamel. Overall, our findings could complement macrowear assessment in dental clinical practice and research and could assist in the early detection and management of pathologic tooth wear. S. Ranjitkar, A.

Various pump types demonstrate different tribological systems under abrasive wear, which are basically dominated by sliding, jet, and stamping <b>wear</b> <b>types.</b> The morphological approach yields an understanding of why wear attacks {{have to be considered}} predominantly. Chances and limitations for wear and endurance prediction based on tribometric simulation are discussed. As quantitative prediction is not always possible, the method of relative suitability {{turns out to be a}} good tool. As experience shows predominant jet and sliding wear in pumps, these two <b>wear</b> <b>types</b> are discussed closer. A good example for a tribological system dominated by sliding wear is the progressing cavity pump. Several tribological simulations, including parameter studies are discussed, evaluated, and compared that demonstrate strategies for pump improvements. Jet wear dominated tribological systems are special clearances in rotary pumps that are discussed with respect to wear phenomena and tribological simulation. Furthermore, methods of wear prediction for centrifugal pumps in general, based on parameter studies with jet tribometers, are explained. The discussion is ended with an extended analysis of various materials, different steel, and sintered types in solid or layered along with plastics for application in pumps against hydroabrasive wear, following the method of relative suitability based on tribometric data for jet and sliding wear...|$|R
