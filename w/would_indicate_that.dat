5|$|The {{possible}} Sinosauropteryx specimen GMV2124 (Sinosauropteryx?sp.) {{was found}} with three mammal jaws in its gut region. Hurum, Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska (2006) identified two of these jaws as belonging to Zhangheotherium and the third to Sinobaatar, showing that these two mammals {{were part of the}} animal's diet. Zhangheotherium is known to have had a spur on the ankle, like the modern platypus, which <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> Sinosauropteryx fed on possibly venomous mammals.|$|E
5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this reason, {{it is not necessary to}} attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  1, a {{comparison}} of managers’ perception for tourists’ expectation and the tourists’ themselves expectation. The result indicted that, the overall Gap 1 score was − 0.583, which <b>would</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> managers {{do not have a}} good understanding of tourist expectation. This finding contrasts with previous studies (Nel and Pitt 1993; Tsang and Qu 2000) but consistent with past research (Choy et al. 1986; Wei et al. 1989).|$|R

50|$|He was {{stroke of}} the school's crew in the Head of the River (this <b>would</b> usually <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> {{he was the}} best oarsman); and, in October 1921, he weighed 10 st 13 lbs (69.5 kg).|$|R
5|$|The British {{official}} casualty return gave 15 killed, 46 {{wounded and}} 30 missing. As was often done in casualty returns with officers (but not with enlisted men), Lieutenant King of Royal Artillery and Lieutenant Lamont of the 49th {{were included in}} the “wounded” category although they were also taken prisoner. The Americans took 34 prisoners, including Lamont and King, which <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> two of the enlisted men who were thought to have been killed were in fact captured. This gives a revised British loss (with Lamont and King counted among the prisoners rather than the wounded) of 13 killed, 44 wounded and 34 captured.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} of the 1219 treaty with Galicia–Volhynia {{it is noted that}} Mindaugas took {{the wife of}} Vismantas from the Bulionis family for himself. It is assumed that Vismantas' wife and Morta are the same woman. It is known that Vismatas died in 1252 in a battle against Mindaugas; however the date of Mindaugas and Morta's wedding is unknown. There is no consensus on how many children Morta had. The chronicles mention two sons, Replys and Gerstukas, in 1261. In 1263 two sons, Ruklys and Rupeikis, were assassinated together with Mindaugas. This is the only information available and historians disagree on whether these are the same two sons, whose name got distorted by scribes, or they are four sons. There is no data on any rivals to the crown after the assassination, except for Vaišvilkas and Tautvilas; it <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that,</b> whether there were two or four sons, they had perished in their youth.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic eruptions eject {{large amounts}} of carbon into the air. The carbon is of {{geological}} origin and has no detectable , so the / ratio {{in the vicinity of}} the volcano is depressed relative to surrounding areas. Dormant volcanoes can also emit aged carbon. Plants that photosynthesize this carbon also have lower / ratios: for example, plants on the Greek island of Santorini, near the volcano, have apparent ages of up to a thousand years. These effects are hard to predict– the town of Akrotiri, on Santorini, was destroyed in a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, but radiocarbon dates for objects recovered from the ruins of the town show surprisingly close agreement with dates derived from other means. If the dates for Akrotiri are confirmed, it <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the volcanic effect in this case was minimal.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} Table  1 show that, for most part, {{employees}} {{believed that their}} perception for delivery are more than tourists themselves perception except attributes 24 “Equipment and facilities are easy to use” (− 0.050) and attribute 26 “Variety of food and beverages meet guests’ needs” (− 0.050). In addition, the overall gap 10 score was 0.156, which <b>would</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the employees {{tend to have a}} good understanding of customer expectations. Therefore, from the results of positive gap 10 score, consequently, Gap 10 did not seem to a major problem of service quality in the hotel case as well.|$|R

5|$|On Friday 9 November, prostitute Mary Jane Kelly {{was murdered}} in the single room where she lived at 13 Miller's Court, behind 26 Dorset Street, Spitalfields. One of the earlier victims, Chapman, had lived in Dorset Street, and another, Eddowes, was {{reported}} to have slept rough there. Kelly's severely mutilated body was discovered shortly after 10:45am lying on the bed. The first doctor at the scene, Dr George Bagster Phillips, believed that Kelly was killed by a slash to the throat. After her death, her abdominal cavity was sliced open and all her viscera removed and spread around the room. Her breasts had been cut off, her face mutilated beyond recognition, and her thighs partially cut through to the bone, with some of the muscles removed. Unlike the other victims, she was undressed and wore only a light chemise. Her clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with the exception of some found burnt in the grate. Abberline thought the clothes had been burned by the murderer to provide light, as the room was otherwise only dimly lit by a single candle. Kelly's murder was the most savage, probably because the murderer had more time to commit his atrocities in a private room rather than in the street. Her state of undress and folded clothes have led to suggestions that she undressed herself before lying down on the bed, which <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> she was killed by someone she knew, by someone she believed to be a client, or when she was asleep or intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jackson {{was working with}} Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Films to {{purchase}} the film rights of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, while 20th Century Fox was trying to hire him for the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes. Jackson turned down Planet of the Apes and because Weinstein was taking longer than expected to buy The Lord of the Rings rights, Jackson decided {{to move forward on}} King Kong. Weinstein was furious, and, as a result, Jackson proposed a deal between Universal and Miramax that the two studios would equally finance King Kong with Jackson's production company Wingnut Films. Universal would receive distribution rights in the United States, while Miramax would cover foreign territories. Jackson was also warranted the right of final cut privilege, a percentage of the gross profits, as well as artistic control; Universal allowed all filming and visual effects to be handled entirely in New Zealand. The deal was settled in April 1996, and Jackson, along with wife Fran Walsh, began working on the King Kong script. In the original draft, Ann was the daughter of famed English archaeologist Lord Linwood Darrow exploring ancient ruins in Sumatra. They would come into conflict with Denham during his filming, and they would uncover a hidden Kong statue and the map of Skull Island. This <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the island natives were the last remnants of a cult religion that had once thrived on Asia's mainland. Instead of a playwright, Jack was the first mate and an ex-World War I fighter pilot still struggling with the loss of his best friend, who had been killed in battle during a World War I prologue. The camera-man Herb is the only supporting character in the original draft who made it to the final version. The fight between Kong and the three V. rex also changed from the original draft. In the draft, Ann is actually caught in the V. rex jaws, where she becomes wedged, and slashed by the teeth; after the fight, Kong gets her out but she is suffering from a fever, from which she then recovers.|$|E

25|$|H. Thomas Milhorn {{mentions}} {{a certain}} Englishman named William Maurice, convicted of piracy in 1241, {{as the first}} person {{known to have been}} hanged, drawn and quartered, which <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the then-ruling King Henry III took an especially severe view of this crime.|$|E
50|$|However {{some years}} ago, the Jocelyn family vault at Kilcoo Parish Church in Bryansford, County Down, Northern Ireland was opened {{and it was}} {{discovered}} that it contained one more coffin than the number of grave markers <b>would</b> <b>indicate,</b> and <b>that</b> the extra coffin was unmarked. This may well be the grave of the unfortunate Bishop of Clogher.|$|R

50|$|Although the organisation's website {{claims to}} {{represent}} {{the views of the}} Saviour Sect in Islam, they do not claim that they themselves are the Saviour Sect, as this apparently would be ascribing purity to themselves and <b>would</b> also <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> they have knowledge of al-Ghayb (the unseen), which Muslims believe only Allah knows about.|$|R

25|$|The {{estimated}} {{return time}} for large earthquakes on the Mount Lebanon thrust is 15001750 years, although a shorter return time {{is also possible}} depending on the dating {{of the most recent}} sea-level highstand.

25|$|Bowling {{analysis}} (BA or OMRW): A shorthand notation {{consisting of}} a bowler's Overs, Maidens, Runs conceded and Wickets taken (in that order), usually for a single innings but sometimes for other periods. For example, an analysis of 10–3–27–2 <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the player bowled ten overs, of which three were maidens, conceded 27 runs and took two wickets.|$|E

A reaction of the cis isomer of 2-methylcyclopropyl bromide with sec-butyllithium again followed by carboxylation with dry ice yielded cis-2-methylcyclopropylcarboxylic acid. The formation of the trans isomer <b>would</b> have <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the intermediate carbanion was unstable.|$|R

50|$|Forests in Vlaams-Brabant, Belgium, show {{evidence}} of extinction debt remaining from deforestation that occurred between 1775 and 1900. Detailed modeling of species behavior, based on similar forests in England {{that did not}} experience deforestation, showed that long-lived and slow-growing species were more common than equilibrium models <b>would</b> predict, <b>indicating</b> <b>that</b> their presence was due to lingering extinction debt.|$|R
25|$|The {{scholarly}} {{interpretation of}} the eagle being the Roman Empire (the eagle in the fifth vision, whose heads might be Vespasian, Titus and Domitian if such is the case) {{and the destruction of}} the temple <b>would</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the probable date of composition lies {{toward the end of the}} first century, perhaps 90–96, though some suggest a date as late as 218.|$|E
25|$|Around 115 BC, {{the embassy}} of Heliodorus from king Antialkidas {{to the court}} of the Sungas king Bhagabhadra in Vidisha is recorded.
