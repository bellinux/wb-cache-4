25|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{not always}} known whether a {{specific}} form is actually the official name of an institution, or <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>its</b> official name (e.g. whether the city of its location is part of the name). In addition, {{it is not}} always clear if a group is actually an institution in the sense of having been registered at the court, with a statute, a stamp, letter header etc. on its own. A third problem is {{the question of whether the}} spelling of an organization can be corrected if it is not written according to the above rule. In addition, adjectival forms derived from institution names are also often mistaken because people feel the need to distinguish them from genuine common names (especially if the name contains a fancy name that becomes identical with a common name if written in lowercase). Furthermore, it is unclear why cinemas are treated differently (see above) from theatres, cf. Művész mozi, but Magyar Színház.|$|E

40|$|London and the City of London are not {{the same}} place. London is a {{metropolis}} of 8 million people. The City of London is the famous square mile in the middle, with about 7, 000 residents but many more businesses. A Corporation older than Parliament, the City of London has played a key historical role in protecting and promoting the interests of finance capital. Secret City investigates the historical power wielded by the Corporation of London over British economic policy, through which it sustains London‘s prime position at the hub of global finance capital — not least through control {{of the majority of the}} world‘s tax havens. The film exposes the Corporation‘s anti-democratic constitution, the ancient laws which allow it function as a state within a state, and what happens to those who oppose it.
