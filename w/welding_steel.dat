5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost savings. In 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made <b>welding</b> <b>steel</b> more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E
25|$|The {{ships were}} used on an {{eastbound}} route from Bordeaux to Singapore (then in Japanese, thus Axis, hands) with cargoes of mercury, steel and aluminum bars, <b>welding</b> <b>steel,</b> bomb prototypes, 20 mm guns, blueprints for tanks and bombsights, {{and up to}} a dozen passengers. Return trip loadings were 110-155 tons of rubber, 44-70 tons of zinc, five tons of tungsten, two tons of quinine, two tons of opium, bamboo, rattan, and passengers. Comandante Cappellini, Reginaldo Giuliani, and Enrico Tazzoli departed Bordeaux in May 1943. The first two completed their voyages in July and August, but Enrico Tazzoli was destroyed by Allied bombers in the Bay of Biscay. Barbarigo was similarly destroyed during a June departure, but Luigi Torrelli reached Singapore in August.|$|E
500|$|Further {{developments}} in <b>welding</b> <b>steel</b> with GMAW {{led to a}} variation known as short-circuit transfer (SCT) or short-arc GMAW, in which the current is lower than for the globular method. As {{a result of the}} lower current, the heat input for the short-arc variation is considerably reduced, making it possible to weld thinner materials while decreasing the amount of distortion and residual stress in the weld area. As in globular welding, molten droplets form on the tip of the electrode, but instead of dropping to the weld pool, they bridge the gap between the electrode and the weld pool {{as a result of the}} lower wire feed rate. [...] This causes a short circuit and extinguishes the arc, but it is quickly reignited after the surface tension of the weld pool pulls the molten metal bead off the electrode tip. This process is repeated about 100 times per second, making the arc appear constant to the human eye. This type of metal transfer provides better weld quality and less spatter than the globular variation, and allows for welding in all positions, albeit with slower deposition of weld material. Setting the weld process parameters (volts, amps and wire feed rate) within a relatively narrow band is critical to maintaining a stable arc: generally between 100 and 200 amperes at 17 to 22 volts for most applications. Also, using short-arc transfer can result in lack of fusion and insufficient penetration when welding thicker materials, due to the lower arc energy and rapidly freezing weld pool. Like the globular variation, it can only be used on ferrous metals.|$|E

Abstract:The <b>welded</b> <b>steel</b> structure {{is used as}} the research object in this paper. On the basis of numerical analysis of <b>welded</b> <b>steel</b> structure in 3 -D residual stress field, the predicted method of the fatigue strength and S-N curve for <b>welded</b> <b>steel</b> structure is set using the volume method of the critical distance theory. The fatigue strength and S-N curve of the typical the <b>welded</b> <b>steel</b> structure including butt, misaligned welded and T-shape joints are got through theory prediction. The predicted value coincides with the experimental value. This method can be reduced fatigue test, saved funds and provided reference for engineering application...|$|R

2500|$|Cappellini (pennant number CL) was {{launched}} 14 May 1939 {{as the first}} boat of the [...] "improved Marcello class". [...] After an unsuccessful war patrol in the Mediterranean, Cappellini sailed on 29 September 1940 and passed the Strait of Gibraltar on 5 October for an Atlantic patrol to Bordeaux on 5 November. Cappellini sank one ship en route to Bordeaux and two ships on its first BETASOM patrol. [...] After unsuccessful patrols from 16 April to 20 May, 29 June to 6 July, and 17 November to 29 December 1941, Cappellini sank two ships on its fifth BETASOM patrol. [...] During the following patrol, Cappellini participated in rescue operations of the Laconia incident. [...] After another unsuccessful patrol, Cappelini was converted to a transport submarine. [...] Cappellini sailed on 11 May and reached Singapore on 13 July 1943 with 160 tons of mercury, aluminum, <b>welding</b> <b>steel,</b> 20mm guns, ammunition, bomb prototypes, [...] bombsights and tank blueprints. [...] Cappellini was seized by Germany following the Italian armistice of September 1943 and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine as UIT-24. [...] UIT-24 was then seized by the Imperial Japanese Navy following German surrender in May 1945 and renamed I-503. I-503 was found at Kobe when Japan surrendered and scuttled in Kii Suido by the United States Navy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{invention}} of a hedge-breaching device is generally credited to Curtis G. Culin, a sergeant in the 2nd Armored Division's 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. However, military historian Max Hastings notes that Culin {{was inspired by}} [...] "a Tennessee hillbilly named Roberts", who during a discussion about how to overcome the bocage, said [...] "Why don't we get some saw teeth {{and put them on}} the front of the tank and cut through these hedges?" [...] Rather than joining in the laughter that greeted this remark, Culin recognized the idea's potential. A prototype tusk-like assembly was created by <b>welding</b> <b>steel</b> scrap (from destroyed [...] "Czech hedgehogs") to the front of a tank to create a hedge cutter. The teeth helped prevent the vulnerable underside of the tank from being exposed while it knocked a hole in the hedgerow wall. On 14 July, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley inspected the tank and [...] "watched in awe as a hedgerow exploded... to make way for the Sherman bursting through". According to Hastings, Culin, [...] "an honest man", attempted to give credit to Roberts, but this was forgotten in the publicity surrounding the invention. Hastings concludes: [...] " [...] became a very American kind of national hero".|$|E

2500|$|While Andrew Carnegie and Thomas N. Miller {{spent the}} better part of the next year touring Europe, Thomas Carnegie flourished at the Union Iron Mills. The company {{struggled}} financially as the end of the Civil War led to sharp drops in the need for iron products, but Thomas proved to be a warm and friendly executive where his brother was cold and austere. Thomas' ability to make friends allowed the firm to receive numerous contracts and even infusions of capital when needed, and it is unlikely the company would have survived without him. Andrew wrote to Thomas extensively from Europe, constantly criticizing his business decisions, providing him with micromanaging instructions, and generally demeaning him. From Europe, Andrew also badgered Thomas to make improvements to their home in America, and decided to call the rapidly expanding mansion [...] "Fairfield." [...] But Thomas' judgment could prove wiser than Andrew's. In July 1865, Andrew Carnegie became fascinated with the [...] "Dodd process," [...] a new English method of <b>welding</b> <b>steel</b> facing to iron railroad rails, and despite Tom's misgivings he purchased the American patent for the process. But the process proved unworkable, and despite additional investments and retooling of the mill additional rails proved just as brittle and breakable as the first. Thomas advised him to conserve his money, but Andrew purchased yet another steel welding patent to try to fix the process. That, too, failed and soon Carnegie's steel-welding business was bankrupt. Thomas correctly foresaw that Andrew too easily believed his judgment was infallible, and soon a coal mining process Andrew had purchased also led to significant financial losses.|$|E

50|$|The MAPP/oxygen flame is {{not entirely}} {{appropriate}} for <b>welding</b> <b>steel,</b> due to the high concentration of hydrogen in the flame - higher than acetylene, but lower {{than any of the}} other petroleum fuel gases. The hydrogen infuses into the molten steel and renders the welds brittle. For small-scale welding with MAPP this is not a serious problem, as the hydrogen escapes readily, and MAPP/oxygen can in practice be used for welding small steel parts.|$|E
50|$|Thermite can be {{used for}} quickly cutting or <b>welding</b> <b>steel</b> such as rail tracks, without {{requiring}} complex or heavy equipment. However, defects such as slag inclusions and voids (holes) are often present in such welded junctions and great care is needed to operate the process successfully. Care must also be taken to ensure that the rails remain straight, without resulting in dipped joints, which can cause wear on high speed and heavy axle load lines.|$|E
5000|$|Stud welding, {{also known}} as [...] "drawn arc stud welding", joins a stud and another piece of metal {{together}} by heating both parts with an arc.
