Who am I? <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> I going? What {{does it all}} mean?

Jon Peters {{reworked}} the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst {{to create a}} [...] model of the cathedral. This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: [...] "Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> I going?' 'We'll talk about it {{when you get to}} the top!' I had to tell him that I didn't know." ...|$|E

2500|$|The second show I {{ever saw}} of the Descendents {{was at the}} Dancing Waters in San Pedro. They broke into the set and he was playing guitar so hard and so angry that his pants fell down. He was an odd character, for sure. I can {{remember}} standing in line at a Misfits show {{and all of a}} sudden he just sat down on the ground and started holding his head like his ears were ringing or something, and said something to the effect of [...] "What am I doing here? <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> I?"

2500|$|The {{second season}} of Dusty, which {{featured}} her rendition of [...] "Get Ready" [...] and her UK No.13 hit, [...] "I'll Try Anything", was broadcast in 1967. It attracted a healthy audience but the series {{did not keep}} up with changes in pop music. The comparatively progressive album <b>Where</b> <b>Am</b> I Going? (October 1967) attempted to redress this by containing a [...] "jazzy", orchestrated version of [...] "Sunny" [...] and Jacques Brel's [...] "If You Go Away". Though it was critically appreciated, it did not sell well in the US – it reached the top40 in the UK. In November 1968, a similar fate befell Dusty... Definitely, which was not issued in the US, it reached the UK top30. Her choice of material ranged from the rolling [...] "Ain't No Sun Since You've Been Gone" [...] to the aching emotion of [...] "I Think It's Gonna Rain Today". In that same year, Springfield had a UK No.4 hit, [...] "I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten", which was written by Clive Westlake. Its flipside, [...] "No Stranger Am I", was co-written by Norma Tanega and Norma Kutzer. By late 1966, Springfield was in a domestic relationship with Tanega – a US-born singer-songwriter who had a UK Top30 hit with the novelty song, [...] "Walkin' My Cat Named Dog". Springfield's ITV series It Must Be Dusty was broadcast in May and June 1968, episode six featured a duet performance of [...] "Mockingbird" [...] with singer-guitarist Jimi Hendrix fronting his band, The Experience.|$|E
2500|$|Mina {{is alone}} in the churchyard; she despairs of her {{situation}} (Aria: (Oh Cielo, dove son'io? / [...] "O Heaven. [...] <b>Where</b> <b>am</b> I?"). [...] When Godvino enters, she demands {{to be left alone}} and her ring be returned. [...] He declares his love and insists upon staying to defend her while she proclaims that she hears her mother's voice coming from her tomb (Aria: Ah, dal sen di quella tomba / [...] "Ah, from the depths of that tomb there echoes a sinister trembling"). [...] Egberto comes across the couple, sends Mina away, and then confronts Godvino, offering him the choice of two proffered swords. [...] Godvino refuses to take one. [...] The older man continues to press him ("Are you dead to any sense of honour?"), accusing him of cowardice and stating that he will reveal him to be a bastard. [...] At that remark, Godvino accepts the challenge and the two men fight until interrupted by the arrival of Aroldo. [...] Stating that [...] "I speak in the name of God", Aroldo tries to force the two men to stop their fighting. [...] In disarming him, he takes Godvino's hand only to have Egberto question how Aroldo can take the hand of the very man who has betrayed him. [...] With Mina's return, Aroldo finally realizes the truth (Aria: Ah no! è impossibile / [...] "Ah no! [...] It is impossible. [...] Tell me at least that I have been mistaken"). Finally, Egberto insists that Aroldo must punish the right person and not Mina, and Aroldo attempts to return Godvino's sword and commence fighting him. [...] Godvino refuses. [...] With Briano's arrival and his attempts to calm his friend ("my heart has lost everything", Aroldo cries, while the chorus of praying parishioners can be heard coming from the church), all join in a plea for forgiveness. [...] Aroldo collapses.|$|E
