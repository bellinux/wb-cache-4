To maintain {{the integrity of the}} original building, the brick exterior of the Old Courthouse was left undisturbed. Some leniencies were allowed in order for current building codes to be met; however, strict requirements, as set out by Alberta Historical Resources, were followed when it came to restoring and renovating the original courtroom, which now serves as Council Chambers. The wood panelling covering {{the lower half of the}} walls needed to remain intact, as did the original cast iron radiators (which now tie in to the geothermal heating and cooling system). The only changes made to the courtroom were the restoration of the <b>wall</b> <b>paint</b> to its original 1920 splendour and the installation of a new carpet. The result of this renovation was a fabulous new City Hall that provides both employees and citizens the opportunity to showcase this beautiful community structure.|$|E
500|$|Central and {{parallel}} to the SDSU student protest movement was an 8 foot high wooden construction fence that encircled the a new campus building. Students quickly put up protest messages, paintings, and cartoons urging students to rally, vote, and challenge the school president. Citing a need to [...] "clean up" [...] the campus during graduation of 1991, President Day attempted to paint over the now symbolic construction fence wall. The night before the attempted <b>wall</b> <b>paint</b> over by President Day, a large police force arrested eight students peacefully {{sitting in front of}} the wall. The next morning, word quickly gathered on campus about the arrests and dozens of student rushed to sit in front of the wall ultimately stopping the painters.|$|E

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 6, 677, 000 apartment housing units in South Korea. Exterior <b>wall</b> <b>painting</b> for such multi-dwelling apartment housings in South Korea represents a typical area to which construction automation {{technology can be}} applied for improvement in safety, productivity, quality, and cost over the conventional method. The conventional exterior <b>wall</b> <b>painting</b> is costly and labor-intensive, and it especially exposes workers to significant health and safety risks. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to design a conceptual model of an exterior <b>wall</b> <b>painting</b> robot which is applicable to apartment housing construction and maintenance, and to conduct its technical?economical feasibility analyses. In this study, a design concept using a high ladder truck is proposed as the best alternative for automation of the exterior <b>wall</b> <b>painting.</b> Conclusions made in this study show that the proposed exterior <b>wall</b> <b>painting</b> robot is technically and economically feasible, and can greatly enhance safety, productivity, and quality compared to the conventional method. Finally, it is expected that the conceptual model of the exterior <b>wall</b> <b>painting</b> robot would be efficiently used in various applications in exterior wall finishing and maintenance of other architectural and civil structures such as commercial buildings, towers, and high-rise storage tanks...|$|R

50|$|In {{the older}} days russ often {{traveled}} around {{in an open}} lorry, either used as-is or with a self-made log cabin added to the cargo area. Today, groups of russ commonly go together to buy a russ van. In eastern Norway, such as the capital Oslo, the posh suburb of Bærum, and other surrounding cities and areas, russ often choose to have a full-scale bus. Russ vans are typically 15- to 20-year-old Volkswagen Caravelles or Chevy Vans. The vehicle is painted in their respective russ colour, either by having it professionally sprayed or with regular <b>wall</b> <b>paint.</b> Decals and other decorations are common.|$|E
50|$|Owing {{to their}} long {{evolutionary}} history, the Ascomycota have evolved {{the capacity to}} break down almost every organic substance. Unlike most organisms, {{they are able to}} use their own enzymes to digest plant biopolymers such as cellulose or lignin. Collagen, an abundant structural protein in animals, and keratin—a protein that forms hair and nails—, can also serve as food sources. Unusual examples include Aureobasidium pullulans, which feeds on <b>wall</b> <b>paint,</b> and the kerosene fungus Amorphotheca resinae, which feeds on aircraft fuel (causing occasional problems for the airline industry), and may sometimes block fuel pipes. Other species can resist high osmotic stress and grow, for example, on salted fish, and a few ascomycetes are aquatic.|$|E

50|$|In 1924, Skurjeni {{commenced}} copying oleographs, making drawings on {{packing paper}} and coloring it with <b>wall</b> <b>paint.</b> These oleographs primarily contained religious images. At this time, Skurjeni was still considered a craftsman {{rather than a}} professional painter. In 1945, Skurjeni joined a Workers’ Cultural Society headed by Vinko Jeđut that hosted evening courses funded by its instructors. The classes, which lasted until 1949, sought to instruct individuals about formal artistic techniques and initiate artists to the socialist realist movement. Skurjeni’s paintings from this time period certainly reflect the movement, including figures with a more regular and proportionate anatomy, such as oval shaped heads. The Cultural-Educational Societies of Zagreb’s art sections considered Skurjeni’s art too primitive, however, and it was never exhibited in their shows in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the same}} year, {{he could spend}} his nights {{painting}} his first murals in lower Manhattan, which quickly earned him to be noticed by street art lovers. However at this time already, he had chosen to work with <b>wall</b> <b>paint</b> rather than spray paint, {{which is why he}} described his work as painting rather than graffiti. Since the mid 80s, he is part of a circle of iconic artists who greatly renewed the New York art scene, alongside the [...] "godfather of street art" [...] Richard Hambleton. Keith Haring taught him how to stretch canvas; Francesco Clemente showed him the use of watercolor; from Ross Bleckner he learned how to work with beeswax and [...] "encaustic painting"; Donald Baechler inspired him with his strong sense of form simplicity; and Brice Marden told him about the use of the [...] "Line" [...] in painting.|$|E
50|$|That {{decision}} {{involved a}} complete re-roofing in slate, an extended re-working of the masonry, a rebuilding {{of the front}} porch and gutters, the building and installation of 493 windows, from 8' to 24' in height, according to the designs of the original windows (still in place at that time), a total re-wiring of the building, new and extended plumbing, new and extended labs, the installation of two new elevators, replacement of most wall surfaces, new heating and pipes, new dire-security systems, new wood flooring in many areas - and professional attention to replacing, in public areas, copies of the original gas-light fixtures. Layers of <b>wall</b> <b>paint</b> were scraped through to find the original colors and designs, and these were replicated. Along the way, it became possible to furnish public areas with antique furniture appropriate to the period, the generous gift of Mr. Richard Driehaus from his collection.|$|E

50|$|The {{terminal}} is home of {{the largest}} mural created during the Roosevelt-era Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project. Created by New York artist James Brooks, the mural, Flight, encircles the upper rotunda walls, {{telling the story of}} man's conquest of the heavens up through 1942 when the work was completed. During the 1950s, many WPA artists were thought to be in collusion with Communists. Several works of art that had been created for post offices and other public facilities were therefore destroyed. Likewise, Flight was completely painted over with <b>wall</b> <b>paint</b> by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey. In the late 1970s, Geoffrey Arend, an aviation historian and author of Great Airports: LaGuardia, mounted a campaign to restore the mural to its original splendor. With the help of Brooks, LaGuardia Airport manager Tim Peirce, and donations from Reader's Digest founders DeWitt Wallace and Laurance Rockefeller, Flight was rededicated in 1980.|$|E

Some architects from the Seidler office saved the Utzon artwork from being destroyed (traced <b>wall</b> <b>paint</b> outline and removed the porcelain cylinders). This Lin Utzon artwork featured at Museum of Sydney during a Harry Seidler exhibition in late 2014-15, and in 2016 was reassembled to Seidler office penthouse, Milsons Point. A Charles O. Perry sculpture [...] "30” Helix Mobius Mace" [...] (1988) was also part of Capita's executive floor on level 31, but when the executive floor was gutted, the sculpture was moved to the building basement. The Perry sculpture was later relocated to the building's entry lobby as part of the ground floor enhancements of 2011.|$|E
