25|$|The {{prevailing}} {{weather pattern}} in the Middle Ohio Valley from 1350–1600 CE <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> wet, followed by a period of frequent drought. In contrast, the upper Ohio Valley experienced milder weather patterns. The frequency of droughts in West Virginia increased in the following decades. Drought frequency during 1250-1400 CE is unknown. North of the Allegheny Plateau, the Till Plains were less affected by drought.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog {{was only}} recorded in pristine rainforests {{where the only}} form of human disturbance was poorly defined walking tracks. As with the southern gastric-brooding frog, the northern gastric-brooding frog was also a largely aquatic species. They were found {{in and around the}} shallow sections of fast flowing creeks and streams where individuals were located in shallow, rocky, broken-water areas, in cascades, riffles and trickles. The water in these streams <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> clear, and the frogs hid away beneath or between boulders in the current or in backwaters.|$|E
25|$|This {{process was}} later {{performed}} on the human body (in {{the image on the}} left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, most of {{the winters}} were milder and usually wetter than average with daytime {{temperatures}} going below freezing a rare occurrence. In fact, the winter of 1995/1996 {{was the only one}} which was defined as below average in terms of the UK as a whole, although February 1991 saw heavy snowfall & January 1997 was cold in the South. The winters of 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11 have however seen a different pattern with these three winters being defined as below or well below average with large snowfall amounts widespread and very low temperatures; {{this was the first time}} three consecutive cold winters in the UK have occurred since the 1960s. Since the winter of 2012/2013, winters have been mild (exceptionally so in 2013/2014 and 2015/2016), although exceptionally wet. The winter of 2014/2015 was an oddity, in that it was generally quiet and sunny. December 2014 & January 2015 were a little milder than the average, February 2015 was close to normal. The winter of 2016/17 was very nearly a very cold winter owing to the presence and position of high pressure, although ultimately only November 2016 was cold widely as a whole. Early December 2016 <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> January 2017 was cold in the south-east, with much of the rest of England and Wales near the 1961-1990 average. At Northolt, the average minimum for January 2017 was below freezing for the first time since December 2010.|$|E

Hill said he replied, [...] "Nothing," [...] and that Silcott said, [...] "Well, you can go." [...] He said {{the aim of the}} attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick. In 1991, he told Rose that, {{throughout}} the interview, the police were saying, [...] "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," [...] and [...] "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" [...] He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again.

500|$|... "Sad" [...] {{was written}} by Maroon 5's lead singer Adam Levine {{together}} with band's guitarist, Valentine. According to Valentine, {{the development of the}} song began one morning, [...] "before he was even awake" [...] he was dreaming of his living room's piano playing the melody. He further stated that it <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> he liked the chords to the verse. He later went to the studio where Levine had a concept for the song including couple of lines for the chorus. It was produced by Levine and Valentine together with Noah [...] "Mailbox" [...] Passovoy. For an interview with MTV News, Levine told that [...] "Sad" [...] is his most personal track on the album, although not revealed the inspiration behind it. The song was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles by Noah Passovoy while Eric Eylands served as engineering assistant. Serbian Ghanea mixed it at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach together with John Hanes and Phil Seaford who served as mixing engineer and mixing assistant respectively.|$|E

Kesha wanted the video to be [...] "different, a video that <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> random". The director, Piliero, {{came up with the}} idea for the video's mythological aspect saying, [...] "I had this idea running in my head with just the idea of unicorns, If I massacred unicorns, they could bleed rainbows. I'm a fan of violence and I'm always trying to find a way to make it OK." [...] While being interviewed Piliero spoke of the collaboration with Kesha, explaining her point of view on the video, [...] "Before we started filming, we had quite a few talks. She was adamant you can't back away from the crazy; everything about the idea she loved and she enforced the fact that she wanted to embrace every aspect of it and really go for it, On set, she was having fun. She was like, 'I want to lick a unicorn.' It was rad working with her because there definitely wasn't a sense of her feeling awkward about stuff or detached; no ego. It felt like we had worked together before." ...|$|E

500|$|Known {{for having}} refined pop tastes and technologically savvy productions, Rundgren had become {{increasingly}} interested in progressive rock sounds {{by the time}} he was enlisted to produce the New York Dolls' debut album. Consequently, his initial impression of the group was that of a humorous live act who were technically competent only by the standards of other unsophisticated New York bands. [...] "The Dolls weren't out to expand any musical horizons", said Rundgren, although he enjoyed Thunders' [...] "attitude" [...] and Johansen's charismatic antics onstage. Johansen referred to Rundgren as [...] "an expert on second rate rock 'n' roll", but also said the band was [...] "kind of persona non grata, at the time, with most producers. They were afraid of us, I don't know why, but Todd wasn't. We all liked him from Max's... Todd <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> he was a producer." [...] Sylvain, on the other hand, felt the decision to enlist him was based on availability, time, and money: [...] "It wasn't a long list. Todd was in New York and seemed like he could handle the pace." [...] Upon being hired, Rundgren declared that [...] "the only person who can produce a New York record is someone who lives in New York".|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{some of the}} Beatles {{defended the}} use of the Butcher photograph. Lennon said that it was [...] "as {{relevant}} as Vietnam" [...] and McCartney said that their critics were [...] "soft". However, this opinion was not shared by all band members. George Harrison said in The Beatles Anthology that he thought the whole idea [...] "was gross, and I also thought it was stupid. Sometimes we all did stupid things thinking it <b>was</b> <b>cool</b> <b>and</b> hip when it was naïve and dumb; {{and that was one of}} them." [...] In 2007 George Martin, the Beatles' producer, recalled that the cover had been the cause of his first strong disagreement with the band. He added: [...] "I thought it was disgusting and in poor taste … It suggested that they were madmen. Which they were, but not in that way." ...|$|E

As they spiral around the world and eventually space, Candace continues to try and bust them, even on the way home. The magnet is stopped, as Phineas and Ferb return home, Candace a second too late. Isabella says that was the best ride ever and she and Phineas talk about Perry and that he may lay an egg. Ferb burps from having peanut butter, which Isabella says <b>was</b> <b>cool,</b> <b>and</b> she leaves at that point. The episode ends with the roller coaster exploding in the boys' backyard tree and tin foil ball is seen rolling in the background setting.
