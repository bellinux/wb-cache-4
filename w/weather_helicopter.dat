50|$|Ground School Boot Camp is {{a one-week}} camp for {{students}} ages 12-17 which {{will serve as}} the beginning of their helicopter flight training. By the end of the week, each student will have accumulated 35 total hours of ground school from a certified flight instructor and will be logged and signed in their pilot logbook. Ground School Boot Camp is given classroom/lecture style which ground school is most commonly given, along with utilizing the museums exhibits and working helicopters for a hands-on experience and better understanding of lessons. Lessons include helicopter aerodynamics, airport operations, radio calls, <b>weather,</b> <b>helicopter</b> maneuvers, approaches and takeoffs, pilot certification process, navigation, aeronautical charts, and airspace, among others.|$|E
50|$|The Air Corps {{military}} {{roles and}} the functions it carries out {{are those of}} an air corps rather {{than that of a}} conventional military air force. The Air Corps air space control and ground attack capacity is limited to low level and limited <b>weather.</b> <b>Helicopter</b> tactical troop transport is available 24 hour basis through the introduction of Night Vision Goggles. The Air Corps non-military capabilities in aid to the civil power and other Government departments include ministerial transport, fishery protection, 24 hour maritime patrolling, Garda air support, search and rescue over both land and sea, an air ambulance service, aerial firefighting, drugs surveillance and non-combatant evacuation. The Air Corps provides the State with the capacity to meet security and contingent roles but only receives 12% of Defence Forces funding (see Dáil Defence Vote 2014).|$|E

40|$|System {{technology}} concepts for all <b>weather</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{operations in}} both remote and high density areas were examined. The SH- 36 {{was used to}} support the remote area investigations. The primary emphasis was {{on the development of}} advanced navigation concepts to allow rotorcraft to land in remote areas where there may not be a ground based navigational aid. The focus was on the used airborne weather radar, the use of high resolution radar and satellite based navigation concepts. The high density work was conducted using the UH- 1 H system that allows alternate guidance and navigation algorithms to be tested in flight...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{autonomous}} precision landing method for an unmanned helicopter {{based on an}} on-board visual navigation system consisting of a single pan-tilting camera, off-the-shelf computer hardware and inertial sensors. Compared to existing methods, the system doesn’t depend on additional sensors (in particular not on GPS), offers a wide envelope of starting points for the autonomous approach, and is robust to different <b>weather</b> conditions. <b>Helicopter</b> position and attitude is estimated from images of a specially designed landing pad. We provide results from both simulations and flight tests, showing {{the performance of the}} vision system and the overall quality of the landing. ...|$|R
50|$|Floatplane and {{helicopter}} {{traffic to}} and from Victoria's Inner Harbour (YWH) accounted for 261,712 passengers in 2010, making it the third busiest airport on Vancouver Island. Nanaimo Harbour (ZNA) also operates a busy water aerodrome. Much of the floatplane traffic is downtown-to-downtown service between these two and Vancouver Harbour, the primary carriers being Harbour Air, West Coast Air, and Baxter Aviation. Harbour Air also flies to other areas around Vancouver, service to Seattle's Lake Union is provided by Kenmore Air, and Orca Airways runs flights between Vancouver and Tofino Harbour. These carriers make several daily scheduled flights, <b>weather</b> permitting. <b>Helicopter</b> service is provided by Helijet in Victoria and various private operators elsewhere.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} week Dr Bindschadler {{and his team}} were able to arrive. Due to additional <b>weather</b> delays, the <b>helicopters</b> weren't able to arrive by the NSF 'drop dead' date and the field season was essentially cancelled. [...] Fortunately limited science was still accomplished by the team thanks {{to a series of}} flights by KBA back onto the glacier; its seems that conditions had changed drastically since the last twin otter flights.|$|R
50|$|Old Crow {{is served}} by Northwestel since 1971. The long {{distance}} connection originally relied on a microwave relay at Rat Pass near the Yukon/NWT border, which also provide a radio-telephone base station along the Dempster Highway, but it was frequently out of service in winter when <b>weather</b> conditions made <b>helicopter</b> access hazardous. In the late 1980s, a satellite ground station was installed in Old Crow, providing more reliable service.|$|R
5000|$|Stanley Peak (...) is {{a central}} summit in the Wilckens Peaks, rising to 1,265 m {{at the head of}} Fortuna Glacier, South Georgia. It was named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) after Lieutenant Commander (later Cdr.) Ian Stanley, Royal Navy, a {{helicopter}} pilot from HMS Antrim, who carried out a rescue operation in bad <b>weather</b> after two <b>helicopters</b> had crashed on Fortuna Glacier, April 21, 1982.|$|R
50|$|In the {{conversion}} to a helicopter-carrying vessel, Assiniboine was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fueling facilities for the helicopter and activated fin stabilizers installed. The fin stabilizers were to reduce roll in rough <b>weather</b> during <b>helicopter</b> operations. All seven St Laurents were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). The single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels {{to permit the}} forward extension of the helicopter hangar. To {{make room for the}} helicopter deck, the aft 3-inch mount and one of the Limbos were removed. The two 40 mm guns were also removed. Following {{the conversion}}, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to 3051 t.|$|R
5000|$|A {{review of}} minimum <b>weather</b> {{standards}} for <b>helicopter</b> flight should take place. The pilot was flying within BA regulations which {{state that the}} pilot is allowed to fly on visual if visibility is 900 metres. The pilots' union, BALPA, had recommended this distance be increased to 1 nmi km after a Bell 212 crashed in the North Sea in 1981. If this had been accepted, the flight would have been conducted under IFR using instruments.|$|R
50|$|In the mid 1950s, {{helicopters}} {{began to}} replace fixed-wing aircraft and supplement the marine craft {{in the search}} and rescue role, their ability to hover giving them an ability to recover survivors that fixed wing aircraft did not have. It {{was not until the}} 1960s, with the introduction of the Westland Wessex and later the Westland Sea King, it was possible to replace marine craft in all sea and <b>weather</b> conditions. <b>Helicopters</b> have the advantage of speed, which means that the same coverage as marine craft can be provided with far fewer bases and much reduced personnel numbers. However, even into the 1970s helicopters had not completely replaced RAF marine craft, however by this time the MCS craft were becoming increasingly elderly and service in the MCS increasingly unattractive.|$|R
50|$|On March 20, 2016, a Bell 412EP {{crashed in}} Poso {{district}} (Indonesia) while flying in adverse <b>weather</b> conditions. The <b>helicopter</b> {{was on a}} mission to capture the country's most wanted militant when it crashed and burst into flames. The helicopter was carrying 13 soldiers and crew when it went down about 35 minutes after taking off from Poso district's Watutau village, said Maj. Gen. Agus Surya Bakti, the regional military chief overseeing South and Central Sulawesi provinces. All 13 people on board died.|$|R
50|$|Rudy Israel Ortiz Ruiz (6 August 1963 - 20 August 2014) was a Guatemalan senior {{military}} officer and chief general {{until his death}} on 20 August 2014. Ortiz joined the Guatemalan Military in 1983 {{at the age of}} 20. In late August 2014, Ortiz, along with four other {{senior military}} officers took off in a helicopter that changed its flight path during bad <b>weather.</b> The <b>helicopter</b> crashed in Huehuetenango, near the capital of Guatemala and with the border of Mexico. It is unclear if the helicopter crashed naturally or was shot down due to flying over Huehuetenango which has a strong drug cartel presence. Ortiz {{died at the age of}} 51, and the President of Guatemala gave out a statement praising Ortiz's dedication to the military. Ortiz was planning to retire from the Guatemalan Military in 2015.|$|R
50|$|In the {{conversion}} to a helicopter-carrying vessel, Assiniboine was gutted except for machinery and some forward spaces. The hull was strengthened, fuelling facilities for the helicopter and activated fin stabilizers installed. The fin stabilizers were to reduce roll in rough <b>weather</b> during <b>helicopter</b> operations. All seven St Laurents were fitted with helicopter platforms and SQS 504 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS). St Laurent {{was equipped with}} VDS late in 1961, the helicopter platform to be added later. When ships were fitted with the helicopter platform, the single funnel was altered to twin stepped funnels to permit the forward extension of the helicopter hangar.

2500|$|Crew {{and patient}} safety {{is the single}} most {{important}} factor to be considered when deciding whether to transport a patient by <b>helicopter.</b> <b>Weather,</b> air traffic patterns, and distances (e.g., from trauma scene to closest level one trauma center) must also be considered. Another reason for cancelling a flight is based on Flight Crew comfort with the flight. The general rule of safety is upon the crew, when there is one pilot and two medical crew is: 3 to go, 1 to say [...] "NO". If one Flight Member is not comfortable with the flight for whatever reason, the flight is cancelled.|$|R
25|$|Rescue {{operations}} were immediately undertaken after {{it became clear}} that the plane had crashed, although efforts were hampered by the fact that the crash site was around two hours away from the closest location of police forces. Heavy rains in the area also led to the risk of flooding and landslides. Personnel from the Nepalese Army reached the site of the crash on foot, and were responsible for gathering bodies, but due to <b>weather</b> conditions, <b>helicopters</b> were forced to land more than a mile away. Authorities announced a reward of Rs. 50,000 for anyone who would find equipment that would help authorities discover the cause of the crash. By 2 September, both the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder of the crashed aircraft had been located; both were undamaged and were analysed by investigators in India. The government of Nepal formed a five-member panel to help determine the cause of the crash; the committee was instructed to submit a report on the crash within 65 days.|$|R
50|$|Vidal {{spent her}} career {{carrying}} out surveys for the Navy, and supporting scientific {{work for the}} British government. The development of the Cold War led the British government to decide to formally annex Rockall. This was authorised on 14 September 1955, with orders from Queen Elizabeth II transmitted to the Vidal detailing On arrival at Rockall you will effect a landing and hoist the Union flag on whatever spot appears most suitable or practicable and you will then take possession of the island on our behalf. The Vidal arrived in position the following day, but were unable to land any men as poor <b>weather</b> prevented the <b>helicopter</b> from flying.|$|R
50|$|When the {{transport}} {{is beyond the}} range of the <b>helicopter,</b> or when <b>weather</b> precludes flight to a location, a fixed-wing aircraft is called into service. Flight For Life partners with Mayo Aviation, Inc. at Centennial Airport in Englewood, Colorado for a dedicated Beechcraft Super King Air 200. This pressurized, twin turboprop aircraft is capable of instrument flight (IFR) at a speed of 265 nmi km per hour (knots), and is used for flights of up to approximately 800 mi round trip distance. The pilots are all proficient in multi-engine and instrument flight. Outfitted in a dedicated air medical configuration, the KingAir is capable of transporting any combination of two adult patients, one adult and an isolette, or two isolettes. On most flights, at least one family member is also able to fly along. The bases in Colorado Springs and Pueblo, Colorado do not have dedicated fixed-wing aircraft. When the <b>weather</b> makes <b>helicopter</b> flight impossible, the aircraft from Mayo Aviation may be sent to them to help move a critical patient. For trips beyond the KingAir’s range, Flight For Life Colorado uses a Learjet 35. This aircraft is capable of speeds of 440 kn.|$|R

The USCGC Northland and a MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter joined search efforts later that day. Aircraft on October 3 flew in violent hurricane conditions, characterized by winds in excess of 100 kn {{at an altitude of}} 1000 ft, waves up to 40 ft, and visibility less than [...] Despite the hazardous conditions, a helicopter crew recovered a life ring from the vessel on this day. Conditions markedly improved on October 4 as Joaquin moved northeast away from the Bahamas; winds averaged 15 kn and visibility was unlimited. Taking advantage of the clear <b>weather,</b> the <b>helicopter</b> remained in flight for 11 hours, requiring refueling twice. A second HC-130, the USCGC Charles Sexton, and the USCGC Resolute were deployed that day. Northland and Resolute continued operations overnight with engineers using night vision goggles {{to take part in the}} search. The United States Navy provided P-8 fixed wing aircraft to assist on October 5; three Crowley Maritime tugboats also joined. Search operations were conducted at a near-continuous pace by this date.|$|R
5|$|At 6:30AM, Israeli {{helicopters}} started landing {{the bulk}} of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh. An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town; however, due to difficult <b>weather</b> conditions, the <b>helicopters</b> flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with resistance by Fatah commandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery, the paratroopers suffered heavy losses. When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a Jordanian infantry brigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug-in Jordanians.
