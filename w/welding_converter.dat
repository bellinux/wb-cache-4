40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the influence of structural parameters of low-carbon steel on arcing process. Methodology. The values of the micro- and substructure characteristics of the electrode wire metal were changed by varying the parameters of heat treatment and cold deformation by drawing. The degree of plastic deformation was obtained by drawing blanks from different initial diameter to final dimension of 1 mm. The thermal treatment {{was carried out in}} electric chamber furnace of the SNOL- 1, 6. 2, 5. 1 / 11 -IZ type. The temperature was measured by chromel-alumel thermocouple and the electromotive force was determined using the DC potentiometer. In order to obtain the substructure of different dispersion degree the steel (after quenching from temperatures and tempering at 650 °C for 1 hour) was subjected to cold drawing to reduction 17 – 80 %. To form structure with different ferrite grain size the steel after drawing was annealed at 680 °C for 1 hour. The microstructure was examined under a light and electron transmission microscope UEMV- 100 K at the accelerating voltage 100 kV. The grain and subgrain sizes were evaluated using the methodologies of quantitative metallography. A <b>welding</b> <b>converter</b> of the PSG- 500 type was used to study the arc welding process of direct and reverse polarities. Findings. The experimentally detected value of the welding current, which depends on the degree of deformation during wire drawing, under conditions of stable arc burning of direct polarity is about an order of magnitude lower than the calculated value. Similar difference was found for the arc of reverse polarity: the experimental value of the welding current is 5 [...] . 6 times less than the calculated value. Dependence analysis shows that, regardless of the polarity of the welding arc, a good enough agreement between the calculated and experimental values of the welding current is limited to deformations of 60 %. For deformation degrees of more than 60 %, the differences are explained by qualitative changes in the dislocation cell structure. Originality. In the conditions of stable arcing of different polarity for the electrode of low-carbon steel, an extreme dependence of welding current on the degree of cold plastic deformation was observed. Practical value. Influence of ferrite grain size of electrode wire on the value of welding current is much greater than that from substructure presence...|$|E
50|$|In 1930, <b>welding</b> <b>converters</b> {{laid the}} {{foundation}} for Kjellberg’s worldwide success. The fundamentally new concept of these machines was the unification of all components under one housing, including control section and steerable carrier. Later, these converters were further developed into automatic welding machines. Experimental studies on automatic arc welding started in 1934. With the market launch of the automatic welding machines S I and S II in 1937, mechanised welding for industrial purposes was possible for the first time. Kjellberg offered three technological options for mechanised welding: with exchangeable electrode head for endless welding of rod electrodes, with welding head for bare wire coils and with carbon head for thin sheet welding.|$|R
40|$|In {{the casting}} of metals, tundish flow, <b>welding,</b> <b>converters,</b> and other metal {{processing}} applications, the behaviour of the fluid surface is important. In aluminium alloys, for example, oxides formed {{on the surface}} may be drawn {{into the body of}} the melt where they act as faults in the solidified product affecting cast quality. For this reason, accurate description of wave behaviour, air entrapment, and other effects need to be modelled, in the presence of heat transfer and possibly phase change. The authors have developed a single-phase algorithm for modelling this problem. The Scalar Equation Algorithm (SEA) (see Refs. 1 and 2), enables the transport of the property discontinuity representing the free surface through a fixed grid. An extension of this method to unstructured mesh codes is presented here, together with validation. The new method employs a TVD flux limiter in conjunction with a ray-tracing algorithm, to ensure a sharp bound interface. Applications of the method are in the filling and emptying of mould cavities, with heat transfer and phase change...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the performances of two controllers such as Hysteresis control (HC) and proportional integral (PI) control to control saturation level in the magnetic core of a welding transformer in a middle-frequency direct current (MFDC) resistance spot welding system(RSWS). It consists of an input <b>converter,</b> <b>welding</b> transformer, and a full-wave rectifier mounted at the transformer secondary. The unequal ohmic resistances of the two transformer’s secondary circuits and the different characteristics of the diodes of output rectifier certainly lead to the magnetic core saturation which, consequently, causes the unwanted spikes in the transformer’s primary current and over-current protection switch-off. The goal is to analyse the performance of both controllers in terms of transients, total harmonic distortion(THD) and variations in primary current and flux in the magnetic core of a welding transformer of highly nonlinear system of RSWS. The simulation study has been done in Matlab/Simulink environment and presented performance analysis. The responses shows that from the aforementioned aspects, proportional integral Controller is the better choice for controlling the saturation level in magnetic core of a welding transformer which is widely used in automobile industry welding system...|$|R

In the developing process the FE-models {{are one of the}} main tools and they {{are becoming more and more}} important in the automotive development. In the tough competition between the manufacturers, the demands for fast development require good FE-models both from the manufacturers and their subcontractors. The main goal of this thesis is to update an existing FE-model of a close coupled exhaust manifold and look at the catalyst to investigate the behavior of the catalytic converter and suggest a way to model the monolith. The thesis combines analytical calculations with experimental measurements. By the use of modal theory, an analytical model is updated to resemble the experimental data. The results of this thesis work include a description of an updated version of the FE-model of the exhaust manifold. It also includes one example of how to model the catalyst assembly. The model of the catalyst assembly has been validated. The initial Finite-Element model showed relatively large differences for the first four natural frequencies, when compared to experimental data. Relatively large amplitude errors were also obtained when comparing frequency response function from the experiment and the model. An acceptable error was obtained for the natural frequencies when comparing the experimental result and the updated Finite-Element Model. The updating was mainly done by changing the mass and stiffness in the <b>welds</b> and the <b>converter</b> tube...|$|R
40|$|Nesta pesquisa estudou-se a soldagem de materiais poliméricos por ultra-som, sendo estes, policarbonato (PC) e poli(metacrilato de metila, PMMA. As soldagens foram obtidas através do equipamento especifico para soldagem Soldadoras Integradas, série 900 IW, empresa BRANSON Ultrasonics Corporation. Onde detalhamos alguns aspectos do equipamento: mecanismo de soldagem, conversores, transformador e sonotrodo. Para o sonotrodo especificamos a relação de área em função da geometria do mesmo. Ressaltamos também os tipos de métodos de soldagem: direto e indireto, de forma que concluímos que os materiais semicristalinos devem ser soldados apenas pelo método direto em conseqüência destes apresentarem grande perda de {{amplitude}} durante a soldagem. Em função destes possuírem uma acentuada queda do módulo de cisalhamento (G) e um aumento no fator de perda mecânica Tang &# 948; acima da temperatura de transição vítrea (Tg), o que prejudica a soldagem. Foram analisados outros fatores que influem no processo de soldagem da junta como: tipos de juntas para uma melhor transmissão de energia, onde verificamos que juntas que possuem um D. R (diretor de energia) apresentam uma boa soldagem, diferente o que acontece com superfícies planas que apresentaram uma soldagem inadequada. Pesquisou-se também a propagação da onda no diretor de energia onde verificamos variações da amplitude através do mesmo. Estudou-se o método para estimar a capacidade de soldagem por ultra-som dos matérias através de fórmulas, onde verificou-se resultados coerentes com os valores reais. Experimentalmente variou-se os parâmetros de soldagem tais como: tempo de soldagem, pressão, e o tempo de recalque, com o intuito de obter-se variações na área soldada e na resistência ao cisalhamento das juntas. Os resultados apresentados pela variação dos parâmetros foram significativos, de modo, que o aumento do tempo de soldagem influenciou em um aumento da área das amostras em 90 % das soldagens realizadas, tanto para soldagens similar (de mesmo material) e dissimilar (de materiais diferentes). Com aumento da pressão de soldagem obtivemos resultados menos significativos, ou seja, verificamos que 86, 52 % das amostras com junção similar, aumentaram a área em função do aumento da pressão. Os outros 13, 48 % diminuíram a área soldada em função do aumento da pressão, fenômeno causado pela diferença de rechupe encontrado nas amostras injetadas. O aumento do tempo de recalque não apresentou variações de área e de resistência ao cisalhamento significativas. As amostras soldadas apresentam o fenômeno de esbranqueceamento da região unida, onde concluímos que a umidade presente {{no material}} e as microrugosidades presentes na superfície do mesmo, causam este fenômeno. O qual pode ser minimizado através de secagem do material antes da injeção. Mediu-se a área soldada, e a resistência ao cisalhamento de todos os tipos de juntas, de forma que obtivemos diferentes valores para cada tipo de material analisado (PMMA e PC) com junções similares (PMMA/PMMA e PC/PC), dissimilares (PMMA/PC) e com direções de injeção similares (HH, VV) e direção de injeção dissimilar (HV). Com estes resultados podemos aplicar o método estatístico de análise de variância em função da variação de área e da variação de resistência. Os resultados da análise de variância foram mais coerentes com os resultados experimentais em função do parâmetro tempo de soldagem. A análise de variância em função da pressão apresentou resultados menos significativos, comparado aos resultados experimentais. As juntas soldadas foram adaptadas da norma ASTM D 638 M, e para realização do teste de cisalhamento projetou-se um dispositivo especial para esta aplicação. In this research it was studied welding of polymerics materials by ultrasound, being these, polycarbonate (PC) and poli(metacrilate of metila, PMMA). The weldings had been gotten through the equipment specify for welding (Integrated Soldering, series 900 IW, company BRANSON Ultrasonics Corporation). Detail {{some aspects of}} the equipment: mechanism of <b>welding,</b> <b>converters,</b> transforming and sonotrode. For sonotrode we specify the relation of area in function of the geometry. Empathized also two types of welding methods: direct and indirect, then we conclude that the semi crystalline materials must be welded only by the direct method, in consequence of these materials to present great loss of amplitude during the welding. In function of these to possess one accented fall of the module of shear (G) and an increase in the mechanics loss factor (Tang &# 948;), above of the glass transition temperature (Tg), these factors it harms the welding. Other factors had been analyzed that influence in the process of welding of the joining, as: geometric of joining for one better transmission of energy, where we verify that joining that possess a D. R (director of energy) these present a good welding, different of others joining with plain surfaces that had presented an inadequate welding. The propagation of the wave in the energy director was also searched where we verify variations of the amplitude through D. R. The method was studied for estimate of the capacity of welding for ultrasound of the materials through formulas, where it was verified coherent resulted with the real results. Experimentally varied the welding parameters such as: welding time, pressure, and the time pressure after welding, with intention to get variations in the welded area and the shear strength of the joining. The results presented for the variation of the parameters had significant, in way, that the increase of the welding time influenced in an increase of the area of the samples in 90 % of the carried through weldings, as much for weldings similar (of same material) and dissimilar (of different materials). With increase of the welding pressure we got resulted less significant, or either, we verify that 86. 52 % of the samples with similar junction, had increased the area in function of the increase of the pressure. The others 13. 48 % had diminished the area welded in function of the increase of the pressure, phenomenon caused for the difference of contraction found in the injected samples. The increase of the time of the time pressure after welding did not present variations of area and significant shear strength. The welded samples present the phenomenon of change of color of the joined region, where we conclude that the present humidity in the material and the microrugosidades of the surface causes this phenomenon. The change color can be minimized through drying of the material before the injection. It measured welded area, and the shear strength of all the types of joining, and this form we got different values of area and of shear strength for each type of material analyzed (PMMA and PC) with similar junctions (PMMA/PMMA and PC/PC) and dissimilar (PMMA/PC) with similar directions of injection (HH, VV) and direction of dissimilar injection (HV). With these results we can apply the statistical method of analysis of variance in function of the variation of area and in function of the variation of resistance. The results of the variance analysis had been more coherent with the experimental results in function of the parameter welding time. The analysis of variance in function of the pressure presented resulted less significant, comparative to the experimental results. The welded joining had been adapted according to norm ASTM D 638 M, and for development of the shear test a special device for this application was projected...|$|R
