5|$|A {{number of}} lessons had been {{learned from the}} 1856 {{disaster}} that allowed the Church to continue the handcart system while avoiding another disaster. Never again would a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.|$|E

5|$|Pickford {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Adolph Zukor in June 1916. Among the agreements in the contract was that she <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> producing her own films {{and they would be}} distributed through a special division of Paramount Pictures called Artcraft. Pickford made 13 films for Artcraft of which 11 survive complete.|$|E

5|$|Article One {{came within}} one {{state of the}} number needed to become adopted into the Constitution on two {{occasions}} between 1789 and 1803. Despite coming close to ratification early on, it has never received the approval of enough states {{to become part of}} the Constitution. As Congress did not attach a ratification time limit to the article, it is still technically pending before the states. Since no state has approved it since 1792, ratification by an additional 27 states <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> necessary for the article to be adopted.|$|E
5|$|By 1967 {{the debate}} over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in {{newspapers}} and magazines. It {{was in the midst}} of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way to deflect criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} shootdown, South Korea, {{owner of the}} {{aircraft}} and therefore prime considerant for jurisdiction, designated the United States and Japan as search and salvage agents, thereby making it illegal for the Soviet Union to salvage the aircraft, providing it was found outside Soviet territorial waters. If it did so, the United States <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> legally entitled to use force against the Soviets, if necessary, to prevent retrieval of {{any part of the}} plane.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August 2010, {{it emerged}} {{that the new}} owners King Power wanted to rename the stadium The King Power Stadium, and had plans to {{increase}} the capacity to 42,000 should Leicester secure promotion. On 7 July 2011, Leicester City confirmed the Walkers Stadium <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> known as the King Power Stadium. In 2015, vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha stated plans were in place to increase {{the capacity of the}} stadium to around 42,000. Relocation to a bigger stadium has also been considered.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{originally}} scheduled for completion in April 1945, but construction was expedited after the defeat at the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944 as the IJN {{anticipated that the}} United States <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> able to bomb Japan with long-range aircraft from bases in the Mariana Islands. The builder was unable {{to increase the number}} of workers on Shinano and could not meet the new deadline of October. Even so, the pressure to finish as quickly as possible led to poor workmanship by the workforce.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} this strength, {{the storm}} slowed and gradually {{took a more}} northwesterly course, heading towards Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba. On September16, the system attained winds of 75mph (120km/h), what <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> considered a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Moving at a slow pace of , the system gradually intensified. Late on September18, {{the center of the}} storm was estimated to have made landfall in Pinar del Río Province with winds of 100mph (155km/h); an atmospheric pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg) was recorded during its passage. The storm's eye passed over the town of Manta for four hours, between 3:00pm and 7:00pm on September17.|$|E

5|$|Although the 1940 Olympic Games {{could not}} be held due to war, Brundage sought to {{organize}} Western Hemisphere games that {{might be able to}} proceed despite the troubled international climate. Brundage was one of the leaders in the founding of the Pan-American Games, participating in the initial discussions in August 1940 in Buenos Aires. On his return, he arranged for the American Olympic Association to be renamed the United States of America Sports Federation (USASF), which would organize the United States Olympic Committee (as the AOC <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> called) and another committee to see to American participation in the Pan-American Games. Brundage became an early member of the international Pan-American Games Commission, although the inaugural event in Buenos Aires was postponed because of the war and was eventually held in 1951, with Brundage present. Despite his role in founding them, Brundage viewed the Pan-American Games as imitative, with no true link with antiquity.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the {{publication}} of Maximinus's first edict, perhaps in 307, Maximinus changed the penalty for transgressions. Instead of receiving the death penalty, Christians <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> mutilated and condemned to labor in state-owned mines. Since Egyptian mines were overstaffed, mostly due to the influx of Christian prisoners, Egyptian penitents were increasingly sent to the copper mines at Phaeno in Palestine and Cilicia in Asia Minor. At Diocaesarea (Tzippori, Israel) in the spring of 308, 97 Christian confessors were received by Firmilianus from the porphyry mines in the Thebaid. Firmilianus cut the tendons on their left feet, blinded their right eyes, and sent them to the mines of Palestine. On another occasion, 130 others received the same punishment. Some were sent to Phaeno, and some to Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{afternoon}} of 3 April, Moore considered conducting a further raid on Kaafjord the next day. He decided against doing so as the preliminary assessment of photos taken during the attack had concluded that Tirpitz was badly damaged. Moore was also aware that his aircrew were fatigued, and was reluctant to expose them to what <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> alert defences. Accordingly, he ordered that the fleet return to base, and it arrived at Scapa Flow in the afternoon of 6 April. King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill sent congratulatory messages to the fleet, but both Churchill and Cunningham were concerned that Tirpitz could be returned to service. Cunningham also regretted Moore's decision not to launch a further strike on 4 April.|$|E

5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Nova {{decided to}} launch a British reprint of the American {{magazine}} Science Fiction Adventures, under the same title. The British Science Fiction Adventures lasted until May 1963, when it was felled by declining sales. New Worlds, Nova's flagship title, and Science Fantasy were also suffering from poor sales, with circulation estimated at about 5,000, though a switch from bimonthly to a monthly schedule was also considered that year for Science Fantasy. In September Nova decided to close down both remaining titles, and {{in preparation for the}} change Carnell signed a contract in December 1963 to edit an original anthology series, New Writings in SF, for publisher Dennis Dobson. Readers' responses to news of the planned demise of the magazines included a letter from Michael Moorcock, published in the April 1964 New Worlds, asking how the British market <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> able to train writers to sell to the higher-paying U.S. magazines.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1970, {{the diamond}} was rated {{one of the}} thirty great stones {{of the world and}} placed on display at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York City. On 16 April 1970, the diamond was sold at auction for $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> $) to Edward J. Hand, a then 48-year-old {{trucking}} firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut. This was the second highest auction price ever for a diamond at that time, the first being circa $1.1 million for the Taylor-Burton Diamond several years earlier. Six years later, the diamond was placed on display in November 1976 at a charity benefit as a means to attract donors to that benefit.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote. Republicans began {{looking for a way to}} offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.|$|E

Meanwhile, the final of the competition had also been altered; it <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> played over a single leg at Wembley Stadium.

5|$|On April 9, 2013, media {{reported}} that Apple Inc. had prohibited {{the sale of}} issue 12 of Saga through iOS, because two panels that depicted oral sex between men in a small, in-set image violated Apple's restrictions on sexual content. This resulted in criticism by artists and writers, who pointed to similarly explicit content in previous issues and in other works sold through iTunes. William Gibson and others suggested that the restriction could have occurred specifically because the drawings in question depicted gay sex. A day later, digital distributor Comixology announced {{that it had been}} they, not Apple, who had chosen not to make the issue available based on their interpretation of Apple's rules, and that after receiving clarification from Apple, the issue <b>would</b> <b>now</b> <b>be</b> sold via iOS.|$|E
