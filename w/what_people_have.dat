In a message posted to the Operation Clambake website, Beghe wrote: [...] "As the Church of Scientology carefully monitors all anti-scientology websites, I am posting the letter here, on xenu.net, to assure that it be received by the C of S." [...] He had previously contacted the President's Office at The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International who [...] "refused to directly respond" [...] to his request, and {{a letter to}} David Miscavige sent through the Church communication system was also refused. Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are also kept on actor Tom Cruise {{as well as other}} celebrity Scientologists. [...] "More people have left Scientology than are currently in it. And yet they maintain these files about <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> said to them in private sessions. Why would you want these people to hold onto this stuff?" [...] said Beghe to The Village Voice. Beghe believes that Scientology's practice of disconnection is still in place, and in an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice cited his four-year-old son being kicked out of a Scientology school as an example of disconnection.|$|E

So compared to <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been talking about here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected.

[...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W.

2500|$|In February 2011, Lewis {{said the}} album {{would be more}} {{experimental}} than Spirit and Echo, embodying a [...] "different" [...] yet [...] "classic" [...] sound. She added, [...] "I'm really, really excited about it. I'm working with some new producers, some up and coming people and it's going {{to be kind of}} a different sound – but still classic". Lewis suggested the album would be [...] "a bit different from <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> heard" [...] from her before, adding that she planned to [...] "go in and create and just see what happens". Lewis later described the album as [...] "more progressive", [...] "more eclectic", [...] "more uptempo" [...] and [...] "a bit darker". The Sun reported that the album had taken a dubstep direction, with songwriters asked to submit dance songs and no ballads. The song [...] "Come Alive" [...] experiments with dubstep and drum and bass. Lewis stated that the song was inspired by the [...] "dirty and heavy" [...] music sound of British electronica band Faithless. She also commented, [...] "We wanted to do an uptempo song, but for it to remain true to what I do". In March 2012, after extending the album's recording sessions, Lewis elaborated on the evolution of her sound, [...] "I've got a track that's got a bit of drum 'n' bass at the end. It's quite different to what I've had out before." [...] Lewis then went on to add [...] "I've got a track that's very '90s. It's just different influences that I've had through my life growing up.

2500|$|Diddy {{described}} the Last Train to Paris as an [...] "electro-hip-hop-soul funk" [...] album {{which has been}} {{three years in the}} making.

[...] The arc will follow Diddy's character as he tours from London to Paris and finds the woman of his dreams - only to lose her, find her, lose her again and find her a final time. The records were conceptualised from Diddy's comments to his producers. He told Alex da Kid (who produced [...] "Coming Home") [...] "I want a beat that makes me feel like a white man in a basement in Atlanta." [...] Diddy said that [...] "most of the producers he worked with, he's been friends with for a long time. The records came together by hanging out with them, taking them to parties and showing them movies". In an interview with MTV News Diddy said [...] "One of the things [...] trying to represent is emotion... Not being afraid to show emotion on record. A lot of records out right now — no disrespect to them, but they're all surface. It's about <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> or a dance. All our records are gonna be about love, feelings and emotion. Last Train to Paris is a love story and the most vulnerable album I've ever been involved in. It's raw emotion — you get a feeling, a vibe." [...] Diddy also released an application for the iPhone that integrates his social networking site and Twitter feed. A short film will also accompany the album. Rap producer Bangladesh, also confirmed that he would be producing for the album. According to New York magazine, the album was [...] "assembled from 60 or so songs. The genesis of Last Train to Paris is full of odd stories involving our hero, ensconced in a darkened studio, barking batty ideas to his production team." ...|$|E

60|$|It will be said, perhaps, {{that the}} greater nervous {{susceptibility}} of women is a disqualification for practice, in anything but domestic life, by rendering them mobile, changeable, too vehemently {{under the influence of}} the moment, incapable of dogged perseverance, unequal and uncertain in the power of using their faculties. I think that these phrases sum up the greater part of the objections commonly made to the fitness of women for the higher class of serious business. Much of all this is the mere overflow of nervous energy run to waste, and would cease when the energy was directed to a definite end. Much is also the result of conscious or unconscious cultivation; as we see by the almost total disappearance of “hysterics” and fainting fits, since they have gone out of fashion. Moreover, when people are brought up, like many women of the higher classes (though less so in our own country than in any other) a kind of hot-house plants, shielded from the wholesome vicissitudes of air and temperature, and untrained in any of the occupations and exercises which give stimulus and development to the circulatory and muscular system, while their nervous system, especially in its emotional department, is kept in unnaturally active play; it is no wonder if those of them who do not die of consumption, grow up with constitutions liable to derangement from slight causes, both internal and external, and without stamina to support any task, physical or mental, requiring continuity of effort. But women brought up to work for their livelihood show none of these morbid characteristics, unless indeed they are chained to an excess of sedentary work in confined and unhealthy rooms. Women who in their early years have shared in the healthful physical education and bodily freedom of their brothers, and who obtain a sufficiency of pure air and exercise in after-life, very rarely have any excessive susceptibility of nerves which can disqualify them for active pursuits. There is indeed a certain proportion of persons, in both sexes, in whom an unusual degree of nervous sensibility is constitutional, and of so marked a character as to be the feature of their organization which exercises the greatest influence over the whole character of the vital phenomena. This constitution, like other physical conformations, is hereditary, and is transmitted to sons as well as daughters; but it is possible, and probable, that the nervous temperament (as it is called) is inherited by a greater number of women than of men. We will assume this as a fact: and let me then ask, are men of nervous temperament found to be unfit for the duties and pursuits usually followed by men? If not, why should women of the same temperament be unfit for them? The peculiarities of the temperament are, no doubt, within certain limits, an obstacle to success in some employments, though an aid to it in others. But when the occupation is suitable to the temperament, and sometimes even when it is unsuitable, the most brilliant examples of success are continually given by the men of high nervous sensibility. They are distinguished in their practical manifestations chiefly by this, that being susceptible of a higher degree of excitement than those of another physical constitution, their powers when excited differ more than in the case of other people, from those shown in their ordinary state: they are raised, as it were, above themselves, and do things with ease which they are wholly incapable of at other times. But this lofty excitement is not, except in weak bodily constitutions, a mere flash, which passes away immediately, leaving no permanent traces, and incompatible with persistent and steady pursuit of an object. It is the character of the nervous temperament to be capable of sustained excitement, holding out through long continued efforts. It is what is meant by spirit. It is what makes the high-bred racehorse run without slackening speed till he drops down dead. It is what has enabled so many delicate women to maintain the most sublime constancy not only at the stake, but through a long preliminary succession of mental and bodily tortures. It is evident that people of this temperament are particularly apt for what may be called the executive department of the leadership of mankind. They are the material of great orators, great preachers, impressive diffusers of moral influences. Their constitution might be deemed less favourable to the qualities required from a statesman in the cabinet, or from a judge. It would be so, if the consequence necessarily followed that because people are excitable they must always be in a state of excitement. But this is wholly a question of training. Strong feeling is the instrument and element of strong self-control: but it requires to be cultivated in that direction. When it is, it forms not the heroes of impulse only, but those also of self-conquest. History and experience prove that the most passionate characters are the most fanatically rigid in their feelings of duty, when their passion has been trained to act in that direction. The judge who gives a just decision in a case where his feelings are intensely interested on the other side, derives from that same strength of feeling the determined sense of the obligation of justice, which enables him to achieve this victory over himself. The capability of that lofty enthusiasm which takes the human being out of his every-day character, reacts upon the daily character itself. His aspirations and powers when he is in this exceptional state, become the type with which he compares, and by which he estimates, his sentiments and proceedings at other times: and his habitual purposes assume a character moulded by and assimilated to the moments of lofty excitement, although those, from the physical nature of a human being, can only be transient. Experience of races, as well as of individuals, does not show those of excitable temperament to be less fit, on the average, either for speculation or practice, than the more unexcitable. The French, and the Italians, are undoubtedly by nature more nervously excitable than the Teutonic races, and, compared at least with the English, they have a much greater habitual and daily emotional life: but have they been less great in science, in public business, in legal and judicial eminence, or in war? There is abundant evidence that the Greeks were of old, as their descendants and successors still are, one of the most excitable of the races of mankind. It is superfluous to ask, what among the achievements of men they did not excel in. The Romans, probably, as an equally southern people, had the same original temperament: but the stern character of their national discipline, like that of the Spartans, made them an example of the opposite type of national character; the greater strength of their natural feelings being chiefly apparent in the intensity which the same original temperament made it possible to give to the artificial. If these cases exemplify what a naturally excitable people may be made, the Irish Celts afford one of the aptest examples of what they are when left to themselves; (if those can be said to be left to themselves who have been for centuries under the indirect influence of bad government, and the direct training of a Catholic hierarchy and of a sincere belief in the Catholic religion.) The Irish character must be considered, therefore, as an unfavourable case: yet, whenever the circumstances of the individual have been at all favourable, <b>what</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> shown greater capacity for the most varied and multifarious individual eminence? Like the French compared with the English, the Irish with the Swiss, the Greeks or Italians compared with the German races, so women compared with men may be found, on the average, to do the same things with some variety in the particular kind of excellence. But, that they would do them fully as well on the whole, if their education and cultivation were adapted to correcting instead of aggravating the infirmities incident to their temperament, I see not the smallest reason to doubt.|$|E
