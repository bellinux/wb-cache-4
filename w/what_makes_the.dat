25|$|Often, these subgenres are blended, blurred or {{overlapped}} {{to create}} second-generation subgenres. The blurring {{between the lines}} of the subgenres is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> long poem so hard to define, but it also marks the growing creativity {{in the use of the}} form.|$|E
25|$|Meditations are {{reflective}} thought poems. Like the Montage and the Series subgenres, Meditations can {{be somewhat}} fragmented, yet their connectivity is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> long poem a coherent and cohesive idea. This subgenre {{is based on}} meditations (or thoughts). Wallace Stevens believes, as do other writers in this genre, that the work does not rely {{on the use of}} multiple voices.|$|E

Unlike most Roman Catholic cathedra, the Cathedra of the See of Chicago is plain and simple. Its back contains three panels depicting the first Christian teachers: Christ in the center panel, Saint Peter to his right, and Saint Paul to his left.|$|E

25|$|After a year hiatus, the Greys {{returned}} with a short bench and started the rebuilding process. Not much hope of a competitive season was ever tossed Owen Sound's way. But <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> return a success isn't the season record—it {{was the lack of}} a mass exodus of players at the Christmas Break. Players bought into the rebuilding process and stuck it out which earned a tremendous amount of respect from around the league and left the Greys in a good position with a solid nucleus to build on for next season.|$|E
25|$|Mexican artesanía is sold {{to foreigners}} in two ways. The {{first is to}} tourists, as Mexican {{handmade}} items is part of <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> country attractive to foreign visitors. The second is through exports. Mexican artesanía is widely sold outside of Mexico, especially through the Internet. However, {{there is no single}} marketing entity or corporation whose business is to export Mexican artesanía in general. Exporting is mostly done by investments in a particular crafts by particular people, rather than a large scale promotion of Mexican crafts in general.|$|E
25|$|Due to the bialphabetic {{nature of}} the language, actual {{physical}} keyboards with the Serbian Cyrillic layout printed on the keys are uncommon today. Typical keyboards sold in Serbian-speaking markets are marked with Serbian Latin characters and used with both the Latin (QWERTZ) and Cyrillic layout configured in the software. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> two layouts this readily interchangeable is that the non-alphabetic keys are identical between them, and alphabetic keys always correspond directly to their counterparts (except the Latin letters Q, W, X, and Y that have no Cyrillic equivalents, and the Cyrillic letters Љ, Њ and Џ whose Latin counterparts are digraphs LJ, NJ and DŽ). This also makes the Serbian Cyrillic layout a rare example of a non-Latin layout based on QWERTZ.|$|E

25|$|Finding a modular {{multiplicative inverse}} has many {{applications}} in algorithms {{that rely on}} the theory of modular arithmetic. For instance, in cryptography the use of modular arithmetic permits some operations {{to be carried out}} more quickly and with less storage requirements, while other operations become more difficult. Both of these features can be used to advantage. In particular, in the RSA algorithm, encrypting and decrypting a message is done using a pair of numbers that are multiplicative inverses with respect to a carefully selected modulus. One of these numbers is made public and {{can be used in a}} rapid encryption procedure, while the other, used in the decryption procedure, is kept hidden. Determining the hidden number from the public number is considered to be computationally infeasible and this is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> system work to ensure privacy.|$|E
25|$|Part of <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> flapamba’s {{characteristic}} {{sound is}} the tuning; for instance, the resonators are not {{tuned to the}} bars as in other standard keyboard percussion instruments. Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were {{getting out of the}} percussion rental business since Emil was dominating much of the work in town. Emil couldn't find any info on the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the softest mallets possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|E
25|$|When a {{bacterium}} detects environmental conditions are becoming unfavourable it may {{start the process}} of endosporulation, which takes about eight hours. The DNA is replicated and a membrane wall known as a spore septum begins to form {{between it and the}} rest of the cell. The plasma membrane of the cell surrounds this wall and pinches off to leave a double membrane around the DNA, and the developing structure is now known as a forespore. Calcium dipicolinate, the calcium salt of dipicolinic acid, is incorporated into the forespore during this time. The dipicolinic acid helps stabilize the proteins and DNA in the endospore. Next the peptidoglycan cortex forms between the two layers and the bacterium adds a spore coat to the outside of the forespore. In the final stages of endospore formation the newly forming endospore is dehydrated and allowed to mature before being released from the mother cell. The cortex is <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> endospore so resistant to temperature. The cortex contains an inner membrane known as the core. The inner membrane that surrounds this core leads to the endospore's resistance against UV light and harsh chemicals that would normally destroy microbes. Sporulation is now complete, and the mature endospore will be released when the surrounding vegetative cell is degraded.|$|E
