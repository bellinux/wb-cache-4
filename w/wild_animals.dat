5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} {{the ethics of}} humans' relationships with <b>wild</b> <b>animals</b> and environments beyond his property rights theory.

He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E

It is not clear that Ng puts forward a successful case.

5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not <b>wild,</b> <b>animals</b> in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist <b>wild</b> <b>animals,</b> and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E
