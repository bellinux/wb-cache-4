The direct impact of monthly variations in <b>world</b> <b>prices</b> on producer price variations has also increased.

50|$|Although the {{possibility}} of breaking this tenuous link with <b>world</b> <b>prices</b> and developing an indigenous system of prices for the Comecon market had been discussed in the 1960s, the evolution of Comecon prices after 1971 went in the opposite direction. Far from a technical or academic matter, the question of prices underlaid vital issues of the terms of, and hence gains from, intra-Comecon trade. In particular, relative to actual <b>world</b> <b>prices,</b> intra-Comecon prices in the early 1970s penalized raw materials exporters and benefited exporters of manufacturers. After the oil price explosion of 1973, Comecon foreign trade prices swung still further away from <b>world</b> <b>prices</b> to the disadvantage of Comecon suppliers of raw materials, in particular the Soviet Union. In view of the extraregional opportunities opened up by the expansion of East-West trade, this yawning gap between Comecon and <b>world</b> <b>prices</b> {{could no longer be}} ignored. Hence in 1975, at Soviet instigation, the system of intra-Comecon pricing was reformed.|$|R
25|$|The National Energy Program had {{a number}} of other flaws. It was based on a <b>world</b> <b>price</b> {{steadily}} increasing to $100 per barrel. The world oil price declined to as little as $10 per barrel in the years following. Since the federal government based its spending on the larger figure, the result was that it {{spent a great deal of}} money on subsidies that could not be recovered in taxes on production. Furthermore, due to proximity to the U.S. market companies had opportunities to make money by playing differentials in prices. For instance, refiners in Eastern Canada would import oil subsidized down to half the <b>world</b> <b>price,</b> refine it into products, and export the products to the U.S. at full <b>world</b> <b>price.</b> Airlines flying between Europe and the U.S. via the polar route would take off with as little fuel as possible, and stop briefly in Canada to fill up before continuing on to their destination. Trucking companies operating between locations in the Northern U.S. would detour their trucks through Canada to refuel. None of these transactions was illegal, or even unusual considering the integrated nature of the economies, but all had the effect of transferring billions of Canadian tax dollars to the balance sheets of (mostly foreign owned) companies. A third flaw was that the NEP assumed that future oil discoveries would be made in areas under federal jurisdiction, such as the Arctic and offshore. As it turned out, most of the major oil discoveries in Canada had already been made, and the subsidies given by the federal government to companies exploring in federal jurisdiction were not productive. All of these flaws resulted in large, and unexpected, increases in the federal budget deficit.|$|E

Their workers, {{almost half of}} the industrial workforce, suffered from rising unemployment. In 1948–1949, a substantial share of Marshall Plan funds was used to subsidize imports of food. American money effectively raised real wages: the grain price was about one-third of the <b>world</b> <b>price,</b> while agriculture remained in ruins.

25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the <b>world</b> <b>price</b> in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the world market price collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E

500|$|Brownlee {{remained}} {{intimately involved}} in the grain industry even outside the UGG, in part through {{his position on the}} Canadian Federation of Agriculture executive. [...] In this capacity, he found himself {{in the middle of a}} controversy over the British Wheat Agreement (BWA). [...] The BWA was an agreement to sell wheat to British clients at a fixed price over a four-year period. [...] The price was to be adjusted during the following two years, [...] "having regard to" [...] world wheat prices. [...] During the first four years, world wheat prices were continually above the price stipulated in the agreement, breeding resentment towards the British, especially since they sold much of this fixed price wheat for a large profit in European markets. [...] This was exacerbated when the British refused to adjust the price upwards for the last two years, on the grounds that there was nothing in the agreement to compel them to do so. [...] The result was considerable ill will and a loss by grain farmers of an estimated $350 million. [...] The federal government, which had negotiated the agreement, offered to supplement the British payments by $65 million, a sum large enough to raise the ire of eastern Canadians but too small to placate western farmers. [...] Brownlee, who had opposed the agreement, authorized a purchase of advertising across the country pointing out that the government fixed the domestic price of wheat at $0.77 per bushel while the <b>world</b> <b>price</b> reached as high as $2.18. [...] In Brownlee's view, the $65 million payment by the government paled in comparison to the benefit to consumers of the federal policy. [...] Subsequent international agreements, for which Brownlee acted as an advisor to the Canadian delegation, resulted in more favourable terms for farmers. [...] Brownlee's continued status as one of the grain industry's leading figures was also exhibited by his involvement in government relations. [...] He appeared before the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture to oppose a system of allocating box cars to each grain elevator by formula, favouring instead a system whereby the Canadian Wheat Board retained the flexibility to assign them as it saw fit. [...] In his September 1960 submission to the Royal Commission on Transportation, In Defense of the Crow's Nest Pass Rates, he rejected the railways' calls to deregulate the rates they charged for the shipment of grain.|$|E

Under the modified Bucharest formula (which remained in effect in late 1980s), prices were fixed every year and were based on a moving average of <b>world</b> <b>prices</b> for the preceding five years. The world-price base of the Bucharest formula was thus retained and still represented an average (although now moving) of adjusted <b>world</b> <b>prices</b> for the preceding five years.
