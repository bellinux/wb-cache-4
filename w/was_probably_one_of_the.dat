5|$|Dimetrodon <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, {{feeding on}} fish and tetrapods, {{including}} reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species {{may have had}} different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon {{may have been used}} to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{material}} from the Bronze Age and earlier has been recovered and excavations have shown that there was unsustained late-Neolithic and Bronze Age human activity in the vicinity. The earliest known permanent settlement dates from the Iron Age and began where a track running northwards from Bourne crossed the River Slea. Although only sparse pottery evidence has been found for the middle Iron Age period, 4,290 pellet mould fragments, likely used for minting and dated to 50BC–AD 50, have been uncovered south east of the modern town centre, south of a crossing of the River Slea and near Mareham Lane in Old Sleaford. The largest {{of its kind in}} Europe, the deposit has led archaeologists to consider that the site in Old Sleaford <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest Corieltauvian settlements during this period and may have been a tribal centre.|$|E
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it enters into the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E

5|$|Robert <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sons of Gilbert de Gant, who is {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book. Gilbert was from Flanders and came to England during 1069. Gilbert, who died around 1095, was married to Alice, daughter of Hugh de Montfort. Robert's conjectured siblings were Emma– wife of Alan de Percy, Hugh de Montfort-sur-Risle, Gilbert de Gant– who died before his father, and Walter de Gant. If Robert was a son of Gilbert, he was a younger son, probably {{the youngest of the}} four brothers, and probably was born sometime around 1085, as his supposed parents married about 1075 and there were older siblings. Robert is often confused in the historical records with another Robert, son of Walter. Robert was probably also the uncle of Gilbert de Gant, later Earl of Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|Sophocles, {{the son of}} Sophilus, was {{a wealthy}} member of the rural deme (small community) of Hippeios Colonus in Attica, which {{was to become a}} setting for one of his plays, and he was {{probably}} born there. Sophocles was born a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC: the exact year is unclear, although 497/6 is the most likely. Sophocles was born into a wealthy family (his father was an armour manufacturer) and was highly educated. Sophocles' first artistic triumph was in 468 BC, when he took first prize in the Dionysia theatre competition over the reigning master of Athenian drama, Aeschylus. According to Plutarch, the victory came under unusual circumstances. Instead of following the usual custom of choosing judges by lot, the archon asked Cimon and the other strategoi present to decide the victor of the contest. Plutarch further contends that following this loss Aeschylus soon left for Sicily. Although Plutarch says that this was Sophocles' first production, it is now thought that his first production was probably in 470 BC. Triptolemus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plays that Sophocles presented at this festival.|$|E

He described surgeries of combining tenodeses and tendon transfers to restore hand function. He also advocated transferring the m. brachioradialis to the wrist extensors when these muscles are paralyzed.|$|E

The Zortech compiler <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first stable and usable C++ compilers for Windows programming, before Microsoft had a C++ compiler.|$|E
25|$|Bình Định <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{places where}} the Cham first arrived {{in what is now}} Vietnam.

The city-state of Vijaya was located around this port and the main city, which was further inland. Its centre was in the southern lowland of Bình Định. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the eleventh or twelfth century.|$|E

25|$|The government's {{response}} to the increased threat was to appoint a Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, which published a far-reaching report in 1860. It recommended that many existing forts should be upgraded or rebuilt entirely, and that new forts should be constructed to guard particularly strategic or vulnerable points along the coast. In all, around 70 forts and batteries were constructed around the English coast {{as a result of}} the Royal Commission's report. Slough Fort <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smallest of these.|$|E
25|$|Ireland was {{inhabited}} sometime {{shortly after}} {{the ending of the}} last Ice Age, approximately 10,000 – 8000 BC Conservative estimates place the arrival of the first humans in County Wexford as occurring between 5000 BC – 3000 BC, referred to as the Mesolithic period in Ireland, though they may have arrived slightly earlier. Its proximity to Britain and Europe means that County Wexford <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest areas of Ireland to be inhabited by humans. Evidence of this period is scarce and much remains to be discovered through Archaeology and Research.|$|E
25|$|However, {{some young}} Friends such as John Wilhelm Rowntree and Edward Grubb {{supported}} Darwin's theories adopting {{a doctrine of}} progressive revelation with evolutionary ideas.

Acceptance of the theory of evolution became more widespread in those Yearly Meetings, which moved towards liberal Christianity in the twentieth century, while a belief in creationism persists within evangelical Friends Churches, particularly in East Africa and parts of the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Bosnia {{in the western}} Balkans during the Dark Ages is patchy. Upon the looter invasions by the Avars and Slavs from 6th-9th century, bringing Slavic languages, both probably gave way to feudalism only with the might by the Frankish penetrating into {{the region in the}} late 9th century (Bosnia probably originated as one such pre-feudal entity). It was also around this time that the Bosnians were Christianized. Bosnia, due to its geographic position and terrain, <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last areas to go through this process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the Dalmatian coast.|$|E
25|$|The church {{houses a}} small {{collection}} of religious objects (sculpture and reliquaries), about 3 dozen {{examples from the}} 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, some of which come from the Carmelite Convent of São José, and from two shrines elsewhere in town. Among these objects is a silver censer, and a carved image of the Christ Child. The censer, {{in the shape of}} a boat, is still used today during the most solemn ceremonies. Its profusion of ornamentation with volutes, acanthus leaves, seraphim heads, etc. is characteristic of the Baroque period of the first half of the 18th century. There is no information about its creator, but it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Algarve artists well known for this type of work.|$|E
25|$|Thales (635-543 BC) of Miletus (now {{in southwestern}} Turkey), {{was the first}} to whom {{deduction}} in mathematics is attributed. There are five geometric propositions for which he wrote deductive proofs, though his proofs have not survived. Pythagoras (582-496 BC) of Ionia, and later, Italy, then colonized by Greeks, may have been a student of Thales, and traveled to Babylon and Egypt. The theorem that bears his name may not have been his discovery, but he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first to give a deductive proof of it. He gathered a group of students around him to study mathematics, music, and philosophy, and together they discovered most of what high school students learn today in their geometry courses. In addition, they made the profound discovery of incommensurable lengths and irrational numbers.|$|E
