Sir Sam Fay, {{a railway}} official {{who worked at}} the War Office 1917–19, enjoyed cordial face-to-face relations with Wilson but wrote that he could argue with total conviction that a horse chestnut <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a chestnut horse, and that an unnamed senior general said he suffered a “sexual disturbance” whenever he came within a mile of a politician (Fay recorded that the general had in fact used “vulgar and obscene” language – Walter Reid simply writes that exposure to politicians gave Wilson an erection). Edward Spears – also a senior Anglo-French liaison officer, but junior to Wilson – loathed him and compared him to Quint, the sinister and evil valet in Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} the album's title, Vedder said [...] "it's called No Code because it's full of code. It's misinformation." [...] In medical terminology, a [...] "no code" [...] order {{is a medical}} order to withhold CPR on a patient. It {{is also known as}} a [...] "do not resuscitate" [...] order. In another interview, Vedder said that [...] "if the record is a complete failure you've kind of owned up to it in a subliminal way. No Code <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing.</b> For me, No Code meant 'Do Not Resuscitate'." ...|$|E
500|$|Six {{companies}} {{working on}} different scenes and elements created 500shots of visual {{effects in the}} film. These were at times altered weekly due to the reactions of test audiences in screenings. CIS Visual Effects Group assisted with the Scorcher VI faux trailer and twenty additional shots for the home media release. To expand on the comedy in the film, some of the explosions and crashes were embellished to look more destructive. The visual effects supervisor Michael Fink reflected on the exaggerated explosions: [...] "We worked really {{hard to make the}} CG crashing helicopter in the hot landing sequence look real. Ben was adamant about that, {{but at the same time}} he wanted the explosion to be huge. When you see it hit the ground, it was like it was filled with gasoline! It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> with Ben's sergeant character, who almost intercepts a hand grenade... Now, I was in the Army for three years and no hand grenade would make an explosion like that... But it was a big dramatic moment and it looks really cool... and feels kind of real." ...|$|E

500|$|The New York Times wrote, [...] "In glorifying {{those who}} are first, the second is often forgotten... Larry Doby {{integrated}} all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And {{he did it with}} class and clout." [...] During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson's number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in Sports Illustrated pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, [...] "Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don't come first or don't do things a certain way get lost. They disappear." [...] "Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, 'We're gonna be nice to the second Black,'" [...] Doby said.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, a leading British antisemite, Henry Hamilton Beamish, stated that Bolshevism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as Judaism. In the same decade, future wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill penned an {{editorial}} entitled [...] "Zionism versus Bolshevism," [...] {{which was published}} in the Illustrated Sunday Herald. In the article, which asserted that Zionism and Bolshevism were engaged in a [...] "struggle for the soul of the Jewish people", he called on Jews to repudiate [...] "the Bolshevik conspiracy" [...] and make clear that [...] "the Bolshevik movement is not a Jewish movement" [...] but stated that: ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1963, Sullivan and {{his entourage}} {{happened}} also to be passing through Heathrow and witnessed how The Beatles' fans greeted the group on their return from Stockholm, where they had performed a television show as warmup band to local stars [...] and Lill Babs. Sullivan was intrigued, telling his entourage it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as Elvis all over again. He initially offered Beatles manager Brian Epstein top dollar for a single show but the Beatles manager had a better idea — he wanted exposure for his clients: the Beatles would instead appear three times on the show, at bottom dollar, but receive top billing and two spots (opening and closing) on each show.|$|E
