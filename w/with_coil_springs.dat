25|$|In 1946, {{the company}} {{restarted}} car production with the 202, delivering 14,000 copies. In 1947, Peugeot introduced the Peugeot 203, <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> rack-and-pinion steering, and hydraulic brakes. The 203 set new Peugeot sales records, remaining in production until 1960.|$|E
25|$|Suspension on the 1965 models was redesigned. Replacing {{the former}} leaf-spring rear {{suspension}} {{was a new}} three-link system, <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> Interiors featured a new instrument panel and two-way key system were introduced. The introduction of two keys was for valet parking, in that the rounded head key would only open the trunk or locked glove compartment, while the squared head key would unlock the doors and the ignition.|$|E
25|$|The front {{suspension}} {{is short}} and long control arms with coil springs; the rear suspension is a four-link design <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b> A torque-arm design rear suspension replaced the four-link design starting with the 1976 models. The Astre is a rear wheel drive vehicle with a live rear axle. Steering is of a recirculating ball type with a power assist option. The brake system features front disc brakes with solid rotors, and rear drum brakes. Power assist was optional starting in the 1975 model year.|$|E

500|$|The Mk.9 was {{designed}} around the FIA's Group 6 regulations for sports prototypes, {{allowing for a}} completely custom mid-engine layout that was only limited in terms of engine sizes available to competitors. [...] Closed cockpit bodywork with gullwing doors {{was designed}} by Bob McKee to shroud the mid-engine layout. [...] Standard double wishbone suspension <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> were used with disc brakes on each wheel. [...] A [...] fuel tank was placed between the cockpit and turbine, housing Jet A fuel.|$|E
2500|$|The car used unit body construction, had a {{wheelbase}} of [...] and a {{dry weight}} of 1,400kg. The all-independent suspension {{was of the}} double wishbone type <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> upfront, and trailing arm type with transverse torsion bars at the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The 8C 2900 was {{designed}} to compete in sports car races {{in general and the}} Mille Miglia in particular. [...] It used the 2.9L version of the 8C engine and was based on the 8C 35 Grand Prix racing chassis. As such, it had an inline 8-cylinder 2.9-litre engine using two Roots type superchargers fed by two updraught Weber carburettors and fully independent suspension with Dubonnet-type trailing arm suspension <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and hydraulic dampers at front and swing axles with a transverse leaf spring at the rear.|$|E

50|$|The {{engineering}} {{of the car}} was conventional <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>sprung</b> independent front {{suspension and}} a live axle at the rear with semi elliptic leaf springs. The braking used a Girling system with 9 in drums all round.|$|R
50|$|Mass {{reduction}} {{was achieved}} by switching to a lighter engine/alternator set, as well as using lighter weight auxiliary system components. The bogie is the design used in the RENFE Class 334 locomotive, <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> primary and secondary suspension.|$|R
2500|$|Styling {{changes for}} 1938 were modest, with a longer hood {{extending}} to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards and redesigned hubcaps, {{but the effect}} was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four {{times the size of}} any others on the market. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. [...] The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new [...] "turbulator" [...] pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase in horsepower to 141.|$|E
2500|$|Drive train {{options for}} the model were either a 5-speed manual (W50) or an {{optional}} 4-speed automatic transmission (A40D). Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive gear whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over [...] The drive train for the Supra retained the T series solid rear axle configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional Limited Slip Differential) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes and featured a four-link rear suspension <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> lateral track bar, and stabilizer bar. The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar.|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{for this}} year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over [...] The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|The Visa {{featured}} a soft but well-damped, long-travel, fully independent suspension (Coil-sprung MacPherson struts at the front, <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>sprung</b> trailing arms at the rear) {{that contributed to}} a soft ride similar to the Citroën 2CV, but without extreme bodyroll.|$|R
40|$|When {{perspective}} {{projections of}} orbital trajectories plotted in local-vertical local-horizontal coordinates are viewed with certain viewing angles, their appearace becomes perceptually unstable. They often lose their trochoidal appearance and reorganize as helices. This reorganization {{may be due}} to the viewer's familiarity <b>with</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>springs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Instrument for nondestructively {{measuring}} {{compression resistance}} of spray foam used as thermal insulation was developed. Cylindrical indicator has probe <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> to provide force and indicating dial. Probe is manually pressed against {{area to be}} tested until complete foot area contacts foam surfaces...|$|R
2500|$|Its overall {{shape is}} of a roundish profile, soon nicknamed [...] "Daruma" [...] for a Japanese {{roly-poly}} doll - {{this is the}} smallest (and arguably the only Kei Jidosha) car to use the [...] "coke bottle styling" [...] which became popular in the United States for the 1965 model year. The wheelbase was , the suspension independent <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and the engine was an all new 356cc three-cylinder air-cooled two-cycle unit which was also called the LC10. The transmission was a four-speed manual, originally with synchromesh on the top three gears only. In a break with Fronte's front-wheel drive traditions, the powertrain was placed transversely in the rear, as was becoming the norm for kei cars of the period. The LC10 Fronte was dubbed the [...] "Queen of the keis" [...] by Suzuki's marketing department - a claim which may have influenced Subaru to name their 360 replacement the [...] "Rex".|$|E
2500|$|Bill Riley's {{redesigned}} Mk III was simpler in its design, allowing more variety {{for customers}} {{as well as}} a low cost. [...] Although the extreme aerodynamics of the original design were gone, the car was conceived to be fast enough to compete for overall wins. [...] The redesign and eventual construction of the first car took only four months. [...] The chassis featured a steel tube frame with panels made of carbon fiber. [...] Behind the cockpit the engine bay was designed to be large enough to allow for a variety of naturally aspirated engines, mostly the V8s of Ford, Chevrolet, and Oldsmobile that were common amongst IMSA GT privateers. [...] All cars used a 5-speed transmission. [...] The suspension consisted of double wishbones <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> attached by a pushrod. [...] A power steering system was also part of the standard Mk III.|$|E
2500|$|Structurally the FJ Cruiser {{incorporates}} a body on frame truck style design similar but not {{identical to that}} of the Prado platform. The FJ Cruiser uses a high-mounted, double wishbone front suspension and stabilizer bar, and a 4-link rear suspension with lateral rod <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and stabilizer bar. The 120-series Land Cruiser Prado, Tacoma, 4Runner, and Hilux share the same suspension parts as the FJ Cruiser. The FJ Cruiser uses power-assisted four-piston front and two-piston rear ventilated disc brakes with an anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), brake assist (BA) and is also equipped with vehicle stability control (VSC) and a specialized traction control system known as [...] "A-TRAC". The A-TRAC system applies braking to control wheels that have lost traction, mimicking the performance of a locking differential without the [...] "binding" [...] that can make steering difficult in normal locking differential setups.|$|E
50|$|Front {{suspension}} Independent damper struts <b>with</b> separate <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and gas-pressurised shock absorbers, triangular {{lower control}} arms with anti-dive geometry and stabiliser bar.|$|R
50|$|There {{were serious}} {{difficulties}} {{with the air}} suspension, which proved troublesome in practice. Some owners found it cheaper to have it replaced <b>with</b> conventional <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bogies were a {{fabricated}} steel design, <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> primary suspension. The traction motors and gearboxes (one per axle) were mounted to the bogie frame {{and connected to}} the wheels by a flexibly coupled quill drive. Traction links were connected to the bogie frame at a height of 200 mm above rail. The locomotive superstructure is supported on <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> on a central swing bolster, and the centre bogie allows 200 mm of lateral movement to negotiate small-radius curves. Yaw dampers are also fitted.|$|R
2500|$|Suspension {{was handled}} by double {{wishbones}} <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> and telescopic dampers at the front, and a de Dion tube system with torsion bar springs at the rear. While this arrangement had been state-of-the-art {{in the early}} years of the 1950s, by the time that the DBR4 made its first public appearance most racing car manufacturers were moving to all-round independent suspension, offering better handling, traction and road-holding than the older system employed at the rear of the Aston. [...] The DBR4 was the last new Grand Prix car to use the de Dion system. This same suspension system would be adapted to the DBR3 sports car which was being developed at the same time as the DBR4, but would be abandoned less than a year later when the DBR3 was considered a failure. [...] To bring the car to a halt, Girling disc brakes were fitted all round.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, Yves Courage {{decided to}} build a World Sports Car for the IMSA GT Championship, which was the Paolo Catone-{{designed}} C41. Although the C41 was entirely designed by Catone, Marcel Hubert had initially developed a long-tailed concept model for the car, but this design was scrapped after Hubert retired. Catone began to design the car, on a limited budget, in early 1994, and completed it in July 1994. The C41 used a carbon fibre and aluminium honeycomb monocoque chassis, with a rear shear plate designed to allow the usage of multiple different types of engine. The first C41 was built in October 1994, and it was fitted with a Comptech-developed 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, which, in 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans trim, was claimed to produce around [...] The power was transmitted to the rear wheels via a 5-speed Intermotion SDC gearbox, whilst Brembo brakes were used to slow the [...] BBS wheels. KONI developed the suspension, which consisted of double wishbones made out of fabricated steel, and pushrod-operated dampers <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The sports-oriented model, {{known as}} the [...] "SE" [...] in North America and [...] "Sportivo" [...] in Australasia, was {{developed}} by Toyota Australia. It features a black [...] "honeycomb" [...] grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels. To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers. Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in spring rate, thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a [...] "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only). Interior changes include charcoal-colored sports fabric and a leather-wrapped three-spoke steering wheel. In addition to the sports-oriented suspension setup, Toyota Australia's standard-grade suspension calibration has also been adopted by New Zealand, the Middle East and North America. The suspension geometry consists of independent MacPherson struts, L-arms, coil springs, gas dampers and a ball-jointed stabilizer bar at the front, with the rear setup comprising dual-link independent MacPherson struts <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs,</b> gas dampers and ball-jointed stabilizer bar.|$|E

50|$|A Locost is a home-built car. The car {{features}} a space frame chassis usually welded together from mild steel 1 x 1 in square tubing. Front suspension is usually double wishbone <b>with</b> <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> struts. The rear is traditionally live axle, but has many variants including {{independent rear suspension}} or De Dion tube. Body panels are usually fiberglass nose and wings and aluminium side panels. Each car is highly individualized according to the resources, needs and desires of each respective builder.|$|R
50|$|The car was the {{successor}} to the Škoda 440/445 on which it was based. It featured redesigned front axles <b>with</b> a <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> and telescopic shock absorbers rather than a leaf spring as in the 440.|$|R
