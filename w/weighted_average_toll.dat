40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a new aggregation operator that unifies the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> and the ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> (OWA) operator in the same formulation. We call it the ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> – <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> (OWAWA) operator. This aggregation operator provides a more complete representation of the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> and the OWA because it includes them as particular cases of a more general context. We study different properties and families of the OWAWA operator. We also develop an illustrative example of the new approach in a decision making problem about selection of strategies...|$|R

40|$|The <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> {{is by far}} {{the most}} popular {{approach}} to combining multiple forecasts of some future outcome. This paper shows that both for probability or real-valued forecasts, a non-trivial <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of different forecasts is always sub-optimal. More specifically, it is not consistent with any set of information about the future outcome even if the individual forecasts are. Furthermore, <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> does not behave as if it collects information from the forecasters and hence needs to be extremized, that is, systematically transformed away from the marginal mean. This paper proposes a linear extremization technique for improving the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> of real-valued forecasts. The resulting more extreme version of the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> exhibits many properties of optimal aggregation. Both this and the sub-optimality of the <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> are illustrated with simple examples involving synthetic and real-world data...|$|R

The <b>weighted</b> <b>averaged</b> shear stresses representing friction forces are defined in terms of the <b>weighted</b> <b>averaged</b> velocities. Fluid pressure and <b>weighted</b> <b>averaged</b> velocities are, therefore, considered as the principle dependent variables.

40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the correlation between}} apartment REIT performance (as measured by Funds from Operations, Net Operating Income, Gross Rental Revenue, Net Income, Market Capitalization and CAP Rate) and market fundamentals (as measured by <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> rent growth, <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> employment growth, <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> stock growth and <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> excess demand). The objective {{of this paper is}} to explain the variance in historical apartment REIT performance based on historical market fundamentals. Market fundamentals are broadly defined as the employment growth, population growth, stock growth and rent growth. More detailed definitions of market fundamentals are provided within the paper. Independent variables are developed from market data collected from 57 MSAs. Using these data, <b>weighted</b> <b>averages</b> are generated in order to isolate geographical effects. These independent variables are regressed against measures of financial performance of apartment REITs as of December 31, 2000.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{developed}} the notion of interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein hybrid <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator along with their some desirable properties such as idempotency, boundedness, and monotonicity. Actually interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator weights only the Pythagorean fuzzy arguments and interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator weights only the ordered positions of the Pythagorean fuzzy arguments instead of weighting the Pythagorean fuzzy arguments themselves. To overcome these limitations, we have introduced an interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein hybrid <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator, which weights both the given Pythagorean fuzzy value and its ordered position. Finally, the proposed operator {{has been applied to}} decision-making problems to show the validity, practicality and effectiveness of the new approach.|$|R

We analyze the use of OWA operators in the Minkowski distance. We will call these new distance aggregation operator the Minkowski ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> distance (MOWAD) operator. We give a general overview {{of this type of}} generalization and study some of their main properties. We also analyze a wide range of particular cases found in this generalization such as the ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> distance (OWAD) operator, the Euclidean ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> distance (EOWAD) operator, the normalized Minkowski distance, etc. Finally, we give an illustrative example of the new approach where we can see the different results obtained by using different aggregation operators...|$|R

40|$|When using {{linguistic}} {{approaches to}} solve decision problems, we need linguistic representation models. The symbolic model, the 2 -tuple fuzzy linguistic representation {{model and the}} continuous linguistic model are three existing linguistic representation models based on position indexes. Together with these three linguistic models, the corresponding ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operators, such as the linguistic ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator, the 2 -tuple ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator and the extended ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator, have been developed, respectively. In this paper, we analyze the internal relationship among these operators, and propose a consensus operator under the continuous linguistic model (or the 2 -tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model). The proposed consensus operator {{is based on the}} use of the ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator and the deviation measures. Some desired properties of the consensus operator are also presented. In particular, the consensus operator provides an alternative consensus model for group decision making. This consensus model preserves the original preference information given by the decision makers as much as possible, and supports consensus process automatically, without moderator.

40|$|In {{multiple}} criteria {{linear programming}} (MOLP) any efficient solution {{can be found}} by the weighting approach with some positive weights allocated to several criteria. The weights settings represent preferences model thus involving impreciseness and uncertain-ties. The resulting <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> performance may be lower than expected. Several approaches {{have been developed to}} deal with uncertain or imprecise data. In this paper we focus on robust approaches to the <b>weighted</b> <b>averages</b> of criteria where the weights are varying. Assume that the weights may be affected by perturbations varying within given intervals. Note that the weights are normalized and although varying independently they must total to 1. We are interested in the optimization of the worst case <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> outcome with respect to the weights perturbation set. For the case of unlim-ited perturbations the worst case <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> becomes the worst outcome (max-min solution). For the special case of proportional perturbation limits this becomes the condi-tional average. In general case, the worst case <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> is a generalization of the conditional average. Nevertheless, it can be effectively reformulated as an LP expansion of the original problem...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Voting {{algorithms}} {{are used}} in a wide area of control systems from real-time and safety-critical control systems to pattern recognition, image processing and human organization systems in order to arbitrating among redundant results of processing in redundant hardware modules or software versions. From a point of view, voting algorithms can be categorized to agreement-based voters like plurality and majority or some voters which produce output regardless to agreement existence among the results of redundant variants. In some applications {{it is necessary to}} use second type voters including median and <b>weighted</b> <b>average.</b> Although both of median and <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voters are the choicest voters for highly available application, <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voting is often more trustable than median. Meanwhile median voter simply selects the mid-value of results; <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voter assigns weight to each input, based on their pre-determined priority or their differences, so that the share of more trustable inputs will increase rather than the inputs with low probable correctness. This paper introduces a novel <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voting algorithm based on neural networks that is capable of improving the rate of system reliability. Our experimental results showed that the neural <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> voter has increases the reliability 116. 63 % in general and 309. 82 %, 130. 27 % and 9. 37 % respectively for large, medium and small errors in comparison with <b>weighted</b> <b>average,</b> and 73. 87 % in general and 160. 44 %, 83. 59 % and 7. 52 % respectively for large, medium and small errors in comparison with median voter.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{computing}} the fuzzy <b>weighted</b> <b>average,</b> where both attributes and weights are fuzzy numbers, is well {{studied in the}} literature. Generally, the approach is to apply Zadeh’s extension principle to compute α-cuts of the fuzzy <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> from the α-cuts of the attributes and weights for fixed values of α∈[0 [...] 1]; this means that all values of the membership functions of the fuzzy <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> are computed separately. In this paper, we generalise this approach {{in such a way}} that α is considered to be a parameter; this enables us to compute exact analytical membership functions for the fuzzy <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> in case the attributes and weights are triangular or trapeizoidal fuzzy numbers. To illustrate the power of our algorithms, they are applied to the examples from the literature, providing exact membership functions in each case...|$|R
