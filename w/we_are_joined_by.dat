"With your honour's permission," [...] said Anderson, respectfully {{raising his}} cap, [...] "when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> the Irish infantry, who are expected, {{and who should}} be landed in the West Highlands before now, we shall have need of good {{soldiers}} to discipline our levies." ...|$|E

"I rejoice to hear this, Deerslayer," [...] {{returned}} Judith, [...] "and now <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> your friend, I make no {{manner of}} {{question that we}} shall find an opportunity to ransom the prisoners. If there are any women in the camp, I have articles of dress that will catch their eyes, and, should the worst come to the worst, we can open the great chest, which I think will be found to hold things that may tempt the chiefs." ...|$|E
60|$|Our {{coffee was}} served in Mrs. Sanderson's sitting-room, where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> {{a bevy of}} young people, to whom <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} {{in anticipation of the}} week's festivities.|$|R

40|$|On {{behalf of}} the Organizing Committee, I would like to welcome you to the Second International Symposium on Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring in Neurosurgery. This year, I am pleased to {{announce}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> 160 participants from 24 countries. The Symposium {{will focus on the}} intraoperative monitoring of the motor pathways. We are also pleased to announce the inclusion of a program covering new developments in the neurophysiological and surgical aspects of functional neurosurgery. As our discipline takes hold, we believe it is important to compare and contrast the different experiences from around the world. We have invited twenty experts in the fields of neurosurgery, neurophysiology, neuro-anesthesiology, and interventional neuro-radiology to give us a comprehensive update on the latest achievements in intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. This kind of multidisciplinary and international approach should not only validate and enhance our understanding of intraoperative neurophysiology, but it should also help us achieve our ultimate goal: prevention of intraoperative neurological injury. ...|$|E
40|$|The National Science Foundation’s (NSF) ADVANCE {{program has}} funded over $ 130 million USD in efforts “to {{increase}} the representation and advancement {{of women in}} academic science and engineering careers, thereby contributing {{to the development of}} a more diverse science and engineering workforce” ([URL] The PURDUE-ADVANCE project has three major goals: 1) to increase the number and success of STEM women faculty of color; 2) to increase the success and leadership of women faculty in STEM, and 3) to educate all the faculty and in particular, the majority, about the benefits of diversity and inclusion (see [URL] Across this institution, different stakeholders have been involved in an integrated approach to lay out and sustain an infrastructure for institutional change. In our presentation, we discuss our own parts within Purdue’s broad institutional effort. To accomplish our goal of educating the majority (Goal 3), PURDUE-ADVANCE recruited Diversity Catalysts (DCs), three successful, well-respected senior faculty who were educated about diversity and inclusion issues to have an impact on STEM disciplines and the entire campus community. These original three DCs have interacted with others in formal and informal settings to engage in deep cultural change one conversation at a time. We developed (a) our intersectional co-learning engagement (i. e., how and what we, as Diversity Catalysts, learned as we engaged with diversity and inclusion literature and with each other), as well as (b) how we describe their personal experiences as Diversity Catalysts individually. We trace the DCs course over the last few years and describe the next phase of our work, in which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> a second cohort of DCs...|$|E
60|$|We talked long together,--we three,--and anon <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> the Chevalier de Canaples, {{who offered}} me also, in his hesitating manner, his felicitations. And with me they lingered until Yvonne came {{to drive them}} with protestations from my bedside.|$|R
60|$|That {{day was a}} Court day, {{when the}} Queens sat in the great hall and {{received}} petitions, discussed laws, money grants, and so forth, and thither we adjourned shortly afterwards. On our way <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> Good, who <b>was</b> looking exceedingly depressed.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> {{ushered into}} a dim-lit drawing-room, where {{an instant later}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> a very tall, handsome, light-beared man of fifty, the younger brother of the dead scientist. His wild eyes, stained cheeks, and unkempt hair all spoke of the sudden blow which had fallen upon the household. He was hardly {{articulate}} as he spoke of it.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> a short, stout man whose olive face and coal-black hair proclaimed his Southern origin, though his speech was that of an educated Englishman. He shook hands eagerly with Sherlock Holmes, and his dark eyes sparkled with {{pleasure}} when he understood that the specialist was anxious to hear his story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Monsieur Duchesne {{himself was}} in town, and madame, Myra, and I had just time {{to gain the}} forest. There <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> Dinah, who did {{everything}} for us. Madame was attacked by fever, but fortunately Dinah knew of a very safe place of refuge. She did everything for us, fetched up provisions, concocted medicine, and after being ten days in hiding, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to get {{them down to the}} town." ...|$|R
60|$|There <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> {{a sturdy}} rascal whom Michelot enlisted into my service, seeing {{that not only}} did my means allow, but the {{enterprise}} upon which I went might perchance demand another body servant. This recruit was a swart, powerfully built man of about my own age; trusty, and a lover of hard knocks, as Michelot--who had long counted him among his friends--assured me. He owned the euphonious name of Abdon.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> {{the whole}} party before the sods were {{laid on the}} graves of the poor; but some time after the silver had been given for the consolations of religion. With melancholy {{reflections}} we mounted to the castle. A---- had been educated in opinions peculiarly favourable to England; but I saw, as we walked mournfully away from the spot, that one fact like this did more to remove the film from her eyes, than volumes of reading.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, general, that <b>was</b> our party; <b>we</b> {{had sent}} forward for some waggons, {{and got into}} Dundee two hours after the skirmish; and as there was a train just going we went on at once, and reached Maritzburg the next morning, where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> some of our party who had come down the day before. As we had made all our plans before leaving Johannesburg, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to start this morning, which was the third after our arrival there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{whenever}} you <b>are</b> ready, <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> the Whimsies, the Growleywogs and the Phanfasms," [...] said Guph; [...] "so {{the conquest of}} Oz is assured without a doubt." ...|$|R
50|$|Netcafe {{opened in}} St Kilda at the Deluxe Café on April 4, 1995, {{inspired}} by the internet café phenomenon {{that was going on}} in Seattle. As Australia’s First Internet Café, founders included Gavin Murray, Rita Arrigo and Christopher Beaumont. Direct from London’s Cyberia <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> Kathryn Phelps and partnerships with Adam Goudie of Standard Computers for hardware and Michael Bethune from Australia Online, Australia’s First ISP for of course our Internet Access. In 1995 it was delivered via a standard analogue phone line using a 9600 Baud US Robotics Modem.|$|R
6000|$|On {{returning}} home <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> the Lord Chief-Commissioner, the Lord Chief Baron, and William Clerk, of gentlemen; and of ladies, Miss Adam and young Miss Thomson of Charlton. Also the two Miss Kerrs, Lord Robert's daughters, and so behold us a gallant Christmas party, full of mirth and harmony. Moreover, Captain John Ferguson came over from Huntly Burn, so {{we spent the}} day jocundly. I intend to take a holiday or two while these friends are about us. I have worked hard enough to merit it, and ...|$|R
40|$|Yo nerds, [...] [...] On today’s show <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> UAA’s {{most famous}} {{librarian}} and radio DJ, Deb Mole (aka Deb the Librarian).

Keep those ear holes listening...|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} {{afterwards}} our long-talked-of excursion to Gunong Sari took place. Our party was increased by {{the captain and}} supercargo of a Hamburg ship loading with rice for China. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> mounted on a very miscellaneous lot of Lombock ponies, which we had some difficulty in supplying with the necessary saddles, etc.; {{and most of us}} had to patch up our girths, bridles, or stirrup-leathers as best we could. We passed through Mataram, where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> our friend Gusti Gadioca, mounted on a handsome black horse, and riding as all the natives do, without saddle or stirrups, using only a handsome saddlecloth and very ornamental bridle.|$|R
50|$|Katie explained: After {{being asked}} to do the 10th annual Brisbane concert series ‘Woman in Voice’ with my mother, Martin Buzacott from The Queensland Symphony Orchestra {{suggested}} we make an album with the orchestra under the baton of conductor Guy Noble. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> some of the finest jazz musicians, the wonderful orchestra and a great jazz horn section led by the beautiful trumpeter John Hoffman, and making this album was a pure joy. With the wonderful guidance of Lyle Chan and the recording prowess of Virginia Read we made this album live. Post release Mum and I had the great honour of touring Australia playing with our finest orchestras.|$|R
60|$|There {{was some}} livelier thronging {{at the station}} where the train stopped for luncheon, but secure with the pretty rush-basket which the head waiter at our hotel, {{so much better than}} the hotel, had {{furnished}} us at starting, we kept to our car; and there presently <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> a young couple who were unmistakably a new married couple. The man was of a rich brown, and the woman of a dead white with dead black hair. They both might have been better-looking than they were, but apparently not better otherwise, for at Seville the groom helped us out of the car with our hand-bags.|$|R
5000|$|In a rare late nineties {{interview}} about their hedonistic lifestyle, Sagar Sarkar {{is quoted as}} saying: [...] "The jams we've had were centered around three guys: Nirmal Chandra Kumar, Samuel Wilson and Zubin Balsara. The other prominent guys were Devendra Gautam Singh, Naveen Shastri and Rohit Nagarkatti. We ran a circuit using little known Pune venues like Nadikinara, Madhur Milan, Jaws, our respective homes and the houses of anybody who'd cooperate. Anyone who knew about our venues were free to just carry their booze, instruments and tune in! Many a time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> guests at our sessions, namely guitarists Sanjay Joseph, Milind Mulick, Jayant Sankrityayana, Ashdin Bharucha, and bassist Jacob Panicker." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{my return}} from Melrose Abbey, Scott {{proposed}} a ramble {{to show me}} something of the surrounding country. As we sallied forth, every dog in the establishment turned out to attend us. There was the old stag-hound Maida, that I have already mentioned, a noble animal, and a great favorite of Scott's, and Hamlet, the black greyhound, a wild, thoughtless youngster, not yet arrived to the years of discretion; and Finette, a beautiful setter, with soft, silken hair, long pendent ears, and a mild eye, the parlor favorite. When {{in front of the}} house, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> a superannuated greyhound, who came from the kitchen wagging his tail, and was cheered by Scott as an old friend and comrade.|$|R
60|$|I could not, for {{the life}} of me, keep that strange tone out of my voice. Silas Foster, obtuse as were his sensibilities, seemed to feel the ghastly earnestness that was {{conveyed}} in it as well as Hollingsworth did. He immediately withdrew his head, and I heard him yawning, muttering to his wife, and again yawning heavily, while he hurried on his clothes. Meanwhile I showed Hollingsworth a delicate handkerchief, marked with a well-known cipher, and told where I had found it, and other circumstances, which had filled me with a suspicion so terrible that I left him, if he dared, to shape it out for himself. By the time my brief explanation <b>was</b> finished, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> Silas Foster in his blue woollen frock.|$|R
6000|$|I {{hastened to}} carry the {{intelligence}} of these strange proceedings to Perdita; and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> soon <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> Raymond. He looked gloomy and perturbed. My sister was struck by my narrative: [...] "How beyond the imagination of man," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "are the decrees of heaven, wondrous and inexplicable!" ...|$|R
40|$|Duration: 11 minutes FROM THE INTERVIEW: It's not {{by chance}} that President Chavez calls this {{pipeline}} project {{the beginning of}} a "South American consensus", something that could economically link that continent's countries. Using that term is seen a direct challenge to the once-championed "Washington Consensus", which referred to a Free Trade Area for the Americas [...] one that was supposed to extend NAFTA from Alaska to Patagonia. Now some observers say the pipeline points to a Latin America poised to exclude American political and economic influence from the region. To help us sort through the rhetoric, and to put the proposed pipeline into a continental and global context, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> Jonathan Nitzan. He is a Political Economist at York University in Toronto, but this morning, he was in Montreal...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aye, {{and he had}} a way of {{knocking}} his recruits {{into shape}} which would scarce be relished by our good friends here in the west country,' said Saxon. 'I remember that after the leaguer of Salzburg, when we had taken the castle or fortalice of that name, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> some thousand untrained foot, which had been raised in Dalmatia in the Emperor's employ. As they approached our lines with waving of hands and blowing of bugles, old Marshal Hinterlassen discharged a volley of all the cannon upon the walls at them, killing three score and striking great panic into the others. [...] "The rogues must get used to standing fire sooner or later," [...] said he, [...] "so they may as well commence their education at once."' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "At Ambas <b>we</b> <b>were</b> a {{party of}} thirty, under Van Eycken, who sent us [...] into a village to {{ascertain}} if the natives were collecting rubber, and [...] in the contrary case to murder all, including men, women and children. [...] We found the natives sitting peaceably. We asked them what they were [...] doing. They were unable to reply, thereupon we fell upon them all, and [...] killed them without mercy. An hour later <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> Van Eycken, [...] and told him what had been done. He answered: 'It is well, but you [...] have not done enough!' Thereupon he ordered us {{to cut off the}} heads of [...] the men and hang them on the village palisades, also their sexual [...] members, and to hang the women and children on the palisades in the [...] form of a cross." ...|$|R
60|$|A little below this {{junction}} we {{made another}} meeting of yet more account. For there <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> the Aisne, already a far- travelled river and {{fresh out of}} Champagne. Here ended the adolescence of the Oise; this was his marriage day; thenceforward he had a stately, brimming march, conscious of his own dignity and sundry dams. He became a tranquil feature in the scene. The trees and towns saw themselves in him, as in a mirror. He carried the canoes lightly on his broad breast; {{there was no need}} to work hard against an eddy: but idleness became the order of the day, and mere straightforward dipping of the paddle, now on this side, now on that, without intelligence or effort. Truly <b>we</b> <b>were</b> coming into halcyon weather upon all accounts, and were floated towards the sea like gentlemen.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> no stragglers {{from the}} village, {{for the weather}} was cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, {{darkness}} coming on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard. There <b>we</b> <b>were</b> stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's hand, while {{two or three of}} his men dispersed themselves among the graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate {{at the side of the}} churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.|$|R
60|$|Starting at six, {{the column}} reached Jar, a march of eight miles, at about ten o'clock. Here <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> a {{wing of the}} 24th Punjaub Infantry, who were coming up to relieve the Royal West Kents. The camp at Jar has the {{disadvantage}} of being commanded by a hill to the north, and the Salarzais, another pestilent tribe, whose name alone is an infliction, delight to show their valour by firing at the troops during the night. Of course this could be prevented by moving the camp {{out of range of}} this hill. But then, unfortunately, it would be commanded by another hill to the south, from which the Shamozai section of the Utman Khels--to whom my former remarks also apply--would be able to amuse themselves. The inconvenience of the situation had therefore to be faced.|$|R
60|$|We lay {{some time}} in the Niagara, the {{commodore}} going to the harbour to get the Pike ready. Captain Crane took the rest of us off Kingston, where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> the commodore, and made sail again for the Niagara. Here Colonel Scott embarked with a body of troops, and we went to Burlington Bay to carry the heights. They were found to be too strong; and the men, after landing, returned to the vessels. We then went to York, again, and took possession of the place a second time. Here we destroyed several boats, and stores, set fire to the barracks, and did the enemy a good deal of damage otherwise; after which we left the place. Two or three days later we crossed the lake and landed the soldiers, again, at Fort Niagara.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis Sir Edgar {{who should}} tell the tale," [...] Albert said, [...] "for indeed I know but little {{about it from}} the time I saw you lowered over the wall. Things went well {{with us for a}} time; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> more men, and were strong enough to divide into two parties, Edgar going to the right while I went to the left. We cleared the wall for some distance, and methinks had there been ladders, so that <b>we</b> could have <b>been</b> helped more quickly, the town would have been won, but the enemy were {{reinforced}} more quickly than <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> and <b>we</b> began to lose ground. Then came a body of knights who beat us back till <b>we</b> <b>were</b> close {{to the point where the}} ladders were set. Then a knight made at me with a mace. I saw his arms raised, and after that I knew nothing more." ...|$|R
