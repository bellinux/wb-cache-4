Due to strong competition {{it is necessary}} to find possibilities, how to be different from other e-shops. Such competition advantage can be reached with higher level of logistic services. Types of logistic chains {{that can be used in}} electronic commerce are defined in Thesis. Work of particular members of chain is described as well. Thesis also deals with evolution of e-commerce and various kinds of online retailers. I focused in great detail on function of e-shop that works according to pull-principle. Processes of this e-shop was compared with processes of e-shop that sell. goods from its stocks. The aim of this comparison was to find competition advantage that can be transfered to e-shop working <b>without</b> <b>stocks.</b> The last passage of Thesis deals with possibility of outsourcing that can make better services of e-shops...|$|E

To achieve this availability the firms make use of logistics activities. These have known continuous developments alongside economic, technical, technological etc. progress that determine transformation in a very competitive branch. This fact it is happening into a context of prevailing rivalry, the globalization process extant leading to a great e extent of dislocation, externalizations and subcontracting of activities, developing of some production modes <b>without</b> <b>stocks</b> or with reduced stocks, flows optimization for obtaining the minimum possible cost. In response to such tendencies, it is emphasized the tendency to develop business partnerships, which transform the logistics from an internal enterprise sector into a sector based on cooperation with external entities as supply chains forms. A basic link of any supply chain is represented by warehousing activity. In the new supply chains development context the warehousing activity is transforming from a passive one, with a simple objective of providing products stocking, into an active one, in which it pursues the achievement of an assembly of services for clients. More and more warehouses are also exploited by logistics services providers {{that are involved in}} different logistics activities destined to reduce total logistics cost, with favorable influences on selling price and on firms competitiveness too. warehouse, logistics, supply chain, flow, logistics services provider...|$|E

One {{option is}} to transfer the patient to a urology ward, but often there are outstanding medical issues that require continued specialist input. Here, we describe an improved system for delivering temporary bladder irrigation by utilizing readily available components and the novel modification of a sphygmomanometer blub. This option is good for bladder irrigation in patients with moderate or severe gross hematuria due to various causes. Materials and methods: In this prospective study from March 2007 to April 2009, we used our new system in eligible cases. In this system, an irrigant bag with 1 L of normal saline was suspended 80 cm above the indwelled 3 -way Foley catheter, and its drainage tube was inserted into the irrigant port of the catheter. To increase the flow rate of the irrigant system, we inserted a traditional sphygmomanometer bulb {{at the top of}} the irrigant bag. This closed system was used for continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) in patients who underwent open prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), or transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB). This high-pressure system is also used for irrigation during cystourethroscopy, internal urethrotomy, and transurethral lithotripsy. Our 831 eligible cases were divided into two groups: group 1 were endourologic cases and group 2 were open prostatectomy, TURP, and TURB cases. The maximum and average flow rates were evaluated. The efficacy of our new system was compared prospectively with the previous traditional system used in 545 cases. Results: In group 1, we had clear vision at the time of endourologic procedures. The success rate of this system was 99. 5 %. In group 2, the incidence of clot retention decreased two-fold in comparison to traditional gravity-dependent bladder flow system. These changes were statistically significant (P = 0. 001). We did not observe any adverse effects such as bladder perforation due to our high-pressure, high-flow system. Conclusion: A pressurized irrigant system has better visualization during endourologic procedures, and prevents clot formation after open prostatectomy, TURP, and TURB without any adverse effects.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Timber Resource Inventory Model (TRIM) is a {{computer}} model used by the U. S. D. A. Forest Service in assessing {{the state of the}} Nation's forest resources and the forests' probable future conditions. TRIM is a yield table projection system designed and developed to model forest inventory changes over time in response to different levels of management and to removals from either large or small forested areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the sensitivity of regional timber availability projections to yield table assumptions and various silvicultural impacts. Yields were projected under various management assumptions. In addition, the yield projections themselves were tested by projecting yields with and without approach to normality. A literature survey was conducted to assess work previously done with changes in management assumptions, model sensitivity, and approach to normality (i. e., stocking adjustment). In the short run, the projections were constrained by current inventory, growth functions, and harvest levels. In the long run, projections were constrained by growth functions and harvest levels. Inventory projections for all species and combined ownership varied both in trend and in degree between runs in both the long and the short run. Growth trends for all species and combined ownership showed normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields <b>without</b> <b>stocking</b> adjustment paralleling each other in both the long and the short run. Growth for managed yields with stocking adjustment exceed the two previous management intensities in both the long and the short run. Empirical yields <b>without</b> <b>stocking</b> adjustment are far below normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields <b>without</b> <b>stocking</b> adjustment in the short run, but the three projections converge in the long run. It was shown that the difference between runs with and <b>without</b> <b>stocking</b> adjustment is appreciable in both the short and the long run. Limitations of TRIM include the fact that it is difficult to use for the uninitiated, harvest levels are set, and the stocking adjustment function is relatively inflexible...|$|R

40|$|During the lasts two decades, the {{employee}} stock option plans (ESOPs) have become {{more important in the}} global remuneration polices to first level executives. As a consequence of this, the repurchase activity has been increased to face the exercise of those options. This text is committed to give the reader a general overview of the ESOPs and share repurchases (SR), as well as analyse the current situation in some of the biggest companies in Sweden. To do this, the following report is divided in two main parts; first it will be introduced “why” and “when” ESOPs are profitable for the company and which facts could influence a company to start a buyback of own shares. The second part will introduce the data collected from the annual reports of the Swedish companies and will analyse if the fact of having an ESOP implemented influences the choice on the benefits distribution method. Considering the tightly relation between share repurchases and dividends distributions, this text includes a small summary {{of the impact of the}} ESOPs in the dividends polices. For that reason, the database also includes data regarding to the share yields and profit distribution. After having analysed all the data collected, the results point to a non-influence of the Employee Stock Option Plans on the benefits distribution method. Thus, a significant difference between the fraction of total number of shares repurchased and the dividend yield in companies with and those <b>without</b> outstanding <b>stock</b> options among their managerial group cannot be confirmed. Although having found a non-significant difference on the dividend treatment between companies with and <b>without</b> <b>stock</b> options, a weak negative relation between the magnitude of the ESOP and the dividend yield was found for those companies with stock options among their managerial group. Moreover, after having divided the sample depending on the type of stock options their managerial group held, the results show a slight difference between those companies with outstanding warrants and employee options; and those <b>without</b> <b>stock</b> options. Despite this fact, it is not possible to assert a real influence of these facts due to a not enough number of observations gathered for the sample...|$|R
