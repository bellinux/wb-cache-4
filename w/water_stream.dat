After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the <b>water</b> <b>stream,</b> and the other ray opposite to the direction of the <b>water</b> <b>stream.</b> After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The interference pattern can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E

25|$|Gitton's design {{relies on}} gravity {{powering}} multiple siphons {{in the same}} principle as the Pythagorean cup; for example, after the water level in the minute or hour display tubes is reached, an overflow tube starts {{to act as a}} siphon and thus empties the display tube. Actual time keeping is done by a calibrated pendulum powered by a <b>water</b> <b>stream</b> piped from the clock's reservoir. The pendulum has a carefully constructed container attached to it; this measures the water that is then poured into the display system. There are other modern designs of water clocks, including the Royal Gorge water clock in Colorado, the Woodgrove Mall in Nanaimo, British Columbia, and the Hornsby Water Clock in Sydney, Australia.|$|E
25|$|There were 245 {{feminine}} and 24 masculine nouns in this class. 6 nouns have common gender: (the first three {{can also be}} attributed to masculine gender) palikuõnis 2, 34b 'progeny, offspring', grobuõnis 2, 3a 'predator', žiniuõnis 2, 4 'knower; witchdoctor', delsuonìs 3b 'who is dallying', giežuonìs 3b 'tiresome, sour (person)', vagìs 4 'thief'. Some other -uonis words are attributed to a masculine gender, for example, geluonìs 3b (2) – sting, deguõnis 2 (3b) (here in the table given as 3b, while 2 accentuation pattern is probably more used) – oxygen. A word vinìs f, c 4 'nail, spike' is also sometimes understood as of common gender. The singular dative is -iui for the common gender, like in masculine nouns. The biggest part of these words have -t- stem. The second accentuation pattern is the rarest, among its examples are: durys pl. 2 'door', slistis 2 (4) 'simulation', gaištis 2, 4 'dallying' (the two latter can also be accentuated in the fourth paradigm), masculine: pirmuõnys pl. – protozoa, deguõnis (3b) – oxygen.

25|$|The PT-76 is amphibious, {{it has a}} flat, boat-shaped hull {{which is}} hermetical and ensures minimal {{resistance}} when the tank is afloat. It can swim after switching on the two electric bilge pumps, erecting the trim vane which improves the vehicle's stability and displacement {{in the water and}} prevents water from flooding into the bow of the tank. Switching the driver's periscope for a swimming periscope enables the driver to see over the trim vane. When not in use the trim vane is stowed {{in the front of the}} bow over the barrel of the main gun and serves as additional armor. Bilge pumps keep the tank afloat even if it leaks or is damaged. There is a manual bilge pump for emergency use. The tank is propelled through the water by two hydrojets, one on each side of the hull, with the inlets underneath the hull and the outlets at the rear. There are also additional assistant water-jet inlets on both sides of the hull over the last road wheels. The rear outlets have lids that can be fully or partially closed, redirecting the <b>water</b> <b>stream</b> to the forward-directed outlets at the sides of the hull, thus enabling the vehicle to turn or go in reverse. To turn to the left for example, the left water-jet is covered, to turn to the right, the right water-jet is covered. To make a 180° turn, one water-jet sucks in water while the other pushes it out. This system was designed by N. Konowalow. It is the same system as the one used in the BTR-50 APC, which was based on the PT-76. The tank can swim at up to 10.2km/h and has a range of 100km. It can cross most water obstacles and can also swim in the sea. However, its amphibious design makes it disproportionally large for a vehicle of its weight and allows less armor protection than other light tanks.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, Glidden sent a sample of Julian's {{isolated}} soy protein to National Foam System Inc. (today a unit of Kidde Fire Fighting), which used it to develop Aer-O-Foam, the U.S. Navy's beloved fire-fighting [...] "bean soup." [...] While it was not exactly Julian's brainchild, his meticulous care {{in the preparation of}} the soy protein made the fire fighting foam possible. When a hydrolyzate of isolated soy protein was fed into a <b>water</b> <b>stream,</b> the mixture was converted into a foam by means of an aerating nozzle. The soy protein foam was used to smother oil and gasoline fires aboard ships and was particularly useful on aircraft carriers. It saved the lives of thousands of sailors and airmen. Citing this achievement, in 1947 the NAACP awarded Julian the Spingarn Medal, its highest honor.|$|E
500|$|Solidified lava from Grande Ronde {{members of}} the Columbia River Basalt Group {{underlie}} Forest Park. About 16million years ago during the Middle Miocene, the Columbia River ran through a lowland south of its modern channel. Eruptions from linear vents in eastern Oregon and Washington flowed down this channel through what later became the Willamette Valley. These flows, some of which reached the Pacific Ocean, recurred at intervals between 16.5 and 15.6million years ago and covered almost [...] About eight separate Grande Ronde Basalt flows have been mapped in the Tualatin Mountains (West Hills), where they underlie the steepest slopes of Forest Park and form the columned rocks visible along Balch Creek Canyon and Northwest Cornell Road.

40|$|Pinch Analysis, in the {{broadest}} sense, {{is concerned with the}} optimal use of resources (material or energy) in a multi-process system. Pinch Analysis based techniques have emerged for water systems over the past decade. A major assumption that has been made in applying these techniques is that a process system can be segregated into a set of process streams and a set of <b>water</b> <b>streams.</b> With this distinction in place, only the <b>water</b> <b>streams</b> are considered in the Pinch Analysis with the process streams represented implicitly. This approach has obvious limitations in situations where a clear distinction between process <b>streams</b> and <b>water</b> <b>streams</b> cannot be made. The chlor-alkali process {{is an example of a}} system in which the clear distinction between process <b>streams</b> and <b>water</b> <b>streams</b> cannot be made. Water is intrinsically involved in the process, serving as a carrier medium for raw materials and eventually becoming part of the products produced by the complex. Hydrochloric acid and caustic soda are reagents which are both used within and produced by the complex. These reagents are required by the process at a range of concentrations and the concentrated reagent is diluted to the required concentration...|$|R

500|$|The {{digestive}} tract of typical bivalves {{consists of an}} oesophagus, stomach, and intestine. A number of digestive glands open into the stomach, often via a pair of diverticula; these secrete enzymes to digest food in the stomach, but also include cells that phagocytose food particles, and digest them intracellularly. In filter-feeding bivalves, an elongated rod of solidified mucus {{referred to as the}} [...] "crystalline style" [...] projects into the stomach from an associated sac. Cilia in the sac cause the style to rotate, winding in a stream of food-containing mucus from the mouth, and churning the stomach contents. This constant motion propels food particles into a sorting region {{at the rear of the}} stomach, which distributes smaller particles into the digestive glands, and heavier particles into the intestine. Waste material is consolidated in the rectum and voided as pellets into the exhalent <b>water</b> <b>stream</b> through an anal pore. Feeding and digestion are synchronized with diurnal and tidal cycles.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] Rotary vane pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These rotary vane pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke.
