50|$|The <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove</b> {{resembles the}} closely related grey-fronted dove (Leptotila rufaxilla), which prefers humid forest habitats. The best distinctions are the greyer {{forehead}} and crown, which contrast less with the hindcrown {{than in the}} grey-fronted dove. In the area of overlap, the <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove</b> usually has a blue (not red) eye-ring, {{but this is not}} reliable in some parts of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, where it typically is red in both species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove</b> (Leptotila verreauxi) {{is a large}} New World {{tropical}} dove. Its {{scientific name}} commemorates the French naturalists Jules and Edouard Verreaux.|$|E
50|$|The {{grey-fronted dove}} {{is very similar}} to the closely related <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove,</b> Leptotila verreauxi, which, in the area of overlap, prefers more open, drier, woodland.|$|E

50|$|The Lower Coast section {{which lies}} around the Rio Grande offers its own species diversity. South Padre Island and the Laguna Madre areas feature {{magnificent}} frigatebirds, bridled terns, and Cory’s shearwater. Further up the Rio Grande around Santa Ana and McAllen {{one can find}} elf owls, <b>white-tipped</b> <b>doves,</b> green jays, green kingfishers, and Mississippi kite. The brown pelican is found especially on South Padre Island {{in addition to other}} locations on the coast. The inland areas around Zapata are home to white-collared seedeaters, lesser goldfinch, ash-throated flycatchers, and black-tailed gnatcatchers.|$|R
40|$|Vocalizations and {{breeding}} habits of <b>White-tipped</b> <b>Doves</b> Leptotila verreauxi were studied in {{a site in}} Buenos Aires Province. Two adult calls and nestling vocalizations are recognized and depicted in sonograms. The breeding season spans at least 162 days, shorter than in other local pigeons and doves. Nest sites included deserted buildings. Second eggs in c 1 utches in which the laying order was known were heavier and darker. The laying interval was between 24 and 36 h., the incubation period 14 days, and the nestling period up to 17 days. A banded pair reared 3 successful broods in one season. Nesting success was 50 % for nests in buildings, and 23 % in other sites. F 1 edglings have grey orbital skins and ferrugineous edges in the wing feathers...|$|R
50|$|The <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove</b> {{is usually}} seen singly or in pairs, and is rather wary. Its flight is fast and direct, with the regular beats and {{clattering}} of the wings which {{are characteristic of}} pigeons in general. The call is a deep hollow ooo-wooooo.|$|E
5000|$|He is commemorated in {{the names}} of Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii [...] ), Verreaux's coua (Coua verreauxi [...] ), Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi [...] ), the <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove</b> (Leptotila verreauxi [...] ), the golden parrotbill (Paradoxornis verreauxi [...] ), Verreaux's skink (Anomalopus verreauxii [...] ), and the Andaman giant gecko (Gekko verreauxi [...] ).|$|E
50|$|It is best {{distinguished}} from the <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove</b> by the buffier lower face and the more contrasting, bluish-grey crown. Another feature is the red (not blue) eye-ring of the grey-fronted dove, {{but this is not}} reliable in all parts of Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay, where it typically is red in both.|$|E
50|$|The Key West quail-dove is {{approximately}} 27-31 cm in length. The bird is distinguished {{by having a}} dark rust colored back and similarly colored wings. It has some amethyst or bronze green iridescence on its crown, nape {{and in the back}} of its neck. The mantle, back, rump and inner wing coverts show some purplish red iridescence. It also has a bold white facial stripe. Its call is similar that of the <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its diet {{includes}} rodents, lizards, {{and other}} small animals. Rodent prey items include rats (Rattus sp.), the hairy-tailed bolo mouse (Necromys lasiurus), the house mouse (Mus musculus), the small vesper mouse (Calomys laucha), the delicate vesper mouse (Calomys tener), and hocicudos (Oxymycterus sp.). It will eat the lizard Tropidurus itambere {{and it has been}} observed taking <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove</b> nestlings (Leptotila sp.). Lizards it will swallow alive but rodents it often constricts first.|$|E
50|$|It has an {{approximate}} length of 28 cm and a weight of 155 g. Adult have a blue-grey crown, a whitish forehead and a grey neck showing purple iridescence. They have a whitish throat and the eye-ring is red. The upperparts and wings are grey-brown, and the underparts are whitish shading to pinkish-buff on the chest. The underwing coverts are rufous. The white tip to the tail is narrower {{than in the}} <b>white-tipped</b> <b>dove.</b> The bill is black, the legs red and the iris is yellow. L. r. hellmayrii has a paler forehead and darker, more rufous, breast.|$|E
