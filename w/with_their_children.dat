5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

STUDY DESIGN:We present data from a larger retrospective study involving bereaved parents {{of a child who}} died of cancer. Parents were asked whether they had discussed the impending death <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> whether they reflected on this discussion positively, their reasons for not discussing death <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> {{and the manner in which}} the conversation regarding death occurred. The data were analyzed qualitatively using a framework approach. RESULTS:Of the 86 parents of 56 children who answered the questions regarding discussing death <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> 55 parents of 35 children did not discuss the impending death <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> The following themes were identified: the parents' inability to discuss the impending death; the parents' desire to protect their child; views regarding talking with children; parents' views of child characteristics; the child's unwillingness to discuss the subject; lack of opportunity to talk; and the child's disability. The parents who did discuss death <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> generally used symbolic and/or religious narratives, or they had brief, direct conversations regarding death. The majority of parents felt positive regarding their decision about whether to talk <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> about his/her impending death.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [121]- 126) The {{meaning that}} families give {{to a family}} member's disability is crucial to their management of the experience. However, very little research has examined the perceptions of families participating in family-centered early intervention treatment programs for children with disabilities. Qualitative methodology was utilized to explore the perceptions of parents participating in the Family-Based Treatment Program for <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> speech- language disability. The findings emerged into the following three categories: (1) emotions experienced by parents, (2) the ways that parents coped with disability, and (3) parental togetherness. First, parents experienced intense emotions such as anger, worry, guilt, powerlessness, and disappointment {{in the process of}} dealing <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> disability. Second, parents coped <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> disability by changing their definitions of the problem as well as benefitting from the strategies utilized in the Family-Based Treatment Program. Third, fathers began to participate more in the daily care of <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> disability as a result of involvement in the Family-Based Treatment Program. In addition, the degree of similarity in parents' definitions of <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> disability impacted <b>their</b> relationship <b>with</b> each other. These findings were linked with the literature on family stress and coping, and theory was formulated to account for parents’ experience <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> disability {{within the context of the}} Family-Based Treatment Program. The findings have important implications for how family-centered early intervention programs that treat disabilities should be designed. In addition to utilizing the substantial family stress and coping literature, programs should also incorporate the following strategies that parents used to cope <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> disability in the study: encouraging family participation, facilitating open communication among family members, seeking family members' opinions, and modelling techniques for working <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> disability.

40|$|Understanding the {{experiences}} of parents <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> intervention might help {{meet the needs of}} parents and, subsequently get them engaged in <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> intervention.

The aim of this mixed studies review was to give an overview of {{the experiences}} and related factors of parents of young children (0 – 5 years of age) with cerebral palsy in relation to the physical and/or occupational therapy of <b>their</b> <b>child</b> in a rehabilitation setting. The literature was searched systematically for qualitative and quantitative studies published between January 1990 and July 2011. Inclusion criteria were (1) the study population consisted of parents of children with cerebral palsy, with at least 25 % of children under the age of five; (2) children had received physical and/or occupational therapy in a rehabilitation setting; and (3) {{the experiences of}} the parents <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> therapy were addressed. Data were synthesized with the framework synthesis method resulting in a conceptual framework describing the factors that are related to the parents’ experiences <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> interventions. A total of 13 studies (eight qualitative and five quantitative) were included and evaluated. Parents expressed various aspects in context, process and outcomes when asked about <b>their</b> experiences <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> intervention. They had different needs over time and needed time to build a collaborative relationship <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> therapists. The proposed framework acknowledges the various aspects in context, process and outcomes that parents reported when asked about their experiences. Knowing this, the importance of the broader context of the child in a family should be acknowledged; realizing the impact that the demands of daily life, supports and resources provided to parents, attitudes in the community and culture have on parental experiences...|$|R
