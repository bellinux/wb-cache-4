5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habré would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure a definitive victory without Libyan armor and airpower.|$|E

However, in September 2015 Doctor Who Magazine confirmed that the much-delayed DVD, now scheduled for October 26, was instead to contain tele-snap reconstructions of the missing episodes 1 and 4.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, Talbot {{appeared}} as a special guest at the African Children's Choir concert in Walsall, UK. It was announced that Talbot <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ambassador for the African Children's Choir and have a school named after her.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, 1998, Discover Card {{replaced}} ITT Corporation as {{the operator}} and {{sponsor of the}} top-most screen on One Times Square {{as part of a}} ten-year deal. The deal came alongside the announcement that Discover Card <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> official sponsor of Times Square's New Year's Eve 2000 festivities.|$|E
50|$|Each {{panellist}} {{would present}} {{a different type}} of puzzle. In general, one <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> numerical puzzle, one <b>would</b> <b>be</b> literal (i.e. <b>a</b> word puzzle) and one <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> logic puzzle.|$|R

5|$|Subway {{service would}} be {{extended}} eastward along Hillside Avenue to Little Neck Parkway. The line <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{extension of the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line as a four-track line to 212th Street, {{and then as a}} 2-track line to its terminus at Little Neck Parkway. The segment to 184th Street was to have cost $3,455,000, while the segment to 212th Street was to have cost $16,355,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, 1983, LeMond won the World Championship outright, {{becoming the}} first American rider to do so. LeMond's cycling talent—his overall strength, climbing ability, ability to ride a fast time trial and his capacity to recover quickly—all suggested LeMond <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> excellent prospect for the most demanding Grand Tours.|$|E

5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> elephant–mammoth hybrid, {{and the process}} {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|Air is {{a romance}} visual novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of three characters. Much of its {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Air follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. With the consumer ports, if an undesired choice was selected, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> option to rewind the story to correct the mistake. However, if the player reaches a bad end to a storyline, the player does not have this option and must reload the game at the last saved point.|$|E
5|$|Although Bo was {{initially}} unhappy about his reassignment in Chongqing, he soon resolved {{to use his}} new position as a staging ground {{for a return to}} higher national office. Bo made no secret of his desire to enter the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) during the 18th Party Congress in autumn 2012, as all but two of the PSC members—including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao—were expected to retire. The transition <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for Bo to join the highest echelon of national leadership, likely as a replacement for ally Zhou Yongkang, secretary of the Central Political and Legislative Committee, serving {{as the head of the}} party's security apparatus.|$|E

5000|$|In {{combinatorial}} game theory, <b>a</b> fuzzy game <b>is</b> <b>a</b> game which <b>is</b> incomparable {{with the}} zero game: {{it is not}} greater than 0, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> win for Left; nor less than 0 which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> win for Right; nor equal to 0 which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> win for the second player to move.

5|$|An archbishopric in Mercia {{would also}} {{reinforce}} the kingdom's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury {{in the kingdom}} of Kent, which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control. Jænberht supported the Kentish king Egbert II, who was not known as a firm supporter of Offa's; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> impediment to Offa's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England. By elevating another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury. Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo-Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric, when Ecgbert became the first Archbishop of York.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the {{garrison}} was strengthened and MacArthur ordered {{the establishment of}} new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for {{an attack on the}} Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the seizure of the Tulagi area, would be conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.|$|E
5|$|Architects and conservationists {{argued that}} the pier was architecturally {{significant}} to Hong Kong {{as one of the}} last remaining examples of a Streamline Moderne public building (along with the Central Market and Wan Chai Market which have been earmarked for demolition); culturally the pier was widely recognised as a part of local collective memory. The Hong Kong Institute of Architects warned against the destruction of Hong Kong's heritage, saying it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> irreversible mistake. Public opinion has resulted in alternatives put forward to preserve the clock tower, including moving the proposed six-lane road or relocating the clock tower {{to the front of the}} new pier as a memorial.|$|E

5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be inclined to question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships. Unless the person has asked for such psychosocial intervention – or at least freely consented to such questioning – this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ethically unjustifiable intrusion into the patient's personal affairs (analogous to providing drugs without the patient's informed consent).|$|E
5|$|As the stadium's {{construction}} got underway, the NFL {{began to}} search for an owner for the team, which the league decided <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> expansion franchise March 23, 1998. A litany of potential owners lined up, including Kosar and a group backed partly by HBO founder Charles Dolan, comedian Bill Cosby and former Miami coach Don Shula. The ultimate winner was Al Lerner, the Baltimore man who had helped Modell in 1986 by buying a small stake in the Browns. A seven-member NFL expansion committee awarded the team to Lerner for $530 million in September 1998. Lerner, then 65 years old, had a majority share, while Carmen Policy, who helped build the 49ers dynasty of the 1980s, owned 10% of the team and was to run football operations.|$|E

This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. Flemming Rose, culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.|$|E
