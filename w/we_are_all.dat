5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> used to enjoy.|$|E

25|$|Interrelatedness – Adler {{used the}} term The Ethical Manifold to refer to his {{conception}} of the universe as made up of myriad unique and indispensable moral agents (individual human beings), each of whom has an inestimable influence on all the others.

25|$|In 1983, Noel Tichy {{wrote that}} because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> beings of habit {{we tend to}} repeat what we are {{comfortable}} with. He wrote {{that this is a}} trap that constrains our creativity, prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full complexity of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and corporate culture.|$|E

25|$|Havel’s message, “We are all responsible, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> guilty,” was not popular. He {{enacted a}} general amnesty {{for all but}} the most serious criminals, apologized on behalf of Czechoslovakia for the post-World War II {{expulsion}} of the Sudeten Germans and resisted demands for a more draconian purge of secret police collaborators. These things were not popular either. And as the government undertook privatization and restitution, Havel confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption and robber baron capitalism. He saw his country fall apart (if bloodlessly), becoming in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia.|$|E
25|$|Laughlin wrote, directed, {{and starred}} in The Young Sinner. Originally filmed in 1960, and shot in Milwaukee {{over a period of}} 14 days, {{it is the story of}} a star high school athlete who falls deeper and deeper into trouble after being caught in bed with his girlfriend. The film was {{intended}} to be the first of a trilogy entitled <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>All</b> Christ. It premiered in 1963 under the original title Among the Thorns, which was changed to The Young Sinner upon its 1965 re-release. In 1960, Laughlin planned to make a film, Poison in Our Land, based on the true story of a Texas couple affected by atomic radiation, but the project was never realized.|$|E
25|$|In a very {{definite}} sense, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> beneficiaries {{from the}} life of Fr. Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed on to us a spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has given us a share of dauntless bravery– of body and soul. He has transmitted to every one of us a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy– godlessness, now stalking the world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul– the spirit of one who loved and served God and man– even unto death.|$|E

25|$|If any brother, being {{priest or}} deacon or {{of any other}} {{clerical}} order, shall commit any offense, and this shall come to {{the knowledge of the}} Prior or the Master, the brethren whom the Prior shall select for the court shall judge with righteous judgment and shall impose a penance of seven days or even of forty according to the gravity of the fault, just {{as in the case of}} other brethren who are not in holy orders. For, seeing that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> of one religion and all, both clergy and laymen, make the same profession, it seems unfitting that there should be any distinction between brethren within the Hospital. Wherefore it is ordered that, as we live under one rule, so also we ought to be subject to the same judges of the rule.|$|E
25|$|Why {{is it that}} we {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities until we reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E
25|$|You write: „in {{order to}} avoid {{unnecessary}} bloodshed“. Who {{is the cause of}} this bloodshed? We or you? Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E
