40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a semantic model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and investigates its {{applications for the}} analysis and design <b>of</b> programming languages. <b>Inheritance</b> is a mechanism for incremental programming {{in the presence of}} self-reference. This interpretation <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> is formalized using traditional techniques of fixed-point theory, resulting in a compositional model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> that is directly applicable to object-oriented languages. Novel applications <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> revealed by the model are illustrated to show that inheritance has wider significance beyond object-oriented class inheritance. Constraints induced by self-reference and inheritance are investigated using type theory and yield a formal characterization of abstract classes and a demonstration that the subtype relation is a direct consequence of the basic mechanism <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The model is proven equivalent to the operational semantics <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> embodied by the interpreters of object-oriented languages like Smalltalk. Concise descriptions <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> behavior in several object-oriented languages, including Smalltalk, Beta, Simula, and Flavors, are presented in a common framework that facilitates direct comparison of their features...|$|R

Our findings indicate that the period under examination is characterised by a substantial increase in the flow <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> This increase, which was particularly marked in the early 2000 s, was mainly driven by the rise in house prices {{and to a lesser extent}} by the increase in the proportion <b>of</b> <b>inheritances</b> which included housing assets. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> amongst recipients became more unequal over this period. However, the inequality-increasing effect from the greater dispersion in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> was counterbalanced by the increase in the percentage of the population who received an inheritance, resulting in a small decrease in the inequality <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for the population overall. Analysis of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> by socio-economic status suggests a positive association between inheritance and socio-economic status with some suggestive evidence that this association might have strengthened over time.

40|$|The {{affected}} sib-pair {{method has}} been used to investigate the mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> and to estimate the "disease" allele frequency, for a number of HLA-associated diseases. One of the assumptions of the original sib-pair method is that the disease confers no selective disadvantage on affected individuals. This is obviously not the situation for most diseases. We have determined the expected HLA haplotype-sharing distribution among affected sib-pairs when selection against individuals with the disease is taken into account. We have shown that if the mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> the selectively disadvantageous disease is recessive or additive, the original affected sib-pair analysis, ignoring selection, still estimates the true mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> but usually yields an underestimate of the "disease" allele frequency. For intermediate and dominant models of disease predisposition, both the estimates of the degree of penetrance of the "disease" genotypes, and the "disease" allele frequency, are altered if selection is ignored in the analysis. Similarly, allowing for recombination between the "disease" locus and the HLA region does not affect the determination of the mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> the disease if it is recessive or additive; in other cases, however, the estimate of the mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> is affected.

Elucidation <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> pattern <b>of</b> localized aggressive periodontitis may {{permit us to}} {{have a better understanding of}} the disease etiology, thereby allowing improved classification, diagnosis, and treatment of this aggressive type of periodontal disease. This review aims to determine the pattern <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> localized aggressive periodontitis through critical evaluation of literature and to evaluate various genetic analyses for determining the mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Records were searched from various databases such as PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, and EMBASE. Articles published over the past 40 years (1972 – 2012) were identified using the key search terms. A total of 121 records were identified by title/abstracts and were retrieved. Potentially relevant reports identified from the reference lists of review articles and chapters were also hand searched. Eighteen articles met the inclusion criteria, and these studies were assessed independently for the methodology and performance. Each study was scored according to STREGA guidelines. Out of the various patterns <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> reported in literature, 38. 9 % of the studies supported an autosomal recessive mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> whereas 27. 7 % showed X-Linked dominant pattern, 16. 67 % reported autosomal dominant inheritance, 11. 11 % reported a recessive mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> and 5. 56 % showed dominant mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> Thus it can be concluded that even though the inheritance pattern apparently shows an autosomal recessive mode <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> the data are meager to conclude that localized aggressive periodontitis is solely inherited through autosomal recessive mode as there are various other factors playing a hand in the occurrence of the disease.
