5|$|Written by Douglas Camfield, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 22 January 1976. The story would involve the Doctor and Sarah arriving in North Africa at an isolated French Legion outpost. This {{has become the}} battleground for a fight between two alien races, the Skarkel and Khoorians. The story was planned to <b>write</b> <b>out</b> the character of Sarah and would see Sarah killed {{by one of the}} aliens. The first script was submitted on 9 February 1976 and removed from the series schedule in April 1976. Camfield would continue to work on the scripts, delivering the final part on 24 September 1976, but the production team were no longer interested in pursuing the story.|$|E
5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to <b>write</b> <b>out</b> the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E

25|$|The {{inception}} of Darwin's theory occurred during an intensively busy period which began when Charles Darwin {{returned from the}} survey voyage of the Beagle, with {{his reputation as a}} fossil collector and geologist already established.

25|$|Because of {{opposition}} from the British government, a more explicit racial policy was avoided in the legislation, with the control mechanism being a dictation test, which required a person seeking entry to Australia to <b>write</b> <b>out</b> a passage of fifty words dictated to them in any European language, not necessarily English, {{at the discretion of}} an immigration officer. The test was not designed to allow immigration officers to evaluate applicants on the basis of language skills, rather the language chosen was always one known beforehand that the person would fail.|$|E
25|$|From {{that time}} Hamilton {{appears to have}} devoted himself almost wholly to mathematics, though he always kept himself well acquainted with the {{progress}} of science both in Britain and abroad. Hamilton found an important defect in one of Laplace's demonstrations, and he was induced by a friend to <b>write</b> <b>out</b> his remarks, {{so that they could}} be shown to Dr. John Brinkley, then the first Royal Astronomer of Ireland, and an accomplished mathematician.

25|$|Chongryon {{opposes the}} use of the Japanese word Kita-Chosen ("North Korea") as an {{abbreviation}} of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It refers to the country as Kyōwakoku ("The Republic") or Sokoku ("The Fatherland"). In 1972 Chongryon campaigned to get the Japanese media to stop referring to North Korea as Kita-Chosen. This effort was not successful, but as a compromise, most media companies agreed to refer to the DPRK with its full official title at least once in every article. By January 2003, this policy started to be abandoned by most newspapers, starting with Tokyo Shimbun, which announced that it would no longer <b>write</b> <b>out</b> the full name, followed by Asahi, Mainichi and Nikkei.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas II always remembered George and his {{wonderful}} {{sense of}} humour. He would tell great jokes that amused his brother very much. Nicholas would dutifully <b>write</b> <b>out</b> the best jokes on {{pieces of paper}} and save them in a box. Years later, the Tsar would be heard laughing by himself in his room, looking through his old box of George's jokes. George's title as Heir Presumptive was passed to his younger brother, Michael, until the birth, in 1904, of Nicholas' son, Alexei. In 1910, Michael named his newborn son, George, after his late brother. This George would also die young; {{he was killed in}} a car crash in 1931 at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|An {{inhabitant}} {{of ancient}} Troy, {{she was a}} brief companion of the First Doctor. The character was devised {{to act as a}} companion. However this was re-evaluated by the writers and Katarina was killed off during the following serial having appeared in just five episodes. As such, she was the first companion in the series to die. The writers, including producer John Wiles decided to <b>write</b> <b>out</b> Katarina as soon as possible, as they realized the writing challenges that came with the character. The writing challenges included the fact that the character was so very unused to modern concepts. For example, Katarina did not even know what a key was. However, they decided to write her out in the most dramatic way possible.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s {{electronic}} typewriters and later personal computers provided people in China and Japan {{an alternative to}} writing by hand. With {{the advent of the}} World Wide Web in 1991 and the subsequent widespread use of email, internet chat, and discussion forums, people began using computers {{to communicate with each other}} in Chinese and Japanese. Today, increased computer usage and the use of SMS text-messaging, especially among young people, means that a large portion of those people's everyday use of Chinese characters is done using input methods, not by hand. In a 2010 survey by Dayang Net, 43 percent of respondents said they use the computer all the time for their jobs and 43 percent said that they only <b>write</b> <b>out</b> characters by hand when filling out forms or writing their signature.|$|E
25|$|The series began taping in colour in late 1974. This period {{also saw}} the series shift its {{emphasis}} from sexual situations and drama {{to focus more on}} comedy, however by mid-1975 ratings had gone into decline so a bold new storyline was concocted in the hope of revitalising the series. The Mad Bomber storyline, in August–September 1975, came in the wake of news from periodical TV Week that the ratings for Number 96 had dropped to just half what they had been at the beginning of 1974. In an unprecedented move, 40 complete scripts were discarded and rewritten, while the Number 96 set was sealed off to non-essential personnel. The new storyline involved a mysterious figure planting a time bomb in Number 96, following a series of warnings and false alarms. The dramatic storyline was intended to draw back viewers and to provide a mechanism to quickly <b>write</b> <b>out</b> several existing characters in a bid to fresh up the cast of characters and revamp the storylines.|$|E
25|$|Most of the game's dialog and {{script was}} written by Schafer and Erik Wolpaw, {{who at the time}} was a {{columnist}} for the website Old Man Murray. After establishing the game's main characters, Schafer undertook his own exercise to <b>write</b> <b>out</b> how the characters would see themselves and the other characters' on a social media site similar to Friendster, which Schafer was a fan of at the time and from where he met his wife-to-be. This helped him to solidify the characters in his own head prior to writing the game's dialog, as well as providing a means of introducing the characters {{to the rest of the}} development team. To help flesh out character dialog outside of cut scenes, Schafer developed an approach that used dozens of spoken lines by a character that could be stitched together in a random manner by the game as to reduce apparent repetition; such stitching included elements like vocal pauses and coughs that made the dialog sound more natural. Schafer used the camp and woods setting as a natural place that children would want to wander and explore.|$|E

25|$|The seven person crew of STS-131 {{was awakened}} {{to begin their}} first full day in space on Flight Day 2. Due {{to the lack of}} Ku-band communication, changes to the crews daily plan were read up for them to <b>write</b> <b>out.</b> After their post sleep activities, {{commander}} Alan Poindexter and pilot Jim Dutton fired Discoverys Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines to correct and further refine the shuttle's path to the ISS. Astronauts Naoko Yamazaki and Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger began activating and checking out the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) also known as the Canadarm. While Metcalf-Lindenburger and Yamazaki were working with Canadarm, Stephanie Wilson was getting equipment together and set up to record the inspections of the shuttle's heat shield. The inspections were recorded so they could be downlinked to the ground once docked to the ISS. Once all that work was done, commander Poindexter and pilot Dutton joined Metcalf-Lindenburger, Yamazaki, and Wilson to conduct the inspection of the shuttle's heat shield. While the inspection was going on, Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson were on the mid-deck of Discovery checking out the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) and getting them ready for their three spacewalks. The last portion of the crew day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools used during rendezvous.|$|E
