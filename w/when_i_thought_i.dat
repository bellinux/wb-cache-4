500|$|Edwards {{signed for}} League One side Stevenage on 27 June 2011. He joined the club on a free transfer, rejecting a {{contract}} extension at Accrington. He signed a one-year deal with Stevenage, with the option of a second year. On joining the club he said [...] "I wasn't particularly looking for another club and I didn't {{have any interest in}} any other clubs at the time, so I thought I'd still be at Accrington next season. However, the manager got in touch with my agent and discussed the offer and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had the chance of playing League One football I decided to sign for Stevenage". Edwards was assigned the number six shirt ahead of the 2011–12 season. He made his Stevenage debut {{on the first day of}} the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match in a 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. Edwards made 13 starting appearances for the club, as well as a further 14 appearances from the substitute's bench, during the first half of the club's first ever League One campaign.|$|E
500|$|Tatlock {{struggled}} with her sexuality, {{at one point}} writing to a friend that [...] "there was a period <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was homosexual. I still am, in a way, forced to believe it, but really, logically, I am sure that I can't be because of my un-masculinity." [...] She began seeing Robert Oppenheimer in 1936, {{when she was a}} graduate student there and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at Berkeley. They met through his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn, who was {{also a member of the}} Communist party, when Washburn held a fund raiser for communist-backed Spanish Republicans. The couple started dating and had a passionate relationship; he proposed to her twice, but she refused. She is credited with introducing Oppenheimer to radical politics during the late 1930s, and to people involved with, or sympathetic to the Communist Party or related groups, such as Rudy Lambert and Thomas Addis. They continued seeing each other after he became involved with Kitty Harrison, whom he married on November 1, 1940. Oppenheimer and Tatlock [...] spent the New Year together in 1941, and once met at Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's very well, dear;--but what {{if one is}} ruffled? But I won't be ruffled, and {{you shall}} come. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> should go again to our own house, then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> we might perhaps {{dispense}} with the ruffling;--that was all." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{not quite}} sure which way this last example pointed. It alarmed me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of Lucilla. <b>I</b> came to a {{standstill}} again.|$|R
2500|$|He then asks {{if anyone}} could know that {{previously}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had meant plus, I had not actually meant quus. He claims that his argument shows that [...] "Each new application we make is a leap in the dark; any present intention could be interpreted so as to accord with anything we may choose to do. So there can be neither accord, nor conflict".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before O'Donnell {{left for}} India he discovered, [...] "a lump on my ribs that was sore. I made some doctors do some horrible things to ensure I got to India. I got an X-ray that showed I was missing a rib. The doctor {{was worried about}} it, but I was {{on a plane to}} India three days later. But two days into India not only did the big lump come back but he had a couple of {{partners}} and that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was in a bit of strife." ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's arrival was {{announced}} by the press in November 1998. She was one of Executive Producer Matthew Robinson's introductions, and {{was described as a}} [...] "home-wrecking blonde". According to actress Lucy Benjamin who played Lisa, the scriptwriters had doubts about casting her in the role: [...] "I just knew in my heart that I'd {{be able to do it}} well. And I desperately wanted the security of a regular income. But after the audition they kept me hanging on for such a long time. They tortured me by saying yes then saying no. It's the only job I've ever cried about <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> didn't have it." [...] Benjamin said that she was overjoyed when she was eventually given the part. In 2010, Matthew Robinson discussed Lisa's introduction with Walford Web, suggesting that Lisa and several other new characters introduced were an attempt to fill in character gaps in the soap resulting from a large number of axings. Lisa was conceptualised as a [...] "totty" [...] contingent. He indicated that the casting of Benjamin had been awkward as BBC controller of drama, Mal Young, was hesitant about her hiring. He eventually relented and, according to Robinson, admitted after seeing her in the role that [...] "she was, after all, a great asset to the show".|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Proudie {{insisted on}} our {{going down to}} the house," [...] {{continued}} the mother, [...] "and <b>when</b> there, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might save a journey by measuring some of the rooms and windows; so I got a knot of tape from Bobbins. Bobbins is as civil as you please, now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{never said}} truer words, sir. Of all {{cruising}} grounds, Heaven defend me {{from that of}} St. James's! I do assure you, Bignall, the service is quite sufficient to wear out the strongest constitution. There were moments <b>when</b> <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> should have died that humble, disagreeable mortal--a lieutenant!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> divined this I saw my revenge. To be sure, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of it <b>I</b> had {{no reason}} to want revenge. She had been most gracious to me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{was sitting}} up to finish a cigar, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> heard a noise in this direction. On coming to his room I find he is not there.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I haven't {{the courage}} I had <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> knew it all. I don't think I should ever amount to anything. It {{would be a}} waste of time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The spirit for adventure," [...] Arnold {{repeated}} quietly. [...] "Well, {{there have}} been times <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had that, but it certainly never occurred to me to go out and rob." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{may never}} {{see you on}} earth. All thought of such a joy is gone. I did really cling to it (I see it now) <b>when</b> most <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was quite content {{to wait for the}} hope of the great meeting. I will try to {{remember}} and to do what you say about all business matters.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believed}} {{what you}} said, Stephen. But {{you were so}} strong, so calm, so sure of yourself. I think that made me angry <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> how ridiculous <b>I</b> must have been." ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{the next}} week, {{in spite of}} Rev. Carroll, <b>I</b> was happy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of Gussie and miserable <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of Nellie. <b>I</b> held myself in some way bound to her and--was she not my ideal? Undoubtedly! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's {{stronger}} than mine. It made me come out, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had much better not, {{and it keeps}} me sitting here long after I should have started for home." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dick's heart stood still, and he {{came very}} near to being disgusted with his queen who could do no wrong. 'Just <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had made some headway, she goes off chasing butterflies. It's too maddening!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do it at once,' said Bounderby, 'has {{always been}} my motto from a child. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did it at once. Do you the same. Do this at once!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drummond! Not {{a bit of}} it. He swore you hadn't {{been with}} him at all. He was as sick as {{anything}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd seen you with him." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{have to be}} {{more careful}} {{contacting}} all of you. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> began <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> could safely speak about his writings and perhaps save us all but now it seems I will have to find a more subtle way to share his visions.|$|R
6000|$|... 31 May.--This morning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> woke <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> {{would provide}} myself with some papers and {{envelopes}} from my bag {{and keep them}} in my pocket, so that I might write in case I should get an opportunity, but again a surprise, again a shock! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bleached by that frightful sickly {{season at}} Poonshedagore, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was done for. But you! you--the boy {{of the whole}} lot! You think me very disrespectful to your father," [...] added he, turning to Ethel, [...] "but you see what old times are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{threw away}} a key of my own. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was giving William Evans {{the key of}} my cellar (with fatal {{intentions}} and designs, hoping {{that he would never}} survive the contents of that cellar), I really gave him the key I had taken from Philippa.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I got {{it every}} way,' said Robina. 'There was Edgar {{treating}} {{me like a}} little contemptible baby, and Alice sometimes coaxing me and sometimes spiting me, and Angel poisoned against me; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> must be acting for the best in telling Felix, somehow that turned out altogether horrid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do. I make {{no mystery}} about that to you. I do love him {{with all my}} heart. I love him to-day, now that I believe him to be here, and that I suppose I shall see him, perhaps this very afternoon. And I loved him yesterday, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> should never see him again. I do love him. I do. I love him so well that I will never do him an injury." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Not I, sir! It {{only came}} into my head a moment ago, and I always like to be second to you in church matters. You could have knocked me down with a sparrer's feather <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> o't, sir; <b>I</b> assure 'ee you could!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just as you please. I {{started to}} catch {{you with your}} bag, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> missed you, <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> might as well keep on. Got in about one, had dinner at uncle's, and been enjoying these high jinks ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't tell exactly, Winthrop," [...] she said, {{touched by}} the boy's simple {{interest}} in this abstruse point. [...] "He made me feel that I had been rather mean and cruel <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had only been practical. I can't explain; but it wasn't a comfortable feeling, my dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, and it {{was enough}} to {{dismount}} me from my hobby," [...] said Lance. [...] "What! <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had the prettiest girl in the Castle dancing after my whistle, to find that she gave me the bag to hold, and was smuggling in a corner with a rich old Puritan!" ...|$|E
60|$|I sat {{smoking and}} thinking, and then smoking a bit more, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> heard {{somebody}} call {{my name in}} a sort of hoarse whisper.

60|$|Great God! If for one instant <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> {{what might}} be the hellish {{intention}} of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself forever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real intentions; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> had prepared only my own death, I hastened that of a far dearer victim.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel shuddered at the spectacle, {{but made}} no comment, and Basil went on: [...] "Do you suppose they scorned {{the idea of}} Sam Patch as they gazed upon the falls? On the contrary, I've {{no doubt that he}} {{recalled}} to her the ballad which a poet of their language made about him. It used to go the rounds of the German newspapers, and I translated it, a long while ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> too was in 'Arkadien geboren'.|$|R
5000|$|A hotel {{staff member}} told the court: [...] "When I got off work, {{there was nothing}} amiss.
