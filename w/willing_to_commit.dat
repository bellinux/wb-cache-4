5|$|Matthias {{approached}} Emperor Frederick {{to suggest}} a new bride for him among Frederick's relatives. Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg proposed one of his daughters to Matthias but the Hungarian Estates opposed this plan. In an attempt to enter into an alliance with King Casimir IV of Poland, Matthias proposed to the King's daughter Hedvig but he was refused. During the 1470 meeting of Emperor Frederick and Matthias, a marriage between Matthias and the Emperor's five-year-old daughter Kunigunde of Austria was also discussed, but the Emperor was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> himself to the marriage.|$|E
5|$|All {{four major}} {{networks}} {{turned down the}} new Star Trek series, as they were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> to a twenty-six-hour first season with a guaranteed unchanging time slot {{as well as a}} promotional campaign for the show. The team proceeded with the project with the backing of Paramount. Roddenberry began putting together a production crew which included colleagues who had worked with him on the original series, including Robert H. Justman, David Gerrold, and Eddie Milkis. Justman proposed three ideas to the others on October 17, including families on board the ship, a concept which later became the holodeck and both an android and a Klingon character. One idea discussed by the production team was for Deanna Troi to have three breasts to which writer D. C. Fontana objected.|$|E
5000|$|When {{something}} {{is said to}} have been done [...] "by force", it usually implies that it was done by actual or threatened violence ("might"), not necessarily by legal authority ("right").

By {{the end of the}} story, Janine is only guilty of the thought {{but it is not clear}} if she will take further action on her frustration or if she is prepared to go back to how things were before and accept her life. The title could be read as implying that the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> the act is equal to the act itself.|$|R
5|$|Fox Mulder {{attends a}} parole hearing for Monte Propps, {{a serial killer}} he helped to {{apprehend}} in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide by drowning; however he {{is now seen as}} a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him of the dangers of the offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley momentarily speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E

50|$|Mu'tazila theologians {{approached}} {{the problem of}} theodicy within a framework of moral realism, according to which the moral value of acts is accessible to unaided reason, so that humans can make moral judgments about divine acts. They argued that the divine act of creation is good despite existence of suffering, because it allows humans a compensation of greater reward in the afterlife. They posited that individuals have free <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> evil and absolved God of responsibility for such acts. God's justice thus consists of punishing wrongdoers. Following the demise of Mu'tazila as a school, their theodicy was adopted in the Zaydi and Twelver branches of Shia Islam.|$|R

25|$|Among {{the most}} vocal proponents of the attack was Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox. Fox had an ulterior motive, in that he wanted the Navy {{to be free from}} {{domination}} by the Army. He was therefore not disturbed when General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck would not agree to a major part for the Army in the operation. Halleck was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> only 10,000 to 15,000 untrained soldiers, who would exploit any successes made by the naval force but would not otherwise have an active role.|$|E

25|$|To obtain {{entry into}} the order, a girl had {{to be free of}} {{physical}} and mental defects, have two living parents and be a daughter of a free-born resident of Rome. From at least the mid-Republican era, the pontifex maximus chose Vestals between their sixth and tenth year, by lot from a group of twenty high-born candidates at a gathering of their families and other Roman citizens. Originally, the girl had to be of patrician birth, but membership was opened to plebeians as it became difficult to find patricians <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> their daughters to 30 years as a Vestal, and then ultimately even from the daughters of freedmen for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|For 17 {{years after}} the 1975 Finals, {{there would be no}} {{national}} over-the-air network coverage of the NHL in the United States (with the exception of CBS' coverage of Game 2 of the 1979 Challenge Cup and Game 6 of the 1980 Stanley Cup Finals and NBC's coverage of the NHL All-Star Game beginning in 1990) and only spotty coverage on regional networks. This was {{due to the fact that}} no network was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> to a large number of games, in turn, providing low ratings for NHL games. ABC would eventually resume broadcasting regular NHL games (on a time-buy basis through ESPN) for the 1992–93 season (and continuing through the 1993–94 season before Fox took over the broadcast television league rights for the next five seasons).|$|E
25|$|The ninja {{emerged as}} mercenaries in the 15th century, {{where they were}} {{recruited}} as spies, raiders, arsonists and even terrorists. Amongst the samurai, a sense of ritual and decorum was observed, where one was expected to fight or duel openly. Combined with the unrest of the Sengoku era, these factors created a demand for men <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> deeds considered disreputable for conventional warriors. By the Sengoku period, the shinobi had several roles, including spy (kanchō), scout (teisatsu), surprise attacker (kishu), and agitator (konran). The ninja families were organized into larger guilds, each with their own territories. A system of rank existed. A jōnin ("upper man") was the highest rank, representing the group and hiring out mercenaries. This {{is followed by the}} chūnin ("middle man"), assistants to the jōnin. At the bottom was the genin ("lower man"), field agents drawn from the lower class and assigned to carry out actual missions.|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{markets are}} {{characterized}} by production and marketing lags. Uncertainty is also an inherent feature of agricultural markets. This paper investigates if two policy active importers <b>will</b> choose <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> their import levels or keep the flexibility to revise their ex-ante import levels once production decisions are made and the uncertainty is resolved. This is the constant dilemma faced by prospective WTO members. We assume production in both importing countries is subject to an asymmetric random shock. We show that a government <b>will</b> not want <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> its import level {{when there is a}} high degree of uncertainty in production. However, an importing country is likely <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> <b>to</b> a trade policy in equilibrium although the equilibrium may be Pareto dominated. Under certain conditions, an equilibrium in which one country <b>commits</b> <b>to</b> its ex-ante import level while the other chooses the flexibility option can emerge. In this setting, international trade agreements play an important role. Trade Agreements, Tariff-RATE Quotas, Pre-COMMITMENT, Production Uncertainty,...|$|R

25|$|The Master's {{past with}} the Doctor is {{explored}} somewhat in The Dark Path, which reveals {{that his name}} prior to taking the alias of the Master is Koschei, when he encounters the Second Doctor during their travels. Although initially a somewhat anti-heroic version of the Doctor, <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> murder as a first option to save the day but generally still {{trying to do the}} right, Koschei turns to evil and becomes the Master after he discovers that his companion and lover, Ailla, is an undercover agent of the Celestial Intervention Agency sent to spy on him. During the course of the novel, Ailla is shot and killed, with Koschei, not knowing that she is a Time Lord and will simply regenerate, completing a time-based weapon to benefit the anti-alien efforts of soldiers from Earth's Empire, in an attempt to bring her back. The weapon is used to destroy the planet Teriliptus and its inhabitants, but when Ailla turns up alive, the knowledge that he has destroyed a planet for nothing, coupled with the revelation of Ailla's betrayal, proves too much. Koschei resolves to bring his own order to the universe at the expense of free will and becoming its Master. Thanks to the Doctor reprogramming his weapon, Koschei is trapped in a black hole {{at the end of the}} novel, with it being left uncertain how he will escape. Although it is generally implied that it takes him most of his remaining lives to do so (hence why the Master is on his last life while the Doctor, intended to be his contemporary, is only on his third), the cover art of The Dark Path depicts Koschei as being already the same regeneration as the Delgado-era Master.|$|E
