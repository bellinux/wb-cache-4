5|$|After the accident, {{souvenir}} hunters {{proved to}} be such a problem that the owners of Berry Brow kept all gates locked. Geoff Inkpen stated that after completion of an Inquiry a bulldozer <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> dig a ditch at the crash site and what remained of the Amana would be buried.|$|E
5|$|Also on 18 April, Iowas fire-control officer, Lieutenant Leo Walsh, {{conducted}} a briefing {{to discuss the}} next day's main battery exercise. Moosally, Morse, Kissinger, and Costigan {{did not attend the}} briefing. During the briefing, Skelley announced that Turret Two would participate in an experiment of his design in which D-846 powder <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> fire 2700lb (1224.7kg) shells.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years. However, because rats do not exhibit naturally occurring breast cancer, the extrapolation of these results to human abortion and breast cancer is viewed as dubious.|$|E

5|$|In March 2015 Australian Aviation {{reported}} that, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of developing a new Defence White Paper, the Australian Government was considering purchasing two LC-130J Hercules fitted with landing skis and other equipment needed to allow the aircraft to operate in Antarctica. If acquired, these aircraft <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> support the Australian Antarctic Division's operations following the closure of the Wilkins Runway near Casey Station.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid {{was quite}} {{expensive}} in 2009; {{a course of}} treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> treat tuberculosis cost about USS$60.|$|E
5|$|Poor and fatherless, Garfield was mocked by {{his fellow}} boys, and {{throughout}} his life was very sensitive to slights. He escaped through reading, devouring all the books he could find. He left home at age 16 in 1847. Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland, Garfield instead found work on a canal boat, responsible for managing the mules that pulled it. This labor <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> good effect by Horatio Alger, who penned Garfield's campaign biography in 1880.|$|E
50|$|FalconSAT-2 - Significantly damaged when Falcon 1 {{launch vehicle}} failed seconds after launch. Despite {{the loss of}} the launch vehicle, the {{satellite}} landed, mostly intact in a support building for the launch vehicle. It was originally scheduled for launch on STS-114 with the Space Shuttle Atlantis in January 2003. Its payload was the MESA instrument (Miniaturized electrostatic Analyzer), which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sample plasma in the upper atmosphere. The data <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> correlate the effect of ionospheric plasma on trans-ionospheric radio communications.|$|R

5|$|The Daicon III {{film was}} {{reported}} on in Animec magazine {{which resulted in}} requests for the film to be released publicly. In order {{to pay off the}} debts from producing the film, {{the decision was made to}} sell 8mm reels of the film and videos. Additional original artwork and the storyboards were included in the release. The sale paid the debts and the profit <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce Daicon IV.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{found that}} the CMF was a hollow shell of its former self, depleted in numbers and in equipment and unable to adequately fulfil its tasks. However, it still {{found that the}}re was a role for the CMF to play in the strategic environment that existed at the time, although it would no longer be called upon to provide the base upon which mobilisation {{in a time of war}} would be built, instead it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> augment the Regular Army. This was the first step in creating the concept of a total force, in which the differing virtues of the citizen soldier and the regular soldier <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> complement each other, and in this vein the Millar Report recommended that the name be changed from the CMF to the Australian Army Reserve.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} the Metro Council Rules Committee {{delivered}} in March stated that the granite's origin was discovered in early 1988, and was authorized by tunnel superintendent David Kalberer {{with the assumption that}} only a small amount <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> furnish University Street station. Kalberer, who received praise for his work on the project before the scandal, admitted that the failure to consult the Metro Council's tunnel subcommittee before signing off on the deal was his mistake. Metro Director Alan Gibbs resigned on February 23 {{as a result of the}} scandal and was succeeded by technical director Richard Sandaas in September. The granite was rejected by Metro and was returned to the supplier in Italy.|$|E

5|$|After the Virginia Tech {{massacre}} on April 16, 2007, Vick and the United Way donated $10,000 {{to assist}} families affected. The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia {{to be placed}} in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a special fund at the United Way of Montgomery, Radford and Floyd counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said the money <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.|$|E
5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|R

5|$|Diệm {{left the}} {{mainland}} on May 19, and his final stop was in Hawaii, {{where he was}} a guest of Admiral Felix Stump, the commander of United States Pacific Fleet. The reason for the visit was to discuss Diệm's concerns over America's reaction if South Vietnam came under communist attack. Stump reiterated Washington's opinions that nuclear weapons <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> defend any anti-communist country that was attacked by communists, in accordance with public statements made by Eisenhower and Dulles. He said the Americans would do so by dropping nuclear weapons on communist China.|$|E
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
5|$|Flaming arrows {{required}} the shooter to get {{quite close to}} their desired target and most will have extinguished themselves before reaching the target. In response, another form of fire arrow was developed which consisted of curved metal bars connecting a tip and hollow end for the shaft. The resulting cage was filled with hot coals or other solid object which could be fired from a much stronger bow or ballista without fear of extinguishing and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> ignite straw or thatch roofs from a safer distance.|$|E
25|$|Written in Coptic, it {{contains}} oracles that <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> provide support and reassurance to people seeking help for problems. It {{is not a}} gospel in the traditional sense, since it doesn’t predominantly teach about Christ.|$|R
50|$|ACE states that, {{as of this}} review, THL could <b>use</b> $1 million <b>to</b> $1.5 {{million more}} in funding in 2017 above their 2016 budget. This funding <b>would</b> likely <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> expand {{international}} work and their campus outreach program.|$|R
5|$|Once in orbit, Big G {{would have}} docked with space {{stations}} using an Apollo docking probe {{mounted on the}} rear of the cargo module, which was in turn mounted on {{the rear of the}} re-entry module. The re-entry module itself <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> incorporated, including the hatch in the heat shield, which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|R
5|$|Hsu may in {{fact have}} been running {{multiple}} cons on a massive scale. As an example, a New York investment fund run by Woodstock Festival founder Joel Rosenman invested $40 million spread over 37 separate deals with a Hsu company. Hsu reportedly told Rosenman the money <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> manufacture apparel for well known luxury brands, yielding a 40% profit on each deal. When Rosenman's fund recently attempted to cash checks from Hsu's company in September 2007, there were insufficient funds. Federal charges of fraud have since been brought against Hsu.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Western Australia state government allocated relief funds to offset the cost of recovery and clean-up in several of the affected towns. Individuals and families became eligible to apply for personal grants and small business owners would be considered for special interest rates on new loans. Local government entities listed under the proclamation were the shires of Ashburton, Broome, East Pilbara, Meekatharra, and the Town of Port Hedland. Disaster assistance money in these jurisdictions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> restore public assets and infrastructure impaired by the storm. The name Lua was later retired from the cyclical list of tropical cyclone names due to the system's adverse effects on land and was replaced by the name Luana.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision {{was responsible for the}} proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analyses to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.|$|E
5|$|The Manned Orbital Telescope was a {{proposal}} for a manned spacecraft for astronomical or solar observation. It would have used the larger reentry module which was also proposed for the Big Gemini spacecraft, and <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> launched on a Saturn IB. The enlarged reentry module was also considered for a spacecraft proposed at the same time, which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> rescue the crews of manned spacecraft that were stranded in low Earth orbit. It would have launched atop a Titan IIIC, once in orbit it would have maneuvered by means of a Transtage integrated into the equipment module.
