40|$|Language {{and culture}} have close relationships. Since {{language}} is {{actually one of}} the elements of a culture, language and culture should be considered as a unity. Furthermore Clyde Kluckhohn in his book entitled Mirror from Man states that each language is a product of a particular culture and it reflects the culture of the people and their view of the world. Moreover, there is an interdependence between language and culture, since in one culture there must be a certain language. Therefore, language and culture cannot be separated one from the other. Since language itself is closely related with culture, the students who learn a foreign language should know about its culture. In this case the students who learn English as a foreign language should understand about its culture. At least they should know its culture. At the English Department of Widya Mandala Catholic University, culture is introduced little by little since the first semester through the material of Integrated Course (IC) namely Breakthrough by Jack C. Richard and M. N. Long as the material which consists of some cultural items. Those cultural items are implicitly stated in part of the speaking section, namely <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> and pair up and practise. The students should understand those cultural items. In fact, {{it is not easy to}} understand most of the cultural items inside because there are so many expressions <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something which cannot be understood clearly by the students. Based on the reason above, the writer tries to analyze some cultural items found in Breakthrough book one, two and three. Her study aims at interpreting and explaining the cultural items of American. people. It is also aimed at mentioning the differences and similarities between American and Indonesian culture found in those books. Through this study, the writer hopes that this thesis gives some contributions concerning the cultural items found in Breakthrough book one, two and three to the students of the English Department of the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Widya Mandala Catholic University Surabaya. In this study the writer limits her study to the conversation sections with the heading <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> and pair up and practice. She chooses both sections because she analyzes cultural items found in the speaking section. She does not discuss writing or reading sections. In carrying out this study, the writer takes three theories namely the language and culture, culture, and the function of language. Furthermore, for the research methodology, she uses content analysis. It is used to analyze particular data, to evaluate its value, appropriateness and accuracy. The writer follows four steps in using this research foreign. First, she takes some theories about culture, then she takes samples of speaking sections in Breakkthrough. She categorizes those ones according to the theories in chapter II. After she unites the same categories into one group, she makes the data analysis from the result. Then she infers the data analysis, at last she concludes the result and asks a culture consultant or a native speaker to check the results. After analyzing the data, the writer finds the result that there are some cultural items found in Breakthrough. She also gives the possible meanings of each cultural item based on the categories she made in chapter III. While analyzing the possible meanings of each cultural item, she found that there are also some differences between American and Indonesian culture. She discusses these items in chapter IV. Since this study does not analyze all the cultural items in Breakthrough book 1 to 3, the writer suggests that this research will be continued by other students who are interested in culture to study the parts that have not been studied yet. She hopes they would like to develop this research as much as possible in order to give more contributions concerning the cultural items found in Breakthrough to the students of Integrated Course at English Department of the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Widya Mandala Catholic University Surabaya...|$|R
40|$|Every {{organization}} regularly faces {{tasks that}} need to be accomplished. As these tasks become larger and more complex, they tend to be more time sensitive and have a greater impact on the organization. When they reach a certain level of importance and complexity, we tend to refer to them as projects. The larger the financial impact of the project the greater the urgency. As these projects reach farther into the organization touching numerous individuals and departments they become much more complex and have far reaching impact. Critical projects are those that are important, urgent, impact finances and have far reaching effects. For these types of critical projects, team based project planning is almost always the best option (Grant and Baumann, 2005). Key factors in building a good team Before any team can succeed, their goals and objectives must be documented and understandable by the entire organization. That means management must first be absolutely clear on what they want the team to accomplish, and it is best if they can describe their desires in terms of a future state vision, or what the ultimate outcomes of the teams ’ efforts would be.

40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 These poems move as a {{conversation}} would: they circle, they get distracted, they get personal, they change the topic. They {{try to tell}} you something, like an accidental autobiography, or {{bits and pieces of}} distress, or the probing of emotions {{in a way that is}} more than just cathartic. There are various cycles of repetition (echoes) in these poems through obsessive content and images, repeated phrases and words, and on an individual scale in several poems. There are many references to reflections, and many poems which were built and written with reflective patterns in images or stanzaically. These poems are public on a surface level; the sonic, lyric, and imagistic qualities of the poems grab a reader's attention. The places where the poems are private lie in the metaphorical musings, where the surface of the poem is driven by language, usually in a rapid rhythm. The most honest and revealing sections come when memory collides with writing. The collection is a verbalization of traumatic experiences full of distractions, intentional changes of topic, and interruptions. In many ways, the collection drives toward the last line "I think I was supposed to tell you it's okay. " The implications are several. Firstly, I really don't know what I'm supposed to be telling you. Secondly, it is not okay. Thirdly, if I should be saying it, is there a right <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it?</b> This collection is not committed to the idea of a right way to say a thing, and has never even heard the word resolution. Or, another way to look at it: Does {{a conversation}} ever come to a resolution? Or, what do we mean by good bye? Certainly not goodbye forever. Nor do we usually mean "See you later" to mean later that same day. In some cases, later spans years. Is a conversation ever truly "over" or are we constantly picking up the same one, reexamining, pushing it, repeating ourselves, asking the same set of questions to someone we've known for years and always getting variations of an answer which, as it turns out, has a theme. That theme is the person's life [...] their inner narrative, maybe the inner monologue, maybe the inner dramatic personae. This lifelong conversation is broken over days and locations, gets caught in themes, and is interrupted by other people; by your memories and thoughts and sudden connections; by the other person's memories and thoughts and sudden connections. Hence the 'almost' of We are Almost Talking. Or: "The purpose of poetry is to remind us how difficult it is to remain just one person for our house is open, there are no keys in the doors; and invisible guests come in and out at will.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is presented}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy""March 2013 "Includes bibliographical references. 1. Introduction [...] 2. Related work [...] 3. Sentiment differences in near-synonym choice [...] 4. Improving near-synonym choice [...] 5. Valence shifting text [...] 6. Conclusions [...] Appendices. When either a human author or a computer natural language generation system tries to express an idea, there is usually more than one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> This is a problem both for systems that process language, such as systems that recognise textual entailment, which must detect when two surface forms express the same idea; and for systems that generate language, which must choose the most appropriate way to express an idea from a potentially large number of surface forms. For a natural language generation system, for a given meaning there may be multiple words that could be chosen to express it, or multiple phrases that express the same idea. However, {{it has also been}} argued that there are no true synonyms, that even words that have very similar meanings cannot be substituted for each other in all circumstances. Automatic natural language generation systems therefore have a use for modules which make effective word and phrase choices among closely related alternatives. In this thesis we consider the specific problem of choosing an appropriate word or phrase where the alternatives are closely related in meaning but differ in sentiment or attitude. One example is stingy and frugal, one of which is critical of what it describes and the other of which is complimentary. The thesis will address three aspects of the problem. The first question is whether existing methods to predict word choice among closely related words are sufficient for choosing between words that differ in sentiment. There are several methods in the literature for this, relying on statistical models of words in context. The early, relatively poor performance of these methods had been used to argue that statistical methods are not suitable for this task, but later successes with statistical approaches suggest that sufficient amounts of data make it approachable. Using a comprehensive set of data for this thesis, we show that sets of words that differ in sentiment behave in a distinct fashion, suggesting that they are particularly amenable to statistical approaches. The second aspect of our research into choosing between related words or phrases that differ in sentiment is investigating whether or not including some global information about the entire text is useful in predicting word choice. We hypothesise that information about the sentiment of a document as a whole (for example, if the document is a movie review, whether it is favourable or not) will assist in choosing between closely related words that differ in sentiment. We demonstrate several models improving prediction of the correct word in context, incorporating information from the entire document, the most successful of which are metrics which account for distance from the target word. The third aspect is an investigation into human perceptions of word choice in a particular generation task - valence shifting - with the goal of changing an existing text so that it is similar in meaning, but more negative in tone. Existing work, which includes using hand-crafted vocabularies annotated with sentiment data, and corpus-derived cues, has found this to be a difficult problem. This work investigates both the success of establishing a more negative tone, and the resulting fluency of the text by asking human judges to evaluate both aspects of the text then explores possible metrics that can predict negativity for use in valence shifting.

My uncle, the doctor one, was just {{up to look}} at my stupid leg 2 ̆ 6 said to keep off it all day 2 ̆ 6 as much as {{possible}} tomorrow 2 ̆ 6 until the swelling goes down. It’s discusting [sic]! Why does everything have to happen to me! Honey, I’ve been writing letters to more people this morning telling them that we’re engaged. Oh, Bill still hasn’t received the letter because I got a letter from him yesterday 2 ̆ 6 I know he hasn’t or if he has he’s doing a darned good job of pretending he has[n’t]. I’m in bed now and will probably be here {{for the rest of the}} week. Darling—Jean Molberg just called me 2 ̆ 6 asked me if it were true. She was all excited 2 ̆ 6 couldn’t believe it. She said that she had just gotten a letter from Dudley Nash so I got his address in case you didn’t have it. I can’t remember whether you said you were writing him or not but here it is anyway. Dudley Nash, M. M. M. 3 /cU. S. S. L. C. I. (L 517) c/o Fleet Post OfficeNew York, New York If you haven’t written him, honey, try to right away if you want to tell him. Jean said she’d wait a few days before she wrote 2 ̆ 6 told him so that you’d have a chance to tell him first. I thought you’d probably like to write him 2 ̆ 6 be the first to tell him if you haven’t already. Well, honey, so long again. I love you very much. You’re the most wonderful person in the world and I love you more than anything or anyone that ever existed. You’re all I want in the world. I love you so. Monday Dearest Judson— Golly, honey, you wanted me to stay home from work to write you a real long letter. Well, I did stay home from work but it’s almost quarter after seven now and I haven’t written at all. Time just flew today. I don’t know where it went. Honestly, I had every intention of writing you a real huge letter but didn’t get around to it. Darling, I’ve been thinking about you all day, every second. I’ve never felt like this before. There were quite a few time[s] when I thought that I was in love but I know now that this is the first time I’ve ever been in love. I feel all shaky sometimes when I think about you. I still haven’t gotten over the way I felt Saturday and Friday night. Can’t understand it. Last night at about two I was lying in bed thinking of you 2 ̆ 6 listening to the radio. They played one song that is really swell—I’m not sure what the name of it was but it was something about “I hadn’t met you” or something like that. Maybe they’ll play it before I finish writing to you. Anyway, you’ve probably heard it. I can remember almost all the words except the title. Today Bobbie brought the picture up to the Standard Star and I phoned in the announcement. They’ll send it to the Daily August 2 ̆ 6 Grandmaw took another one to the Pelham Sun. They probably won’t be in the papers until Thursday or Friday. The telephone’s been wringing all night. Everyone’s been calling up to let us know how their hangovers are. Oh, after you left millions of people had come. It was quite a mad house. Honey, I was so lonesome. When you called up it was such a nice surprise, honey. Golly, it was good to hear your voice again. Everyone was telling me how cute you were 2 ̆ 6 how lucky I was 2 ̆ 6 how happy I looked 2 ̆ 6 how wonderful you were. Golly, hon, I wish you could have stayed. I wanted to be alone with you so much. Remember when we went upstairs just before you left. Daddy was looking all over the place for us—of all times for him to pick, honestly! So of course everyone knew where we were. That was almost so well planned, too. When I called up Ginny today to tell her that I wouldn’t be in for a few days, she was so nice. Said not to worry about work 2 ̆ 6 to be sure 2 ̆ 6 stay home until it was all better. I hope that by Wednesday I’ll be able to go again. It’s so annoying to have to lie in bed all day. Last night the darned ankle was all swollen again 2 ̆ 6 so I decided to be a good little girl 2 ̆ 6 stay home. I’m afraid that if I don’t keep entirely off it, that it won’t be healed by next weekend 2 ̆ 6 that would break my heart. If there’s any swelling at all, I won’t go to work so don’t worry, darling. I just remembered the name of that song—“I Didn’t Know About You. ” Have you heard it? It reminds me so much of you. You’ve changed me a lot, honey. Was thinking of that today. I’m so afraid that I’ll do something to hurt you, though. You’re so sweet and thoughtful. I love you so. Honey, I wish that I could tell you how much I love you. There just doesn’t seem to be any way to showing you how I feel or telling you how deeply I love you. You write the most wonderful letters, honey. I wish I could say the right thing all the time the way you do. Your letters are just like you and they always say just what I like to hear—(experience, no doubt). Today looked like a beautiful day. What I could see of it between the slats of my Venitian [sic] blinds. Did you go on the cross-country yet? Hope that the weather is nice all week and that they let you off for a long time Christmas. Honey, when do you find out how long they’re going to give you? If it’s not too long, darling, I’m going to take some time off from work. It’s a shame that my ankle couldn’t wait until after Christmas. Gee, I love you so. Everything seemed to change so suddenly, honey, Friday night. Before we seemed to be more or less kidding around all the time 2 ̆ 6 then all of a sudden, everything was different. It’s a good thing that it happened, I guess. It had to sooner or later. And I think that it’s a good thing in a way that you’re leaving on the 28 th. Have you heard anything about where they’ll send you? It would be marvelous if they sent you someplace where you could get home every weekend or kept you at Stewart for the rest of your training. Darling, we were so lucky to have so much time together but I’d still like to have more. I hope when you get your wings that you have a long, long leave so that we can be married 2 ̆ 6 together for as long as possible. You’ll get 15 weeks more training, honey, won’t you after you graduate? Woody is going to try to come over tonight. I hope she can because then I’ll be able to talk about how wonderful you are to her. How is Steve? If Woody doesn’t come over tonight, I’ll answer his letter. He’s a very nice fellow. Did Gini go up yesterday? They’re playing “Silver Wings in the Moonlight. ” That should be more popular with so many Air Corps fellows around. I meant to tell you—Mary Smith got tight last night. She could hardly walk but she was so funny. Carol had to practically carry her home. The worst part was that she was going to Jim’s house for dinner. That should have been something. Darling, I love you so. That seems to be the only thing I can think of to say. There should be some other <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> but somehow that’s all I can think of. This week will probably go fast for me because I’ll be in bed most of it and if I do go to work it will be such a surprise when Saturday comes. Darling—what do you want for Christmas? I know one thing I’m giving you but it’s only a small thing 2 ̆ 6 just sorta something extra. You said you wanted a pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set but not what kind. I don’t know anything about pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil sets so tell me more about what kind 2 ̆ 6 color 2 ̆ 6 everything! Tell me some more things because a pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set is the most unromantic thing I can think of. It’s so practical, too. Honey, I think we’ll be so happy when we’re married. I know I won’t be completely happy until we are. Wonder if we’ll always hate crowds as much. Hon, it’s getting worse 2 ̆ 6 worse, as far as I’m concerned. I don’t even know anybody else exists when you’re around except that they occasionally interrupt 2 ̆ 6 bother us. I love you so, honey. I just want to be with you, honey, forever. What time will we have to start, darling, to get up to the air show in time? I’d love to see you fly but it will be nicer to have you with me during the show, you can be with me can’t you? I wish we were married now, darling 2 ̆ 6 there wasn’t a war 2 ̆ 6 we could be together. Did Steve get Woody’s letter yet? How does he feel? What’s going to happen if Gini invites herself up for next weekend? That would be cozy. Gee, honey, it sure was good to be with you for a whole day. This was a wonderful weekend. Are you very tired, darling. I feel so much in love. You should feel pretty beat after carrying me around last weekend. Do you know that when you went down to the station everyone was watching you carry me. When I got back they all had something to say about how cute it was, and what good practice you were getting. All my relatives are crazy about you. They think you’re wonderful. When they say that one of my friends (boys anyway) is swell, that really means something. Frenchy thought I was very lucky. Boy, did he get tight! Everyone did. Charlotte, Muriel, Ronnie 2 ̆ 6 I were up in my bedroom listening to the radio because we were sober 2 ̆ 6 they were getting a little wild down stairs. I sure wish you could have been there, darling. It would have been so perfect. Golly, I was so surprised. In a way I was in such a daze that I just didn’t know what was going on. That’s love. Honey, I love you so. Much more than I did last weekend. Every weekend seems to be the same—I love you so much more than the weekend before last. This just can’t go on much longer darling. Well, honey, I’ll write again tomorrow. I love you very, very, much. You’re marvelous—I love you so. All my love—Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|E

If a knowledgebase (a set of formulae) is inconsistent, {{we need more}} illuminating <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how inconsistent <b>it</b> is, or <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether one knowledgebase is “more inconsistent” than another. To address this, we provide a general characterization of inconsistency, based on quasi-classical logic (a form of paraconsistent logic with a more expressive semantics than Belnap’s four-valued logic, and unlike other paraconsistent logics, allows the connectives to appear to behave as classical connectives). We analyse inconsistent knowledge by considering the conflicts arising in the minimal quasi-classical models for that knowledge. This is used for a measure of coherence for each knowledgebase, and for a preference ordering, called the compromise relation, over knowledgebases. In this paper, we formalize this framework, and consider applications in managing heterogeneous sources of knowledge...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to {{investigate}} and discuss {{the current state of}} game research and its potential usage in didactic situations. The essay is divided in two parts. Part one consists of an attempt to comment preceding contemporary game research and address possible myths that have been established. Part two aims to discuss games narrative capacity and function in education using the theories and terms laid down by Wolfgang Iser and Gérard Genette. Contemporary game research tends to focus on classic retro games, trying to form theories for a general understanding of the media. This is a useful method as long as {{the purpose of the study}} is to define how game mechanics and layout are formed. However, the use of this perspective in defining how games function as narratives is a mistake, since games do not adapt narrative methods from their predecessors, but from literature and other media. Another misconception is the possibility to generalize about games by looking at bestsellers. Since the game media is under constant development there is no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what <b>it</b> can and cannot do. What we today say is true, might tomorrow be contradicted and proven wrong with the next game release. Wolfgang Iser has formed a literary theory built on the communication between reader and text. He explains the grounds for this communication using the terms Repertoire, Strategies and Realization. Within a text’s strategies, Iser claims, communication is built on structured blanks that the reader is to fill in, and so become part of the productive process, creating the aesthetic object. Using these terms, and structured blanks in particular, I further on discuss how text and games share narrative and textual functions, using the role-playing game The Witcher 2 : Assassins of Kings (Namco Bandai Games) as an example...|$|R
6000|$|To {{quarrel with}} the {{uncertainty}} that besets us in intellectual affairs, {{would be about}} as reasonable as to object to live one's life, with due thought for the morrow, because no man can be sure he will be alive an hour hence. Such are the conditions imposed upon us by nature, {{and we have to}} make the best of them. And I think that the greatest mistake those of us who are interested in the progress of free thought can make is to overlook these limitations, and to deck ourselves with the dogmatic feathers which are the traditional adornment of our opponents. Let us be content with rational certainty, leaving irrational certainties to those who like to muddle their minds with them. I cannot see my <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that demons are impossibilities; but I am not more certain about anything, than I am that the evidence tendered in favour of the demonology, of which the Gadarene story is a typical example, is utterly valueless. I cannot see my <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>it</b> is [...] "impossible" [...] that the hunger of thousands of men should be satisfied out of the food supplied by half-a-dozen loaves and a fish or two; but it seems to me monstrous that I should be asked to believe it on the faith of the five stories which testify to such an occurrence. It is true that the position that miracles are [...] "impossible" [...] cannot be sustained. But I know of nothing which calls upon me to qualify the grave verdict of Hume: [...] "There is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned goodness, education, and learning as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of such undoubted integrity as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood; and at the same time attesting facts performed in such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of the world, as to render the detection unavoidable: all which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men."[50] ...|$|R
40|$|Artist Statement I {{am trying}} to show the freedom in my works that an artistic life {{provides}} to me and also find {{the process of making}} artwork is a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> release inner stress. I am focusing on the sculpture because making sculpture is perfect for creative expression and release of tension. I like to use the technique some like twisting, combination of the line and shape, hanging and mix material on my project, I think that is more suitable to show the meaning of freedom. And, sometimes my artwork takes a critical view of social, political and cultural issues, it is similar to a lot of artists in the world, Ai Weiwei is one of them, I am his big fans, the reason may be we both come from China, I can easily be understated the meaning he want to show in his work, and that was always my reference. I think that also a part of “the freedom” I keep searching for, it is the freedom of expression. So, I keep creating different project try to show the freedom feeling and talk about the social problem or the problem of human and nature. I still enjoy making other things as well to balance myself, I used to make some graphic designs, drawing and painting blend into my life, I like that so much, and I want to combine the 2 D designs and the 3 D sculpture. In most of my works, there is a narrative of freedom, which is mainly reflected in the way I produced and emotional performance. But what about this? For me, this makes some of the ironies of sensitive topics and from my understanding. As a Chinese art worker, in some cases, {{we do not have the}} freedom of speech, and in some cases, 2 ̆ 2 some people 2 ̆ 2 need to hide some of the real reports of things, so as to maintain social stability. But I think everyone has their analysis and understanding of things, of course, the best <b>way</b> is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> boldly. [URL]...|$|R
