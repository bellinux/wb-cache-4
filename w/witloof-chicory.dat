40|$|A {{genetic linkage}} map {{based on an}} {{intraspecific}} cross between two inbred lines of <b>witloof-chicory</b> (Cichorium intybus L. var. foliosum Hegi) has been constructed. In total, 129 RAPD markers were scored in 565 F- 2 plants. Grouping of these markers at a LOD of threshold 4. 0 resulted in nine linkage groups, which {{is equal to the}} chicory haploid genome. The nine linkage groups covered 609. 6 cM. All 129 RAPD markers were linked to one of the nine groups. Three RAPD markers could not be mapped. Out of the 126 remaining RAPD markers, 18 showed segregation distortion with significance value of P < 0. 01. status: publishe...|$|E
