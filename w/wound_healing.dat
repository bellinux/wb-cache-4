5|$|Fly larvae {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly larvae to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy <b>wound</b> <b>healing.</b> The larvae also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E
5|$|Histological {{examination}} {{reveals that}} pachycephalosaurid domes {{are composed of}} a unique form of fibrolamellar bone which contains fibroblasts that {{play a critical role}} in <b>wound</b> <b>healing,</b> and are capable of rapidly depositing bone during remodeling. Peterson et al. (2013) concluded that taken together, the frequency of lesion distribution and the bone structure of frontoparietal domes, lends strong support to the hypothesis that pachycephalosaurids used their unique cranial structures for agonistic behavior. CT scan comparisons of the skulls of Stegoceras validum, Prenocephale prenes, and several head-striking artiodactyls have also supported pachycephalosaurids as being well-equipped for head-butting.|$|E
40|$|Background: Accelerating of skin <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> {{process has}} been focused by {{researchers}} in recent years. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the effects of topical phenytoin, silver sulfadiazine and conjugated estrogen on skin <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> in male rats. Accessing a way to accelerate skin <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> is still one of the important goals in medical science. Materials and Methods: This experimental study was accomplished on 32 male rats (8 animals in each group) with approximately equal body mass. Skin wounds were made with an area of 40 mmÂ² and a depth of 0. 5 mm on the back of the necks. Three groups were administered daily by topical phenytoin (1), silver sulfadiazine (1) and conjugated estrogen (625). Control group received no drug. <b>Wounds</b> <b>healing</b> was evaluated daily and the study was continued until the <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> completed. Results: Silver sulfadiazine demonstrated to be the best treatment for the <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> compared with the other medicines, it required significant shorter time of treatment. Conclusion: Silver sulfadiazine accelerates skin <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> in male rats...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} study "Experiences of nurses {{of primary care}} with <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> {{there are two main}} {{relevant}} questions [...] primary care of patients and <b>wounds</b> <b>healing.</b> Process of <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> has been for many years in significant attention of some medical branches. According to this interest many useful studies, discoveries and researches have been done. <b>Wounds</b> <b>healing</b> is not according to only affected locality, but also to the whole organism, immune system, metabolism, nourishment and many other aspects referential to this question. Patients with wounds can have more comfortable health care due to interests for tissue defects. However lots of experts try to implement new methods of <b>wounds</b> <b>healing,</b> majority of clients meet still the out of date therapies. Some kinds of primary health care have been used for a long time, other ones used to be used {{a long time ago and}} now are again renovating. All providers of primary health care are under capacity, financial and legislative pressure and so are not able to provide this health care in full extent. The aim of this study was to find "Experiences of nurses of primary care with different materials for <b>wounds</b> <b>healing.</b> For this aim the hypothesis "Nurses of primary care have not enough experiences with modern methods of <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> was settled. The second aim was "To discover the interests of nurses of primary care for new experiences of <b>wounds</b> <b>healing.</b> This aim was encouraged by hypothesis "Nurses have interests about new experiences of <b>wounds</b> <b>healing.</b> The information needed for this research were taken by questionnaires given to nurses working by general practitioners in České Budějovice and Benešov. Answers of 50 nurses were used for data processing. The hypothesis that nurses do not have enough experiences with <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> was confirmed. The second hypothesis was also confirmed. My work study could be useful for nurses of primary health care as summary of actual situation and so could improve the health care for clients...|$|R

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises jasmonic acid aldehydes and alcohols that function in <b>wound</b> <b>healing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote <b>wound</b> <b>healing.</b> Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their body cavities are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include <b>wound</b> <b>healing,</b> heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
40|$|Extract] Many {{surgical}} procedures are conducted each year. The {{majority of these}} procedures result in <b>wounds</b> that <b>heal</b> by primary intention, {{which means that the}} wound edges are approximated using sutures, staples, clips or glue. In <b>wounds</b> <b>healing</b> by secondary intention, the edges are not approximated and the <b>wound</b> <b>heals</b> by granulation, re-epithelialisation and contraction. Most <b>wounds</b> <b>heal</b> without complications but surgical site infections can occur after surgery in the site where the surgery took place. Most wound infections are caused by contamination during surgery with the patient’s own micro-organisms (Kulayalat 2007). They may be superficial and self-limiting, involving the skin only, or they may be deeper and life-threatening. Surgical site infection is classified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as superficial incisional, deep incisional and organ/space infections (CDC 2014; Mangram 1999) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E

25|$|Wound licking is also {{important}} in other animals. Removal of the salivary glands of mice and rats slows <b>wound</b> <b>healing,</b> and communal licking of wounds among rodents accelerates <b>wound</b> <b>healing.</b> Communal licking is common in several primate species. In macaques, hair surrounding a wound and any dirt is removed, and the wound is licked, healing without infection.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, {{angiogenesis}} and vascular remodelling is {{an important}} aspect of <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> and the long-term stability of tissue grafts.

50|$|One {{example of}} {{behavior}} that is modulated by Rho GTPase proteins is in the <b>healing</b> of <b>wounds.</b> <b>Wounds</b> <b>heal</b> differently between young chicks and adult chickens. In young chicks, <b>wounds</b> <b>heal</b> by contraction, much like a draw-string being pulled to close a bag. In older chickens, cells crawl across the wound through locomotion. The actin formation required to close the wounds in young chicks is controlled by Rho GTPase proteins, since, after injection of a bacterial exoenzyme used to block rho and rac activity, the actin polymers do not form, and thus the healing completely fails.|$|R

25|$|The body {{responds}} to postoperative wounds {{in the same}} manner as it does to tissue damage acquired in other circumstances. The inflammatory response is designed to create homeostasis. This first step is called the inflammatory stage. The next stage and <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> is the infiltration of leukocytes and release of cytokines into the tissue. The inflammatory response and the infiltration of leukocytes occur simultaneously. The final stage of postoperative <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> is called remodeling. Remodeling restores the structure of the tissue and that tissues ability to regain its function.|$|E
25|$|Both in vivo {{study and}} {{modelling}} are necessary tools {{to understand this}} complex process. Vascular remodelling is pertinent to <b>wound</b> <b>healing</b> and proper integration of tissue grafts and organ donations.
