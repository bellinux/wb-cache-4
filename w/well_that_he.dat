5|$|Michael Rosenbaum plays Lex Luthor, a billionaire's son sent to Smallville to run {{the local}} {{fertilizer}} plant. After Clark saves his life, they become fast friends. As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark crumbles until they consider themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling {{that he did not}} take his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.|$|E
5|$|When Jeremy Lin was sidelined for the 2017–18 NBA {{season after}} the first game, it opened up playing time. After Allen Crabbe started game 2, LeVert entered the {{starting}} lineup for game 3 on October 22 against the Atlanta Hawks, posting 16 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals. Coming off the bench on November 6 against the Phoenix Suns, LeVert posted a 5-steal performance, while locking down Devin Booker so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> frustrated Booker into fouling out.|$|E

25|$|McQueen {{was educated}} at his local primary school, {{performing}} so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> received an open {{scholarship to the}} Scotch College, Melbourne. At Scotch, McQueen proved himself as a scholar, becoming dux in classics in 1906 and winning a scholarship to Ormond College at Melbourne University in classics and mathematics. He was also a talented tennis player and athlete.|$|E
25|$|Since he was young, Trần Nhật Duật {{began to}} make friends with many foreigners from Champa or Song Dynasty with whom he could discuss by their own {{languages}} and customs. One of them was Triệu Trung, a refugee from China, who eventually became Trần Nhật Duật's subordinate during the war against Yuan Dynasty. Prince Chiêu Văn spoke foreign languages, even some exotic ones, so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was once mistaken as a Chinese by an Yuan ambassador.|$|E
25|$|Vainio {{succeeded in}} his {{preparation}} for his home championships excellently. The 10,000 metres final {{was held on}} the third day of the Championships. Despite the slow race which culminated in the last lap, Vainio finished fourth with the time 28:01.37, missing the gold medal by only 0.33 seconds and bronze by 0.11 seconds. The home audience was very impressed with his achievement, since they knew very <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not at his best in the slow races. The gold medal was won again by Alberto Cova.|$|E

5000|$|Wells {{had trouble}} placing the novel with a {{publisher}} because sales of his novels had declined in recent years, but The Autocracy of Mr. Parham {{proved to be}} [...] "one of Wells's better sellers in years".

25|$|In 1977, {{radio station}} WBUR-FM in Boston {{scheduled}} {{a panel of}} local car mechanics to discuss car repairs on one of its programs, but only Tom Magliozzi showed up. He did so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was asked to return as a guest, and he invited his younger brother Ray (who was actually more of a car repair expert) to join him. The brothers were soon asked to host their own radio show on WBUR, which they continued to do every week. In 1986, NPR decided to distribute their show nationally.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{fashionable to}} blame all of Asia's present {{problems}} on corruption {{and the failure}} of Asian values, it is at bottom a case of a bubble bursting, of too many imprudent lenders chasing too many incautious borrowers. But the greed of Mr. Suharto's children ensured that their father would take the lion's share of the blame for Indonesia's financial collapse. The Suharto children's favored position became a major obstacle to the measures needed to restore economic confidence. Worst of all, they ensured that the economic crisis would be a political crisis as <b>well.</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> allowed this, and that he amassed such wealth himself, is all the more mysterious since he lived a relatively modest life.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 Gover's {{progress}} was stalled by him shortening his run to conserve his energy, but when allowed his full run in 1936 Gover went from strength to strength. He took 54 wickets in May {{mostly on the}} placid Oval pitches, and carried on so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took 171 County Championship wickets for 15.42 each even when many pitches were too wet for him. He played for England against India at Old Trafford but the wicket was so good that even his energetic delivery could produce no venom. The following year (1937) Gover did equally well, again taking 201 wickets. He remains the only fast bowler to take that many wickets in a season, since Tom Richardson in 1897.|$|E

25|$|He {{originally}} {{joined the}} Surrey staff as a medium-paced bowler. In a minor match in 1923 he kept wicket when the regular wicketkeeper was injured, {{and did so}} <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> concentrated on his keeping from then on. When Strudwick retired after the 1927 season, Brooks succeeded him as the regular first team keeper, having already played in some matches from 1925 to 1927 when Strudwick was injured or away playing for England. He was notably acrobatic behind the stumps and kept particularly well to fast bowling. That he was regarded highly as a keeper is indicated {{by the fact that}} he played four times for the Players against the Gentlemen between 1931 and 1935. He took six catches in an innings against Kent at Blackheath in 1935, which equalled the Surrey record.|$|E
25|$|In June 1863, he was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General. Lee was discouraged from taking a field command by Davis, but encouraged by his father. Lee asked his father for a field command, but his father replied that his highest duty was obedience to his superiors. For the most part, he obeyed Davis, but during the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee was given the command of the troops in Richmond. In 1864, Lee was placed in command of Richmond's local defenses against General Grant and General Benjamin Butler. He did so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was given command of Richmond's eastern defenses at Chaffin's Bluff. Lee remained at Chaffin's Bluff throughout the next months, and in 1864, he {{was promoted}} to Major General. Shortly {{before the end of the}} war, he commanded troops in the field and was captured at Sayler's Creek; three days before his father surrendered on Palm Sunday April 9, 1865 to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at the McLean House in the village of Appomattox Court House, Virginia (see: Appomattox Court House National Historical Park).|$|E
25|$|Judah Ben-Hur {{trains in}} wrestling {{for five years}} in the Palaestra in Rome before {{becoming}} the heir of Arrius after his death. While traveling to Antioch on state business, Judah learns that his real father's chief servant, the slave Simonides, lives in a house in this city, and has the trust of Judah's father's possessions, which he has invested so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is now wealthy. Judah visits Simonides, who listens to his story but demands more proof of his identity. Ben-Hur says he has no proof, but asks if Simonides knows of the fate of Judah's mother and sister. He says he knows nothing and Judah leaves the house. Simonides sends his servant Malluch to spy on Judah to see if his story is true and to learn more about him. Shortly afterwards, Malluch meets and befriends Judah in the Grove of Daphne, and they go to the games stadium together. There, Ben-Hur finds his old rival Messala racing one of the chariots, preparing for a tournament.|$|E

How we had been made blind, deaf and dumb by this white race of people and how we must return to our people, our God and His religion of peace (Islam), {{the religion of the}} prophets. We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed {{from the face of the}} earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this wrong food is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He {{declared that}} he would heal us and set us in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.|$|E
25|$|Barnes took an {{apprenticeship}} in a foundry {{with the}} South Australian Railways in 1973 but the love {{he and his}} brother had for music led him to join a band. Swanee was now playing drums with Fraternity, who had just parted ways with singer Bon Scott. Barnes took over the role but his tenure with the band was brief and before long he had joined a harder-edged band called Orange, featuring organist and songwriter Don Walker, guitarist Ian Moss, drummer Steve Prestwich and bassist Les Kaczmarek (who would be replaced by Phil Small within two years). Within a short time the group had changed its name to Cold Chisel and began to develop a strong presence on the local music scene. Barnes' relationship with the band was often volatile and he left several times, leaving Moss to handle vocal duties until he returned. After a temporary move to Armidale, New South Wales while Walker completed his engineering studies there, Cold Chisel moved to Melbourne in August 1976 and then three months later shifted base to Sydney. Progress was slow and Barnes announced he was leaving once again in May 1977 to join Swanee in a band called Feather. However, his farewell performance with Cold Chisel went so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> changed his mind and decided to stay in the band and a month later the band was signed by WEA.|$|E

Although the character (originally an unnamed minor vampire) was supposed to die in the pilot, Whedon liked her performance so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> named her and her character appeared in a few more episodes. Benz went on to portray Darla in several episodes of Buffys spin-off television series, Angel. She later went on to say: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} composer whose music Beecham regularly performed was Handel, whom he called, [...] "the great international {{master of}} all time. ... He wrote Italian music {{better than any}} Italian; French music better than any Frenchman; English music better than any Englishman; and, {{with the exception of}} Bach, outrivalled all other Germans." [...] In his performances of Handel, Beecham ignored what he called the [...] "professors, pedants, pedagogues". [...] He followed Mendelssohn and Mozart in editing and reorchestrating Handel's scores to suit contemporary tastes. [...] At a time when Handel's operas were scarcely known, Beecham knew them so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was able to arrange three ballets, two other suites and a piano concerto from them. He gave Handel's oratorio Solomon its first performance since the 18th century, with a text edited by the conductor.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, Clayton {{was accused}} of {{deliberately}} tampering {{with the results of}} the U.S. house election between Thomas Boles and John Edwards in the third congressional district. According to Arkansas law, the results were to be certified and given to the secretary of state, then Robert J.T. White. After that, the governor and secretary of state would [...] "take up and arrange" [...] the results and the governor would issue a proclamation declaring the winner and deliver the seal of the state to him. Clayton {{was accused of}} adding around a hundred votes to the final count for Edwards, and declaring him the winner. Boles successfully contested the election and Clayton was indicted by the federal Circuit Court. Although the court found that Clayton did in fact falsify his proclamation and delivered the seal to Edwards knowing full <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not won, this was not illegal. His actions were in no way binding to the Congress and under federal law of the time, state governors were not considered election officials. Boles became a congressman.|$|E
500|$|The match saw Lindwall at his best. In his post-lunch spell, Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs, taking five wickets {{for eight}} runs, and {{finishing}} with 6/20 from 16.1 overs. Bradman described the spell as [...] "the most devastating {{and one of}} the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket". Fingleton, who played against the Bodyline attack in 1932–33, said [...] "I was watching a man almost the equal of Larwood [...] in pace... Truly a great bowler". O'Reilly wrote Lindwall's [...] "magnificent performance must go down {{as one of the greatest}} bowling efforts in Anglo-Australian Tests. He had two gruelingly long sessions in the innings and overcame each so <b>well</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> set the seal on his well-earned reputation as one of the best bowlers ever." [...] Hutton was the only batsman to resist the Lindwall-led attack, scoring 30 in 124 minutes and surviving 147 deliveries. The next most resilient display was from Yardley, who scored seven runs in 31 minutes of resistance, facing 33 balls. Miller and Johnston took 2/5 and 2/20 respectively, and Australia's pace trio removed all the batsmen without Bradman having to call upon Ring's leg spin.|$|E
