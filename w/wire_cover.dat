The winged contraband had taken Nelly at her word, and flown away on the journey home. Little Rob was put in a large cage, where he could use his legs, yet not injure his lame wing. Forked-tongue lay under a <b>wire</b> <b>cover,</b> on sprigs of fennel, for the gardener said that snakes were fond of it. The Babes in the Wood were put to bed {{in one of the}} rush baskets, under a cotton-wool coverlet. Greenback, the beetle, found ease for his unknown aches in the warm heart of a rose, where he sunned himself all day. The Commodore was made happy in a tub of water, grass, and stones, and Mr. Fuzz was put in a well-ventilated glass box to decide whether he would be a cocoon or not.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Wire</b> (<b>cover</b> title Wire) is a British avant garde music magazine, {{founded in}} 1982 by jazz {{promoter}} Anthony Wood and journalist Chrissie Murray. The magazine initially concentrated on contemporary jazz and improvised music, but branched {{out in the}} early 1990s to various types of experimental music. Since then it has covered hip hop, modern classical, free improvisation, post-rock, and various forms of electronic music.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1981 and 1985, Wire ceased {{recording}} and performing {{in favour of}} solo and collaborative projects such as Dome, Cupol, Duet Emmo and several Colin Newman solo efforts. In 1985, the group re-formed as a [...] "beat combo" [...] (a joking reference to early 1960s beat music), with greater use of electronic musical instruments. Wire announced that they would perform none of their older material, hiring The Ex-Lion Tamers (a <b>Wire</b> <b>cover</b> band named after a song title from Pink Flag) as their opening act. The Ex-Lion Tamers played Wire's older songs, and Wire played their new material. Wire released IBTABA in 1989, a [...] "live" [...] album of mostly reworked versions of songs from The Ideal Copy and A Bell Is a Cup, heavily rearranged, edited, and remixed. A new song from the album, [...] "Eardrum Buzz", was released as a single and peaked at number 68 in the UK singles chart.|$|E

5000|$|The band's profile {{was raised}} by {{extensive}} touring, including an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1990 and tours of Japan in late 1990 and the US (with Ride) {{in the spring of}} 1991. Preceded by the Black Spring EP issued in October 1991, Lush's first full-length album of completely new material, Spooky, was released in January 1992. Again produced by Guthrie, Spooky featured a sound very similar to Guthrie's band Cocteau Twins, with walls of sound {{and a great deal of}} guitar effects. Reviews were mixed and critics of the album held that Guthrie's production brought the sound away from the band's original creative vision, although it sold well, reaching No. 7 in the UK Albums Chart. The album was preceded by the band's first UK top 40 single, [...] "For Love", which was partly re-recorded and remixed by Mark Freegard. He also produced the single's B-sides: the original recording of [...] "Starlust", <b>Wire</b> <b>cover</b> [...] "Outdoor Miner" [...] and the only Lush track with lead vocals by Anderson, [...] "Astronaut". Gil Norton remixed [...] "Superblast!" [...] for the Japanese single release. Rippon left the band after recording the [...] "For Love" [...] EP to concentrate on writing; though his book Cold Turkey Sandwich—a fictionalised chronicle of his time touring—was rejected by publishers. He was replaced by Phil King. During the summer of 1992, Lush toured America as part of the second edition of the Lollapalooza festival. Lush was added to the roster by Lollapalooza organiser Perry Farrell, the Jane's Addiction/Porno for Pyros frontman, who personally requested Lush.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom {{requires}} {{the use of}} <b>wire</b> <b>covered</b> with green/yellow striped insulation, for safety earthing (grounding) connections. This growing international standard was adopted for its distinctive appearance, to reduce the likelihood of dangerous confusion of safety earthing (grounding) wires with other electrical functions, especially by persons affected by red-green colour blindness.|$|R

50|$|The {{interesting}} {{consequence of}} this behavior is that, while a single 2 mm length of wire has a delay of 4 µs, two separate 1 mm wires only have a delay of 1 µs each. The two separate <b>wires</b> <b>cover</b> the same distance in half the time! By cutting the wire in half, we can double its speed.|$|R

50|$|A noseclip or {{nose clip}} is a device made of <b>wire</b> <b>covered</b> in rubber or of plastic, and is worn by people during {{a wide range}} of aquatic {{activities}} such as kayaking, freediving, recreational swimming, synchronized swimming and waterdance. It is designed to hold the nostrils closed to prevent water from entering, or air from escaping. Some types of nose clips also feature a long band to keep the clip around the neck while it is not being used.|$|R
25|$|Another {{design was}} {{patented}} in 1894 by inventors John Buchanan and Alexander Gordon from Melbourne, Australia. The construction {{was based on}} a frame of spiral <b>wires</b> <b>covered</b> with waterproof material. The design was improved by Alexander Gordon by attaching the suit to the helmet and other parts and incorporating jointed radius rods in the limbs. This resulted in a flexible suit which could withstand high pressure. The suit was manufactured by British firm Siebe Gorman and trialed in Scotland in 1898.|$|R
5000|$|Camp {{conditions}} were challenging {{due to high}} heat conditions, water shortages, lack of restroom facilities, and large amounts of trash. The camps were secured using fences constructed of concertina <b>wire</b> <b>covered</b> in netting and were surrounded by portable light generators. Refugees lived in tents, and slept on military issue cots. Portable restrooms were located throughout the camp, and Navy Seabees constructed concrete shower facilities within the camps. Camp security included interior camp patrols, exterior camp patrols, and fixed exterior towers.|$|R

500|$|The show {{opened with}} Sabu versus Abyss in the (first-ever) [...] "Barbed Wire Massacre", {{in which the}} ring ropes were {{replaced}} with barbed wire, {{and the only way}} to win was by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell accompanied Abyss to the ring. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 59 seconds. Early in the bout Sabu was pushed face-first into the barbed wire ropes as a result of Abyss kicking out of a pin attempt. Later, Abyss lifted up and dropped Sabu face-first into the barbed wire ropes. After this Sabu used a sharp weapon, which he had hidden under his belt, to stab Abyss in the arm repeatedly. Abyss was next to fall into the barbed wire after Sabu tripped him as he ran. A barbed wire wrapped steel was introduced in the match, which Sabu used to bash Abyss over the head. A barbed <b>wire</b> <b>covered</b> board was pushed into the ring after this by Sabu, which Abyss used to lift up and drop Sabu on. Another barbed <b>wire</b> <b>covered</b> board was introduced following this, with Sabu causing Abyss to run into it. He then pushed Abyss onto the other one and covered him for the pin to win the encounter.|$|R
25|$|A fan {{edition of}} Tangled Up was also {{available}} through Girls Aloud's official website; the artwork incorporates {{each of the}} members holding onto long thick metal <b>wires</b> <b>covered</b> in rubber, while the original photos were placed inside the booklet. Additionally, the CD came with the lyrics and signed postcards. Despite the change, which was positively received, the artwork was noted by critics for its slightly uneven display of member Nicola Roberts, whose photo occupies marginally less space {{than those of the}} remaining four members, as described by Fraser McAlphine of BBC Music.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{modified}} FDTD method using a hybrid Cartesian-cylindrical coordinate system is presented for modeling long wires with a axial symmetry structure.

30|$|The {{electrode}} {{used was}} either a copper plate, a carbon rod, or a pod with a lead <b>wire</b> <b>covered</b> with PbCl 2. Several plates or rods were sometimes used to form an electrode. The electrode locations were moved and the electrode distances changed several times, with the most recent change at KAK made in March 1988 (Japan Meteorological Agency 1989). Previously, both long-distance (~ 1 km) and short-distance (~ 300 m) observations were undertaken; however, the long-distance observations ceased in 1988 because population pressures around the three sites rendered large-scale observations difficult. The short-distance observations have been undertaken since 1988 at all three observatories.|$|R
