500|$|After leaving Firestone in 1920, Willkie joined leading Akron {{law firm}} Mather & Nesbitt, which {{represented}} several local public utilities. Although he quickly {{gained a reputation}} as a leading trial lawyer, he was especially noted for presenting utility cases before the Ohio Public Utilities Commission. In 1925, he became president of the Akron Bar Association. One of Willkie's clients, Ohio Power & Light, was owned by New York-based Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (C), whose chairman, B.C. Cobb, noticed him. Cobb wrote to the senior partner of Willkie's firm, [...] "I think he is a comer and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> an eye on him." [...] In 1929, Cobb offered Willkie a salary of $36,000 to be corporate counsel to C, a job which would involve a move to New York, and Willkie accepted.|$|E
500|$|On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah's behalf to {{recommend}} to the British king, George VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan's first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who {{had hoped to}} have that position in both dominions—he would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten {{would be likely to}} favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, as well as sectarian violence. [...] Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten's plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, [...] "That's the end of that." [...] On 11 August, he presided over the new constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, [...] "You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that {{has nothing to do with}} the business of the State ... I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State." [...] On 14 August, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, [...] "here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{a fire in}} 1905, the {{building}} was renovated by Brinton Davis. When he visited Louisville in 1948, Frank Lloyd Wright referred specifically to the Courthouse when he said, [...] "Louisville's architecture represents {{the quality of the}} old South; we should not build this type of building anymore but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> those we have left." [...] This was after efforts in the 1940s to demolish it for urban renewal.|$|E

2500|$|The first crest {{to appear}} on a Reading kit was in 1953, it {{featured}} just the letter [...] "R". There was no crest seen again until 1981 {{when there was a}} crest featuring three trees and the rivers Thames and Kennet, this only lasted two seasons. From 1987–96 the crest used the new kit colours of yellow, sky blue, royal blue and white. In 1995 chairman Sir John Madejski said, [...] "I know some traditionalists will say <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> the old badge but they should bear in mind the need to move forward." [...] This crest only lasted from 1996–98 when the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium. The current crest was first seen on the kits for the 1998–99 season. It is based on the club colours, blue and white, and includes a crown to represent the County of Berkshire and a Maiwand Lion to represent Reading.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996 the Israeli weekly {{newspaper}} Kol Ha'ir published the personal accounts of {{several members of}} the Israeli artillery battery responsible for the shelling of the Qana camp. The soldiers spoke under condition of anonymity. One acknowledged that they were encouraged by their commander after the attack: [...] "He told us it was war. Come on, the bastards fire at you, what can you do? He told us we were firing well and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>keep</b> it up, and that Arabs, you know there are millions of them," [...] Soldier A was quoted as saying. Another artilleryman, Soldier T, was quoted as saying that [...] "no-one spoke about it {{as if it was a}} mistake. We did our job and we are at peace with that. Even 'S' told us we were great and that they were just a bunch of Arabs (in Hebrew, 'arabushim')...How many Arabs are there and how many Jews? A few 'arabushim' die, there is no harm in that." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by another soldier, Soldier Y, who remarked, [...] "it's a war, in a war these things happen...It's just a bunch of Arabs. Why are you taking it so hard?" [...] An official army spokesman's statement questioned the accuracy of Kol Ha'ir report.|$|E
