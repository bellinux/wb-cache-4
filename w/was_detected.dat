By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which <b>was</b> <b>detected</b> in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK <b>was</b> <b>detected.</b> Using a 1024-bit RSA key, {{it was believed}} {{large enough to be}} computationally infeasible to break without a concerted distributed effort.|$|E
