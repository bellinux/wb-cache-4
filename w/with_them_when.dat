The dead Doctor is {{revealed}} to be an older self, after his younger version returns. They try {{to understand what the}} future Doctor said and are sent to Washington D.C. The team deals with the Silence, a race of aliens with the ability to make people forget their encounter <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they look away.|$|E
5|$|The English Great Horse was valued {{during the}} reign of Henry VIII, when stallions {{measuring}} less than 'fifteen handfuls' could not be kept, but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle. Oliver Cromwell's cavalry favoured lighter, faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead. During the 16th century, Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they came to England to drain the fens, and these horses probably had a significant influence on what became the Shire breed.|$|E
5|$|The four {{released}} {{their debut}} full-length studio album, Something About Airplanes, on August 18, 1998. The album was favorably reviewed {{in the independent}} music scene. In 1998 the band also met their long-term manager Jordan Kurland. Kurland had heard good things about them, and after a failed attempt to see them play at South By Southwest finally hooked up <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> touring with his then client, the band Crumb.|$|E

5|$|The local Cathars held {{a special}} place in their {{religion}} for horses, especially through their belief in the transmigration of souls. There was also a belief in Pamiers that knights took their horses <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they died. In the 12th century, the Cathar princess Esclarmonde of Foix climbed to the fortress of Château de Montségur {{on the back of a}} small, sure-footed black horse. In the 14th century, the same small black horses are mentioned as accompanying the armies of Gaston III, Count of Foix.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining what to do <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> given a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients {{to take a chance}} at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{he is the}} {{lieutenant}} of Gabriel Roman, and helps him hold Sullivan and Drake hostage. He also leads a team of highly trained mercenaries hired by Roman. Though never made into a chapter, Nate and Elena attempt to sneak into an airship to get to an island in search of El Dorado, but the area was infested by Navarro's mercenaries. After killing them, Navarro appears in an armored truck and begins firing at them with a chaingun. Nate knocks a telephone pole on his truck using explosive barrels, and escapes on the plane with Elena. Sometime later, he and Roman travel to the island so Roman can sell El Dorado {{for a lot of}} money that Sully owes him (who they took <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> Nate thought he was dead), unaware that Navarro has his own plan of selling it. Eventually, they team up with Eddy Raja, who is also searching for statue of El Dorado, and try to keep Nate away from it.|$|E
5|$|His family {{returns to}} Epcot, where {{the tension between}} Jim and Emily comes to a head after a drunk Jim vomits while on the Gran Fiesta Tour. Spotting the French girls, Emily argues with Jim about his obvious {{interest}} in them and slaps Sara. Embarrassed, she returns to the hotel with Elliot, leaving Jim and Sara to ride on the Soarin' attraction at Spaceship Earth, where Jim imagines a beautiful topless woman superimposed over the ride's video footage of landscapes, who promises they will be together soon. After the ride, Sophie approaches and invites Jim to come <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> Jim refuses, Sophie spits {{on his face and}} she walks off, Jim notices that Sara disappeared and searches frantically for her, but the park guards use a taser to knock him unconscious.|$|E
5|$|In 1595 Żółkiewski {{participated in}} the Moldavian {{campaign}} and the battle of Cecora near the Prut river. The following year he defeated the Cossack uprising of Severyn Nalivaiko. Żółkiewski was a known supporter of Cossack grievances, and generally favored peaceful negotiations <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> the Cossacks surrendered Nalivaiko and other leaders of the uprising to him he guaranteed their fair treatment. But Nalivaiko was subsequently executed in Warsaw, and a mob of Polish soldiers massacred the other prisoners, {{which led to a}} deterioration in Polish-Cossack relations. In 1600 Żółkiewski returned to Moldova, where he took part in the victorious battle of Bukowo.|$|E

5|$|Julius Caesar {{mentions}} {{small black}} horses that resemble the Mérens in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico (Commentaries on the Gallic War), when discussing {{the defeat of}} Crassus by the Sotiates and their cavalry. Historian Paul Prunet {{was the first to}} link the animals discussed by Caesar to the Mérens, although the relationship has not been definitely established. The location of the Sotiates is the subject of controversy, with some authors placing them in the district of Nerac and others near Foix. The Mérens may have been used as a pack animal by the Romans, who may have taken some of the animals <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they left. The small black horse from the Pyrenees is described throughout antiquity.|$|E

Morrow is directed to safety, while Reyes stops to confront one of the prisoners, a member of the gang who were responsible for him becoming the Ghost Rider. The prisoner reveals that they were hired to carry out the job, but does not know who by, before the Ghost Rider murders him. Outside the prison, Morrow is found by Lucy who needs his help to read the Darkhold and revert her ghostly state.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans prized saffron as a perfume or {{deodoriser}} {{and scattered}} it about their public spaces: royal halls, courts, and amphitheatres alike. When Nero entered Rome they spread saffron along the streets; wealthy Romans partook of daily saffron baths. They {{used it as}} mascara, stirred saffron threads into their wines, cast it aloft in their halls and streets as a potpourri, and offered it to their deities. Roman colonists took saffron <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they settled in southern Roman Gaul, where it was extensively cultivated until the AD 271 barbarian invasion of Italy. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century Moors or with the Avignon Papacy in the 14th century.|$|E

5|$|Diving beetles, {{such as the}} Dytiscidae, carry {{a bubble}} of air <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they dive. Such a bubble may be {{contained}} under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs. The bubble covers {{at least some of}} the spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae. The function of the bubble is not only to contain a store of air, but to act as a physical gill. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 13th century Henry III began to {{redesign}} his favourite castles, including Winchester and Windsor, building larger halls, grander chapels, installing glass windows and decorating the palaces with painted walls and furniture. This marked the beginning of a trend towards the development of grand castles designed for elaborate, elite living. Life in earlier keeps had been focused around a single great hall, with privacy for the owner's family provided by using an upper floor for their own living accommodation. By the 14th century nobles were travelling less, bringing much larger households <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> they did travel and entertaining visitors with equally large retinues. Castles such as Goodrich were redesigned in the 1320s to provide greater residential privacy and comfort for the ruling family, while retaining strong defensive features and a capacity to hold over 130 residents at the castle. The design influenced subsequent conversions at Berkeley and by the time that Bolton Castle was being built, in the 1380s, it was designed to hold up to eight different noble households, each with their own facilities. Royal castles such as Beaumaris, although designed with defence in mind, were designed to hold up to eleven different households at any one time.|$|E

5|$|One of Ranulf's {{brothers}} was Fulcher, who was Bishop of Lisieux in 1101. Another {{brother was}} Osbern, {{who was a}} royal clerk for Rufus, and the last brother was Geoffrey. Fulcher may have been appointed bishop to enable Ranulf to exploit the see while Ranulf was in exile in Normandy. Ranulf had a son, Thomas, who also held the see of Lisieux, right after his uncle. Like his uncle, {{he may have been}} appointed as a placeholder to allow his father to appropriate the revenues of Lisieux. Ranulf's mistress was an Englishwoman named Alveva or Ælfgifu, who was the mother of at least two of his sons. Alveva's sons were Ranulf, who was an archdeacon, and Elias. When Ranulf became bishop, he married her to a burgess of Huntingdon, but remained on good terms with both Alveva and her spouse, often staying <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> he travelled away from Durham. Alveva was the aunt of Christina of Markyate, and Christina is said to have rebuffed the bishop's attempts to seduce her in 1114. Alveva and Ranulf's son Elias held a prebend at London and was a royal clerk under Henry I. Ranulf's son Ralf was parson of Middleham and held a prebend at London too. He was a member of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury's household after 1138. Some of Ranulf's sons were educated at Laon under William de Corbeil, who was one of Ranulf's clerks. One of Ranulf's nephews, Ralf, was archdeacon of Northumberland and during the reign of King Stephen helped to hold the diocese of Durham loyal to Stephen. Other nephews were Osbert, who was sheriff of Durham, and Robert, Richard, and William who held fiefs. Unrelated to Ranulf, William of Corbeil became one of Ranulf's household clerks, and was eventually to be elected Archbishop of Canterbury in 1123.|$|E
