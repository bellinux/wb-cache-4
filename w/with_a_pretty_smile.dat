60|$|She thought {{until the}} supper-bell rang, {{and then she}} rose and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> and flush upon her face, which showed that her {{thoughts}} had {{not in the least}} worried her, she put the sweet-pea blossom into a little jar which she had brought from Florence, and which was just big enough for one small flower.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you? Is {{it strange}} {{you should have}} a taste common to all human beings?" [...] she {{returned}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "But it is easier to ask questions than to answer them. If you had never seen the sun setting in glory, or the midnight sky shining with myriads of stars, could you imagine these things if I described them to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She gave {{a little}} start and scream, and stood up to let him pass. He was about to rebuke her for doing such work at such an hour; but he saw her flushed, panting, and evidently very tired, and his wrath was averted. Hurrying on to the drawing-room, he found Isabel eagerly writing. She looked up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> of greeting; but he only ran {{his hand through his}} already disordered hair, and exclaimed-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't look on you {{quite as}} he does now,' said Amy, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>smile.</b> 'Do you think his opinion of you will ever alter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} it of all things," [...] said Gwendolen. [...] "There is nothing I enjoy more than taking aim--and hitting," [...] she ended, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> nod and <b>smile.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And Lady Julia De Guest {{was already}} there, {{the sister of}} the other old earl, {{who lived in the}} next county. She had only arrived on the day before, but had been quick in {{spreading}} the news as to Crosbie's engagement. [...] "Engaged to one of the Dales, is he?" [...] said the countess, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> little <b>smile,</b> which showed plainly that the matter was one of no interest to herself. [...] "Has she got any money?" ...|$|R
60|$|I looked {{somewhat}} anxiously at the weather, I {{feared the}} shower would cease, {{and in a}} minute, alas! the rain passed away; and I was forced to notice it, for the sun-rays came dancing through the window, importunately, making patterns of light upon the floor. I had no further excuse to stay, and said good-bye; but I begged for the bunch of violets in Soledad's dark hair and she gave it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile.</b> I plunged again into the endless olive-groves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] she said, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "let me do the talking. Don't look so downcast. When I {{tell you}} that you have made me very, very happy, you should look happy too. When you came to me yesterday, and said what you said, I thought you were in too much of a hurry; but now I think that perhaps you were right, and that when people of our age have {{anything}} important to do it is well to do it at once; for in this world {{there are all sorts of}} things continually springing up to prevent people from being happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Scotch lassie's eyes caught Amelia's at {{the same}} time, and she broke into <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> of good-humoured amusement. [...] "Taken in another person, Dick, dear!"

60|$|The {{view from}} the summit was both {{extensive}} and grand, but neither Lilian nor Mimmy were much pleased with the place. The elder sister, who had talked over the matter with her school companions, expected <b>a</b> fine castle <b>with</b> turrets, battlements, and romance; and the other expected <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smiling</b> house, such as princes, in her mind, ought to inhabit.|$|R
60|$|Her kind {{blue eyes}} met mine in an infinitude of friendliness. Her lips in her pauses shaped in <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> faint <b>smile.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{teaching}} {{him to talk}} for me," [...] the young girl went on, without heeding her mother; [...] "to say little things in society. It will save {{me a great deal}} of trouble. Stenterello, love, give <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> and say tanti complimenti!" [...] The poodle wagged his white pate--it looked like one of those little pads in swan's-down, for applying powder to the face--and repeated the barking process.|$|R
60|$|Jane {{was one of}} {{the large}} number of people whom it seemed my wife's fortune to carry through life on her back. She was <b>a</b> <b>pretty,</b> <b>smiling,</b> {{pleasing}} daughter of Erin, who had been in our family originally as nursery-maid. I had been greatly pleased in watching a little idyllic affair growing up between her and a joyous, good-natured young Irishman, to whom at last we married her. Mike soon after, however, took to drinking and unsteady courses; and the result has been to Jane only <b>a</b> yearly baby, <b>with</b> poor health and no money.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{really had}} <b>an</b> {{extraordinarily}} <b>pretty</b> <b>smile,</b> {{and there was}} something in her soft bright brown eye--like the movement of some quick little bird. And--she was like somebody he knew! Indeed she was. She was quite ready to be spoken to.|$|R
60|$|The last {{member of}} the party to {{disembark}} was a girl of about nineteen, {{and it was the}} young man who stood at the boat's prow to lift her high and dry upon land. She gave him <b>a</b> brave and <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> of thanks, but no words passed between them.|$|R
60|$|Miss Conway gave <b>a</b> very <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> {{of sympathy}} and consolation, that shone like a sunbeam on her {{beautiful}} pensive features and dark, soft eyes. Then {{she began to}} admire the view, as they stood on the turf, beside Captain Hannaford's two small cannon, overlooking the water towards Bickleypool, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> purple hill rising behind it. A yacht was sailing into the harbour, and James ran indoors to fetch a spy-glass, while Lady Conway seized the occasion of asking her nephew his tutor's name.|$|R
50|$|Xifeng's {{relationship}} with her sybaritic husband changed greatly as the story processed. At first, Jia Lian was infatuated with his new bride, weeping hysterically when she got ill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> voodoo curse. But he is a womanizer by nature, and grew tired of Xifeng's stringent control. In one chapter, he slept <b>with</b> <b>a</b> servant woman during his daughter's illness; in another, he was caught {{in bed with the}} wife of his servant on Xifeng's birthday. The fatal turn in their relationship came when Jia Lian met You Erjie at a funeral, and married her in secret (right after Xifeng's abortion). Xifeng was kept in the dark for months. When she found out, the outraged mistress came up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cunning plan. She put on <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> and invited You Erjie to live with the Jia family, putting the unfortunate concubine completely under her control. In the end, You Erjie lost her child to a charlatan and committed suicide. Xifeng and Jia Lian's relationship deteriorated quickly after this.|$|R
60|$|So saying, she resumed {{her seat}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> air of dignity.|$|R
6000|$|Just {{as we had}} {{concluded}} the above remarks comes <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> little note sealed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> little butterfly--bearing <b>a</b> northern postmark--and to the following effect:-- ...|$|R
40|$|Capitalism {{has become}} strange. Ironically, while the ‘age of work’ {{seems to have}} come to an end, working has assumed a total {{presence}} – a ‘worker’s society’ in the worst {{sense of the term}} – where everyone finds themselves obsessed with it. So what does the worker tell us today? "I feel drained, empty… dead. " This book {{tells the story of the}} dead man working. It follows this figure through the daily tedium of the office, to the humiliating mandatory team building exercise, to awkward encounters with the funky boss who pretends to hate capitalism and tells you to be authentic. In this society, the experience of work is not of dying [...] . but neither of living. It is one of a living death. And yet, the dead man working is nevertheless compelled to wear the exterior signs of life, to throw <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile,</b> feign enthusiasm and make a half-baked joke. When the corporation has colonized life itself, even our dreams, the question of escape becomes ever more pressing, ever more desperate...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{made the}} handsomest bride that ever {{came out of}} Milby church, too,' said Mrs. Pettifer. 'Such a very fine figure! And it showed off her white poplin so well. And what <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>smile</b> Janet always had! Poor thing, she keeps that now for all her old friends. I never see her but she has {{something}} pretty to say to me--living in the same street, you know, I can't help seeing her often, though I've {{never been to the}} house since Dempster broke out on me in one of his drunken fits. She comes to me sometimes, poor thing, looking so strange, anybody passing her in the street may see plain enough what's the matter; but she's always got some little good-natured plan in her head for all that. Only last night I met her, I saw five yards off she wasn't fit to be out; but she had a basin in her hand, full of something she was carrying to Sally Martin, the deformed girl that's in a consumption.' ...|$|R

60|$|But Kilmeny was charmingly at ease. There {{was not a}} {{trace of}} embarrassment in her manner, though there was <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> shyness. Eric <b>smiled</b> as he {{recalled}} HIS first meeting with her. He suddenly realized how far Kilmeny had come since then and how much she had developed.|$|R
60|$|She stopped, {{gazing into}} Courtland's face <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> vague impatience {{and a slight}} pouting of her lip.|$|R
60|$|Nellie Seaforth nodded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> gravity, for {{the bond}} between them all was {{stronger}} than friendship usually is.|$|R

60|$|Lady Barbara {{first took}} her up-stairs, {{and showed her}} a little long narrow bed-room, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> pink-curtained bed in it.|$|R
60|$|Her eyes sparkled, and {{she tossed}} her chin <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty,</b> wilful {{air of a}} woman who is {{mistress}} of the situation.|$|R
60|$|Rose laughed, but {{the color}} deepened {{in her cheeks}} as she {{answered}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> mixture of maidenly shyness and natural candor.|$|R

6000|$|... 'What does a shrivelled old grey {{thing like}} that want <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> young bride?' thought the brothers, and went on their way.|$|R
6000|$|... "How very provoking!" [...] exclaimed Ruth, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> little frown on her {{innocent}} face {{after reading}} the letter to her stately mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm no heroine and no beauty, so I {{shall never}} enter your poetical paradise," [...] said Lillian, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> {{affectation}} of regret.|$|R
