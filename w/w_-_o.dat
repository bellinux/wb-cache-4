These reversible reactions induce changes in the <b>W</b> <b>-</b> <b>O</b> bond system while maintaining the <b>W</b> <b>-</b> <b>O</b> skeleton. The effect of the intercalation process on the host crystalline structure has been studied with respect to the v(O - <b>W</b> <b>-</b> <b>O)</b> stretching vibration changes and lattice parameter variations by means of infrared and X-ray diffraction measurements. Among the main results, the intercalation process is shown to be strongly influenced by the structural type of the host compound as well as its amorphous versus crystalline nature. For instance, for the ReO 3 type oxides (monoclinic and cubic WO 3) and hexagonal WO 3, v(O - <b>W</b> <b>-</b> <b>O)</b> shifts to higher frequency are assigned to a shortening effect of <b>W</b> <b>-</b> <b>O</b> bonds.

Converging spectroscopic and computational evidence point to a unique role played by the lacunary structure, and allow to address the electronic and structural factors dictating the protonation sites and equilibria of these complexes, as well as their impact on H 2 O 2 activation. In all cases, the evolution of the four terminal <b>W</b> <b>-</b> <b>O</b> functions, bordering the site defect on the polyoxotungstate surface, towards a bis-aquo, bis-oxo structure is preferred over the formation of four terminal hydroxo ligands.

Variation associated with these factors make selection for increased weight less effective. To improve selection response, selection {{must be based on}} genotypic rather than environmentally induced superiority. It is well-documented that corrections for classifiable sources of variation render selection and culling more accurate, thereby increasing rates of genetic improvement. The objective of this study were to develop within breed adjustment factors for post-natal lamb weights. Field records from Suffolk and Dorset lambs collected in the U. S.

The presence of small amount of acid (TFA/HCl/HNO 3, ect.) is essential. This amount should be kept very precise to provide pH 1.6 ± 0.4. The most informative peak separation can be obtained with saline:acetonitrile mixture (1 : 1 ÷ 1 : 3) containing 0.06 - 0.08 % TFA. Experiment details and critical features will be presented.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to give {{characteristics}} of the SWOT-analysis, to decode its components using schematic display of the process of occurrence of a crisis situation, in which the influence of factors of the external and internal environment of the enterprise is reflected. From this point of view, it is possible to consider the SWOT-analysis as one of the basic aspects, which are necessary for the effective application of a technique of crisis management. One of the major principles of the strategy of crisis management is constant monitoring of the external and internal environment of a company in order to detect an approaching threat of a crisis as soon as possible. Crisis management of a company begins from the moment when its mission is chosen, i. е. from the answer to the question: "What to do?” At all following stages of the development of a company, the attention of its management should be concentrated to the duly "catching" of the signals testifying to possible weakening of the position of a company, its competitive status. In order to do it, it is necessary to build the system, which would allow to combine the quantitative and qualitative analysis of threat "signals" that a crisis condition is approaching, thus, decreasing the competitive status of a company.

40|$|A {{regional}} eddy-resolving {{primitive equation}} circulation model {{was used to}} simulate circulation on the southeastern Bering Sea (SEBS) shelf and basin. This model resolves the dominant observed mean currents, eddies and meanders in the region, and simultaneously includes both tidal and subtidal dynamics. Circulation, temperature and salinity fields for years 1995 and 1997 were hindcast, using daily wind and buoyancy flux estimates, and tidal forcing derived from a global model. This paper describes {{the development of the}} regional model, a comparison of model results with available Eulerian and Lagrangian data, a comparison of results between the two hindcast years, and a sensitivity analysis. Based on these hindcasts and sensitivity analyses, we suggest the following: 1) The Bering Slope Current (BSC) is a primary source of large (~ 100 km diameter) eddies in the SEBS basin. Smaller meanders are also formed along the 100 m isobath on the southeastern shelf, and along the 200 m isobath near the shelf break. 2) There is substantial interannual variability in the statistics of eddies within the basin, driven by variability in the strength of the ANSC. 3) The mean flow on the shelf is not strongly sensitive to changes in the imposed strength of the ANSC; rather, it is strongly sensitive to the local wind forcing. 4) Vertical mixing in the SEBS is strongly affected by both tidal and subtidal dynamics. Strongest mixing in the SEBS may in fact occur between the 100 and 400 m isobaths, near the Pribilof Islands, and in Unimak Pass.
