He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> for him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
