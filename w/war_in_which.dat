5|$|Accusations of Żydokomuna {{accompanied}} the incidents of anti-Jewish violence in Poland during Polish–Soviet War of 1920, legitimized as self-defense against {{a people who}} were oppressors of the Polish nation. Some soldiers and officers in the Polish eastern territories shared the conviction that Jews were enemies of the Polish nation-state and were collaborators with Poland's enemies. Some of these troops treated all Jews as Bolsheviks. According to some sources, anticommunist sentiment was implicated in anti-Jewish violence and killings {{in a number of}} towns, including the Pinsk massacre, in which 35 Jews, taken as hostages, were murdered, and the Lwów pogrom during the Polish-Ukrainian <b>War,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> 72 Jews were killed.

5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a <b>war</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> they would provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|Between 1960 and 1992, the Navy {{carried out}} a program that {{included}} the study of marine mammals' abilities with sonar, {{with the objective of}} improving the detection of underwater objects.

The program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working underwater by holding cameras in their mouths to locate lost objects, survey ships and submarines, and underwater monitoring. A similar program was used by the Russian Navy during the Cold <b>War,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> belugas were also trained for antimining operations in the Arctic.|$|E
5|$|By November 1987, Castro began {{spending}} {{more time on the}} Angolan Civil <b>War,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the Marxists had fallen into retreat. Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos successfully appealed for more Cuban troops, with Castro later admitting that he devoted more time to Angola than to the domestic situation, believing that a victory would lead to the collapse of apartheid. Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola. Castro was angered by Gorbachev's approach, believing that he was abandoning the plight of the world's poor in favor of détente.|$|E

The Royalist commander, Prince Rupert, stationed himself at Didsbury Ees, to the south of Barlow Moor.

Years after the Great Ninja War, it is revealed that from one of Orochimaru's test subjects who has a unique ability of accepting tissue and organ transplantation, Shin Uchiha, came multiple clones of children having cloned Sharingan; the survivors are taken in by Konoha's orphanage. Sasuke's daughter, Sarada, also eventually awakens her own Sharingan.|$|E
