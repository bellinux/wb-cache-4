3000|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the hydrological impact of afforestation by comparing the water and salt balances of a neighbouring grassland, a hybrid poplar plantation and an oak forest in the Hungarian Great Plain. The question is an important one since the EU actively promotes afforestation and 15 – 18, 000  ha are being forested in Hungary each year. Hybrid poplar is the most planted forest type in shallow groundwater areas of the Hungarian Great Plain because of its profitability. Key questions are generally the following: What will be the effects of afforestation on the <b>water-salt</b> <b>balance</b> of the target area, and, second, do poplar plantations have similar or significantly different effects than native oak woodlands?

40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) {{comprise}} a post-transcriptional layer of gene regulation {{shown to be}} involved in diverse physiological processes. We aimed to study whether regulatory networks that determine susceptibility to hypertension may involve a miRNA component. Screening of loci, involved in renal <b>water–salt</b> <b>balance</b> regulation, highlighted the mineralocorticoid receptor gene NR 3 C 2 as a potential target for several miRNAs. A luciferase assay demonstrated that miR- 124 and miR- 135 a suppress NR 3 C 2 3 ′UTR reporter construct activity 1. 5 - and 2. 2 -fold, respectively. As the tested miRNAs did not reduce the levels of target mRNA, we suggest that the binding of miR- 124 and miR- 135 a to NR 3 C 2 3 ′UTR contributes to the translational, not transcriptional regulation of the gene. Co-expression of two different miRNAs did not increase the repression of the reporter gene, indicating no additive or synergistic effects between the tested miRNAs...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the opioid peptides on the mechanism of regulation of the kidneys functions and water-salt exchange of the rats of three age groups on {{the background of the}} 5 %-water load was being studied. The physico-chemical indicators of blood, tissue water-salt depout, kidneys functions, the concentrations of ADG and aldosteron after the injection of the synthetic analog of Leu-enkephalint (SAE). For the first time it has been shown, that Leu-enkephaline inserts the modulating action on support of the hydroion balance of the rats with the disturbing effects. In the juvenile age, the high reactivity of hydro- and ionouretic function of kidneys in response to the water load has been revealed. The action of SAE is mediated through the tissue opiate receptors, and by activation GGNS (in particular, by increasing secretion of ADG and aldosteron). The results of the work can be used for the correction of possible deviations with the disturbance of the <b>water-salt</b> <b>balance,</b> give the representation about the formation of the enkephaline system in the mammals' ontogenesis.

40|$|The urine protein {{composition}} {{samples of}} ten Russian cosmonauts (male, aged of 35 up to 51) performed long flight missions and varied from 169 up to 199 {{days on the}} International Space Station (ISS) were analyzed. As a control group, urine samples of six back-up cosmonauts were analyzed. We used proteomic techniques to obtain data and contemporary bioinformatics approaches to perform the analysis. From {{the total number of}} identified proteins (238) in our data set, 129 were associated with a known tissue origin. Preflight samples contained 92 tissue-specific proteins, samples obtained on Day 1 after landing had 90 such proteins, while Day 7 samples offered 95 tissue-specific proteins. Analysis showed that consistently present proteins in urine (under physiological conditions and after space flight) are cubilin, epidermal growth factor, kallikrein- 1, kininogen- 1, megalin, osteopontin, vitamin K-dependent protein Z, uromodulin. Variably present proteins consists of: Na(+) /K(+) ATPase subunit gamma, β-defensin- 1, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, maltasa-glucoamilasa, cadherin-like protein, neutral endopeptidase and vascular cell adhesion protein 1. And only three renal proteins were related to the space flight factors. They were not found in the pre-flight samples and in the back-up cosmonaut urine, but were found in the urine samples after space flight: AFAM (afamin), AMPE (aminopeptidase A) and AQP 2 (aquaporin- 2). This data related with physiological readaptation of <b>water-salt</b> <b>balance.</b> The proteomic analysis of urine samples in different phases of space missions with bioinformation approach to protein identification provides new data relative to biomechemical mechanism of kidney functioning after space flight...|$|E
40|$|Migratory {{shorebirds}} inhabit {{environments that}} may yield contrasting salinity-temperature regimes-with widely varying osmoregulatory demands, even {{within a given}} species-and the question is: by which physiological means and at which organisational level do they show adjustments with respect to these demands? Red knots Calidris canutus winter in coastal areas over a range of latitudes. The nominal subspecies winters in salty areas in the tropics, whereas the subspecies Calidris canutus islandica winters in north-temperate regions of comparatively lower salinities and temperatures. In this study, both subspecies of red knot were acclimated to different salinity (28 / 40 ‰) -temperature (5 / 35 °C) combinations for 2 -week periods. We then measured food/salt intakes, basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass and temperature, fat and salt gland scores, gizzard mass, heat-shock proteins, heterophils/lymphocytes (H/L) ratio and plasma Na(+) to assess the responses of each taxon to osmoregulatory challenges. High salinity (HS) -warm-acclimated birds reduced food/salt intake, BMR, body mass, fat score and gizzard mass, showing that salt/heat loads constrained energy acquisition rates. Higher salt gland scores in saltier treatments indicated that its size was adjusted to higher osmoregulatory demands. Elevated plasma Na(+) and H/L ratio in high-salinity-warm-acclimated birds indicated that salt/heat loads might have a direct effect on the <b>water-salt</b> <b>balance</b> and stress responses of red knots. Subspecies {{had little or no}} effect on most measured parameters, suggesting that most adjustments reflect phenotypic flexibility rather than subspecific adaptations. Our results demonstrate how salinity and temperature affect various phenotypic traits in a migrant shorebird, highlighting the importance of considering these factors jointly when evaluating the environmental tolerances of air-breathing marine taxa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{hydrological}} research {{in regard to}} the water resources crisis in the vulnerable areas found {{in the northern part of}} China. This area includes three main river basins, namely the basins of the Yellow (Huang) River, the Hai River and the Huai River. Several water problems are becoming very severe. Among them, two are the most critical: the Yellow River has been drained dry in the main course of its lower reaches and along its major tributaries, and the groundwater table has rapidly declined in the floodplains of the three rivers' downstream areas. To counter the problems, particularly the critical issues mentioned above, hydrological research, which serves as the basis of water development and management, has been carried out in the last two decades. This paper addresses three basic scientific problems in North China, namely: (a) water consumption and the capacity for saving water; (b) the changes in hydrological processes and water resources caused by natural change and human activities; and (c) the ability to supply water resources and water safety in terms of both quantity and quality within a changing environment. However, opportunities and challenges for ameliorating the problems exist, and new ideas and methodology to solve the problems have been proposed, such as the interface process study on the interactions in the soil-root interface, the plant-atmosphere interface, the soil-atmosphere interface, and the interface of soil water and groundwater. In order to manage water resources in a sustainable manner, the study of water resources' renewal ability as affected by natural change and human activity is addressed from the viewpoint of both water quantity and quality, and their integration. To reduce the vulnerability of water resources in regional water management, a paradigm of sustainable water resources utilization is also proposed, using water-heat balance, <b>water-salt</b> <b>balance,</b> water-sediment balance, and water supply-demand balance. This approach may help reveal the basic problems and point to possible approaches to solving the water problems in North China in the 21 st century. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Son...|$|E
