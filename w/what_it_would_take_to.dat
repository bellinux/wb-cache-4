25|$|When Charles W. Nash, {{founder of}} Nash Motors {{began looking for}} his successor, he turned to Mason upon the {{recommendation}} of Walter Chrysler. Mason initially rebuffed Nash’s offer, however when Nash asked <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> bring Mason over to Nash, Mason stated {{that he would not}} take the position if Kelvinator {{was not included in the}} deal. Nash saw merit in this idea; General Motors owned Frigidaire, Borg-Warner owned Norge Appliance, and Chrysler operated its own air conditioning division, Airtemp. Nash and Mason came to terms and the deal announced in November 1936. The two firms merged to form Nash-Kelvinator Corporation with Mason as its CEO. By 1940, Mason continued to grow Kelvinator’s market share and returned Nash to profitable status.|$|E

500|$|Similarly to the club's {{successful}} campaign {{the season}} before, but in complete {{contrast to his}} first tenure at the club, the 2010–11 season saw five players joining the club, while roughly five players left the club in the close season. The club started the season inconsistently, with Westley stating the season would be a [...] "massive learning curve" [...] for both himself and the players. Following four defeats in six games in December 2010 and January 2011, Stevenage found themselves in 18th position, just four points above the relegation zone. However, during a congested period throughout February and March 2011, Stevenage won nine games out of eleven, propelling the club up the league table and into the play-off positions. This included winning six games on the trot, a sequence only matched by Bury. A 3–3 draw against Bury {{on the final day}} of the season meant that Stevenage finished the season in sixth place. They faced fifth place Accrington Stanley in the 2010–11 League Two play-off semi-finals, winning both legs by a 3–0 aggregate scoreline. They beat Torquay United 1–0 in the Final at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011. The victory meant that Westley had guided the club to back-to-back promotions, playing in League One for the first time in the club's history. On securing promotion, Westley said [...] "It's a fantastic feeling. The players work so hard and they deserve everything they get". During the 2010–11 season, Westley also guided the club to the Fourth Round of the FA Cup, where they lost to Reading 2–1. In the previous round, Stevenage beat Premier League side Newcastle United 3–1 at Broadhall Way. After the match, Westley said before the game he had told the players to [...] "go out and win the match 5–0. We established that if we did just 20% of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> win 5–0 then we would still win the game".|$|E

The War Office and the War Cabinet questioned Marshall's judgement and asked Dunsterville directly, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> control the Caspian Sea and destroy the oilfields. Dunsterville urged a forward policy but not the sabotage of the oil as this was inimical to the interests of the populations he was trying to recruit against the Ottomans. Marshall then offered the 39th Infantry Brigade of the 13th (Western) Division and artillery, provided that it could be supplied locally. (The brigade was detached on 1 July and set off in stages from [...] the Brigade HQ arriving five days later.) Along with training and leadership, Dunsterforce was to occupy the Baku oil fields, to deny oil and the local cotton crop to the Germans and Ottomans. Dunsterforce was to operate against the Ottomans in the west and hold a line from Batum to Tiflis, Baku and Krasnovodsk (on {{the opposite side of the}} Caspian Sea) to Afghanistan.|$|E

40|$|In his contribution, Mark Alfano {{lays out}} a new (to virtue theory) naturalistic way of {{determining}} what the virtues are, <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> {{for them to be}} realized, and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> for them to be at least possible. This method is derived in large part from David Lewis’s development of Frank Ramsey’s method of implicit definition. The basic idea is to define a set of terms not individually but in tandem. This is accomplished by assembling all and only the common sense platitudes that involve them (e. g., typically, people want to be virtuous), conjoining those platitudes, and replacing the terms in question by existentially quantified variables. If the resulting sentence is satisfied, then whatever satisfies are the virtues. If it isn’t satisfied, {{there are a couple of}} options. First, one could just admit defeat by saying that people can’t be virtuous. More plausibly, one could weaken the conjunction by dropping a small number of the platitudes from it (and potentially adding some others). Alfano suggests that the most attractive way to do this is by dropping the platitudes that deal with cross-situational consistency and replacing them with platitudes that involve social construction: basically, people are virtuous (when they are) at least in part because other people signal their expectations of virtuous conduct, which induces virtuous conduct, which in turn induces further signals of expected virtuous conduct, and so on...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks how}} {{effective}} are co-operatives at surviving economic recession, {{and whether they}} can grow {{at the expense of}} investor-owned businesses and provide an alternative business model that is fairer, more stable and less risky. The paper begins by providing historical evidence concerning the resilience of co-operatives during economic crises. Then, taking a ‘member-owned business' approach, it analyses the comparative advantages and disadvantages of co-ops along three dimensions: ownership, control and benefit. It broadens this out to consider advantages to the wider society, and theorises comparative advantages of other business types. It concludes by asking <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> for the co-operative potential to be realized...|$|R
