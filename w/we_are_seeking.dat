25|$|The common {{heritage}} of humanity principle in international law has been viewed as one solution to {{the tragedy of the}} commons dilemma described in an influential article by that name written by Garrett Hardin in the journal Science in 1968. The article critically analyzes a dilemma in which multiple individuals, acting independently after rationally consulting self-interest, ultimately destroy a shared limited resource even when each acknowledges that outcome is not in anyone's long-term interest. Hardin's conclusion that commons areas are practicably achievable only in conditions of low population density and so their continuance requires state restriction on the freedom to breed, created controversy particularly through his deprecation of the role of conscience in achieving justice and equality in society. Hardin's views have been noted by scholars and policy-makers supporting privatization of common spaces and suggesting economic rationalism on such social and ecosystems. Though there are many that point out that as what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> is a social contract, privatisation would actually annihilate any possibility of rational use - the land would simply be in enclosure. Hardin's views are based on malthusian ideas of competition and over population, we have now accepted that it is the nature of man's consumption (not his numbers) that is causing the destruction of the environment. Hardin, like many who criticise principles of commonality, have to rely on long debunked 18th century ideas to make their point.|$|E

2500|$|All {{statistical}} work presents {{opportunities for}} error, but it's possible to reduce error to manageable amounts. A statement reads: [...] "An important aim of our ongoing {{work is to}} understand, manage, control and report on all known sources of error... which simply reflect the inherent variability that exists among the units <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> to measure... This variability manifests itself in sampling error when we use samples for cost-effectiveness reasons to estimate characteristics about a population. Sampling errors are relatively easy to measure.... Other sources reflect process, measurement and inference errors, and {{are referred to as}} non-sampling error. It is not possible to eliminate all sources of error. However, our continued efforts at understanding and managing variability and error ensure we are exercising a high level of control on all known sources of error." ...|$|E
2500|$|Archipenko's Woman with a Fan (1914) {{combines}} high-relief sculpture with painted colors (polychrome) {{to create}} striking illusions of volumetric space. Experimenting with the dynamic interplay of convex and concave surfaces, Archipenko created {{works such as}} Woman Combing her Hair (1915). Depending on the movement around the sculpture and effects of lighting, concave and convex surfaces appear alternately to protrude or recede. His use of sculptural voids {{was inspired by the}} philosopher Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution (1907) on the distortions of our understanding of reality, and how our intellect tends to define unanticipated circumstances positively or negatively. 'If the present reality is not one <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking,</b> we speak of an absence of this sought reality wherever we find the presence of another'. [...] "Archipenko's sculptural voids", write Antliff and Leighten, [...] "allows us to fill this illusory gap with our own durational consciousness".|$|E

2500|$|This thesis targets {{a problem}} with the nature of inquiry {{originally}} postulated by Plato in Meno. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible. In other words, [...] "If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack the knowledge, we don't know what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems." [...] The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this paradox. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either consciously or unconsciously, a rationalist claims we don't really [...] "learn" [...] things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply bring to light what we already know.|$|E

In December 2009, Fianna Fáil secured its first Northern Assembly MLA when Gerry McHugh, an independent MLA, announced he had joined the party. Mr. McHugh confirmed that although he had joined the party, he would continue to sit as an independent MLA. In June 2010, Fianna Fáil opened its first official office in the North in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The then Taoiseach Brian Cowen officially opened the office, accompanied by Ministers Éamon Ó Cuív and Dermot Ahern and Deputies Rory O’Hanlon and Margaret Conlon. Discussing the party's slow development towards all-Ireland politics, Mr. Cowen observed: [...] "We have a very open and pragmatic approach. [...] We are a constitutional republican party and we make no secret of the aspirations on which this party was founded. [...] It has always been very clear in our mind what it is <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeking</b> to achieve, that is to reconcile this country and not being prisoners of our past history. [...] To be part of a generation that will build a new Ireland, an Ireland of which we can all be proud".|$|E
