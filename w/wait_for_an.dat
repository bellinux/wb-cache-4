5|$|The killings {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Allied landing in the Balkans.|$|E

As they <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opening, Trina buys a lottery ticket. McTeague becomes enamored with Trina and begs Schouler {{for permission to}} court Trina. After seeing McTeague's conviction, Schouler agrees. Trina eventually agrees to marry McTeague and shortly afterwards her lottery ticket wins her $5,000. Schouler bitterly claims that the money should have been his, causing a rift between McTeague and Schouler. After McTeague and Trina wed, they {{continue to live in}} their small apartment with Trina refusing to spend her $5,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{position of the}} Low Countries, located between France and Germany on the uncovered flanks of their fortification lines, made the area a logical route for an offensive by either side. In a 20 January 1940 radio speech, Winston Churchill tried to convince them not to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inevitable German attack, but to join the Anglo-French Entente. Both the Belgians and Dutch refused, even though the German attack plans had fallen into Belgian hands after a German aircraft crash in January 1940, in {{what became known as}} the Mechelen Incident.|$|E

5|$|Response unit – Also {{known as}} a fly-car or a , which is a vehicle {{which is used to}} reach an acutely ill patient quickly, and provide on scene care, but lacks the {{capacity}} to transport the patient from the scene. Response units may be backed up by an emergency ambulance which can transport the patient, or may deal with the problem on scene, with no requirement for a transport ambulance. These can be a wide variety of vehicles, from standard cars, to modified vans, motorcycles, pedal cycles, quad bikes or horses. These units can function as a vehicle for officers or supervisors (similar to a fire chief's vehicle, but for ambulance services). Fire & Rescue services in North America often staff EMTs or Paramedics to their apparatuses to provide medical care without the need to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ambulance.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from the}} dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E
25|$|Each auditioner {{will take}} turn to sing one song {{for as long}} as they want. If the {{representative}} is not sure about the competitor's performance, they may ask them to sing another song. After all five auditioners have sung, the representatives may make comments, and announces auditioners that will not go through to the second round. The successful auditioners will be given a Yellow Ticket, and will return to the waiting room to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audition crew to lead them to a separate waiting room where they wait for the second round of audition.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the basic configuration of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first {{is the level of}} the tracks. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a level crossing, the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in urban areas, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extended period of time.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{achievements}} of the Duke's premiership was {{the arrangement of the}} King's marriage. The King had been betrothed to Mariana Victoria, the infanta of Spain, daughter of the Spanish king, in 1721, when she was just three years old, and the French king only eleven. By 1724, the king was fourteen but the infanta was still a decade away from child-bearing age. Some felt that this was too long for France to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> heir. This was especially so because, if Louis XV died without an heir, it was feared that, armed with a hereditary right he had renounced when he became king of Spain, Philip V de Bourbon would ignore the Treaty of Utrecht and claim the French throne, thus plunging France and Spain into conflict with the other European powers.|$|E
25|$|Boa constrictors are ambush predators, {{so often}} lie in <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{appropriate}} prey to come along, when they attack. However, {{they have also}} been known to actively hunt, particularly in regions with a low concentration of suitable prey, and this behaviour generally occurs at night. The boa first strikes at the prey, grabbing it with its teeth; it then proceeds to constrict the prey until death before consuming it whole. Unconsciousness and death likely result from shutting off vital {{blood flow to the}} heart and brain, rather than suffocation as was previously believed; constriction can interfere with blood flow and overwhelm the prey's usual blood pressure and circulation. This would lead to unconsciousness and death very quickly. Their teeth also help force the animal down the throat while muscles then move it toward the stomach. It takes the snake about 4–6 days to fully digest the food, {{depending on the size of}} the prey and the local temperature. After this, the snake may not eat for a week to several months, due to its slow metabolism.|$|E

500|$|General Samuel Jones, {{commander}} of the Confederate Armies in southwest Virginia, was informed of the Union Army's movements beginning midday July 18. [...] Jones' headquarters was at the Dublin railroad depot—east of Wytheville along the Virginia & Tennessee Railroad. Jones intercepted a passenger train on the railroad line around 3:00pm, and the train was used to haul soldiers and equipment to Wytheville. He sent two small newly organized companies, employees from his headquarters, and some local citizens who volunteered to help. This group totaled to about 130, and was led by Major Thomas M. Bowyer. Bowyer's men were well armed, and brought two pieces of artillery plus additional small weapons for the locals. The train carrying Bowyer and his men was delayed because it had to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> eastbound train to pass.|$|E

Unable to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: [...] "None of [...] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is {{so far away from}} the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive.

500|$|Virgin {{had claimed}} that they were {{prepared}} to take losses on Little Red, estimated to be up to £3 million a week, in order to <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> expansion in brand awareness. [...] Virgin then stated that losses on Little Red would be covered by Virgin Atlantic's transatlantic routes. Despite this, {{as a result of the}} low passenger numbers in October 2014, it was announced that Little Red would cease to operate from September 2015. This was attributed to BA's dominance of the UK domestic market and Heathrow's restrictions of the usage of the small number of slots available. The slot limitation issue had been mentioned at Little Red's foundation in that the slots to Scottish airports could only be used to fly to Edinburgh and Aberdeen. It was also claimed in the media that passengers preferred to use low-cost carriers such as EasyJet to fly to and from other London airports aside of Heathrow for domestic travel owing to pricing.|$|E
