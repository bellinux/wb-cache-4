40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} methanogen diversity in animal hosts to develop a swine-specific archaeal molecular marker for fecal source tracking in surface waters. Phylogenetic analysis of swine mcrA sequences compared to mcrA sequences from the feces of five animals (cow, deer, sheep, horse, and chicken) and sewage showed four distinct swine clusters, with three swine-specific clades. From this analysis, six sequences were chosen for molecular marker development and initial testing. Only one mcrA sequence (P 23 - 2) showed specificity for swine and therefore was used for environmental testing. PCR primers for the P 23 - 2 clone mcrA sequence were developed and evaluated for swine specificity. The P 23 - 2 primers amplified products in P 23 - 2 plasmid DNA (100 %), pig feces (84 %), and swine <b>waste</b> <b>lagoon</b> surface water samples (100 %) but did not amplify a product in 47 bacterial and archaeal stock cultures and 477 environmental bacterial isolates and sewage and water samples from a bovine <b>waste</b> <b>lagoon</b> and a polluted creek.

Sequencing of PCR products from pig feces demonstrated 100 % similarity to pig mcrA sequence from clone P 23 - 2.

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 <b>Waste</b> water <b>lagoons</b> {{have been}} used as a {{satisfactory}} means of treating domestic and certain industrial wastes {{in many parts of the}} country. Many of the parameters that govern the applicability of this type of treatment process are climatic in nature, and critical evaluation of local climatic conditions, as well as biological and physical conditions, is essential to determine their effects upon the successful operation of <b>waste</b> water <b>lagoons.</b> The objects of this thesis are to review and evaluate the research, design and operational data of <b>waste</b> water <b>lagoons</b> in this State and in other locations, for the purpose of determining, if possible, better design criteria for <b>waste</b> water <b>lagoons</b> in Oregon. More specifically, the <b>waste</b> water <b>lagoon</b> process and the various parameters that affect the process were studied. Data pertaining to the climatic conditions prevalent to this State were compiled and evaluated. Research and operational studies conducted here at Oregon State University and other installations were reviewed to determine the limitations of climatic, biological and physical factors that affect the <b>waste</b> water <b>lagoon</b> process. Results of this study reveal that climatic conditions prevalent in the State of Oregon do not preclude the use of <b>waste</b> water <b>lagoons</b> in this State, and that the present design criteria of 20 pounds of 5 -day, 20 ° Centigrade, Biochemical Oxygen Demand per surface acre per day is workable and contains a factor of safety.

The current study is the 4 th phase (after 1989, 2001 and 2004) of checking and controlling the chromium concentration in this territory. The chromium content was assessed after soil and plant mineralization using FAAS method. Total chromium concentrations in soil samples reached values of 2. 25 - 18. 25 mg · kg - 1 dry mass. Levels of chromium in water samples ranged between 0. 008 and 0. 017 mg · dm - 3 for Wieprz River and the trough, situated in the tannery centre, respectively.
