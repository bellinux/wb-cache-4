500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that}} {{although}} [...] "30 Rock gave us yet another riff on what a wild and crazy guy Tracy Jordan is", the series was really finding its footing. Mitovich enjoyed the appearances of Dratch and Parnell, labeling the latter as {{the highlight of the}} episode. Robert Canning of IGN said that the episode [...] "failed to deliver the comic gold <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> for." [...] Canning had hoped that Tracy's storyline would be a [...] "subtle, fairly straightforward plot", in contrast to the wackiness the series had a reputation for, but found it unfunny. The reviewer did not enjoy the appearances of Dratch and Winters, and felt Conan O'Brien was not used to his full potential. Canning rated the episode 5 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Despite waning {{popularity}} at home, Wałęsa's international reputation remained untouched. He {{continued his}} lecture circuit around the world, occasionally appearing in [...] headlines. In 2014 in a widely publicized interview, Wałęsa expressed his disappointment in another Nobel laureate, US president Barack Obama: he told CNN, [...] "When {{he was elected}} there was great hope in the world. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> that Obama would reclaim moral leadership for America, but that failed... in terms of politics and morality America no longer leads the world". Wałęsa also accused Obama of not deserving his Nobel Peace Prize; during the 2012 US presidential campaign he endorsed Obama's opponent Mitt Romney. In September 2015, Wałęsa again hit the headlines after sharing his thoughts on the migrant crisis in Europe with media, saying, [...] "watching the refugees on television, I noticed that...they are well fed, well dressed and maybe even are richer than we are...If Europe opens its gates, soon millions will come through and while living among us will start exercising their own customs, including beheading".|$|E

500|$|By late February 1942, the Soviet winter counter-offensive, {{had pushed}} German forces from Moscow {{on a broad}} front and then ended in mutual exhaustion. Stalin was {{convinced}} that the Germans were finished and would collapse by the spring or summer 1942, as he said in his speech of 7 November 1941. Stalin decided to exploit this perceived weakness on the Eastern Front by launching a new offensive in the spring. Stalin's decision faced objections from his advisors, including the Chief of the Red Army General Staff, General Boris Shaposhnikov, and generals Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Georgy Zhukov, who argued for a more defensive strategy. Vasilevsky wrote [...] "Yes, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> for , but the reality was more harsh than that". According to Zhukov, Stalin believed that the Germans were able to carry out operations simultaneously along two strategic axes, he was sure that the opening of spring offensives along the entire front would destabilize the German Army, before it had a chance to initiate what could be a mortal offensive blow on Moscow. Despite the caution urged by his generals, Stalin decided to try to keep the German forces off-balance through [...] "local offensives".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the video's release, several critics took notice of the {{similarities}} in Eminem's attire and Carey's stalker. Nick Levine from Digital Spy wrote: [...] "It isn't quite as ridiculous as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>hoping,</b> and Mariah's insisting the male stalker she plays isn't meant to be a 'specific person', but there's still plenty to enjoy in the 'Obsessed' video. There is a lot of MC cleavage, a not entirely convincing fake beard and a neat Mean Girls reference towards the end." [...] Newsdays Corris Little described it as [...] "genius!" [...] and continued, [...] "Move over Eminem, I'm officially obsessed with Mariah Carey. Who isn't? She can sing, she's pretty and she has really fun music videos." [...] A writer from the Evening Standard called the video [...] "shocking", and felt that Carey's disguise was so convincing, she should assume the role more often if she wants to travel incognito. The New York Posts Jarett Wieselman described it as [...] "human butterfly embrac her macho side", and concluded his review with [...] "I'm guessing the video involves Mariah's butch bellhop becoming a little infatuated with the singer, or something. Basically it's another way to give her double the screentime – much like that Mariah-on-Mariah fight in 'Heartbreaker'!" [...] New York Daily News writer Chris Baud joked about Eminem going one step further, writing: [...] "It's great that Mariah seems to be having fun with this whole 'Miminem' thing, but we're afraid of the conflict going any further, because no one wants to see the next step: Eminem in drag." [...] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly complimented Carey for [...] "going after" [...] Eminem, and concluded [...] "I like Mariah with a sense of humor, and I love the idea of her turning the tables on the king of celebrity-mocking videos." ...|$|E

[...] Daniella Graham from Metro.co.uk emphasized the hot pants Minogue wore in the video, and an iconic clothing piece in her career from her single [...] "Spinning Around"; Graham titled their article [...] "Kylie Minogue brings back the hotpants in new Timebomb video".

Timothy Randall, one of the 6 winners, was named the winner of the 2nd internship for Infinite Interactive in this phase.

They said it might have come into the astrologer's hands in some such way, but into Father Peter's, never! Our characters began to suffer now. We were Father Peter's only witnesses; how much did he probably pay us to back up his fantastic tale? People talked that kind of talk to us pretty freely and frankly, and were full of scoffings when we begged them to believe really we had told only the truth. Our parents were harder on us than any one else. Our fathers said we were disgracing our families, and they commanded us to purge ourselves of our lie, and there was no limit to their anger when we continued to say we had spoken true. Our mothers cried over us and begged us to give back our bribe and get back our honest names and save our families from shame, and come out and honorably confess.
