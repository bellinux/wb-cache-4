40|$|People <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> face many {{constraints}} {{that affect their}} participation in leisure and sports, which {{can be seen in}} the gaps in the scientific literature. This study aims to document the specific issues in the leisure and sports participation of people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> rural areas. Qualitative research has documented the rurality-related items. Overall, stakeholders (n = 35) working <b>with</b> people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> rural areas were met in focus groups (n = 4). Strengths and difficulties have emerged from these testimonials. Being near the community facilitates awareness towards people <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> However, one of the difficulties refers to the limited number of people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> the communities which obstructs the deployment of the leisure and sport offer. The second difficulty is the small number of volunteers and the problem of succession. Finally, availability and dilapidated infrastructure affects the participation in sports and recreation by people <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> rural areas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{twenty million}} persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> India are {{increasingly}} being offered poverty alleviation strategies, including employment programs. This study employs a spatial analytic approach to identify correlates of employment among persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> India, considering sight, speech, hearing, movement, and mental disabilities. Methods Based on 2001 Census data, this study utilizes linear regression and spatial autoregressive models to identify factors associated with the proportion employed among persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> at the district level. Models stratified by rural and urban areas were also considered. Results Spatial autoregressive models revealed that different factors contribute to employment of persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> rural and urban areas. In rural areas, having mental disability decreased the likelihood of employment, while being female and having movement, or sight impairment (compared to other disabilities) increased the likelihood of employment. In urban areas, being female and illiterate decreased the likelihood of employment but having sight, mental and movement impairment (compared to other disabilities) increased the likelihood of employment. Conclusions Poverty alleviation programs designed for persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> India should account for differences <b>in</b> employment by <b>disability</b> types and should be spatially targeted. Since persons <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> <b>in</b> rural and urban areas have different factors contributing to their employment, {{it is vital that}} government and service-planning organizations account for these differences when creating programs aimed at livelihood development...|$|R
