5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of Egyptian vulture, white stork, black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
25|$|The avian {{species in}} the park are 122, of which at least 97 are nesting. Important birds of prey with high {{conservation}} value include the griffon vulture, cinereous vulture, eastern imperial eagle and booted eagle. The park {{is one of the}} two nesting localities in the country of the lanner falcon and the common rosefinch. Rila Monastery Nature Park is an important sanctuary of the hazel grouse, rock partridge, western capercaillie, Eurasian pygmy owl, boreal owl, black woodpecker, <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> red-breasted flycatcher, wallcreeper, Alpine accentor and Alpine chough. Most of the listed species have at least 5% of their total national population in the territory of the park.|$|E
50|$|The Bryansk {{forest is}} the only place in Europe where there are all ten of the European woodpeckers: great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted, lesser spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> Syrian, <b>white-backed,</b> black <b>woodpecker,</b> grey, green, three-toed and Wryneck.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{woodpeckers}} (the wryneck, black grey-headed, green, greater, lesser-spotted, <b>white-backed,</b> three-toed <b>woodpeckers).</b> The {{purpose of the}} work: the revealation of the specificity of ecology, demography, and interspecies relations of the woodpeckers. For the first time, the demographic parameters of the woodpeckers populations of the Russia European centre have been studied. It has been proved, that the large species variety of the woodpeckers became possible under the conditions of sympatry due to the differentiation {{of the terms of}} multiplication, the differences in the level of number, the biotopic and trophic segregation. The information by the important ecologo-population characteristics of 8 species of the woodpeckers have been given.

25|$|The {{vertebrate}} fauna of Pirin {{consists of}} 229 species. The mammal species are 45 and include brown bear, gray wolf, wildcat, European pine marten, wild boar, red deer, roe deer and chamois. The {{total number of}} bird species is 159, including three relicts— boreal owl, <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker, {{and a number of}} birds of pray, such as lesser spotted eagle, booted eagle, golden eagle, short-toed snake eagle, saker falcon, peregrine falcon, etc. There are 11 reptile, 8 amphibian and 6 fish species.

25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the European green woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E
50|$|The Amami {{woodpecker}} (Dendrocopos owstoni) is {{a bird in}} {{the family}} Picidae found only on Amami Ōshima in the Ryukyu Islands south of Japan.

50|$|The park {{contains}} one of {{the most}} biologically diverse areas of Europe. The climate is between that of the Mediterranean and that of the rest of continental Europe. The park contains more than two thousand plant species, some of which are found exclusively in this area, such as the Abruzzo Edelweiss. Many species of wildlife inhabit the park, including rare animals such as the Abruzzo chamois, as well as wolves, Marsican brown bear, roe deer, wildcats, wild boars, foxes and squirrels. Notable birds include the golden eagle, the <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> the goshawk, the common buzzard and the peregrine falcon. There are also a wide variety of insects, such as the apollo butterfly.|$|E
50|$|When {{hidden by}} the foliage, the Syrian woodpecker’s {{presence}} is often advertised by the mechanical drumming, a vibrating rattle, produced by the rapidly repeated blows of its strong bill upon a trunk or branch. This {{is not merely a}} mating call or challenge, but a signal of either sex. It is audible from a great distance, depending on the wind and the condition of the wood, and a hollow bough naturally produces a louder note than living wood. The drumming is longer than great spotted woodpecker’s, and decreases in volume. It is faster and shorter than the drumming of <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The call is a sharp quit, quit, softer than great spotted woodpecker, and something like common redshank.|$|E
50|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> enlarged as it extended eastwards.

50|$|Many {{birds of}} prey inhabit the park. Most notable amongst them is the golden eagle, {{represented}} by six breeding couples, which, despite living in the more inaccessible regions, can often be seen soaring over central areas of the park in search of prey such as small mammals or even sick, young chamois. Other raptors that reside within the park include goshawks, peregrine falcons, Eurasian buzzards, kestrels and Eurasian sparrowhawks. Less visible, but perhaps more audible, to the nighttime visitor are several species of owl, the little owl, the barn owl and the tawny owl.Woodland birds include the European green woodpecker and the rare <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> cliffs harbour the red-billed chough and alpine chough and bare mountain birds include the rock partridge and white-winged snowfinch. streams provide habitat for the grey wagtail and white-throated dipper.|$|E
50|$|The high {{mountains}} {{of the park}} are too barren for many creatures to thrive, but there the ptarmigans thrive. Golden eagles nest in several valleys that reach up towards the glacier and they feed on the ptarmigans in the glacial areas. Meadow pipits are the most abundant species above the tree line. In the wooded areas below the tree line, red deer are abundant, in fact more red deer are shot in Kvinnherad municipality {{than anywhere else in}} the country. Black grouse and capercaillie can also be found in the pine forests. This is also one of the last places to find the <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker</b> in all of Western Europe. Avalanches in this area leave many dead trees in their paths and this is exactly the habitat favoured by these woodpeckers.|$|E
50|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls.

50|$|Habitats of {{the park}} range from maquis on the lower slopes, through {{deciduous}} woodland and beech and fir forest to alpine meadows at the highest levels. It is a refuge for mountain birds, such as lammergeier and other vultures, golden eagle and more than 20 other raptor species. Other high-altitude species include alpine accentor, rock thrushes and choughs. The area is also good for eastern specialities such as isabelline wheatear, and, at almost the most westerly points of their range, red-fronted serin and Krüper's nuthatch. The dense fir forest holds short-toed treecreeper, common crossbill and Tengmalm's owl, a rare and very local bird in Turkey, {{as well as the}} <b>white-backed</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> The rare and local butterfly, Parnassius apollo graslini, is found on Uludag and the area has much of interest to botanists, with colourful pink primroses (Primula vulgaris var. sibthorpii), leopard's bane (Doronicum orientale), crocuses: the purple Crocus siberi and yellow Crocus flavus, and grape hyacinths (Muscari racemosum). There are also few wolf packs roaming on the mountain.|$|E
