25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|Gillan {{was largely}} {{dissatisfied}} with his brief stint in Sabbath, notably the final mix of Born Again (though {{he liked the}} songs and their original mixes), and its cover, which featured a demonic-looking baby. He was quoted in Kerrang! in 1984 as saying, [...] "I looked at the cover and puked." [...] In an interview supporting Deep Purple's reformation in 1984, he stated of Born Again, [...] "They had sent me a box of records. And, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> cover, and heard the mix, I smashed {{every single one of}} them to pieces." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and I kind of built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|In court, Martin {{argued that}} he was by nature not a violent person. [...] "I may have worked in the (prison) butchery, but cutting up a human body is another thing. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{photographs}} (of Lowe's body parts), {{it made me feel}} sick." [...] He maintained that he had killed Lowe after the latter made homosexual advances that caused him to [...] "freak out"; he had previously fended off homosexual attacks twice while imprisoned: in Israel in 1978, and in England in 1994. When Deputy Public Prosecutors Jennifer Marie and Norul Rashid asked him what he did after killing Lowe, he said that he could not remember anything because he had drunk heavily and consumed Valium after Lowe's death until he was arrested. He repeated that he had not killed the Damudes, and that he had come back to Singapore from Phuket to clear his conscience about Lowe's death.|$|E
500|$|Kajol as Anjali Sharma, Rahul's love-interest and later, wife. She is a fun-loving woman {{living in}} the Chandni Chowk area of Delhi. Belonging to a lower {{socio-economic}} group than the Raichand family, she is not accepted by Yash as his daughter-in-law. Karan was initially hesitant to cast Kajol in the film, as he felt that she would refuse the offer due to her recent marriage. Kajol, however, was moved to tears during the script narration and agreed to do the film. In an interview to Filmfare, Kajol said, [...] "One tiny fact that Karan forgot to mention during his narration was just how much Punjabi my character spoke in the film. I nearly died <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> lines of dialogue {{on the first day}} of shooting." [...] However, she learnt the right pronunciation and diction with the help of Yash Johar and the crew members.|$|E

500|$|Ayane {{become a}} popular {{character}} among audience of both genders for various reasons. Model and actress Jaime Bergman chose the [...] "quick and bold" [...] Ayane as a Dead or Alive 2 character she would partner with. While awarding the Annual GameSpy E3 Award to Dead or Alive Ultimate in 2004, Raymond 'Psylancer' Padilla wrote, [...] "Ayane should be my new girlfriend." [...] He later elaborated: [...] "To be honest, I always thought Ayane was an uptight bitch with a massive chip on her shoulder. I always rooted for Kasumi in their feud. Then {{a funny thing happened}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> trailer for Dead or Alive Ultimate during E3 2004 -- I started to care about Ayane. Learning more about her story, her upbringing, and the root of her feud with Kasumi made me change sides." [...] Kotaku's Mike Fahey also described himself as [...] "more of an Ayane sort of guy." [...] In 2005, she was described as his favourite Dead or Alive character by James Mielke from 1UP.com. Featuring Ayane as a [...] "videogame babe of the day" [...] in 2009, IGN's Chris Carle commented: [...] "After that awkward goth stage in high school, not many people continue to rock the violet locks, but Ayane is different… she's hot enough to get away with it." [...] "Kayane", pseudonym of the professional gamer Marie-Laure Norindr comes from a mix of [...] "Kasumi" [...] and [...] "Ayane". Kayane said: [...] "She has a lot of charisma and is pretty. She’s full of anger but has a sweet heart in fact. I think she has the most interesting story and personality in the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Played by Mike Reid, Frank {{had been}} a regular {{character}} in the serial from 1987 to 1994, and had appeared in a recurring role until 1998, when Reid agreed to return full-time. Frank's history on the show included a former marriage to another long-running matriarch, Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). Their history as lovers featured prominently in Peggy's narrative in 1998, when, after agreeing to marry Frank, Peggy was wrongly told that Frank and Pat were having an affair. A special two-hander episode aired in November 1998, featuring only Pat and Peggy for the entire duration. It concentrated on Peggy's reaction to the suspected affair, whilst simultaneously addressing Pat's unresolved history with Frank and the apparent destruction of Pat's own marriage to Roy (Tony Caunter), who had also responded badly to the rumours about his wife's infidelity. The episode, written by Tony Jordan, featured what the Sunday Mirror described as one of [...] "the most vicious fights ever filmed by a soap", with both throwing glasses at one another and Pat slapping Peggy across the face exclaiming [...] "You bitch!" [...] and Peggy responding by slapping Pat exclaiming [...] "You cow!". According to press reports, the fight scene between the characters was [...] "so powerful {{that it had to}} have scenes and dialogue cut so it could be screened before the 9pm watershed." [...] Barbara Windsor was reportedly bruised during the filming. Windsor commented, [...] "The writer didn't want a namby- pamby cat fight between two silly girls. We were throwing chairs and bottles and the adrenaline was at a high. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> programme I couldn't believe how good it was. Pam and I were really proud." [...] The Sunday Mirror described it as: [...] "one of the most impressive episodes of all time". In the climax of the storyline, both couples resolved their differences, and their relationships remained intact.|$|E

When I released Best Of in 2004, our country was fighting the economic crisis, so I wrote lyrics about that situation and made songs for it relationated with crisis. D.

2500|$|Both {{participants}} and {{observers of the}} Cedar Revolution demonstrations have asked if the movement was influenced by recent local and regional events supporting democracy. Lebanese Druze leader Walid Jumblatt remarked to a reporter of the Washington Post, [...] "It's strange {{for me to say}} it, but this process of change has started because of the American invasion of Iraq. I was cynical about Iraq. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi people voting three weeks ago, 8 million of them, it was {{the start of a new}} Arab world".|$|E
2500|$|Kucinich {{was criticized}} during his 2004 {{campaign}} for changing his {{stance on the}} issue of abortion. His explanation was [...] "I've always worked to make abortions less necessary, through sex education and birth control. But the direction that Congress has taken, increasingly, is to make it impossible for women {{to be able to have}} an abortion if they need to protect their health. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> direction taken, it finally came to the point where I understood that women will not be truly free unless they have the right to choose." ...|$|E

2500|$|The main thesis was Mrs. Von Harbou's, but I am {{at least}} 50 percent {{responsible}} because I did it. I {{was not so}} politically minded in those days as I am now.

But I was very interested in machines. Anyway, I didn't like the picture– thought it was silly and stupid– then, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> astronauts: what else are they but part of a machine?

2500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Sweet Guy" [...] was {{directed}} by Claudia Castle, who had earlier directed Kelly's [...] "To Her Door", which won 'Best Video' at the ARIA Music Awards of 1988.

Kelly later wrote that he was disappointed in the video, [...] "this one looked like an ad for coffee or sheets... had worked with us on a couple of videos previously ... that had turned out really well.

[...] The landscape grips my imagination – I try to measure my work against the vast spaces of this country. Conquering the landscape does not rely on scale but simplicity and clarity of form expressing inner strength and tension. If my sculpture is outdoors or in the public domain I like it to arouse people's curiosity to explore the work. Multidimensional objects look different from every angle. The exciting thing about outdoor sculpture is the change with the light, the weather... everything is in constant flux. It becomes almost a living entity.|$|E

[...] Portman was, however, enthusiastic over being cast as the queen of Naboo, a character she expected to become a role model: [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power.
