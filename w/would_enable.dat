5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> it to {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
5|$|Each burial was {{provided}} with equipment that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> a comfortable {{existence in the}} afterlife. Also present in the tombs were items used to perform magic rituals, such as Shabtis and divine figurines. Some equipment was what the king may have used during his lifetime (Tutankhamun's sandals for example), and some was specially constructed for the burial.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force {{to be able to}} traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> him to reach his destination as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> animal species to acquire characteristics {{under the influence}} of the environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{finished}} the 1984–85 Serie A in fifth position, which was {{outside of the}} European qualification positions. In order to participate in European competition in 1985–86, they needed to win the European Cup. Liverpool had finished second behind Everton in the 1984–85 Football League, and thus qualified for the UEFA Cup, but victory in the final <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> them {{to compete in the}} European Cup the following season.|$|E

50|$|Cossa {{had neither}} the divination, which <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> him to {{reconstruct}} the ancient world, nor the imagination which <b>would</b> have <b>enabled</b> him to idealize it. But he was an energetic writer, never tame or languid, {{and at the same}} time able to command the attention of an audience without recourse to melodramatic artifice; while his sonorous verse, if scarcely able to support the ordeal of the closet, is sufficiently near to poetry for the purposes of the stage.|$|R
5|$|MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer {{assigned}} the script to Donald Ogden Stewart—one {{of his favorite}} screenwriters. Mayer's choice seemed unusual, because {{up to that time}} Stewart had written only light romantic comedies featuring wealthy East Coast socialites, but Mayer felt Stewart's strongly leftist political leanings <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> him to chalk out a better screenplay.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{played a}} leading role in {{blocking}} a treaty with Switzerland that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> the IRS to conduct tax evasion probes, arguing that the treaty would infringe upon Americans' privacy. Paul received the 2014 Distinguished Service Award from the Center for the National Interest (formally called the Nixon Center) for his public policy work.|$|E
5|$|A severe depression, the Panic of 1873, {{began in}} the same year as passage of the act, and persisted for much of the decade. Many in the United States came to believe the gold {{standard}} too rigid to deal with economic hard times like those, and sought to restore bimetallism. The inflation caused by such a policy <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> debtors to repay what they owed more easily. The price of silver continued to fall—the silver in a dollar in the new metric-weight subsidiary silver coins was worth only $.75 by mid-1876, though the price recovered some after that.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{permitted}} under the US National Electric Code, it is technically {{possible to have}} a “plug and play” PV microinverter. A recent review article found that careful system design <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> such systems to meet all technical, though not all safety requirements. There are several companies selling plug and play solar systems available on the web, but there is a concern that if people install their own it will reduce the enormous employment advantage solar has over fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E

Control of the upper Hudson <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently captured in the New York campaign by Major General William Howe. This strategy would separate the American colonies of New England from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Commanded by Captain Roderick Dew, {{the ship}} was {{initially}} assigned to the Channel Fleet where she spent three months as temporary flagship before she {{was transferred to the}} Mediterranean in 1868. Lord Clyde made one cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet during which she fractured her steel mainyard in a squall. Her engines continued to deteriorate and they were condemned as no longer safe to use by the fleet engineer when she arrived in Naples. The ship was sent to the Malta Dockyard under sail for repair, but they could only make temporary repairs that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> her to reach home.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the attack}} on his family, Captain Pipe {{said that he would}} not seek vengeance. Instead, in September 1778, {{he was one of the}} signers of the Treaty of Fort Pitt between the Delawares and the United States. Americans hoped this {{agreement}} with the Delawares <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> American soldiers to pass through Delaware territory and attack Detroit, but the alliance deteriorated after the death of White Eyes, the Delaware chief who had negotiated the treaty. Eventually, Captain Pipe turned against the Americans and moved his followers west to the Sandusky River, where he received support from the British in Detroit.|$|E

He also found a girl who looked just like he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper's painting The House by the Railroad, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a trade, or become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, the C {{submitted}} another bill {{to increase}} its capacity by enlarging its tunnels to the larger diameter used for the tunnels of the more recently built railways to allow larger, more modern rolling stock to be used. Together, the works proposed in these bills <b>would</b> <b>enable</b> the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE)'s trains to run over the C's route and vice versa, effectively combining the two separate railways. Tunnel enlargement works only restarted after World War I when an extension of time was granted in February 1919. The Moorgate to Clapham Common section reopened on 1 December 1924, approximately {{eight months after the}} rest of the line.|$|E
