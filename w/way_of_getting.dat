5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the Garden of Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the Garden of Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks of a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> her back in by digging a tunnel {{with the help of}} some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the Garden of Eden.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the mid-1980s, early '90s and 2000s, {{a number}} of black music pirate {{stations}} in London, including Vibes FM, Power Jam FM (now deceased), Lightening FM, Juice FM (now deceased), Roots FM, Sweet FM (now deceased), RJR FM, Millennium Supreme FM, Baseline FM (now deceased), Blues FM, Galaxy FM, Unique FM, Genesis FM, On top FM, SLR (South London Radio) FM, Time FM (now deceased),Kool FM, Conscious FM and Station FM have established a relatively stable presence on the airwaves.

5|$|If {{the player}} follows Gail, they go after an unknown man, but end up losing him. Rick then tells Regina that Tom's dead. If the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death. Rick takes {{him to the}} medical room, however a Velociraptor attacks them, but Tom sacrifices himself to kill it and save Rick. Later, Regina and the team manage to locate Kirk and {{apprehend}} him. As they are preparing to leave via helicopter, the T. rex returns and destroys the helicopter, forcing them to flee back into the base while Kirk manages to escape. Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex in the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> to it. Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when the gun is shot {{out of his hand}} by Gail, and they arrest him again.|$|E

25|$|As The Greaseman, Tracht {{invented a}} clever <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> around limits on indecent {{language}} by using slang terms for body parts and functions that he invented.

25|$|Teachers can, however, accidentally promote {{cheating}} behavior. A {{study found}} {{a correlation between}} how harsh or unfair a professor is perceived as and academic misconduct, since students see cheating as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> back at the teacher. Also, students who see themselves in a competition, such as when the teacher is using a grade curve, {{are more likely to}} cheat.|$|E

25|$|Practice of good {{oral hygiene}} {{including}} daily brushing, flossing {{and the use}} of appropriate mouthwash can significantly reduce the number of oral bacteria, including S. mutans and inhibit their proliferation. S. mutans often live in dental plaque, hence mechanical removal of plaque is an effective <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> rid of them. However, there are some remedies used in the treatment of oral bacterial infection, in conjunction with mechanical cleaning. These include Fluoride, which has a direct inhibitory effect on the enolase enzyme, as well as Chlorhexidine, which works presumably by interfering with bacterial adherence.|$|E

Whilst recovering from this mishap, he developed tetanus and died on 4 December 1864, at his home in Ackworth.
