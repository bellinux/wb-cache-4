50|$|Plotz {{does not}} stop the <b>Warners</b> from {{reaching}} the star {{at the same time}} as all the other townsfolk. However, the King's army has already built a military base around the star, and a small ice palace to the side of it, and the townspeople (including Plotz) are all captured and locked up so that the King may have his wish. The <b>Warners</b> hint that the wishing process is not as simple as the king thinks in a desperate bluff. The King captures the <b>Warners</b> and tortures them in outlandish ways (from a terrible singer, a filthy gas station restroom, and a parody of Barney the Dinosaur). The <b>Warners</b> tell the King any wish he makes could have an ironic twist and demonstrate this to his annoyance. He orders the <b>Warners</b> executed, but Dot uses her charms to save them.
