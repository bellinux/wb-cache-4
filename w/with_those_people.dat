500|$|One of Aden's {{most notable}} storylines {{highlighted}} {{the issue of}} sexual abuse. In the story Aden struggles {{to cope with the}} sexual abuse inflicted on him by his grandfather. Lasance and the serial's writing team worked hard to raise awareness of the [...] "taboo issue". Lasance said he felt he had to do the storyline [...] "one hundred percent justice" [...] because there are people, [...] "more than we probably realise" [...] in real life who have suffered the same as Aden. He felt it was a challenge to play as he did not want victims to think it was unrealistic. Lasance said he had to come onto set each morning in Aden's frame of mind. To research Aden's storyline, he spoke to a relative who had been through a similar situation. He drew inspiration for his portrayal from how his relative had coped and the effects it had on him growing up. Lasance said like his relative, Aden goes though [...] "the huge rebellion years" [...] and the subsequent attempts to [...] "reconnect <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who had betrayed you." [...] Lasance also received extra training from an acting coach, where he used [...] "haunting" [...] techniques to make himself feel vulnerable like Aden. He also used the storyline to show US agents his acting abilities.|$|E
500|$|Wings for My Flight {{was first}} {{published}} in 1991 in hardcover by Addison-Wesley. Houle later wrote a short story titled [...] "Albert" [...] that was adapted from Wings for My Flight, focusing on Albert and Leopold's first attempts at flying. The story was published in the May 1996 issue of the children's magazine Cricket. Wings for My Flight was republished, this time in paperback, in 1999 by Pruett Publishing. This edition included a foreword by Robert Michael Pyle and a new preface and epilogue by Houle. In 2014, the book was updated and republished again by University of New Mexico Press. The updated edition contained photographs of the Chimney Rock landscape, as well as a preface by Houle that addressed the recovery of the peregrine falcon population since the book {{was first published}} in 1991. Houle highlighted the 1972 agricultural prohibition of DDT, which was the chemical primarily responsible for the peregrine decline; the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which allowed the pursuit of wildlife conservation to take precedence over land issues; and successful attempts to raise peregrines in captivity and later release them to the wild. While writing the book, Houle changed the names of various people and places, explaining the choice by saying [...] "I felt more comfortable changing the names because I worked for so long <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>people,</b> it was impossible to be honest about them if I named them".|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I think we did one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? <b>With</b> <b>those</b> <b>people?</b> They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey." [...] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, [...] "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackman went {{to primary}} school at Pymble Public School and later {{attended}} the all-boys Knox Grammar School on Sydney's Upper North Shore, where he starred in its production of My Fair Lady in 1985 {{and became the}} school captain in 1986. Following graduation, he spent a gap year working at Uppingham School in England as a Physical Education teacher. On his return, he studied at the University of Technology, Sydney, graduating in 1991 with a BA in Communications. In his final year of university, he took a drama course to make up additional credits. The class did Václav Havel's The Memorandum with Jackman as the lead. He later commented, [...] "In that week I felt more at home <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> than I did in the entire three years [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Tipping off {{buyers to}} the joke (albeit {{after they had}} {{purchased}} the album), Warner inserted the Rolling Stone review {{as well as a}} San Francisco Chronicle column by critic Ralph J. Gleason, a co-founder of Rolling Stone. [...] Gleason found it incredible anyone believed the review and declared the gag a [...] "delightful bit of instant mythology." [...] The closing track, [...] "Saturday Night at the Cow Palace," [...] also made clear the album was all in fun. The track featured a riotous monologue by a record buyer so indignant at being taken in by the hoax that he vows, [...] "When I get through <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> at Deity Records, I’ll have them walking out of the building in barrels." [...] The album’s liner notes, penned by [...] "T.M. Christian," [...] also offered its share of clues, most notably the line: ...|$|E

2500|$|The 16th {{season of}} The Simpsons has {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from critics, with many noting while the episodes are still good and funny {{they are of}} a lesser quality {{than those of the}} show's earlier seasons. CraveOnline gave the season a rating of 8.0 out of 10, and spoke highly of its [...] "little pieces of continuity", [...] "sharp parody", and [...] "non sequitur gags". Entertainment Focus gave it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding [...] "Some people have criticised The Simpsons claiming that the show is tired and has passed its prime. We don't agree <b>with</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> at all and think The Simpsons has been remarkably consistent in terms of its humour and stories. Sure it may have been eclipsed by the edgier Family Guy in more recent years but The Simpsons is, and always will be, one of the most original and talked-about shows. The Simpsons: Season 16 is another cracking instalment of the hit show and we still, after all these years, just can't get enough. High-Def Digest also gave a 4/5 star rating, saying [...] "As mentioned in the review, there are plenty of laughs to be had in this season, but very few of them come from a place that feels truly genuine and sincere. Sixteen seasons in, it seems that the show is a mixture of been-there-done-that sentiment and perfunctory punch lines. Aside from the so-so image, there's plenty here to keep the die-hard 'Simpsons' fan happy, so this one comes recommended for fans". Cinema Sentries said [...] "This is not something to pick up if you are a general TV fan, or a casual Simpsons fan. The overall quality of the season is not high enough, and you may not get satisfactory enjoyment from them. If you sort of turned your back on the show, this probably isn't the season to check out. However, if you are a Simpsons devotee, then you will want to pick it up". DVDTalk wrote [...] "The Simpsons: Season Sixteen isn't the best of the series' run but it is a very strong collection of truly funny and frequently quite clever doses of animated comedic insanity." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{is perhaps}} unfortunate that mid-career, for both mental and {{physical}} health reasons, Dr Cribb found himself and his broader projects (in Cape York) having to proceed without academic patronage or funding.
