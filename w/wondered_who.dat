2500|$|Despite the film's later reputation, some {{contemporary}} critics panned it. The New York Times critic Mordaunt Hall {{called it}} a [...] "technical marvel with feet of clay". The Times went on the next month to publish a lengthy review by H. G. Wells who accused it of [...] "foolishness, cliché, platitude, and muddlement about mechanical progress and progress in general." [...] He faulted Metropolis for its premise that automation created drudgery rather than relieving it, <b>wondered</b> <b>who</b> was buying the machines' output if not the workers, and found parts of the story derivative of Shelley's Frankenstein, Karel Čapek's robot stories, and his own The Sleeper Awakes. Wells called Metropolis [...] "quite the silliest film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{effect the}} {{opposition}} to the war had was that the American soldiers in Vietnam began to side with the opposition and feel remorse for what they were doing. Zinn argues this with an example in which the soldiers in a POW camp formed a peace committee as they <b>wondered</b> <b>who</b> the enemy of the war was, because it certainly was not known among them. The statement of one of the soldiers reads, [...] "Until we got to the first camp, we didn't see a village intact; they were all destroyed. I sat down and put myself in the middle and asked myself: Is this right or wrong? Is it right to destroy villages? Is it right to kill people en masse? After a while it just got to me." [...] Howard Zinn provides that piece of evidence to reiterate how all of this destruction and fighting against an enemy that seems to be unknown has been taking a toll on the soldiers and that they began to sense a feeling of opposition as one effect of the opposition occurring in the United States.|$|E
