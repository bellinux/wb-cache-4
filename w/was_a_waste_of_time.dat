25|$|When the Daughters of Bilitis or the Mattachine Society had a convention, {{the news}} was reported. The {{magazine}} compiled {{some of the first}} statistics about lesbians in the United States by sending their readership questionnaires, the first in 1957 and again in 1963. There was a marked difference in the tone of the magazine after Barbara Gittings heard Frank Kameny speak at the national DOB convention that attempting to find the cause of homosexuality <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> since it was equal to heterosexuality. Many articles from 1956 to 1963 focused on ways to function in an overwhelmingly homophobic world, but gradually articles began to appear that were unapologetic in promoting lesbianism.|$|E
500|$|However, {{interest}} in metaphysics – the philosophical {{investigation of the}} nature of the universe and existence – had become unfashionable by the time Whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s. [...] The ever-more impressive accomplishments of empirical science had led to a general consensus in academia that the development of comprehensive metaphysical systems <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> because they were not subject to empirical testing.|$|E

Jaws 3-D was the only thing Joe Alves ever directed; the man is a very skilled production designer, but as a director, no.

500|$|Lord Somers, {{following}} his dismissal as Lord Chancellor, introduced an Act in 1706 which [...] "became {{the most important}} act of law reform which the 18th century produced". The Act significantly amended the existing law and court procedure, and while {{most of it was}} aimed at the common-law courts, it did affect the Chancery. For equity, the Act provided that a party trying to have his case dismissed could not do so until he had paid the full costs, rather than the nominal costs that were previously required; at the same time, the reforms the Act made to common-law procedure (such as allowing claims to be brought against executors of wills) reduced the need for parties to go to equity for a remedy. Legal historian Wilfrid Prest writes that despite these legislative enactments, the tally of which [...] "begins to look quite impressive", the old problems continued, albeit less frequently; one barrister of the time claimed that going to the Court with a case worth anything less than £500 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Steven Pacey {{was cast}} as Tarrant. Pacey was {{told about the}} part by Chris Boucher at the BBC bar. Remembering his audition, Pacey said, [...] "...reading the {{character}} breakdown, and it said, 'Del Tarrant is thirty-five years old-' and I thought, 'This is a bit silly, I'm only twenty-one'. I went downstairs thinking it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and saw other actors who all seemed nearer the right age. When I went to see David Maloney [...] his advice to me was to keep my performance as gritty as possible". Maloney was concerned that Pacey's curly hair made Pacey look similar to Gareth Thomas. Judith Smith, Maloney's production secretary, recalled that [...] "...there was all the rigmarole about trying to straighten his hair and can we cut it really short, and what can we do?".|$|E

2500|$|During {{a special}} session at the XX International AIDS Conference, 2014, Geldof {{referred}} to sex workers as [...] "hookers", {{for which he was}} subsequently criticised. Christian Vega, a sex workers' rights activist and a member of Victoria's peer-only Victorian Sex Industry Network (VIXEN), blamed speakers including Geldof for their use of pejorative language, which perpetuated the very stigmas that are among the key barriers to HIV prevention. Geldof responded to the criticism during the closing session of the conference: [...] "I read today in the paper that my talk yesterday was littered with profanities – fuck them." [...] In Geldof's view, rights-based language hampered HIV prevention, and he defended using terms such as [...] "hookers" [...] and [...] "": [...] "Let’s not get distracted by diversionary language. Let’s call it as it is." [...] In a radio show after the conference on Joy 94.9, Vega dismissed Geldof’s view that rights-based language <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> as “ridiculous”, as it served as an important tool to challenge stigma and discrimination, particularly within an HIV context.|$|E

I can talk about it now at 65 because it's sort of, dispassionate about it, and I've seen worse things since, but that gave me a bit of a turn, yes, I didn't enjoy that. A row of kid's heads that you thought were footballs and you kick one and it wasn't, and it rolled away down the rubble." ...|$|E

60|$|The old beech partridge, however, was a bird of a {{different}} mind. No dog ever stood him {{for more than a}} second; he had learned too well what the thing meant. The moment he heard the patter of a dog's feet on leaves he would run rapidly, and skulk and hide and run again, keeping dog and hunter on the move till he found the cover he wanted,--thick trees, or a tangle of wild grapevines,--when he would burst out on, the farther side. And no eye, however keen, could catch more than a glimpse of a gray tail before he was gone. Other grouse make short straight flights, and can be followed and found again; but he always drove away on strong wings for an incredible distance, and swerved far to right or left; so that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> to follow him up. Before you found him he had rested his wings and was ready for another flight; and when you did find him he would shoot away like an arrow out of the top of a pine tree and give you never a glimpse of himself.|$|E
