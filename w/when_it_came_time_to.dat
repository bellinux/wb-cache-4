5|$|In {{the second}} episode, both St-Pierre and Koscheck had Johnson {{at the top}} of their lists <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> select fighters. During the team {{selection}} process however, St-Pierre created a fake list which did not have Johnson among his top selections, and subtly showed it to Koscheck to fool him into believing it. This seemed to manipulate Koscheck into picking Marc Stevens, as he may have believed he could take Johnson later. This allowed St-Pierre to choose Johnson with the second overall pick.|$|E

Years later, during the early seasons of The Simpsons, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> give Grampa a first name, Groening says he refused to name him after his own grandfather, Abraham Groening, leaving it to other writers to choose a name. By coincidence, they chose Abraham, unaware that it was the name of Groening's grandfather.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{kill off}} Ana Lucia, the {{character}} of Libby was killed {{at the same time}} to create an emotional impact. This happened amidst rumours that the characters were killed off because both actresses in question had been arrested for DUI while filming on location in Oahu. The producers denied that Ana Lucia was killed off because of Rodriguez's behaviour on set, saying although they had no interaction with her, they had been told she had been professional. Rodriguez felt comfortable on the series, but was happy to leave as she felt this would help her grow personally, and become a woman. She had mixed feelings about leaving Hawaii, where Lost is filmed; her allergies were hard to deal with, but she loved the scenery.|$|E

Methuen had decided that the book did not portray Great Britain accurately enough, and had {{compiled a list of}} 131 errors of detail, which should be put right, asking Studios Hergé to rework it completely. The resulting album is the dramatically updated and redrawn 1966 version that is the most commonly available today. , Egmont publishes Tintin books in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble finding a place to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} further tramline closures in the mid-1930s, the Board {{decided to}} go with A.E.C. diesel buses as they felt the technology had matured {{to the point where}} they were a reliable option. Though the trolley buses introduced only a few years earlier had performed well and found favour with passengers, their dependence on fixed infrastructure did not suit the Board's preference for operational flexibility. The first order for ten chassis was placed with A.E.C. in 1935–1936.|$|E

25|$|To {{the extent}} that Italy held the {{territory}} by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, {{which was to be}} incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would cause serious difficulties <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> integrate the two parts.|$|E

25|$|Johnson's {{trial began}} in late March. With a {{predominantly}} Republican Senate, Johnson's impeachment seemed to many a foregone conclusion. However, throughout the process, several senators began showing hesitance {{to remove the}} President from office. Stanton, meanwhile, had remained barred in the War Department's headquarters for weeks, sneaking off {{once in a while}} to visit his home. When it seemed to Stanton that Johnson would not remove him forcefully from office, he began spending more time at home. Stanton watched closely as the trial, which he was convinced would end with Johnson's conviction, continued for several months. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> vote, 35 voted to convict, 19 to acquit, falling one short of the 36-vote supermajority needed for a conviction.
