5|$|The Luftwaffe was {{detailed}} {{to destroy}} Fighter Command before the planned invasion of Britain could take place. The OKL {{hoped that the}} destruction of the British fighter force would force the British to come to terms by air power alone and the very risky Operation Sea Lion would not be needed. The enormous numerical superiority of British naval forces over their German opponents made a crossing of the Channel very dangerous, even with air superiority. Furthermore, the aircraft losses of the spring campaign had weakened the Luftwaffe before the Battle of Britain, and it could not begin its campaign against Fighter Command immediately. It was forced to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> had reached acceptable levels before a main assault against the RAF could be made in August 1940.|$|E

Their {{trenches}} stretched from the sea to Walkers Ridge and included two outposts, No.1 Post and No.2 Post. The regiment took over on the extreme right, with one squadron in the front line, one squadron in the support trench and the third squadron as the reserve. Next in line to their right, was the Auckland Mounted Rifles, and then the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the left. However, the regiment had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> got dark before sending men forward to man the two outposts.|$|E

Regardless of the end-product, the manufacturing principle is the same: to meter the liquid isocyanate and resin blend at a specified stoichiometric ratio, mix them together until a homogeneous blend is obtained, dispense the reacting liquid into a mold or on to a surface, <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> cures, then demold the finished part.|$|E
25|$|A {{resident}} {{who wishes to}} challenge the validity of an ordinance need not <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> has been enforced against them (although it may be challenged at that time). Instead, a resident may bring an action for a declaratory judgment alleging that the ordinance is void {{because it was not}} properly noticed, goes beyond the county charter, is arbitrary, discriminatory, or unreasonably vague, or that it is preempted by state or federal law. An ordinance will be deemed preempted if it addresses an activity for which the state has prohibited local regulation altogether, or where it is inconsistent with state law. An ordinance may not permit an activity that is expressly prohibited by state law, or prohibits an activity that is expressly permitted by state law. However, if some state regulation exists as to an activity, political subdivisions may impose further regulations on that activity so long as it is possible for a resident to comply with both sets of regulations.|$|E
25|$|While {{hunting in}} the dark depths, {{elephant}} seals seem to locate their prey at least partly by vision; the bioluminescence of some prey animals can facilitate their capture. Elephant seals {{do not have a}} developed a system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae, which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed {{to play a role in}} search of food. Males and females differ in diving behavior. Males tend to hug the continental shelf while making deep dives and forage along the bottom, while females have more jagged routes and forage in the open ocean. Males return to the same feeding ground every year, while females have less predictable feeding migrations. Elephant seals are prey for killer whales and white sharks. Both are most likely to hunt pups, and seldom hunt large bull elephant seals, but have taken seals of all ages. The shark, when hunting adults, is most likely to ambush a seal with a damaging bite and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> is weakened by blood loss to finish the kill.|$|E

25|$|The London Irish G and F Companies {{crossed the}} start-lines after a fifteen-minute warm-up by the 25 pounders, {{and they were}} soon on Points 704 and when G Company {{overwhelmed}} the position, H Company moved on to take Point 703. On the start-line they had some casualties as they had to face machine-guns from the hill and from the sides; G Company helped in silencing the enfilade fire, and when darkness came the London Irish consolidated on the ground gained. The third hill however still held out and the decision {{had to be made}} whether to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> had fallen, or to carry on without delay and rely on the preoccupation of the Germans with the left-flank attack. The latter course was taken; the Royal Irish Fusiliers put in their assault towards the north and rear of Centuripe, and the Inniskillings, who throughout had been in close contact with the Germans on the frontal sector, obtained a foothold on the southern edge of the village after a heavy barrage, which included scaling a 100-foot cliff.|$|E
500|$|Crocodilians {{are unable}} to chew and need to swallow food whole, so prey that is too large to swallow is torn into pieces. They {{may be unable to}} deal with a large animal with a thick hide, and may <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> becomes putrid and comes apart more easily. To tear a chunk of tissue from a large carcass, a crocodilian spins its body {{continuously}} while holding on with its jaws, a manoeuvre known as the [...] "death roll". During cooperative feeding, some individuals may hold on to the prey, while others perform the roll. The animals do not fight, and each retires with a piece of flesh and awaits its next feeding turn. Food is typically consumed by crocodilians with their heads above water. The food is held with the tips of the jaws, tossed towards the back of the mouth by an upward jerk of the head and then gulped down. Nile crocodiles may store carcasses underwater for later consumption.|$|E
500|$|To {{ward off}} the threat of vampires and disease, twin {{brothers}} would yoke twin oxen to a plow and make a furrow with it around their village. An egg would be broken and a nail driven into the floor beneath the bier {{of the house of}} a recently deceased person. Two or three elderly women would attend the cemetery the evening after the funeral and stick five hawthorn pegs or old knives into the grave: one at the position of the deceased's chest, and the other four at the positions of his arms and legs. Other texts maintain that running backwards uphill with a lit candle and a turtle would ward off a stalking vampire. Alternately, they may surround the grave with a red woolen thread, ignite the thread, and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> was burnt up. If a noise was heard at night and suspected to be made by a vampire sneaking around someone's house, one would shout [...] "Come tomorrow, and I will give you some salt," [...] or [...] "Go, pal, get some fish, and come back." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 26, {{about four}} {{days prior to}} Ernesto {{striking}} the state, the government of Florida activated its Emergency Operations Center, while the National Guard was placed on standby, following a [...] "warning order" [...] to its commanders. On August 27, the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, issued {{a state of emergency}} because of the high risk of impact from Ernesto on the state. Officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for all visitors and non-residents in the Florida Keys about three days before the storm passed through the area. Mandatory evacuations were later issued for mobile homes and low-lying areas of Monroe, Broward, St. Lucie, and Martin counties; voluntary evacuations were also issued for barrier islands in Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties. On August 28, forecasters issued a hurricane watch for southern Florida through the Florida Keys. When Ernesto was downgraded to tropical storm status, Governor Jeb Bush urged Florida residents to continue preparations and not <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> regained hurricane status, as it was forecast to do by the National Hurricane Center. At least 30shelters were opened, and tolls on four turnpike were lifted. Several schools were closed across southern Florida. The threat of the storm caused NASA to postpone the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Space Center to avoid risking damage from the storm.|$|E
500|$|According to Warren Treadgold, the Byzantine effort {{seems to}} have been led by Irene's chief minister, the eunuch Staurakios, whose {{strategy}} was to avoid an immediate confrontation with Harun's huge army, but <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> had split up and advanced to meet its various detachments independently. The Thracesians under Lachanodrakon confronted al-Barmaki at a place called Darenos, but were defeated and suffered heavy losses (15,000 men according to Theophanes, 10,000 according to Michael the Syrian). The outcome of al-Rabi's siege of Nakoleia is unclear, but he was probably defeated; Theophanes's phrasing may imply that the town was taken, but Michael the Syrian reports that the Arabs suffered great losses and failed to capture it, a version of events confirmed by hagiographic sources. Al-Tabari reports that part of the main army under Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani met a Byzantine force led by a certain Niketas who was [...] "count of counts" [...] (perhaps the Count of the Opsician Theme), probably somewhere near Nicaea. In the ensuing battle, Niketas was wounded and unhorsed in single combat with the Arab general and forced to retire, probably to Nicomedia, where the imperial tagmata (professional guard regiments) under the Domestic of the Schools Anthony were assembled. Harun did not bother with them, and advanced to the town of Chrysopolis, across the Bosporus Strait from Constantinople itself. Lacking ships to cross the Bosporus, and with no intention of assaulting Constantinople in the first place, Harun probably intended this advance only as a show of force.|$|E
500|$|Tensions between Tipu and the Nizam and the British {{were raised}} when, in 1788, the East India Company gained {{control over the}} Circar of Guntur, the southernmost of the Northern Circars, {{pursuant}} to an earlier agreement with the Nizam. [...] In exchange, the company agreed to station some of its troops with the Hyderabadi army. By 1789, tensions between Tipu and his neighbours and vassals to Mysore's west, including the Kingdom of Travancore, also rose noticeably. [...] Travancore, listed in the 1784 treaty as a British ally, acquired from the Dutch East India Company two forts located within the territory of Cochin, a Mysorean vassal state. [...] The Dutch had never paid tribute to anyone for these forts since gaining control of them, {{but the fact that}} they were within Cochin's bounds was sufficient for Tipu to dispute Travancore's claim. [...] He began massing troops at Coimbatore and making threatening gestures toward Dharma Raja of Travancore. [...] British authorities in Madras warned Tipu that acts of aggression against Travancore would be met with a British response, and Cornwallis began urging John Holland, the governor of Madras, to begin military preparations. [...] On 29 December 1789, Tipu attacked Travancore's defences. Hollond, however, was not a military man, and rather than acting with vigour, he temporised and attempted negotiation with Tipu. He was replaced in early 1790 by General William Medows, to whom Cornwallis gave the authority for a military campaign against Mysore. Cornwallis began negotiating with the Marathas and the Nizam for their support, since the British forces in India were significantly lacking in cavalry, one of Tipu's strengths. The Marathas and the Nizam both had significant cavalry forces, and they were interested in recovering territories lost to Mysore in earlier conflicts. [...] However, they were too weak to attack Mysore individually, and did not trust each other, so they preferred to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> was clear the British were committed to act against Mysore.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} counter their {{weaknesses}} to an American offensive, {{the idea of}} a Canadian invasion of the United States was proposed. [...] It was hoped that a successful invasion would occupy Portland and large sections of Maine, requiring the U.S. to divert troops that would otherwise be occupied with an invasion of Canada directed at its east-west communication and transportation lines. Burgoyne, Seaton, and MacDougall all supported the plan and Lewis recommended it to Palmerston on December 3. However no preparations for this attack were ever made, and success depended on the attack being initiated {{at the very beginning of}} the war. [...] MacDougall believed that [...] "a strong party is believed to exist in Maine in favor of annexation to Canada" [...] (a belief that Bourne characterizes as [...] "dubious"), and that this party would assist a British invasion. [...] The Admiralty hydrographer, Captain Washington, and Milne both felt that if such a party existed that it would be best to postpone an attack and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> became apparent that [...] "the state was inclined to change masters." ...|$|E
2500|$|The leaders got {{clear by}} over seven {{minutes in the}} early running of the stage, which {{eventually}} reached a margin of eleven minutes approaching {{the midpoint of the}} stage where rain started to fall once again.

In Murten, a railway crossing closed with members of those teams able to get through while the rest of the field had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>it</b> was cleared; race commissaires later ruled that the riders – around twenty in total – that got through the crossing without waiting were ordered to drop back to the peloton once again. With [...] to go, the three leaders still held an advantage of around eight minutes. Vangenechten dropped back at Frienisberg, while Mørkøv and Bonnafond managed to resist capture until inside the final kilometre, which ultimately set up the bunch sprint. The sprint itself was won by 's Peter Sagan for his tenth victory of the season, ahead of 's Baden Cooke and [...] rider Ben Swift.
