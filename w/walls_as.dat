5|$|As of 2009, monthly {{visits to}} the tomb in {{bullet-proof}} vehicles under heavy IDF protection are organised by the Yitzhar based organization Shechem Ehad. In late April 2009, a group of Jewish worshipers found the headstone smashed and swastikas painted on the <b>walls,</b> <b>as</b> well as boot prints on the grave itself.|$|E
5|$|Cave 16 {{is a small}} dwelling, on a {{slightly}} higher level above cave 15. It has a cell with a bench along its right wall and a veranda, {{which leads to the}} cell through a door. The side <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> well {{as a part of the}} ceiling are broken.|$|E
5|$|In Bucharest, the {{earthquake}} had an estimated intensity of VIII–IX on the Mercalli scale. It toppled church steeples and caused Cotroceni Monastery to collapse. Numerous fires broke out, mainly from overturned stoves. In Bulgaria, {{the cities of}} Ruse, Varna and Vidin were almost completely destroyed. The force of {{the earthquake}} cracked <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> far north as Moscow.|$|E

5|$|The land walls {{stretch from}} Fort Bokar {{in the west}} to the {{detached}} Revelin Fortress in the east.

5|$|The two gates {{into the}} city, Mdina Gate and Greeks Gate, are {{located within the}} curtain walls of the land front. Remains of the medieval double <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> well as the 18th-century Torre dello Standardo are located just within the city walls. The land front is {{surrounded}} by a deep ditch, and a traverse-like battery is located in its eastern extremity.|$|E
5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At {{the same time}} work {{continued}} on the castle. Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had been spent {{on the construction of}} Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town <b>walls.</b> <b>As</b> the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon, the plan was to build the castle's northern facade last.|$|E

5|$|Early on, manning {{a castle}} was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later {{replaced}} with paid forces. A garrison was usually commanded by a constable whose peace-time role {{would have been}} looking after the castle in the owner's absence. Under him would have been knights who by benefit of their military training would have acted {{as a type of}} officer class. Below them were archers and bowmen, whose role was to prevent the enemy reaching the <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> can be seen by the positioning of arrowslits.|$|E
5|$|Etruscan {{architecture}} {{was created}} between about 700 BC and 200 BC, when the expanding civilization of ancient Rome finally absorbed Etruscan civilization. The Etruscans were considerable builders in stone, wood {{and other materials}} of temples, houses, tombs and city <b>walls,</b> <b>as</b> well as bridges and roads. The only structures remaining in quantity in anything like their original condition are tombs and walls, but through archaeology and other sources {{we have a good}} deal of information on what once existed.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} {{yellow-brown}} spore print. Spores are egg-shaped to ellipsoid, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8.4–10.5 by 4.2–4.9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–35 by 7–9µm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube <b>walls</b> (<b>as</b> pleurocystidia) and abundantly on the edges (as cheilocystidia). They are somewhat spindle-shaped, sometimes with a central swelling, and measure 45–70 by 7–12μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae, {{and all of the}} hyphae are inamyloid.|$|E

5|$|In 1660 Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne and ownership of the castles changed once again. Beaumaris {{was restored}} to {{the control of the}} Bulkeley family, traditionally the constables of the castle, who promptly stripped the castle of any remaining materials, including the roofs, and Conwy was returned to the Conway family, who stripped down the castle for lead and timber, reducing it to a ruin as well. Charles' new government regarded Caernarfon's castle and town <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> a security risk and ordered them to be destroyed, but this order was never carried out, possibly because of the costs involved in doing so.|$|E
5|$|In {{towns and}} central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion {{made possible by}} sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But {{the main reason for}} the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E

5|$|On March 3, the Texians {{watched from}} the <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> {{approximately}} 1,000 Mexicans marched into Béxar. The Mexican army celebrated loudly throughout the afternoon, both in honor of their reinforcements and at the news that troops under General José de Urrea had soundly defeated Texian Colonel Frank W. Johnson at the Battle of San Patricio on February 27. Most of the Texians in the Alamo believed that Sesma had been leading the Mexican forces during the siege, and they mistakenly attributed the celebration {{to the arrival of}} Santa Anna. The reinforcements brought the number of Mexican soldiers in Béxar to almost 3,100.|$|E

Link is granted with the ability to merge onto <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> a painting after obtaining a magical bracelet and encountering Yuga. This new ability allows Link to reach previously inaccessible areas and travel between Hyrule and Lorule.|$|E

5|$|The Round Church {{contains}} many medieval inscriptions, both official and scratched on its <b>walls</b> <b>as</b> graffiti. One study counted {{a total of}} 193signs and 30drawings, the vast majority bearing some kind of Christian symbolism. As a whole, the epigraphy of the Round Church dates from the 10th century, and three alphabets are represented: the Greek, the Glagolitic, and the Cyrillic, {{as well as two}} languages: Byzantine Greek and Old Bulgarian (the eastern Bulgarian recension of Old Church Slavonic). The Glagolitic inscriptions of the Round Church bear evidence that the use of that alphabet in Preslav continued alongside Cyrillic.|$|E
