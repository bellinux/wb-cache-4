5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not reducible to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia {{in the case of}} non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E
25|$|Much of Dennett's {{work since}} the 1990s has been {{concerned}} with fleshing out his previous ideas by addressing the same topics from an evolutionary standpoint, from <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> human minds from animal minds (Kinds of Minds), to how free will is compatible with a naturalist {{view of the world}} (Freedom Evolves).|$|E
25|$|After Phaedrus {{concedes that}} this speech was {{certainly}} {{better than any}} Lysias could compose, they begin {{a discussion of the}} nature and uses of rhetoric itself. After showing that speech making itself isn't something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> good from bad writing, and they take this up.|$|E
50|$|Norton 360, {{developed}} by Symantec, was an “all-in-one” security suite that combined online protection with performance tuning. <b>What</b> <b>distinguished</b> this suite from Norton Internet Security is {{the inclusion of}} optimization and problem solving tools.|$|R

25|$|Several other {{performance}} evaluation {{models in the}} academic literature also describe performance measurement. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> performance paradox from these other models is {{that they tend to}} restrict their scopes either to explanations for changing performance criteria or to endorsements of maximizing on a specific, defined set of static criteria. Performance paradox alone predicts that maximizing on a set of predictably shifting criteria generates positive outcomes for organizations, most accurately describing most actual organizations' behavior.|$|E
25|$|Compared to {{server-based}} streaming, p2p-based streaming saves on data {{costs for}} the service provider, {{at the same time}} as the distribution becomes more robust, since it only grows stronger with every additional user. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> Vnet from traditional p2p is that Vnet allows an administrator to have central control over which movies are in the network and which users that can see them. Publishing into the network and access to the network is thus centrally controlled.|$|E
25|$|This relief sculpture, {{in a sense}} {{depicts the}} eclectic {{inclusion}} of various art forms by the Achaemenids, yet their ability {{to create a new}} synthetic form that is uniquely Persian in style, and heavily dependent on the contributions of their subject states. After all, that is <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> Achaemenid architecture from those of other kingdoms. It is its originality in context of fusion and inclusion of existing styles, {{in such a way as}} to create awe-inspiring structures.|$|E

25|$|Abductive reasoning, or {{argument}} {{to the best}} explanation, {{is a form of}} inductive reasoning, since the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.|$|E
25|$|This {{features}} French poetry, then {{very influential}} in Italy. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> the Sicilian School from the troubadours, however, {{is the introduction}} of a kinder, gentler type of woman than that found in their French models; one who was nearer to Dante's madonnas and Petrarch's Laura, though much less characterised psychologically. The poems of the Sicilians hardly portray real women or situations (Frederick's song cannot be read as autobiographical), but the style and language are remarkable, since the Sicilians (as Dante called them) created the first Italian literary standard by enriching the existing vernacular base, probably inspired by popular love songs, with new words of Latin and Provençal origin.|$|E
25|$|Closely related {{fields in}} {{theoretical}} computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity {{theory is that}} the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms {{that could be used to}} solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.|$|E

25|$|In {{statistical}} mechanics, for {{a closed}} system (no transfer of matter), heat is the energy transfer {{associated with a}} disordered, microscopic action on the system, associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system, without change in {{the values of the}} energy levels themselves. It is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves, but <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered, microscopic action, including radiative transfer. A mathematical definition can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates.|$|E
25|$|At stake, beyond {{commercial}} {{speculation and}} financial profit, were {{the questions of}} when Cubism began, who {{led the way in}} its development, <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> Cubist art, how it can be defined and who can be called Cubist. By marginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and Salon d'Automne, Kahnweiler's attempted to focus attention on Picasso and Braque, those who played a leading if independent {{role in the development of}} this new mode of expression. To some extent Kahnweiler had succeeded in his endeavor, prompting historians such as Douglas Cooper to coin the term ‘true’ Cubism to describe the work of Picasso and Braque. The implied value judgement was intentional.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{is one of}} {{the four}} {{fundamental}} states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam.|$|E

25|$|<b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> the Amami Islands {{from other}} island groups was the {{presence}} of the Gusuku Site Complex in Kikai Island. This archaeological site complex lasted for a long time from the 9th century. In its second peak, from {{the latter half of the}} 11th century to the first half of the 12th century, an exceptionally large quantities of sue wares, haji wares, kamuiyaki, and soapstone cauldrons produced in the Nishisonogi Peninsula, Nagasaki Prefecture were used together with Chinese white glazed wares, Chinese celadons, Goryeo ceramics and Goryeo unglazed stonewares. The Gusuku Site Complex is noted for its non-native nature and resemblance to Dazaifu, the administrative center of Kyūshū. It is highly probable that the Gusuku Site Complex was constructed by people under the State of Japan although Amami was not formally incorporated into the administrative system of Japan.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Putnam County's lakes {{had become one}} of many places where city {{residents}} went on hot summer weekends. Brothers Warren and Arthur Smadbeck were developers who decided to create more. They bought failing farms in the area in 1928 and built the dam to create the lake. Around it they built small bungalows and cottages meant to be weekend or summer homes for middle-income families, selling them in lavish ads in the New York Daily Mirror. This continued through the 1940s. Eventually, 5,400 homes were built in the three square miles (8km²) around the lake, Kent Township, N.Y.|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E3D7143BF935A25757C0A9629C8B63===all|publisher=The New York Times Company|work=The New York Times|date=2004-04-16|accessdate=2008-08-02|quote=That quality is <b>what</b> <b>distinguishes</b> the region referred to as western Kent, which encompasses all but the densely populated three square miles of the Lake Carmel area, bordering Patterson on the east, where 3,000 homes sit on quarter-acre lots}} accounting for one-third of the town's housing stock.|$|E
25|$|Although not as {{well known}} as the Carnival of Veracruz, a number of {{communities}} in the state hold Carnival celebrations {{in the days leading}} up to Ash Wednesday. These include Jiutepec, Tlaltizapán, Emiliano Zapata, Tepoztlán, Tlayacapan, Yautepec, and Xochitepec. <b>What</b> <b>distinguishes</b> carnivals in Morelos from others in Mexico is the participation of the Chinelos and bands with wind instruments. In Tepotzlan on the Sunday before Ash Wednesday, the traditional tianguis market is cleared away from the main square and hundreds of multicolored stands move onto the streets in order to make way for Carnival. The street stands mostly specialize in items needed to enjoy the event. Chinelo dancers dominate the event, many in costumes which have been very expensive to assemble. Other events during Carnival here are processions, including the principal one in which there are representatives of all the communities of the municipality. The events last from Sunday to midnight Tuesday, signaling the beginning of Ash Wednesday and Lent. Each day, the Chinelos dance more energetically than the last.|$|E
