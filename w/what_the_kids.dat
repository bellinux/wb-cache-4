500|$|Oblivion {{features}} {{the voices of}} Patrick Stewart, Lynda Carter, Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, Ralph Cosham, and Wes Johnson, with celebrity acquisition and voice production being handled by Blindlight. The voice acting received mixed reviews in the gaming press. While many publications praised it as excellent, others found fault with its repetitiveness. The issue has been blamed on {{the small number of}} voice actors and the blandness of the dialogue itself. Lead designer Ken Rolston found the plan to fully voice the game [...] "less flexible, less apt for user projection of his own tone, more constrained for branching, and more trouble for production and disk real estate" [...] than Morrowinds partially recorded dialogue. Rolston tempered his criticism with the suggestion that voice acting [...] "can be a powerful expressive tool" [...] and can contribute significantly to the charm and ambience of the game. He stated [...] "I prefer Morrowinds partially recorded dialogue, for many reasons. But I'm told that voiced dialogue is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> want".|$|E

Norris cartoons remain popular today even though much of their original political or social context is gone.|$|E
