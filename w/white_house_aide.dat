25|$|The project {{not only}} accused Clinton of {{financial}} and sexual indiscretions (some later verified, others not), but also gave root to conspiracist notions that the Clintons {{collaborated with the}} CIA to run a drug smuggling operation out {{of the town of}} Mena, Arkansas and that Clinton had arranged for the murder of <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aide</b> Vince Foster as part of a coverup of the Whitewater scandal. The possibility that money from the project had been given to former Clinton associate David Hale, a witness in the Whitewater investigation, led to the appointment of Michael J. Shaheen as a special investigator. Shaheen subpoenaed Scaife, who testified before a federal grand jury in the matter.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aide</b> with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Kathleen Willey {{alleged that}} Clinton groped {{her in a}} hallway in 1993. An {{independent}} counsel determined Willey gave [...] "false information" [...] to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aide</b> of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.|$|E
500|$|In July 1973, <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aide</b> Alexander Butterfield testified {{under oath}} to Congress that Nixon {{had a secret}} taping system that {{recorded}} his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office. These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes, citing executive privilege. With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the [...] "Saturday Night Massacre"; he was replaced by Leon Jaworski. In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations held in the White House on June 20, 1972 featured an 18½ minute gap. Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, {{claimed responsibility for the}} gap, alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, though her tale was widely mocked.

In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the press briefing room. The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires. The closet in the master bedroom was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium.|$|E

50|$|Gewirtz {{also takes}} issue with the Hatch Act of 1939 for two reasons. First, he claims that since the Hatch Act {{apparently}} bans <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staffers from using government e-mail resources for political communication, <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aides</b> used political party e-mail resources instead, effectively bypassing the record-keeping requirements of the Presidential Records Act. He claims in the 2,072 days between September 11, 2001 and May 15, 2007, a minimum of 103.6 million messages were likely sent by <b>White</b> <b>House</b> staffers on Republican National Committee servers.|$|R

The McGovern–Hatfield Amendment to the annual military procurement bill, co-sponsored by Republican Mark Hatfield of Oregon, required via funding cutoff a complete withdrawal of all American forces from Indochina {{by the end of}} 1970. It underwent months of public discussion and alterations to make it acceptable to more senators, including pushing the deadline out to the end of 1971. In May 1970, McGovern obtained a second mortgage on his Washington home in order to fund a half-hour televised panel discussion on the amendment on NBC. The broadcast brought in over $500,000 in donations that furthered work on passage, and eventually the amendment gained the support {{of the majority of the}} public in polls. The effort was denounced by opposition groups organized by <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aide</b> Charles Colson, which called McGovern and Hatfield [...] "apostles of retreat and defeat" [...] and [...] "salesmen of surrender" [...] and maintained that only the president could conduct foreign policy. The amendment was defeated in September 1970 by a 55–39 vote, just short of what McGovern had hoped would constitute at least a moral victory.

On June 25, Dean named Nixon as having helped to plan the burglary's cover-up, and the following month, <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aide</b> Alexander Butterfield testified that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office.
