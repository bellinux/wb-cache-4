This objective is accomplished with the visible infrared spin scan radiometer Atmospheric Sounder (VAS), and the Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which includes three instruments: a magnetometer, solar X-ray sensor, and an energetic particle sensor, which monitor the near earth space environment. The satellite's communication system provides several user oriented functions, including: (1) Transmission of VAS data; (2) Transmission of SEM data; (3) Transponder capabilities for stretched VAS (SVAS) data, <b>weather</b> <b>facsimile</b> (WEFAX) data, and trilateration signals; (4) transponder capabilities for data collection platform interrogation and data collection platform reply...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) uses newer {{technology}} and has expanded capability relative to the predecessor GOES series of satellites. The satellite directly transmits day and night observations of hemispheric-scale weather, hurricanes, and other more localized severe storms and relays processed high-resolution observation data along with <b>weather</b> <b>facsimile</b> (WEFAX) data. Weather observations are generated in the visible and infrared spin scan radiometer (VISSR) atmospheric sounder (VAS). The VAS performs visible and infrared imaging as well as multispectral imaging (MSI) and temperature sounding of the atmosphere. The satellite provides direct interrogation and simultaneous relay transmission between the command data acquisition station (CDAS) and the multiple, widely dispersed data collection platforms (DCP). The satellites also monitor {{the condition of the}} earth's magnetic field, energetic particle flux, and X-ray emissions from the sun. The satellite performs all communications functions by means of a multifunction communications system that operates on S-band and uhf frequencies at rates varying from 100 bit/s to 28 megabit/s. An experimental capability for the detection of the emergency locator transmitter beacons is included in the GOES-GH design {{as a part of the}} international satellite-aided search and rescue system...|$|E
40|$|The GOES-N study {{consisted}} of five distinct tasks including: determining replication costs of GOES I-M and GOES- 7 in the GOES-N time frame; defining and evaluating modifications to GOES I-M to improve efficiency or reduce costs; and defining evolutionary changes to the GOES I-M design to satisfy National Weather Service (NWS) 1983 and NOAA 1989 requirements. The categorization and disposition of NOAA requirements is reported in volume 1 section 4. Results of the GOES I-M efficiency/cost improvement modifications study are described in Section 7. 1. The system concept options 1, 2, and 3 that generally represent {{the results of the}} Task 2, 3 A, and 3 B studies are summarized in Section 7. 2. Another result of the GOES-N study, the determination of which NWS 1983 and NOAA 1989 requirements can be met with the three options, is contained in volume 1 section 7. Conclusions and recommendations are covered in volume 1 section 8. Imager, sounder, control system, space environment monitor, search and rescue, <b>weather</b> <b>facsimile,</b> data collection system, and products/process/communications recommendations were extracted from sections 9, 10, and 11. Section 8 also contains conclusions pertaining to programmatic operational satellite issues (prerequisite development strategies, the direct procurement of instruments by the government, protoflight mission, etc.). Sections 9, 10, and 11 address instrument, control system, image/navigation/registration, and other system design considerations and surveys. These sections are supported by the appendices in volume 2...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaThe GOES {{satellites}} are multifunctional satellites {{whose primary}} {{function is to}} provide continuous measurements of the earth’s surface and atmosphere from two geostationary orbit locations: 75 °W and 135 °W. This objective is accomplished with the Visible infrared spin scan radiometer Atmospheric Sounder (VAS). The atmospheric sounder is a new feature which will add a third dimension to the photographs of the earth seen nightly by TV newscast viewers. The satellite also contains a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) which includes three instruments: a magnetometer, a solar X-ray sensor and an energetic particle sensor (EPS), which monitor solar flares and near earth space environment. The satellite contains a communications system which, in addition to transmitting VAS, SEM and housekeeping data to earth, provides relay capabilities for the stretched VAS and <b>weather</b> <b>facsimile</b> (WEFAX) data, {{as well as for}} the Data Collection Platform (DCP). A sketch of the satellite is given in Figure 1. The telemetry system encompasses two subsystems: RF communications and baseband assemblies. A general diagram of the telemetry system is shown in Figure 2. The telemetry system consists of two functional operations; real time telemetry data which is frequency modulated into IRIG 12 and IRIG B, and PCM data which is phase modulated. The baseband assemblies collect, format and modulate the data. The RF system sums the PCM and IRIG signals, phase modulates it onto both the CDA and STDN carriers, and transmits it to the ground stations. The following sections will describe in further detail the operation of the PCM and real time telemetry functions, and a description of the satellite RF communications system...|$|E
