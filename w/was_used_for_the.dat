5|$|Due to the damage, {{the name}} Ione was retired {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic {{hurricane}} again. This was before the formal lists were created, as a result it was not replaced with any particular name.

5|$|Georgia's jury {{votes in}} the Grand Final were all {{declared}} invalid, as all the jury members had voted exactly the same from 3 points up to 12 points. According to EBU, this constitutes a statistical impossibility. Therefore, only Georgia's televoting result <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> distribution of the Georgian points in the Grand Final.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{the title}} <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tenth {{film in the}} Eon Productions series.

Scenes in the San Francisco Bay were shot at a tank on Paramount's backlot.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the title}} of the story From a View to a Kill <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill, with none of the story used in this or any other film to date.|$|E
5|$|Since Close Encounters {{was filmed}} anamorphically, the visual effects {{sequences}} were shot on 70 mm film to better conform with the 35 mm film {{used for the}} rest of the movie. A test reel using computer-generated imagery <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be too expensive and ineffective since CGI was in its infancy in the mid-1970s.|$|E
30|$|The cold {{tolerance}} {{scores of}} all the tested cultivars and their corresponding latitude values <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> correlation analysis.

30|$|In {{the first}} experiment, Exp. 1, native Arabic {{speakers}} {{are involved in}} both the training and the testing. The WestPoint corpus is divided {{in such a way}} that 61 % of <b>the</b> corpus <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and 39 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test regardless of either gender or scripts. In the second experiment, Exp. 2, native speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only nonnative speakers are involved in the test phase. Then, the training uses 85 % of the corpus (native speakers), while 15 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In Exp. 3, all nonnative Arabic speakers <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and all Arabic native speakers <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In the fourth experiment, Exp. 4, only nonnative Arabic speakers <b>were</b> <b>used</b> in both training and testing systems. The nonnative speakers' part of the corpus is divided to obtain 67 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training, and 33 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In the fifth experiment, Exp. 5, both native and nonnative Arabic utterances are pooled to constitute the training data (69 % of the corpus) and testing data (31 % of the corpus). Experiments Exp. 6 to Exp. 9 are set up by varying the gender of the speakers in training and testing data. In Exp. 6, native male speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only nonnative male speakers are involved in the test. Thus the training uses 82 % of the corpus (male speakers only), while 18 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In Exp. 7, native female speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only nonnative female speakers are involved in the test. Hence the training uses 90 % of the corpus (female speakers only), while 10 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. In Exp. 8, nonnative male speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only native male speakers are involved in the test. In this case, the training uses 18 % of the corpus (male speakers), while 82 % of the corpus composed of native male speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. Finally, in Exp. 9, nonnative female speakers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> training and only native female speakers are involved in the test. Thus the training uses 10 % of the corpus (female speakers), while 90 % of the corpus composed of nonnative speakers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test. The bigram language model was always derived from the total of prompts provided by WestPoint. This means that we use the same language model for all experiments.|$|R

5|$|The Hotel New Otani Tokyo {{served as}} the outside for Osato Chemicals and the hotel's gardens were used for scenes of the ninja training. Bōnotsu in Kagoshima {{served as the}} fishing village, the Kobe harbour <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dock fight and Mount Shinmoe-dake in Kyūshū <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exteriors of SPECTRE's headquarters. Large crowds were present in Japan to see the shooting. A Japanese fan began {{following}} Sean Connery with a camera, and the police were called several times to prevent invasions during shooting.|$|E
5|$|The Moving Picture Company {{created the}} climactic hotel sequence. The fire effects were {{supervised}} by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had {{to enhance the}} sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous. A full-scale replica of the building's exterior <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.|$|E
50|$|Cars {{given away}} on the mid-'90s version of the program were {{provided}} by Daihatsu and later SEAT. Early in the 2003 run, Suzuki cars <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> both <b>the</b> pricing games and the Showcase; once the Mega Showcase was introduced, Citroën cars <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pricing games, while Alfa Romeo cars <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Showcase. Holden replaced Citroen in 2005.|$|R
50|$|Dry {{cargo ships}} today are mainly bulk {{carriers}} and container ships. Bulk carriers or bulkers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> transportation of homogeneous cargo such as coal, rubber, copra, tin, and wheat.

30|$|In {{the first}} step, the {{customer}} service information table {{is converted to}} the Kavosh format. In this phase, one service is considered as a target field. The relationships between this service and other services are extracted as rules. The customer service information table is distributed over 70 nodes. The conversion time is 1200 s. Fifty servers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Mapper, one server <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Reducer and sixty servers <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rule generation layer.|$|R
5|$|The {{cover for}} Thriller {{features}} Jackson {{in a white}} suit that belonged to photographer Dick Zimmerman. The gatefold sleeve reveals a tiger cub at Jackson's leg, which Zimmerman reported the singer mostly kept away from his face fearing he would be scratched. Another picture from the shoot, with Jackson embracing the cub, <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2001 special edition of Thriller.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{originally}} designated as an east–west highway, whereas {{it is now}} signed north-south. Although Route S-28 <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> alignment for nearly three decades, the second state highway renumbering in 1953 eliminated the designation, and Route 18 was designated in place.|$|E
5|$|The {{stations}} {{were in the}} heart of the North East coal field, which at the time of their opening had hundreds of collieries. Coal was delivered straight to the stations by rail. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> South station, where 22railway sidings were built. Trains could only enter the sidings when travelling in a westerly direction.|$|E
30|$|Once the {{investment}} and operating cost assessment has been concluded, the service cost can be obtained. As indicated in Figure 2, {{a selection of}} the service drivers <b>is</b> <b>used</b> in the cost allocation calculator that is described in this section. For future reference, these service drivers are identified as ‘used capacity’ service drivers. The peak number of active connections <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> WAPs. The maximum on-board throughput per car <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wiring and the switches. The maximum train-to-wayside throughput per train <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> gateway servers, antennas, splitters and radios. The yearly consumed data volume <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> train-to-wayside communication. The used capacity service driver <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other resources is a dummy variable that indicates if the service uses the resource or not.|$|R
30|$|The Pearson Chi Square {{test and}} Fisher’s exact test <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{comparisons}} of <b>the</b> categorical variables.
