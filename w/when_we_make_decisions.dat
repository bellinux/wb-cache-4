40|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions,</b> the {{benefits}} of an option often need to be weighed against accompanying costs. Little is known, however, about the neural systems underlying such cost-benefit computations. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and choice modeling, we show that decision making based on cost-benefit comparison can be explained as a stochastic accumulation of cost-benefit difference. Model-driven functional MRI shows that ventromedial and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compare costs and benefits by computing the difference between neural signatures of anticipated benefits and costs from the ventral striatum and amygdala, respectively. Moreover, changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the bilateral middle intraparietal sulcus reflect the accumulation of the difference signal from ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In sum, we show that a neurophysiological mechanism previously established for perceptual decision making, that is, the difference-based accumulation of evidence, is fundamental also in value-based decisions. The brain, thus, weighs costs against benefits by combining neural benefit and cost signals into a single, difference-based neural representation of net value, which is accumulated over time until the individual decides to accept or reject an option...|$|E

We developed a metric for estimating how participants weight their partner’s opinion relative to their own and compared this weighting to an optimal benchmark.

This emerging field, called neuroeconomics, has made quick progress in identifying a plethora of brain areas that track or are modulated by reward value.

A primate study by Strait and colleagues in this issue of PLOS Biology finds overlapping signals of value coding in two brain regions central to the valuation process: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum.

The (Neuro) Economic Model of Choice A central axiom of economic models of choice is that there exists a single, common scale of value that the decisionmaker uses to compare options, and that this common currency can be revealed through the actions of the animal (see Box 1 for a glossary of terms used in this pre-view).

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Hypothetical thinking involves {{the imagination of}} situations {{that we have not}} actually experienced. We may, for example, imagine the consequences of alternative actions available to us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> a <b>decision.</b> In such a case we would try to conduct a mental simulation of a possible world in order to work out the consequences of the action. The investigators have recently developed a new psychological theory of conditional statements of the form if p then q on the basis that these trigger a process of hypothetical thinking in which q is assessed in a mental simulation of p. This differs from standard logical and psychological accounts. Our theory has a number of psychological consequences for (a) how people decide whether they believe a conditional statement, (b) when they will assert conditional statements in everyday discourse and (c) the nature of the inferences they will draw from such statements. In a series of experimental studies we examine predictions of the theory with regard to all of these functions. In addition, we study individual differences in hypothetical thinking about conditional statements and their relation to measures of general intelligence. This involves the general claim that abstract hypothetical thinking is better developed in those of high IQ...|$|R
40|$|In engineering, we {{constantly}} {{need to make}} decisions: which {{design to}} select, which parameters to select for this design, etc. The traditional approach to decision making {{is based on the}} assumption that we know all possible consequences of each alternative, and we know the probability of each such consequence. Under this assumption, we can describe a rational decision-making process: to each possible consequence, we assign a numerical values called its utility, and we select the alternative for which the expected value of the utility is the largest. An important advantage of this approach is that it can be performed in real time: if after we made a decision, a new alternative appears, we do not need to repeat the whole analysis again: all we need to do is compare the new alternative with the previously selected ones. In the past, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> used the same procedures year after year, we accumulated a lot of data about the consequences of different decisions [...] based from which we could estimate the desired probabilities. Nowadays, with new technologies, new materials constantly emerging, we do not have such detailed information about the consequences of these new technologies. As a result, we often only have partial information about the corresponding probabilities. Different possible probability values result in different values of expected utility. Hence, for each alternative, instead of a single value of expected utility, we have a range (interval) of possible values. <b>We</b> need to <b>make</b> a <b>decision</b> under such interval uncertainty.

Recent studies in animals have probed the subjective aspects of the choice confidence using confidence-reporting tasks. These studies showed that estimates of the choice confidence substantially modulate neural activity in multiple regions of the brain. Building on these findings, we investigated the neural representation of the confidence in a choice in humans who explicitly reported the confidence in their choice. Subjects performed a perceptual decision task in which they decided between choosing a button press or a saccade while we recorded EEG activity. Following each choice, subjects indicated whether they were sure or unsure about the choice. We found that alpha activity strongly encodes a subject’s confidence level in a forthcoming button press choice. The neural effect of the subjects’ confidence was independent of the reaction time, of eye movement, and of activity of forearm muscles. Furthermore, the effect was not explained by the sensory input modeled by a decision variable. Neither could the effect be explained by a general cognitive state, such as arousal or reward expectation, because the effect was specifically observed during button press choices and not during saccade choices. The neural effect of the confidence in the ensuing button press choice was strong enough that we could predict, from independent single trial neural signals, whether a subject was going to be sure or unsure of its button press choice. In sum, alpha activity in human cortex provides a window into the degree of a forming commitment to make a hand movement...|$|R

That is why, ever since its beginnings, the advertising industry was admonished by social critics for taking materialism to the highest levels; to replace inner happiness and intrinsic motivation with the wish to be productive in society only to the extent of consuming and buying happiness. Therefore, over time, advertising and publicity have raised pros and cons; while some voices describe advertising as a motor of society, driving economic development, there are others that strongly criticise advertising creations, blaming it of manipulation. Conversely, reality proves that a number of other factors exercise a major influence on the customers: experience, price, traditions, age, fashion, religion, etc thus, the fight between advertising pros and cons has led to the emergence of theories regarding its efficiency.

Returning to a basic principle of political life, possibly as old as mankind but more clearly declared in forms of democratic organization, we cannot understand a democracy without the existence of an educated and informed citizenry, able to think for itself in confrontation with options and world conceptions different from its own. Intelligence - understood as the ability of people to develop abstract thinking and reasoning, to understand complex ideas, solve problems and overcome obstacles, learn from experience and adapt to the environment - is the most valuable attribute that we have. Reasoning well, therefore, is essential to all human beings, both in relation to their personal lives and in the relations we have living in society.

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThe main {{objective}} of this project is to analyses the factors that affect the cost and efficiency during the offshore 3 D seismic survey. Four parts will be discussed to support the {{main objective}} [...] the equipment, environment, decision making on the investment and human factors. These parts will analyze how those elements affect the cost and efficiency in 3 D seismic surveys and how to optimize these effects during production. The study focus on examples from South China Sea working area {{to back up the}} argument. The first part introduces the equipment, which as the executive element employed in almost all offshore activities we want them to run without problem as long as possible and to be as efficient as possible. So the problem with the equipment usually cause down time for long hours. The root causes are identified as below: lack of maintenance or lack of spare parts or lack the knowledge to handle it. If we have proper maintenance plan/strategy, the equipment would probably be in service for longer period before break down. As to the maintenance and spare parts for the equipment, we would elaborate within the field of equipment Operations and maintenance management. And condition monitoring and management would be probably used as well if necessary, such as Thermography, Vibration monitoring, Thermodynamic monitoring, Wear and oil monitoring, Nondestructive testing. As to the critical spare parts, the economic spare part will be discussed. Part two, the environment. In this chapter, mostly we would talk about the environment that affect the vessel efficiency, for example, the sea state, wind, typhoon, sea current etc. As ergonomics for human working condition is a critical factor, we would single this out in the human performance part which is part three. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> mentioned the weather in South China Sea, there always Typhoon during summer, the rough sea state cause the data we acquired very noisy and this kind of data may not be preferred and may need be acquired again, that would cost time and waste money, what’s worse is we should pick up streamers for the shelter to avoid the Typhoon, this would cost even more. This part will be supported by history statistic data of typhoon effect. The harsh weather in winter in BoHai bay or North Sea would not be included in the project although it affects seismic activity a lot. Part three, since the equipment investment will cost much, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>decision</b> for the new investment, we shall consider how could we use our limited money to get the most benefit.

40|$|Traditional {{theories}} of decision-making assume that utilities {{are based on}} the intrinsic value of outcomes; in turn, these values depend on associations between expected outcomes and the current motivational state of the decision-maker. This view disregards the fact that humans (and possibly other animals) have prospection abilities, which permit anticipating future mental processes and motivational and emotional states. For instance, we can evaluate future outcomes in light of the motivational state we expect to have when the outcome is collected, not (only) <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> a <b>decision.</b> Consequently, <b>we</b> can plan for the future and choose to store food to be consumed <b>when</b> <b>we</b> expect to be hungrier, not immediately. Furthermore, similarly to any expected outcome, we can assign a a value to our anticipated mental processes and emotions. It has been reported that (in some circumstances) human subjects prefer to receive an unavoidable punishment immediately, probably because they are anticipating the dread associated with the time spent waiting for the punishment. This article offers a formal framework to guide neuroeconomic research on how prospection affects decision-making. The model has two characteristics. First, it uses model-based Bayesian inference to describe anticipation of cognitive and motivational processes. Second, the utility maximization process considers these anticipations in two ways: to evaluate outcomes (e. g., the pleasure of eating a pie is evaluated differently {{at the beginning of a}} dinner, when one is hungry, and at the end of the dinner, when one is satiated), and as outcomes having a value themselves (e. g., the case of dread as a cost of waiting for punishment). By explicitly accounting for the relationship between prospection and value, our model provides a framework to reconcile the utility-maximization approach with psychological phenomena such as planning for the future and dread...|$|R

But what if we have too many alternatives to consider <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> a <b>decision?</b> In the present work we investigate how two aspects of a consumer decision, namely decision control and the number of alternatives, affect consumers. Two studies examine how consumers 2 ̆ 7 (a) decision control and (b) the number of alternatives affect consumers when they shop online. In Study 1 we find that the positive aspects of a decision (product attitude and purchase intention) can be enhanced by presenting consumers with control of the decision. In Study 2, we further explored how consumers can achieve more positive responses in a situation prompting potential choice overload. Two studies were held in a computer lab, where the participants could visit an online shopping mall website. The participants in study 1 had the goal of buying an MP 3 player and in study 2, a USB security memory stick. An artificial online shopping mall was used to control for the possible influence of specific brand name. We found that all negative measures of the decision, viz., regret, hesitation, and difficulty, were lower when an advertisement for the product was present during the decision and there were many alternatives to choose between. In addition to reducing negative reactions, the presence of an ad also bolstered positive aspects of the decision. Satisfaction, purchase intention, and attitude toward the product all increased in the presence of ad when there were many alternatives. Increased positive feelings were also associated with the presence of ad in the condition with few alternatives, but generally to a lesser degree. Evidently when an ad is present, consumers tend to unconsciously simplify their decision process, thus decreasing the negative reactions and enhancing the positive ones. There are managerial implications. First, from the marketer 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, it is important to ensure consumers have control. Second, although past research has studied how decision makers themselves invoke heuristics to simplify their decisions, the findings from the present work suggest a basis for how companies might install in consumers a proclivity to adopt a heuristic-based rather than a systematic approach to processing large quantities of product data. In order to improve this research, the following points should also be considered. First of all, the on-line purchase decisions conducted were only hypothetical in nature. Would shoppers respond the same way in a real purchase situation? Second, to fully understand when the presence of an ad would lead to heuristic processing, and when it would not needs more investigation.

Should we treat all animals the same despite context or is there room for treating animals differently when it comes to forming policies? To answer this question, I examined the moral responsibility we have towards animals, on three different levels. These levels are: -	The moral position of animals -	The moral responsibilities we have towards animals -	The specific considerations in specific contexts To determine where animals morally stand, I’ve reviewed the historical views of Descartes, Rousseau and Kant. The moral value we award animals can differ from them having only instumental value, to them having an inherent dignity. These positions are extremes on a scale, with a lot of possible positions in between them. The position in which animals have intrinsic value, is the current position in government policy. Equally important for the moral position of animals, is the way their interests are taken into account. There are different ethical theories that describe if and how, the interests of animals matter <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>decisions.</b> From these theories we can derive that the way we should treat animals, can differ depending on context. The moral responsibilities we have towards animals, is partially dependent on the moral position they hold. This tells us if we need to protect the interests of animals and why. To establish what kind of responsibility we have towards animals, it is essential to know what the intersts of animals are and how we can care for them. The concept of welfare is very important in this matter. With welfare clearly defined, it is possible to assess the quality of welfare of animals in different contexts. This way we can formulate specific ways to care for the welfare of animals in specific contexts. Difference in contexts also give rise to specific considerations. These considerations can be morally relevant to our moral responsibilities towards animals. To define what our duty of care is towards animals, different factors contribute. The way animals depend on humans, is very important when establishing a specific duty of care. Animals who live in the wild, don’t need a lot of specific care because they are not completely dependent on humans. The care for these animals should be given by not harming their environment. Animals who live as pets, need more specific care because they are unable to fulfill certain needs. Since humans created this environment, they are responsible for providing this specific care. Another important aspect of our interactions with animals, is the realtionship we can have with them. People can have a certain connection to their own pet that they don’t have with other animals. When we acknowledge the fact these relationships exist, we can examine the impact it has on moral responsibility. It is important to see the responsibilities that derive from a specific relationship, as extra responsibilities on top of the moral responsibilities we already have for all animals. This way some animals benefit from additional protection and care, without other animals being overlooked. After research on the three different levels, I can draw a conclusion on our moral responsibilities towards animals in different contexts. All animals have the same moral value and moral position. We have the same moral responsibilities against them, regardless the context. The way we practically carry out these responsibilities in different contexts however, can differ because of other morally relevant contributing factors. Based on this conclusion, we can define more specific regulations for the way we treat animals in different contexts...|$|E
