Its transistor count is identical to the P54C and, despite the newer process, it had an identical die area as well. The chip was connected to the package using <b>wire</b> <b>bonding,</b> which only allows connections along the edges of the chip. A smaller chip would have required a redesign of the package, as there is a limit on the length of the wires and the edges of the chip would be further away from the pads on the package. The solution was to keep the chip the same size, retain the existing pad-ring, and only reduce the size of the Pentium's logic circuitry to enable it to achieve higher clock frequencies.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{life time}} prediction of <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure {{in a power}} electronic module based on computational approach that integrates methods for high fidelity analysis, reduced order modelling, and life time prediction using reduced order model. This methodology is demonstrated {{for the design of}} a <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure in a power electronic module with aim of reducing the chance of failure due to the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> lift off in power electronic module when a random load is applied to the aluminium wire. In particular, <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> reliability of the power module related to the thermal fatigue material degradation of aluminium wire {{is one of the main}} concerns. In the power electronic module reliability, understanding the performance, reliability and robustness of <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> is a key factor for the future development and success of the power electronic module technology, because <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> lift off failure ignites other catastrophic failures. The main focus in this study is on the application of reduced order modelling techniques and the development of the associated models for fast evaluation and analysis. The discussion is on methods for approximate response surface modelling based on interpolation techniques using Kriging and radial basis functions. The reduced order modelling approach uses prediction data for the electro-thermo-mechanical behaviour of the power module wirebond design obtained through non-linear transient finite element simulations, in particular for the fatigue life-time of the aluminium wire attached to the silicon chip of the wire in the module. The reduced order models are used for the analysis of predicting the life time of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure under random load. One of the widely used cycle counting algorithm, so called rainflow counting algorithm is utilised to count the cycles of temperature profile at the a specific point of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> structure in a power electronic module.

These <b>wire</b> <b>bonds</b> are operated in strong magnetic field environments and if time-varying currents pass through them with frequencies close to their mechanical resonance frequency, strong resonant oscillations may occur. Under certain conditions, this effect can lead to fatigue stress and eventually breakage of <b>wire</b> <b>bonds.</b> Systematic {{studies have been conducted}} to analyse the effects of resonance vibration on <b>wire</b> <b>bonds.</b> In particular, the case of the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) detector, the new innermost layer of the ATLAS Pixel Detector, has been reviewed. An experimental set-up has been built to simulate as much as possible the operation conditions of IBL <b>wire</b> <b>bonds</b> in the ATLAS magnetic field. The results provide useful information for the comprehension of the IBL <b>wire</b> <b>bonds</b> behavior. The dangerous resonance frequencies have been identified experimentally for different <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> lengths. The resonance frequency amplitudes have been characterized in terms of several parameters, like wire length, wire orientation angle with respect to B-field and current amplitude. Several fatigue studies have been performed with simulations and laboratory tests. It has been demonstrated that in well-defined conditions, as for example with high currents, the wires can get irreparably damaged after few oscillation cycles and they can break. Two types of <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> protections have been considered: the classical encapsulation of the wire feet and the coating of the whole wire. The results reveal that these methods minimize the oscillation amplitude reducing the possibility of damaging or breaking the <b>wire</b> <b>bonds.</b> For the IBL detector a Fixed Frequency Trigger Veto has been implemented for excluding the potentially dangerous frequencies identified in these studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Noise {{induced by}} {{impedance}} discontinuities from VLSI pack-aging {{is one of}} the leading challenges facing system level designers in the next decade. The performance of IC cores far exceeds that of current packaging technology. The risetimes of IC signals require that the interconnect of the package be treated as transmission lines. As a result, impedance discon-tinuities in the package cause reflections which may result in intermittent switching of digital signals and edge time degradation, both of which limit system performance. The major cause of the impedance discontinuity in the package is the high inductance of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> interconnect. To compensate for this problem, capacitance can be placed near the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> to reduce its effective impedance over a given frequency range. This paper presents the application of this impedance matching technique for use in broadband digital signals that are prevalent in modern VLSI designs. Both static and dynamic compensation approaches are presented. The static compensator places pre-defined capacitances on the package and on the IC to surround the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> inductance. The dynamic compensator places a switchable capacitance on the IC that can be programmed to a desired value, thereby enabling the designer to overcome design and manufacturing variations in the <b>wire</b> <b>bond.</b> Both techniques presented are shown to bound the reflections of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> to less than 5 % (down from 20 % for an uncompensated structure) for <b>wire</b> <b>bonds</b> up to 5 mm in length, and for frequencies up to 3 GHz. In addition, both circuits utilizes less area than a typical <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> pad, making them ideal for placement directly beneath the <b>wire</b> <b>bond</b> pads. I...|$|R
