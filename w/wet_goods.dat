50|$|The bonding {{temperature}} {{needs to}} be high enough to reduce the viscosity of the glass material and ensures a <b>good</b> <b>wetting</b> of the bond surface, but also low enough to prevent overspreading of the glass frit material. The heating up over 410 °C enables the wetting of the bond surface. A <b>good</b> <b>wetting</b> is indicated by a low edge angle. The atomic wafer surface layers are fused into the glass at an atomic level. This forms a thin glass mixture at the interface which forms the strong bond between the glass and the wafer.|$|R

50|$|The {{industry}} has recognized {{that in many}} circumstances it may be impractical to design and build building assemblies which never get <b>wet.</b> <b>Good</b> design and practice involve controlling the wetting of building assemblies from both the exterior and interior. So, the use of vapor barrier {{should be taken into}} consideration. Their use has already been legislated within the building code of some countries (such as the U.S., Canada, Ireland, England, Scotland & Wales). How, where, and whether a vapor barrier (vapor diffusion retarder) should be used depends on the climate. Typically, the number of heating degree days (HDD) in an area is used to help make these determinations. A heating degree day is a unit that measures how often outdoor daily dry-bulb temperatures fall below an assumed base, normally 18°C (65°F). For building in most parts of North America, where winter heating conditions predominate, vapor barrier are placed toward the interior, heated side of insulation in the assembly. In humid regions where warm-weather cooling predominates within buildings, the vapor barrier should be located toward the exterior side of insulation. In relatively mild or balanced climates, or where assemblies are designed to minimize condensation conditions, a vapor barrier may not be necessary at all.|$|R
