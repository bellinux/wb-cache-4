5|$|Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville {{to use a}} {{designated}} hitter (DH) in their lineups. However, this allowance was later revoked, as the Reds {{were a part of}} the National League which did not use a DH. Larry Schmittou issued an ultimatum: if Cincinnati would not let the Sounds use a DH in their lineups, they would not renew their contract and <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a new major league affiliate. The Reds did not budge on their decision to prohibit the designated hitter, so the Sounds looked for a new affiliate after 1979. Schmittou was then approached by five or six clubs looking to enter the Southern League as a Sounds affiliate.|$|E

25|$|When {{initially}} questioned for {{ten hours}} by the police, Shepherd {{refused to discuss}} Stewart's disappearance. Afterwards, he spoke with an activist named Quanell X, whom officers credit with helping to obtain a confession. Quanell informed Shepherd that the police <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> incriminating forensic evidence if he was involved. Shepherd started crying as the two spoke and later led the activist and a detective to a trash can where he stated he left the body. When no {{body was found in}} the trash container, Shepherd confessed to the murder. However, investigators did discover Stewart's teeth in the disposal.|$|E

25|$|Sigismund {{was officially}} deposed from {{the throne of}} Sweden by a Riksdag held in Stockholm on 24 July 1599. He was given six months to say whether he wanted to send his son, Prince Władysław Vasa, to Sweden as his successor, under the {{condition}} that the boy would be brought up in the Evangelical faith. Otherwise the Estates <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a new king. In February 1600, Duke Charles summoned the Estates of the Realm to Linköping. Since Sigismund had not provided a reply, the Estates elected Duke Charles as King Charles IX of Sweden. The consequences for those who had supported Sigismund were devastating. The most prominent among them were killed by the new King in the Linköping Bloodbath. During the winter and spring of 1600, Charles also occupied the Swedish part of Estonia, as the castle commanders had shown sympathies towards Sigismund. Charles' invasion of Livonia led to a series of wars with Poland, starting with the Second Polish–Swedish War. Charles accepted the crown as Charles IX in 1604.|$|E
500|$|In the past, the Humanitarian Bowl usually {{selected}} the WAC championship team. However, Boise State was {{not content to}} play a middle-grade ACC team after negotiations with Ball State failed. The WAC commissioner said that the Broncos <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> another match-up that had [...] "the same type of sizzle" [...] as a match-up against Ball State. The Idaho Statesman added that [...] "The Terrapins don't 'sizzle.'" [...] Boise State traveled to the Poinsettia Bowl, where they faced 11th-ranked TCU, which had lost only to the BCS-bound Oklahoma and Utah teams.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most French {{armies of}} the Revolutionary period, Moreau's troops in late 1800 enjoyed a well-organized supply service. Though {{the onset of}} winter {{lengthened}} the army sick list, the months-long truce allowed many units to approach their full strength. Many French officers were confident of success. [...] Moreau planned a broad-front advance eastward to the Inn, fighting any enemies as he found them. He would lead with his left to allow Lecourbe's Right Wing to advance unmolested, since it had a greater distance to cover. Once the French wings closed up to the Inn River, his troops <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> crossing sites.|$|E

It was also called [...] "The Iron Crowbar", [...] "a hole sucking air", [...] "The Hog" [...] ("The Groundhog"), and [...] "The World's Fastest Tricycle", [...] "Ground Loving Whore" [...] as a {{testament}} to its long takeoff rolls. F-84 lore stated that all aircraft were equipped with a [...] "sniffer" [...] device that, upon passing V2, <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the dirt {{at the end of}} the runway. As soon as the device could smell the dirt, the controls would turn on and let the pilot fly off the ground. In the same vein, it was suggested a bag of dirt should be carried in the front landing gear well. Upon reaching V2, the pilot would dump the dirt under the wheels, fooling the sniffer device.|$|E
500|$|Certification {{having been}} declined, the Fourth Circuit, again en banc, held 4-2 {{that the statute}} of {{limitations}} did not bar the tribe's claim, finding that there was a presumption of possession within the 10 year limitations period. [...] In other words, the court held that the Catawba's claim would only be time-barred as to defendants who were able to demonstrate adverse possession, without tacking except by inheritance. [...] Thus, the court <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> a continuous ten-year period of possession for each defendant land-owner for the period between July 12, 1962 (the date of termination) and October 28, 1980 (the filing of the complaint). [...] Further, the court rejected the defendant's other affirmative defense that the claim was not recorded in South Carolina's Registry of Mesne Conveyances and challenge to the jurisdiction of the court. [...] The U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari after this ruling.|$|E
500|$|Ballard {{realized}} that {{looking for the}} wreck itself using sonar was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic, drawing {{on the experience of}} the surveys of Thresher and Scorpion; he <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> the debris field instead, using Argos cameras rather than sonar. Whereas sonar could not distinguish man-made debris on the sea bed from natural objects, cameras could. The debris field would also be a far bigger target, stretching a mile (1.6km) or longer, whereas Titanic itself was only [...] wide. The search required round-the-clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed, with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris. After a week of fruitless searching, at 12.48am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorrs screens. One of them was identified as a boiler, identical to those shown in pictures from 1911. The following day, {{the main part of the}} wreck was found and Argo sent back the first pictures of Titanic since her sinking 73 years before. The discovery made headlines around the world.|$|E

500|$|A shot where Lester and Ricky share a {{cannabis}} joint {{behind a}} building {{came from a}} misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters <b>would</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light {{from the top of}} the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot [...] "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene". Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move to the couch, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.|$|E
