25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a remote-control of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E

500|$|Historically, {{the press}} had enjoyed {{considerable}} prestige and respect to that point, though some Republicans complained of bias. But in his Des Moines speech, Agnew attacked the media, complaining that immediately after Nixon's speech, [...] "his words and policies {{were subjected to}} instant analysis and querulous criticism... by {{a small band of}} network commentators and self-appointed analysts, the majority of whom expressed {{in one way or another}} their hostility to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say...</b> It was obvious that their minds were made up in advance." [...] Agnew continued, [...] "I am asking whether a form of censorship already exists when the news that forty million Americans receive each night is determined by a handful of men... and filtered through a handful of commentators who admit their own set of biases".|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{literary}} theorists have approached the Devotions as politically themed. Richard Strier, in particular, identifies the Devotions as an [...] "Arminian polemic", {{arguing that it}} was highly atypical of Donne to actually publish works, rather than merely let them circulate amongst friends. Both before and after ordination, Donne actively resisted publication, normally only publishing works {{that had been the}} result of a commission, such as The Anniversaries or Pseudo-Martyr. The Devotions, however, were [...] "literally rushed" [...] into print, with the volume being handed to the printers a month after he had recovered from his disease. Strier argues that Donne's rationale for publishing the Devotions matches his rationale for publishing a sermon, the Encaenia, the same year, to assert the importance of [...] "places, and of dayes, and of all outward meanes", because he felt some sense of urgency about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> This is coupled with Devotion XVI, in which Donne explicitly comes out against Puritanism and is simultaneously [...] "purposely militant", deliberately frustrating the other extreme from Puritanism, where [...] "the Arminianism and the polemical anti-puritanism of the volume becomes explicit".|$|E
500|$|Biographers {{describe}} Rutherford as {{tall and}} solidly built with a senatorial demeanor, {{and a strong}} booming voice that helped make him a powerful orator. In 1917, The New York Times stated that Rutherford [...] "has a reputation as an eloquent, forceful speaker". Watch Tower Society literature states that his personality contrasted strongly with that of his predecessor. One Witness history book says that while Russell was kind, warm and tactful, Rutherford [...] "was warm and generous toward his associates {{but he was also}} a brusque and direct type of person, and his legal background and experiences in early life gave him a directness in his approach to problems in dealing with his brothers that caused some to take offense." [...] Another Watch Tower Society account says he did not hide his feelings, adding, [...] "His bluntness, even when spoken in kindness, was sometimes misunderstood." [...] Fellow Watch Tower Society director A. H. Macmillan says Rutherford [...] "spoke as simply and directly to the people as he knew how, and he was an extremely forthright man. He was thoroughly convinced that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> was the truth and that {{it was a matter of}} life and death." [...] Macmillan added, [...] "He would never tolerate anything that would be contrary to what he clearly understood the Bible to teach. He was so strict about that, he would permit nothing that would seem to show a compromise when it came to an issue of the truth." [...] Author Tony Wills describes him as charitable and generous, and says his sympathy for the poor and oppressed was exceeded only by his hatred for the rich, the oppressors. Wills also notes that he was a dynamic, impatient extrovert. Other authors also address Rutherford's abrasiveness: James Penton describes him as blunt and moody with an explosive temper, with [...] "a streak of self-righteousness which caused him to regard anyone who opposed him as of the Devil", while Alan Rogerson notes that he was a [...] "dogmatic and insensitive person, obsessed with his own self-importance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Francesco Balilla Pratella {{joined the}} Futurist {{movement}} in 1910 {{and wrote a}} Manifesto of Futurist Musicians in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the [...] "sublime genius" [...] of Wagner and saw some value {{in the work of}} other contemporary composers, for example Richard Strauss, Elgar, Mussorgsky, and Sibelius. By contrast, the Italian symphony was dominated by opera in an [...] "absurd and anti-musical form". The conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the [...] "rickety and vulgar" [...] operas of Puccini and Umberto Giordano. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher Pietro Mascagni, because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled [...] "the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice." ...|$|E
2500|$|American Horse {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} advocates of education for the Indian, and his son Samuel and nephew Robert were among the first students at Carlisle. While recruiting at Pine Ridge, Captain Richard Henry Pratt met heavy opposition from Red Cloud who was distrustful of white education, and who had no school age children. [...] But Pratt couldn’t help noticing that American Horse “took a lively interest” in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> [...] American Horse had grown into an influential tribal politician and was the head of a large household with two wives and at least ten children. [...] He had become a sophisticated man who adroitly negotiated his way between the traditional Lakota society and the new white society encircling him. He had become a shrewd politician and his friendliness with whites was a calculation to win concessions for himself and his people. [...] Above all, American Horse prided himself in his sagacity, [...] It was glaring apparent to him that his offspring would have to deal with whites, and perhaps even live with them, whether they liked it or not. American Horse agreed to send two sons and a daughter for first class: Ben American Horse, Samuel American Horse and Maggie Stands Looking. Charles A.

2500|$|Unlike many {{of their}} contemporaries, Vicky and Frederick {{rejected}} antisemitism. In a letter to her mother, the Crown Princess harshly criticised the essay Das Judenthum in der Musik (Judaism in Music) by Richard Wagner, whom she considered ridiculous and unfair. As for Frederick, he {{did not hesitate to}} make public appearances in synagogues when manifestations began of hatred against the Jews in Germany, especially in the early 1880s. In 1880-1881, there was a campaign waged by the Völkisch movement to disemancipate German Jews, led by the Lutheran Pastor Adolf Stoecker and the historian Heinrich von Treitschke, leading to a quarter of million Germans signing a petition asking the government to ban all Jewish immigration, forbid Jews from holding public office, to work as teachers and from attending universities, which was a mere prelude to their ultimate goal of the völkisch activists of stripping Jews of their German citizenship. Both Stoecker and Treitschke were very popular and well respected men in Germany, and their anti-Semitic campaign attracted much support from the Prussian Army officer corps, university students and the court, but the Crown Princess was fearless in attacking the anti-Semitic leaders, writing that [...] "Treitschke and his supporters are lunatics of the most dangerous sort". In another letter, Victoria suggested that Stoecker and his followers belonged in a lunatic asylum, since so much of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> reflected an unbalanced mind. In yet another letter, the Crown Princess wrote she had become ashamed of her adopted country as Stoecker and Treitschke [...] "behave so hatefully towards people of a different faith and another race who have become an integral part (and by no means the worst) of our nation!". Victoria and her husband, the latter wearing the uniform of a Prussian field marshal, attended a synagogue service in Berlin in 1880 to show support for the German Jews threatened by what Victoria called Treitschke's [...] "disgraceful" [...] attacks. In 1881, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess attended a synagogue service in Wiesbaden [...] "to demonstrate as clearly as we can what our convictions are" [...] just as the Reichstag was beginning to debate the issue of Jewish disemancipation. The Crown Princess's mother, Queen Victoria was proud of her daughter and son-in-law's efforts to stop the völkisch campaign, writing to Frederick to say she was happy that her daughter had married a man like him, who was prepared to stand up for the rights of the Jews. In both the Kronprinzenpalais and Neues Palais in Potsdam, the Crown Princely couple received many commoners, including some Jewish personalities, which inevitably led to the disapproval of the Emperor and the court. Among their guests were the physicians Hermann von Helmholtz and Rudolf Virchow, the philosopher Eduard Zeller and the historian Hans Delbrück. The reactionary and anti-Semitic Field Marshal Alfred von Waldersee felt so threatened by the prospect of Frederick becoming Emperor and Victoria Empress that he planned, were Frederick to ascend to the throne, to have the military stage a coup d'état in favor of his son Prince Wilhelm; to have Victoria expelled back to Britain and to have her executed if she ever returned to Germany; to end universal manhood suffrage for the Reichstag; and to have Germany launch a war to [...] "take out" [...] France, Austria and Russia (the fact that the Germany was allied to the last two did not matter to Waldersee). Only the fact that Frederick was already dying of cancer when he become Emperor in 1888 kept Waldersee from going ahead with his plans for a putsch.|$|E
