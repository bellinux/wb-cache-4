Each section has two ranks of natural wooden benches and its own thick wooden door.

25|$|The English {{music critic}} John Steane, {{reviewing}} Simon Keenlyside's performance of this aria, wrote:Coming after the grave-diggers' scene, it is a tender yet bitterly repentant elegy on Ophelia's death. The soliloquy has no counterpart in Shakespeare and {{brings out the}} best in both Thomas and Keenlyside. From the composer it draws on the graceful French lyricism <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tenor solos in Mignon, adding a more complex responsiveness to the opera-Hamlet's simpler nature. For the singer, it provides an opportunity to use the refinement of his art yet rise to phrases, high in the voice, where he can expand the riches of his tones and the most heartfelt of his feelings.|$|E
500|$|The {{protective}} sign of {{the hammer}} was worn by women, as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that it has}} been found in women's graves. It seems to have been used by the warrior also, {{in the form of the}} swastika. [...] Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.|$|E

2500|$|Shakespeare’s Christianity is {{in itself}} not universally accepted. William Birch of Oxford University was, in 1848, {{probably}} the first to suggest that Shakespeare could be an atheist, based on his interpretation of sentiments expressed in the works. His theory wasn't accepted by other scholars, however, and his contemporary H. H. Furness dismissed it as a [...] "rare tissue of perverted ingenuity". Some evidence used to support this thesis was suggested by a notorious forger of historical documents, John Payne Collier, who examined the records of St Saviour's, Southwark, and found that Shakespeare, alone among his fellow Globe actors, was not shown as a churchgoer. Joseph Pearce again offers the explanation of recusancy, rather than evidence of atheism. Herbert Thurston, writing in the 1912 edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia questioned not only Shakespeare's Catholicism, but pondered [...] "whether Shakespeare was not infected with the atheism, which, as <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> testimony of writers as opposite in spirit as Thomas Nashe and [...] Persons, was rampant in the more cultured society of the Elizabethan age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hausdorff's {{entry into}} a {{thorough}} study of ordered sets was prompted {{in part by}} Cantor's continuum problem: which place does the cardinal number [...] take in the series [...] In a letter to Hilbert on 29 September 1904, he speaks of this problem, [...] "it has plagued almost like a monomania". He saw in the set [...] a new strategy to attack the problem. Cantor had suspected , but had only shown [...] [...] is the [...] "number" [...] of possible well-orderings of a countable set [...] had now emerged as the [...] "number" [...] of all possible orders of such an amount. It was natural, therefore, to study systems that are more special than general orders, but more general than well-orderings. Hausdorff did just that in his first volume of 1901 {{with the publication of}} theoretical studies of [...] "graded sets". <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> results of Kurt Gödel and Paul Cohen, that this strategy to solve the continuum problem is just as ineffectual as Cantor's strategy, which was aimed at generalizing the Cantor-Bendixson principle for closed sets to general uncountable sets.|$|E
2500|$|Kant {{thinks that}} all of our actions, whether {{motivated}} by inclination or morality, must follow some law. For example, if a person wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will have to follow a law that tells him to practice his backhand pass, among other things. Notice, however, that this law is only binding on the person who wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee. In this way, it is contingent upon the ends that he sets and the circumstances that he is in. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> third proposition, however, that the moral law must bind universally and necessarily, that is, regardless of ends and circumstances. [...] At this point, Kant asks, ‘what kind of law can that be, the representation of which must determine the will, even without regard for the effect expected from it...?’ (4:402) He concludes that the only remaining alternative is a law that reflects only the form of law itself, namely that of universality. [...] Thus, Kant arrives at his well-known categorical imperative, the moral law referenced in the above discussion of duty. Kant defines the categorical imperative as the following: “I ought never to act except {{in such a way that}} I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.” (4:402) ...|$|E

60|$|During {{three years}} of the Revolution the American army, under General Washington, wintered in New Jersey.
