Now a day, it {{has been a}} way of presenting various intravenous additives and diagnostic agents in X-ray examinations. Various substances can be used as emulsifying agent, which can be operationally defined as a stabilizer of the droplets formed of the internal phase. Materials and Methods: Gum from Moringa oleifera was evaluated for its emulsifying properties. Castor oil emulsions 30 percent (o/w), containing 2 to 4 % Moringa oleifera gum was prepared. Emulsions containing equivalent concentration of acacia were also prepared for comparison. All the emulsions prepared were stored at room temperature and studied for stability at various time intervals for 8 weeks. The prepared emulsions were evaluated for creaming rate, globule size and rate of coalescence. 23 factorial design was chosen to investigate the effects of centrifugation, pH, temperature changes and electrolytes on the creaming rate and globule size. Results: The results of the investigations show that the gum of Moringa oleifera possesses better emulsifying properties as compared to gum acacia.

Particles of all the TiO 2 samples had a globular shape of diameter between 10 and 30 μm. When compared to the corresponding technical-grade samples, the optically pure anatase and rutile demonstrated higher photocatalytic activity {{in the destruction of}} tetradecylpyridinium chloride, Methylene Blue and tetrachlorofluorescein as well as in reduction of Cr 2 O 7, MnO 4, [Fe(CN) 6] 3 − and [Fe(CN) 6] 4 −.

Due to the high xylan content in wheat straw, fermentation of both xylose and glucose is crucial to meet desired overall yields of ethanol. In the present work a recombinant xylose fermenting strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TMB 3400, cultivated aerobically on wheat straw hydrolysate, was used in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of steam pretreated wheat straw. The influence of fermentation strategy and temperature was studied in relation to xylose consumption, ethanol formation and by-product formation. In addition, model SSF experiments were made to further investigate the influence of temperature on xylose fermentation and by-product formation. In particular for SSF at the highest value of fibre content tested (9 % <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance,</b> WIS), it was found that a fed-batch strategy was clearly superior to the batch process in terms of ethanol yield, where the fed-batch gave 71 % of the theoretical yield (based on all available sugars) in comparison to merely 59 % for the batch. Higher ethanol yields, close to 80 %, were obtained at a WIS-content of 7 %. Xylose fermentation significantly contributed to the overall ethanol yields. The choice of temperature in the range 30 - 37 degrees C was found to be important, especially at higher contents of <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> solids (WIS).

A slight modification of the Hibbert's ethanolysis procedure was used. The monomeric compounds present in the reaction products were then examined. Two fractions of ethyl ether soluble oil were obtained from both bark and wood samples, which were mixtures of monomeric compounds produced by the ethanolysis reaction. One, which was designated "PE" fraction, was obtained by an ether extraction of a tar-like <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> of the ethanolysis products, {{and the other one}} designated "LE" fraction was obtained by the ether extraction of a water solution of the water soluble ethanolysis product. Two dimensional paper partition chromatography of these ether soluble oils demonstrated the presence of 12 compounds in the bark "PE" fraction, four compounds in the bark "LE" fraction and nine compounds in the wood "LE" fraction. The wood "PE" fraction gave the same chromatogram as the wood "LE". In the wood "LE", the typical Hibbert's monomers, 1 -ethoxy- 1 -guaiacyl- 2 -propanone, 2 -ethoxy- 1 -guaiacyl-lpropanone, guaiacyl-acetone, vanilloyl-acetyle, vanillin, and vanillic acid were identified. Ethyl ferulate was isolated from the bark "PE", which was the only C₆-C₃, phenyl propane type compound obtained from the ethanolysis of the bark fines sample. Ethyl protocatechuate, protocatechuic acid, and vanillic acid were isolated from the bark "PE" and "LE". Ethyl vanillate was isolated from the bark "LE".

40|$|High-molecular-weight {{suspended}} {{organic matter}} {{of soil and}} aquatic origins competes with water for the dissolution of relatively <b>water</b> <b>insoluble</b> organic <b>substances.</b> The same happens with microalgae and other organisms present in natural waters. Several pheromones, which play a specific role in the reproductive cycle of fish, are secreted to the water and are generally, if not always, molecules with hydrophobic or amphiphilic characteristics. The natural tendency of these pheromones to dissolve in suspended or deposited organic matter may cause their signaling function to be adversely affected. In this work we study the partition constants between water and organic reservoirs in suspension, Kh, of two fish pheromones, 4 -pregnene- 17 alpha, 20 β-diol- 3 -one (17, 20 β-P) and prostaglandin F 2 α (PGF 2 α), and also of 4 -pregnene- 11 β, 21 -diol- 3, 20 -dione 21 -sulfate (21 -P-sulfate), used {{as a proxy for}} sulfated steroid pheromones.

40|$|Aerosols affect {{precipitation}} by modifying cloud properties such as {{cloud droplet}} number concentration (CDNQ. Aerosol effects on CDNC depend on aerosol properties such as number concentration, size spectrum, and chemical composition. This study {{focuses on the}} effects of aerosol chemical composition on CDNC and, thereby, precipitation in a mesoscale cloud ensemble (MCE) driven by deep convective clouds. The NICE was observed during the 1997 department of energy's Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) summer experiment. Double-moment microphysics with explicit nucleation parameterization, able to take into account those three properties of aerosols, is used to investigate the effects of aerosol chemical composition on CDNC and precipitation. The effects of aerosol chemical compositions are investigated for both soluble and <b>insoluble</b> <b>substances</b> in aerosol particles. The effects of soluble substances are examined by varying mass fractions of two representative soluble components of aerosols in the continental air mass: sulfate and organics. The increase in organics with decreasing sulfate lowers critical supersaturation (S,) and leads to higher CDNC. Higher CDNC results in smaller autoconversion of cloud liquid to rain. This provides more abundant cloud liquid as a source of evaporative cooling, leading to more intense downdrafts, low-level convergence, and updrafts. The resultant stronger updrafts produce more condensation and thus precipitation, as compared to the case of 100 % sulfate aerosols. The conventional assumption of sulfate aerosol as a surrogate for the whole aerosol mass can be inapplicable for the case with the strong sources of organics. The less precipitation is simulated when an <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> replaces organics as compared to when it replaces sulfate. When the effects of organics on the surface tension of droplet and solution term in the Kohler curve are deactivated by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance,</b> S, is raised more than when the effects of sulfate on the solution term are deactivated by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance.</b> This leads to lower CDNC and, thus, larger autoconversion of cloud liquid to rain, providing less abundant cloud liquid as a source of evaporative cooling. The resultant less evaporative cooling produces less intense downdrafts, weaker low-level convergence, updrafts, condensation and, thereby, less precipitation in the case where organics is replaced by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance</b> than in the case where sulfate is replaced by the <b>insoluble</b> <b>substance.</b> The variation of precipitation caused by the change in the mass fraction between the soluble and <b>insoluble</b> <b>substances</b> is larger than that caused by the change in the mass fraction between the soluble substances.

The mixing state of the particles was probed using the AMS data and images from the TEM. Both of these probes suggest that the particles were internally mixed. Water uptake by the mixed particles was then probed at 273 K. It was found that for ammonium sulfate containing ~ 20 &nbsp;wt% palmitic acid the deliquescence relative humidity (DRH) was the same as for pure ammonium sulfate (80 &plusmn; 3 %&nbsp;RH). For particles with ~ 50 &nbsp;wt% palmitic acid however, the mixed particles began to take up water at relative humidities as low at 69 % and continued to slowly take up water to 85 %&nbsp;RH without fully deliquescing. In addition to studies of water uptake, water loss was also investigated. Here coatings of up to 50 &nbsp;wt% had no impact on the efflorescence relative humidity. These studies suggest that even if <b>insoluble</b> <b>substances</b> coat salt particles in the atmosphere, there may be relatively little effect on the resulting water uptake and loss...|$|R
