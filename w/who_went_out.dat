5|$|Ganesha was {{particularly}} worshipped by traders and merchants, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of India for commercial ventures. From approximately the 10th century onwards, new networks of exchange developed including {{the formation of}} trade guilds and a resurgence of money circulation. During this time, Ganesha became the principal deity associated with traders. The earliest inscription invoking Ganesha before any other deity {{is associated with the}} merchant community.|$|E
5|$|Pollack {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' experiences. For example, in 2007 the WSOP flattened its award structure. The cash awards were distributed more evenly so that people <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> earlier earned more money, while those who made it to the final table won less.|$|E
5|$|In 1902 {{the club}} {{required}} a larger ground {{and moved to}} Edgeley Park, then home of the rugby league club Stockport, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of business three years later. Green Lane was retained {{for use by the}} club's reserve team, and one further first team game was played at the ground on 18 April 1903 when Edgeley Park was being used by the rugby club. The site was later used for housing. Stockport County have played home games at Edgeley Park {{since the start of the}} 1902–03 season, celebrating the centenary in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Clemson {{returned}} Georgia Tech's kickoff to its 43-yard line, {{but despite}} the good field position, Clemson was unable to take advantage. On the first play of the drive, Clemson quarterback Parker threw an interception to Georgia Tech defender Dominique Reese, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of bounds at the Tech 45-yard line. Georgia Tech's offense returned to the field at that point and began driving down the field. In two plays, Tech passed the 50-yard line. In six more, it penetrated the Clemson 10-yard line. Once there, however, the Yellow Jackets' drive stalled. Three consecutive penalties against Georgia Tech pushed the Yellow Jackets back 20 yards, and Tech was unable to score a touchdown or gain a first down after that setback. Kicker Blair again returned to the field and scored a 49-yard field goal. With 5:35 remaining in the first half, Georgia Tech extended its lead to 13–7.|$|E
5|$|Dickinson {{remained}} in the band for another year, recording two studio albums with them—Head On and Shock Tactics. However, Samson soon ran into difficulties with their record label, Gem, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of business and failed to finance their European tour in support of Iron Maiden. The band were turned over to RCA, which began neglecting the group, and so they promptly fired their management team and the resulting injunction meant that their equipment was reclaimed and {{they could not be}} paid for their concert performances. The band's last gig was at Reading Festival, after which Dickinson was approached by Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, who asked him to audition to be their new lead vocalist.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} diurnal, and forage {{on the ground}} or onto low {{vegetation}} in search of food, but a few are nocturnal and only forage at night. Most Myrmecia ants are active during the warmer months, and are dormant during winter. However, M. pyriformis is a nocturnal species that is active throughout the whole year. M. pyriformis also has a unique foraging schedule; 65% of individuals <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to forage left the nest in 40–60 minutes, while 60% of workers would return to the nest in the same duration of time at dusk. Foraging workers rely on landmarks for navigation back home. If displaced a short distance, they will scan their surroundings, and then rapidly move {{in the direction of the}} nest. M. vindex ants carry dead nest-mates out of their nests and place them on refuse piles, a behaviour known as necrophoresis.|$|E

5|$|The legendary saga Yngvars saga víðförla {{describes}} the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly {{connected with the}} Georgian-Byzantine Battle of Sasireti in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from Sweden by Ingvar the Far-Travelled, who went down the Volga into {{the land of the}} Saracens (Serkland in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six Ingvar Runestones, twenty-three of them being in the Lake Mälaren region of Uppland in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar's brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the Baltic and Caspian seas.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of British newspapers on creating {{the public perception}} of mods as having a leisure-filled club-going lifestyle {{can be seen in}} a 1964 article in the Sunday Times. The paper interviewed a 17-year-old mod <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> clubbing seven nights a week and spent Saturday afternoons shopping for clothes and records. However, few British teens and young adults would have had the time and money to spend this much time going to nightclubs. Paul Jobling and David Crowley argue that most young mods worked 9 to 5 at semi-skilled jobs, which meant that they had much less leisure time and only a modest income to spend during their time off.|$|E
25|$|The morning {{session of}} Saturday {{brought with it}} sunny skies, but also a light drizzle {{at the start of}} the session. This forced teams <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> early to use their wet tires, but what little water was on the track dried up quickly enough to have no effect on any racer on dry tires. Räikkönen was the {{consistent}} pace-setter and topped the chart with a 1:26.064. Fisichella pushed his Renault to second with a time of 1:26.454. Rookie Lewis Hamilton came third over his team mate, the double and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso who came in at seventh. The slowest team of 2006, Super Aguri, got into the top ten with fourth and tenth for Anthony Davidson and Takuma Sato, respectively. Felipe Massa and Nick Heidfeld completed the top six.|$|E

25|$|After 25 {{years from}} the {{introduction}} of the first-generation Range Rover, the second-generation Range Rover—model-designation P38A—was introduced for the 1995 model year, with an updated version of the Rover V8 engine. There was also the option of a 2.5-litre BMW six-cylinder turbo-diesel with a Bosch injection pump. This was the first diesel injection with electronic controls in a Land Rover, before common rails were introduced. This was a result of BMW's subsequent ownership of Rover Group and hence the Land Rover brand. The new model offered more equipment and premium trims, positioning the vehicle above the Land Rover Discovery to face the increased competition in the SUV marketplace. This model was the last to feature the Rover V8 and interior leather supplied by Connolly <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of business in 2002. It was the first model to feature Satellite Navigation as an option.|$|E
25|$|On June 5, the Beijing {{population}} {{prepared to}} welcome {{those who had}} defeated Li Zicheng. The elders and officials <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of the city expecting to greet Wu Sangui and the Ming heir apparent were shocked when {{the leader of the}} victorious army turned out to be Prince Regent Dorgon of the Qing. Dorgon and his retinue rode to Donghua Gate (東華門), an eastern gate to the Forbidden City, to receive the imperial regalia; Dorgon was then escorted to Wuying Palace by the former Ming imperial bodyguards, who had previously submitted to Li Zicheng but now vowed to serve the Qing. Dorgon welcomed the Shunzhi Emperor to Beijing on October 19. The young monarch was officially enthroned as Emperor of China on November 8, 1644, marking the moment when the Qing seized the Mandate of Heaven.|$|E
500|$|During {{these few}} years at Riebeek West Jan worked assiduously at his studies — self-evidently, given his achievements. His {{academic}} abilities were soon noted by his headmaster, <b>who</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{of his way}} to provide Jan with further curricular reading. Yet this was to prove insufficient to meet what was becoming an almost insatiable thirst for knowledge. Jan borrowed books and yet more books from the headmaster, poring over them at all times rather than engaging in the childish pursuits of the other children, separated from them by his strong work ethic. A few weeks before the School Higher examination this had its consequences — Jan fell ill, an illness exacerbated by his unremitting study. With a strict injunction from his doctor, ordering a complete rest with an absolute prohibition on work and reading, Jan was packed off to bed. Nevertheless, despite the doctor's orders, Jan went to strenuous lengths to evade the ban. One story told of him during this enforced convalescence describes how he used to involve the headmaster's youngest son in his subterfuges, bribing the four-year-old child to bring him books from his father's study. This enjoyed considerable success until the day of an unannounced visit from the headmaster's wife. In his sparsely furnished room there were few possibilities, but Jan made the best job that he could of concealing his by now substantial collection of books. The headmaster's wife upon entering the room found Jan, as expected, in bed. However the boy did not look to be comfortably resting as he ought, in fact he looked positively uncomfortable. She offered to make Jan's bed for him, he declined, insisting that he was perfectly comfortable; she insisted and, being the headmaster's wife, got her way. Embarking upon her deed of kindness she found, to her astonishment, the real reason for Jan's restlessness — underneath his bedclothes he was making a valiant effort to conceal an immense pile of contraband books! ...|$|E
