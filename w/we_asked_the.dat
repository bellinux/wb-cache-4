Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 18, Rowley {{addressed}} Bolden's {{allegations in}} testimony {{provided to the}} Warren Commission. Rowley explained that Bolden was selected to rotate through the White House detail for 30 days {{in the summer of}} 1961 as part of an orientation program, and that Bolden's allegations referred to a 5-day span in Hyannis Port. When J. Lee Rankin, general counsel for the Warren Commission, asked him when he received Bolden's complaint, Rowley replied: [...] "The fact is he never informed me. He never informed any of his supervisors or anyone on the detail." [...] Rankin then interrupted his questioning of Rowley to state: [...] "I think the record should show, Mr. Chairman, that we were never advised that he wanted to testify, nor had we any inquiry or anything about the matter, until after we learned about it in the newspapers. And, even then, he didn't ask to testify. And <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> FBI to check into it, and he had counsel and they refused to tell anything about the matter at that time." [...] Rowley later stated that there was [...] "no truth to the charges of misconduct". He added that Bolden had leveled eleven charges and that there was partial truth to one of the charges (that the agents had purchased two or three cases of beer which were available to agents coming off duty), but that his investigation found that there were no violations of Secret Service regulations. In response to Rankin's questioning, Rowley answered that Bolden's indictment {{was the first time he}} could recall that a criminal complaint was lodged against a Secret Service agent.|$|E

60|$|At this moment, {{one of our}} {{servants}} came {{to inform}} me that a dinner which had been preparing for us at the farmhouse was ready; <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> stranger to do us the honour to partake of our repast; he assented, and the following conversation took place at table.|$|E
60|$|After {{learning}} how to get into bed, the writer of the present narrative tried his hand at the composition of whisky punch, and succeeded in imparting satisfaction to his intemperate fellow-creatures. When the punch and the pipes accompanying {{it had come to}} an end, a pilot-boat anchored alongside of us for the night. Once embarked on our own element, we old sea-dogs are, after all, a polite race of men. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> pilot where he had come from--and he asked us. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> pilot where he was bound to, to-morrow morning--and he asked us. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> pilot whether he would like a drop of rum--and the pilot, to encourage us, said Yes. After that, there was a little pause; and then the pilot asked us, whether we would come on board his boat--and we, to encourage the pilot, said Yes, and did go, and came back, and asked the pilot whether he would come on board our boat--and he said Yes, and did come on board, and drank another drop of rum. Thus in the practice of the social virtues did we while away the hours--six jolly tars in a twelve-foot cabin--till it was past eleven o'clock, and time, as we say at sea, to tumble in, or tumble out, as the case may be, when a jolly tar wants practice in the art of getting into his hammock.|$|E

60|$|That {{was the end}} of that party. I {{never saw}} a party break up so quietly, and with so little fuss. We never said good-night even to one another. We came downstairs one at a time, walking softly, and keeping the shady side. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> servant for our hats and coats in whispers, and opened the door for ourselves, and slipped out, and got round the corner quickly, {{avoiding}} each other as much as possible.|$|E
60|$|He {{finished}} amid {{a perfect}} shriek of laughter. We {{said it was}} the funniest thing we had ever heard in all our lives.

And when he was in his full strength he went away, and with him went Noda, daughter to the chief. First, after that, was one of our bitches brought to pup. And never was there such a breed of dogs,--big-headed, thick-jawed, and short-haired, and helpless. Well do I remember my father, Otsbaok, a strong man. His face was black with anger at such helplessness, and he took a stone, so, and so, and there was no more helplessness. And two summers after that came Noda back to us with a man-child in the hollow of her arm.|$|E
6000|$|We fancied {{at first}} it was talking about {{somebody}} named Hester (it had spelt Hester with a [...] "u" [...] before we allowed a margin for spelling), and we tried to work the sentence out on that basis, [...] "Hester enemies fear," [...] we thought it might be. Whibley had a niece named Hester, and we decided the warning had reference to her. But whether she was our enemy, and we were to fear her, or whether we had to fear her enemies (and, if so, who were they?), or whether it was our enemies who were to be frightened by Hester, or her enemies, or enemies generally, still remained doubtful. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> table if it meant the first suggestion, and it said [...] "No." [...] We asked what it did mean, and it said [...] "Yes." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{it may be}} said as a rule, {{that every}} Englishman in the Duke of Wellington's army paid his way. The remembrance of such a fact surely becomes a nation of shopkeepers. It was a blessing for a commerce-loving country to be overrun by such an army of customers: and to have such creditable warriors to feed. And the country which they came to protect is not military. For {{a long period of}} history they have let other people fight there. When the present writer went to survey with eagle glance the field of Waterloo, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> {{conductor}} of the diligence, a portly warlike-looking veteran, whether he had been at the battle. [...] "Pas si bete"--such an answer and sentiment as no Frenchman would own to--was his reply. But, on the other hand, the postilion who drove us was a Viscount, a son of some bankrupt Imperial General, who accepted a pennyworth of beer on the road. The moral is surely a good one.|$|E

500|$|Security forces did not {{intervene}} to disperse the march, however a state-owned helicopter hovered overhead. A {{small number of}} police and army officers participated in the protest. Denouncing army troops who opened fire on protesters, an officer said, [...] "What we did to the people was not heroic. <b>We</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> people to forgive us, <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> people for forgiveness". Another officer added, [...] "The weapons {{that have been used}} against the people are weapons of shame, these weapons should be used to protect the people, and not be used against them.

60|$|Bit by bit it {{all came}} out. He had ridden behind us the first day we viewed the place, and, giving himself out to the {{servants}} {{as one of our}} party, had joined us in the reception-room. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> real Count why he had spoken to the intruder. The Count explained in French that the man with the moustache had introduced my brother-in-law as the great South African millionaire, while he described himself as our courier and interpreter. As such he had had frequent interviews with the real Graf and his lawyers in Meran, and had driven almost daily across to the castle. The owner of the estate had named one price from the first, and had stuck to it manfully. He stuck to it still; and if Sir Charles chose to buy Schloss Lebenstein over again he was welcome to have it. How the London lawyers had been duped the Count had not really the slightest idea. He regretted the incident, and (coldly) wished us a very good morning.|$|E
60|$|Marble {{and myself}} {{observed}} that the canoe, in which the messengers left us, did not pull out to sea, but that it entered a small stream, or creek, that communicated {{with the head of}} the bay. As there was no duty on board, <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> captain's permission to explore this spot; and, at the same time, to make a more thorough examination of our haven, generally. The request being granted, we got into the yawl, with four men, all of us armed, and set out on our little expedition. Smudge, a withered, grey-headed old Indian, with muscles however that resembled whip-cord, was alone on deck, when this movement took place. He watched our proceedings narrowly, and, when he saw us descend into the boat, he very coolly slipped down the ship's side, and took his place in the stern-sheets, with as much quiet dignity as if he had been captain. Marble was a good deal of a ship's martinet in such matters, and he did not more than half like the familiarity and impudence of the procedure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it's terrible!" [...] cried Grace, and now {{the tears}} began to course down her cheeks. [...] "We got a note--at least Dora did--stating you had had a fall from the biplane and were hurt. The note was signed 'Tom,' and we of course thought Tom had sent it. It said to keep the matter quiet but to come without delay--down this road to the old white cottage. So {{the three of us}} started off as soon as we could. Dora was so afraid it was serious she ran nearly all the way, and Nellie and I ran, too. We had thought you were at the cottage, but when we got there we didn't see anybody. While we hunted around a big touring car, one of the kind with a closed coach top, dashed up. There was a man running the car and another man inside, a fellow who looked like a doctor. The driver asked if we were the girls who had come to see Dick Rover, the aviator, and we said yes. Then he said the car had been sent for us and for the doctor, and for us to get in and he would take us to Dick Rover at once. We got in, and then, before we knew it, the touring car was rushing along the road at a great rate of speed. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> doctor about you, Dick, but he said he hadn't seen you yet. Then <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> driver, but he acted so queer we began to get suspicious. Then, oh, wasn't it strange? Nellie saw a card {{on the floor of the}} car, and picked it up, and it was Josiah Crabtree's visiting card! She showed it to Dora and I, and Dora screamed, and wanted to leap out of the car. But the doctor--if he was a doctor--held her, and held Nellie, too. But I was too much for him. I don't know how I did it, but, just as we were {{rounding}} a curve rather slowly, I flung myself out of the door, and I landed in some bushes. I got scratched a little, as you can see, but I wasn't hurt, and I started to run back to the seminary and was doing that when I saw your flying machine. You know the rest." [...] And now Grace stopped, too exhausted to say another word.|$|E

60|$|There {{are many}} other {{circumstances}} of fraud and falsehood attending this petition, (we must call things by their proper names, my Lords,)--there are, I say, many circumstances of fraud and falsehood. We know it to have been impossible, {{at the time of}} presenting this petition, that this man should have expended thirty thousand pounds in the preparation of materials for his defence; and your Lordships' justice, together with the credit of the House of Commons, are concerned in the discovery of the truth. There is, indeed, an ambiguous word in the petition. He asserts that he is engaged for the payment of that sum. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> clerks of the India House whether he had given them any bond, note, security, or promise of payment: they assured us that he had not: they will be ready to make the same assurance to your Lordships, when you come to inquire into this matter, which before you give judgment we desire and claim that you will do.

60|$|One of {{the first}} errors of our search for the Archaeological Museum, {{promoted}} by the mistaken kindness of people <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> way, found us in the Academy of Fine Arts, where {{in the company of}} a fat and flabby Rubens (Susanna, of course, and those filthy Elders) we chanced on a portrait of Goya by himself: a fine head most takingly shrewd. But there was another portrait by him, of the ridiculous Godoy, Prince of the Peace, a sort of handsome, foolish fleshy George Fourthish person looking his character and history: one of the most incredible parasites who ever fattened on a nation. This impossible creature, hated more than feared, and despised more than hated, who misruled a generous people for twenty-five years, throughout the most heroic period of their annals, the low-born paramour of their queen and the beloved friend of the king her husband, who honored and trusted him with the most pathetic single-hearted and simple-minded devotion, could not look all that he was and was not; but in this portrait by Goya he suggested his unutterable worthlessness: a worthlessness which you can only begin to realize by successively excluding all the virtues, and contrasting it with the sort of abandon of faith on the part of the king; this in the common imbecility, the triune madness of the strange group, has its sublimity. In the next room are two pieces of Goya's which recall in their absolute realism another passage of Spanish history with unparalleled effect. They represent, one the accused heretics receiving sentence before a tribunal of the Inquisition, and the other the execution of the sentence, where the victims are mocked by a sort of fools' caps inscribed with the terms of their accusal. Their faces are turned on the spectator, who may forget them if he can.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had done}} it somehow. Afterwards Archie {{declared}} that the thing was [...] "meeraculous." [...] For many days we wondered, {{and it was the}} one ever-interesting subject of conversation {{to the end of the}} voyage. <b>We</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> cook, in fine weather, how he felt when he saw his stove [...] "reared up on end." [...] We inquired, in the north-east trade and on serene evenings, whether he had to stand on his head to put things right somewhat. We suggested he had used his bread-board for a raft, and from there comfortably had stoked his grate; and we did our best to conceal our admiration under the wit of fine irony. He affirmed not to know anything about it, rebuked our levity, declared himself, with solemn animation, to have been the object of a special mercy for the saving of our unholy lives. Fundamentally he was right, no doubt; but he need not have been so offensively positive about it--he need not have hinted so often that it would have gone hard with us had he not been there, meritorious and pure, to receive the inspiration and the strength for the work of grace. Had we been saved by his recklessness or his agility, we could have at length become reconciled to the fact; but to admit our obligation to anybody's virtue and holiness alone was as difficult for us as for any other handful of mankind. Like many benefactors of humanity, the cook took himself too seriously, and reaped the reward of irreverence. We were not un-ungrateful, however. He remained heroic. His saying--the saying of his life--became proverbial in the mouth of men as are the sayings of conquerors or sages. Later, whenever one of us was puzzled by a task and advised to relinquish it, he would express his determination to persevere and to succeed by the words:--"As long as she swims I will cook!" ...|$|E
