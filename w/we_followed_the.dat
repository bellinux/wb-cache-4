60|$|<b>We</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> {{tracks of}} the horses which lead {{southwest}} toward the rim, and {{a quarter of a}} mile from camp we crossed a lion trail running at right angles with our direction.|$|E

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> sombre, shaded alley {{across the}} Esplanade. It was {{moderately}} cool there under the trees. Captain Giles remarked, {{with a sudden}} laugh: [...] "I know who's jolly thankful at having seen the last of you." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was near}} to daybreak when <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> soldier to where General Herkimer lay under a shelter of pine boughs; but {{owing to the}} storm the gloom was quite as {{profound}} as {{at any time during}} the night.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Ruck {{joined her}} mother, {{with a little}} toss of her head, and <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> ladies to the carriage. [...] "In your place," [...] said Miss Sophy to her father, [...] "I wouldn't talk so much about pennies and pounds before strangers." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Our Holy Week was a calm solemn season. All the {{services}} {{have long been}} in print. Day by day in school and chapel <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> holy services and acts of each day, taking Ellicott's [...] "Historical Lectures" [...] as a guide.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} we proceeded leisurely, through an atmosphere growing warmer and denser, {{down to the}} valley, reaching it at dusk. <b>We</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> course of Furnace Creek and made camp under some cottonwood trees, on the west slope of the valley.|$|E

60|$|For {{three long}} marches <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> left {{bank of the}} growing river, until at last we saw it roll its mighty volume into the vast waters of the sea. Far out across the {{rippling}} ocean we described three islands. The one to the left must be Anoroc.|$|E
60|$|It was new {{for us to}} {{be doing}} business, with a Marshal of France as sentry at the door. However, <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> Emperor as we were ordered, and he led us into the recess of the window, {{gathering}} us around him and sinking his voice as he addressed us.|$|E
60|$|For {{two days}} <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> river northward, cutting off where we could, but {{confined}} {{for the most}} part to the game trails that paralleled the stream. One afternoon, we cut across a narrow neck of land that saved us many miles, where the river wound to the west and back again.|$|E

Skirting the spinney, <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> brook course, and came at last to the quarry fence. The old {{excavations}} were filled now with trees. The steep walls, twenty feet deep in places, were packed with loose stones, and trailed with hanging brambles. We climbed down the steep bank of the brook, and entered the quarries by {{the bed of the}} stream. Under the groves of ash and oak a pale primrose still lingered, glimmering wanly beside the hidden water. Emily found a smear of blood on a beautiful trail of yellow convolvulus. <b>We</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> tracks on to the open, where the brook flowed on the hard rock bed, and the stony floor of the quarry was only a tangle of gorse and bramble and honeysuckle.|$|E
60|$|The Indian was right. On {{clearing}} the wooded land {{we found that}} the moon was up, and <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> trail easily. Coming to a hillock in the open ground, the top of which was covered with thick and stunted bushes, we rode into them and there experienced much difficulty in picking our way.|$|E
60|$|For hours <b>we</b> <b>followed</b> <b>the</b> {{dark and}} gloomy river {{farther and farther}} into the bowels of Mars. From the {{direction}} and distance I knew that we must be well beneath the Valley Dor, and possibly beneath the Sea of Omean as well--it could not be much farther now to the Temple of the Sun.|$|E
