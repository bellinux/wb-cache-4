5|$|Rubidium <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> for the {{influence}} on manic depression and depression. Dialysis patients suffering from depression show a depletion in rubidium {{and therefore a}} supplementation may help during depression. In some tests the rubidium was administered as rubidium chloride with up to 720mg per day for 60 days.|$|E
5|$|The RLM ordered seven A-0s initially, {{but then}} {{increased}} {{the order to}} 11. Early in 1937, the A-0 <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> with varied bomb loads. The underpowered Jumo 210A, as pointed out by von Richthofen, was insufficient, and was quickly replaced with the Jumo 210D power plant.|$|E
5|$|The casing <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> in a wind tunnel, and {{retained}} {{after it}} {{was found to be}} as good as other forms of streamlining. After introduction it was subsequently found that its aerodynamic form failed to disturb the air sufficiently to lift the exhaust from the chimney, thus obstructing the driver's vision with smoke.|$|E

5|$|The {{crew members}} also {{checked out the}} Advanced Space Vision System, a precise {{alignment}} system for the robot arm that <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> on STS-74. The OSVS, which was used during the mating operation, consisted {{of a series of}} large dots placed on the exterior of the docking module and the docking system.|$|E
5|$|The final {{iteration}} of the Yer-2 {{series was}} a 1941 production aircraft re-engined with ACh-30BF engines and redesignated as the Yer-4. It had a slightly larger wingspan, increased takeoff weight and improved armament. The prototype <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> in December 1943, {{but did not}} enter production.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{production}} variants {{were the}} Do 17E-1 bomber, which <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> with two Daimler-Benz DB 600, and Do 17F-1 reconnaissance aircraft, powered like the early prototypes with BMW VI engines, which entered production in late 1936. The first Luftwaffe units converted to the Do 17 in early 1937.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the thought {{processes that are}} associated with reluctance in gay men to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> for HIV antibodies. The sample comprised 97 men who had not <b>been</b> <b>tested</b> for at least four years; 69 had never <b>been</b> <b>tested.</b> They <b>were</b> asked to imagine that someone had suggested that they <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> very soon and to identify, from the list provided, any negative thoughts prompted by this suggestion. The most commonly reported thoughts <b>were</b> that <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> unnecessary because risks had not been taken, that it was unnecessary because there were no symptoms, {{and that there was no}} urgency to <b>be</b> <b>tested.</b> Data <b>were</b> explored by means of factor analysis and comparisons across subgroups differing in risk level. The results are interpreted as indicating the use of rationalizations to buttress a decision not to <b>be</b> <b>tested,</b> the powerful influence on HIV decision-making exerted by salient perceptible features, and the ‘status quo bias’. Techniques that could be used to encourage testing in gay men are discussed. <br /...|$|R

5|$|The third version {{featured}} a photocell {{to measure the}} brightness of the night sky and the ship's side; the projectors' brightness was automatically controlled to balance out the difference. It <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> in September 1941 on the corvette HMCS Kamloops.|$|E
5|$|This gun was {{retrofitted}} into German and Dutch Leopard 2s, and {{chosen as}} the main gun of the Spanish Leopard 2E and the Greek Leopard 2HEL. It <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> on the British Challenger 2 as a potential replacement for its current weapon, the rifled L30 120mm cannon.|$|E

5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, hippopotamuses, and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|All {{production}} Comet 2s {{were also}} modified {{to alleviate the}} fatigue problems (most of these served with the RAF as the Comet C2), while a programme to produce a Comet 2 with more powerful Avons was delayed. The prototype Comet 3 first flew in July 1954, and <b>was</b> <b>tested</b> in an unpressurised state pending completion of the Cohen inquiry. Comet commercial flights would not resume until 1958.|$|E
