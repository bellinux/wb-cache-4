40|$|The {{prevalence}} and {{risk factors of}} canine parvovirus disease in Denpasar were determined using datacollected from private veterinary practioners between 2004 - 2007. The risk factors observed including :dogs breed, age, sex, vaccination status, season, humidity, and temperature. Diagnosis of parvovirusinfection was done based on clinical signs, confirmed laboratory test and/or rapid test using parvoviruskit. The prevalence of canine parvovirus infection was 3. 26 % during 2004 - 2007. It appeared that incompletevaccination <b>would</b> <b>increased</b> {{the risk of the}} infection by 10. 15 fold (OR 10. 15).

5|$|Looking Glass {{intended}} Flight Unlimited as {{a gateway}} into {{the video game}} publishing industry. According to Lerner, the idea of self-publishing had been considered when the company was founded. In 1995, Looking Glass projected that sales of Flight Unlimited <b>would</b> <b>increase</b> royalty revenues to $10 million that year, up from $1.5 million in 1994. Jeffrey A. Kalowski, the company's vice president of finance and administration, expected that the game would recoup its development costs and make a return {{before the end of}} the year. He predicted that, over the following 12 to 18 months, the company's number of employees <b>would</b> <b>increase</b> from 52 to 82. The company's executive vice president and general manager, Jerry Wolosenko, told The Boston Globe that the company hoped to publish six games each year. According to Doug Church, the pressure for Flight Unlimited to succeed meant that the concurrently-developed System Shock, which was not self-published, received little attention from the company's management.|$|E

In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This <b>would</b> <b>increase</b> the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target.
