25|$|The cable {{construction}} technique {{differed significantly}} from that {{used for the}} earlier western spans and similar conventional suspension bridges. In that method, the cables were spun only a few wires at a time, with bundles made up as the wires were spun by pulling a loop along the cable's route. The SAS used a different technique, with the wire strands pre-fabricated into mile-long cable bundles with bundle terminations already in place, pulled by dragging one end through the route. After attachment to the termination, a tensioning operation was performed on each bundle at the eastern anchor point, and the bundles were suspended a few feet above the catwalk. A total of 137 such bundles were installed. As bundles were positioned, they were temporarily tied together to form the cable. The cable was completely in place in late May 2012. It was later compacted into a circular shape, and then wrapped with a protective wire jacket. In mid-March 2013, the western portion was completed and the catwalks were removed. <b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> was still in progress on the eastern portion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> {{comes from}} the {{tradition}} of rope splicing. Early <b>wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> was performed manually; a slow and careful process. <b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> was used for splices and for finishing cable ends in suspension bridge wires and other wire rope rigging, usually with a smaller diameter wire wrapped around a larger wire or bundle of wires. Such techniques were purely mechanical, to add strength or prevent fraying.|$|E

40|$|Application of <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> spacers in SCWR {{can reduce}} {{pressure}} drop and obtain better mixing capability. As a consequence, the required coolant pumping power is decreased and the coolant temperature profile inside the fuel bundle is flattened which will obviously decrease the peak cladding temperature. The distributed resistance model for <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> {{was developed and}} implemented in ATHAS subchannel analysis code. The HPLWR <b>wire</b> <b>wrapped</b> assembly was analyzed. The results show that: (1) the assembly with <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> can obtain a more uniform coolant temperature profile than the grid spaced assembly, which {{will result in a}} lower peak cladding temperature; (2) the pressure drop in a <b>wire</b> <b>wrapped</b> assembly is less than that in a grid spaced assembly, which can reduce the operating power of pump effectively; (3) the <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> pitch has significant effect on the flow in the assembly.

40|$|Broken {{prestressing}} <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> are {{the main}} cause of failure in prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP). The effect of the number and location of broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> on the structural performance of PCCP is investigated using advanced numerical modeling that considers full interaction between the spigot and bell ends of adjacent pipes. The stresses and strains in the various components of PCCP are evaluated with increasing internal pressure. A sensitivity analysis is performed to understand how manipulating the severity of the damage through varying the number of broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> affects the internal fluid pressure that causes failure. A 244 -cm (96 -in.) embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) is modeled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps.</b> The results obtained show that the internal fluid pressure required to cause failure can be as much as 14 % lower when the damage is at the joint, and that the internal pressure that causes yielding of the <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> decreases approximately 65 % as the severity of the damage increases from 5 to 100 broken wires.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{location}} of broken prestressing <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> on the overall strength of prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) is investigated here. An advanced computational model based on non-linear finite element analysis is used to study three possible locations of broken wire wraps: at the spigot joint, at the bell joint and in {{the barrel of the}} pipe. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the cracking of the concrete core and the yielding of the prestressing wires and steel cylinder with increasing internal pressure and with an increasing number of broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps.</b> Two classes of 2. 44 m embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) were modelled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> breaks. The results show that broken <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> at the joint, and especially the spigot joint, decrease the overall strength of PCCP more so than those at the bell joint or in the barrel of the pipe.

50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>wrapping</b> {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{techniques}} for making handmade jewelry. This technique is done with some jewelry wire and findings similar to wire (like head-pins) to make components. Wire components are then connected to one another using mechanical techniques with no soldering or heating of the wire. Frequently, in this approach, a wire is bent into a loop or other decorative shape and then the wire is wrapped around itself to finish the wire component making that loop or decorative shape permanent. Because of this technique for wrapping wire around itself, this craft is called <b>wire</b> <b>wrapping.</b>|$|E

40|$|This work {{contributes}} to the Hydride Fuels Project, a collaborative effort between UC Berkeley and MIT aimed at investigating {{the potential benefits of}} hydride fuel use in light water reactors (LWRs). Core design is accomplished for both hydride and oxide-fueled cores over a range of geometries via steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic analyses, which yield the maximum power, and fuel performance and neutronics studies, which provide the achievable discharge burnup. The final optimization integrates the outputs from these separate studies into an economics model to identify geometries offering the lowest cost of electricity, and provide a fair basis for comparing the performance of hydride and oxide fuels. This work focuses on the steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic as well as economic analyses for PWR cores utilizing <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> in a hexagonal array with UZrH 1. 6 and UO 2. It was previously verified that square and hexagonal arrays with matching rod diameters and H/HM ratio have the same thermal hydraulic performance. In this work, this equivalence is extended to hexagonal <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> arrays, and verified by comparing the thermal hydraulic performance of a single hexagonal <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> core with its equivalent square array core with grid spacers. A separate neutronics equivalence is developed, {{based on the assumption that}} arrays with matching rod diameters and H/HM ratios will have identical neutronic performance. Steady-state design limits were separated into hard limits, which must be satisfied, or soft limits, which serve to keep the design reasonable. Design limits were placed on the pressure drop, critical heat flux (CHF), vibrations, and fuel and cladding temperature. Vibrations limits on the <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> assemblies were imposed for flow induced vibrations (FIV) and thermal hydraulic vibrations (THV). (cont.) An analysis of the fretting wear of <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> was performed, which outperformed the analogous fretting wear analysis for grid spacers. A CHF study found <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> to outperform grid spacers. LOCA and overpower transient analyses were performed for <b>wire</b> <b>wraps.</b> The overpower transient was analyzed over a range of geometries, and found to be more limiting than the steady-state analysis. The LOCA was analyzed for various powers at the reference geometry and another geometry of interest. Through all of these analyses, it was determined that the thermal hydraulic performance of UZrH 1. 6 and UO 2 are very similar. The optimal <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> designs were found to have significantly higher maximum powers than the reference core, allowing for uprates up to - 54 %. This is due to improved vibrations, pressure drop, and CHF. The steady-state and transient analyses were combined with fuel performance and neutronic studies into an economics model that determines the optimal geometries for incorporation into existing PWR's. The model also provides a basis for comparing the performance of UZrH 1. 6 to UO 2 for a range of core geometries. Results presented herein show cost savings for oxide fuel with <b>wire</b> <b>wraps</b> over grid spacers of at least 0. 8 mils/kWe-hr, or 4 %, due to power increases predicted by the thermal hydraulic analyses. <b>Wire</b> <b>wrap</b> UZrHI. 6 has a COE savings over U 02 of 0. 7 mils/kWe-hr, or 4 %. Due to the large power uprates possible, a utility could achieve a cost savings of up to 10. 9 mils/kWe-hr, or 40 %, with a UZrH 1. 6 <b>wire</b> <b>wrap</b> uprate instead of building a new core. by Peter Ray Diller.
