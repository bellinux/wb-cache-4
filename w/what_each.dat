5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate <b>what</b> <b>each</b> color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Carson bequeathed her {{manuscripts and}} papers to Yale University, to take {{advantage}} of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only <b>what</b> <b>each</b> correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.|$|E
5|$|Harkin realizes what {{happened}} to the power and rushes to find London, while Benson and Secretary Abbott gather energy from a multitude of other companies to get around the breakdown at Lexer. Unaware of <b>what</b> <b>each</b> party is doing, London quickly reverses the hacks {{at the same time as}} the energy starts flowing in from other companies. This overloads the system, knocking out the entire Midwest power grid as the storm hits the city and London is killed in the process.|$|E

5|$|The 30 contestants {{were divided}} into three teams of ten named Team 1, Team 2 and Team 3, and each group met in a {{different}} London location on 10 June, {{the day of the}} programme's launch. To record <b>what</b> <b>each</b> team did, Russian hired unpaid trainee cameramen. Once the teams were assembled, they were given their challenge: in a year, they had to make £1million. Their first task was to find accommodation for themselves for free for a week. The contestants slowly realised that, despite what their contracts had claimed, they would have to find their own food and accommodation, and would essentially be making their own prize money. Some contestants demanded to meet with Russian, who eventually revealed to them that no television channel had actually commissioned his show. Teams 1 and 3 disbanded within two days.|$|E
5|$|Then a rule {{change is}} announced, {{allowing}} the tributes {{from the same}} district to win as a couple. Katniss finds and nurses a seriously wounded Peeta, while continuing to act {{the part of a}} girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers announce that <b>what</b> <b>each</b> contestant needs most will be provided at a feast, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is pinned to the ground by Clove, who gloats about Rue while toying with the helpless Katniss. That talk costs Clove her life, however; Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, kills her, but spares Katniss - once - for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life.|$|E
5|$|Some argue on {{religious}} or philosophical {{grounds that it}} is blameworthy to act against conscience, even if the judgement of conscience {{is likely to be}} erroneous (say because it is inadequately informed about the facts, or prevailing moral (humanist or religious), professional ethical, legal and human rights norms). Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted justifications for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in <b>what</b> <b>each</b> society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E

Promotion for pieces able to do so is both compulsory and permanent.|$|E
25|$|These {{are similar}} to the {{well-known}} licences, in that they're defined before their use and can be applied to many instances of licensing. Their difference is that as they're not well known, it's also necessary to explain <b>what</b> <b>each</b> of them entails, as the user is always likely to be encountering each of them for the first time. A REL provides the means to do this.|$|E

25|$|Optical {{character}} recognition (OCR) {{is preferable to}} rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a Linotype-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce <b>what</b> <b>each</b> character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, Google Book Search) and promises more for the future.|$|E
25|$|Game theorists use the Nash {{equilibrium}} {{concept to}} analyze {{the outcome of the}} strategic interaction of several decision makers. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying John Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask <b>what</b> <b>each</b> player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the concern}} of some Torah {{scholars}} that misunderstanding these passages as literal descriptions of God's image might lead to blasphemy or idolatry, there was great opposition to studying this topic without the proper initiation. Jewish biblical commentaries emphasize that the imagery of the merkabah {{is not meant to}} be taken literally; rather the chariot and its accompanying angels are analogies for the various ways that God reveals himself in this world. Hasidic philosophy and kabbalah discuss at length <b>what</b> <b>each</b> aspect of this vision represents in this world, and how the vision does not imply that God is made up of these forms.|$|E
