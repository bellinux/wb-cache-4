40|$|When {{islanding}} occurs, {{power supply}} {{from the main}} grid is interrupted which causes a problem when distributed generators continue to provide power into distributed networks. An islanding situation should be detected accurately soon after the island is formed. Because failure to trip the islanded distributed resource {{can lead to a}} number of problems for the resource and the connected load. Although ROCOF islanding detection method is the most commonly employed anti-islanding protection technique, it provides fast detection and easily implementation. It is sensitive to the system disturbance. Therefore, the application of the ROCOF relay to detect system islanding has been limited. This thesis proposes a solution to enhance the performance of the ROCOF relay by cooperation with rate of change of power or v 2 /p interlock function. During system load variation, the false operation of ROCOF relay can be blocked effectively. It is validated by applied in grid-connected synchronous generator, Doubly-fed Induction generator (both simulation and experiment) and microgrid. The principle of rate of change of power or v 2 /p interlock function are presented in this thesis. The new interlock function v 2 /p with ROCOF relays works well for different types of DGs within a short detection time without introducing perturbation into the system, which are the advantages over other active and hybrid islanding detection methods. The performances characteristics of ROCOF relays for DGs islanding detection (i. e. frequency measuring methods, measuring <b>windows,</b> <b>generator</b> inertia constant, relay settings and load power factor) are investigated. In addition, two other islanding detection methods (impedance measurement (active method) and the Total Harmonic Method) are applied to the grid-connected DFIG distributed system, the comparison and effectiveness of these two methods utilized in islanding and load changing conditions are also discussed.

The overall purpose {{is the development of}} guidance systems combining real-time imaging with tracking of flexible instruments for bronchoscopy, laparoscopic ultrasound, endoluminal surgery, endovascular therapy, and spinal surgery. Methods: The WFG has a torus shape, which facilitates x-ray imaging through its centre. The authors compared the performance of the WFG to that of a standard field generator (SFG) {{under the influence of the}} C-arm. Both accuracy and robustness measurements were performed with the C-arm in different positions and poses. Results: The system was deemed robust for both field generators, but the accuracy was notably influenced as the C-arm was moved into the electromagnetic field. The SFG provided a smaller root-mean-square position error but was more influenced by the C-arm than the WFG. The WFG also produced smaller maximum and variance of the error.

40|$|Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) {{has been}} tasked with {{evaluating}} {{the effectiveness of}} ORNL’s new hybrid transport code, ADVANTG, on scenarios of interest to our NA- 22 sponsor, specifically of detection of diversion of special nuclear material (SNM). PNNL staff have determined that acquisition and installation of ADVANTG was relatively straightforward for a code in its phase of development, but probably not yet sufficient for mass distribution to the general user. PNNL staff also determined that with little effort, ADVANTG generated weight windows that typically worked for the problems and generated results consistent with MCNP. With slightly greater effort of choosing a finer mesh around detectors or sample reaction tally regions, the figure of merit (FOM) could be further improved in most cases. This does take some limited knowledge of deterministic transport methods. The FOM could also be increased by limiting the energy range for a tally to the energy region of greatest interest. It was then found that an MCNP run with the full energy range for the tally showed improved statistics in the region used for the ADVANTG run. The specific case of interest chosen by the sponsor is the CIPN project from Las Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), which is an active interrogation, non-destructive assay (NDA) technique to quantify the fissile content in a spent fuel assembly and is also sensitive to cases of material diversion. Unfortunately, weight windows for the CIPN problem cannot currently be properly generated with ADVANTG due to inadequate accommodations for source definition. ADVANTG requires that a fixed neutron source be defined within the problem and cannot account for neutron multiplication. As such, it is rendered useless in active interrogation scenarios. It is also {{interesting to note that}} this is a difficult problem to solve and that the automated weight <b>windows</b> <b>generator</b> in MCNP actually slowed down the problem. Therefore, PNNL had determined that there is not an effective tool available for speeding up MCNP for problems such as the CIPN scenario. With regard to the Benchmark scenarios, ADVANTG performed very well for most of the difficult, long-running, standard radiation detection scenarios. Specifically, run time speedups were observed for spatially large scenarios, or those having significant shielding or scattering geometries. ADVANTG performed on par with existing codes for moderate sized scenarios, or those with little to moderate shielding, or multiple paths to the detectors. ADVANTG ran slower than MCNP for very simply, spatially small cases with little to no shielding that run very quickly anyway. Lastly, ADVANTG could not solve problems that did not consist of fixed source to detector geometries. For example, it could not solve scenarios with multiple detectors or secondary particles, such as active interrogation, neutron induced gamma, or fission neutrons...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{metastability}} immune warning flip-flop (FF) is proposed, {{which consists}} of an edge detector, a warning <b>window</b> <b>generator,</b> and a warning detector along with a traditional FF. The delayed data are monitored during the warning window to flag a warning signal before the data enter the erroneous zone. In this scheme, the warning window is independent of input clock frequency and hence is suitable for frequency scaling application. A 16 -bit Kogge-stone adder is implemented in 65 -nm technology, which uses warning FF for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The warning FF-based DVFS allows elimination of safety margins and operates till the point of first warning of the adder without any erroneous results. The experiments were conducted with different supply voltages, phase-shifted clocks, and process conditions. The circuit is helpful to determine when to stop further reduction in supply voltage by producing the warning signal with predefined timing slacks in DVFS application. The test chip results demonstrate that the proposed circuit can track the critical path delay of 2. 4 - 7. 5 ns at warning voltage of 1. 15 - 0. 72 V, respectively.

40|$|The {{decommissioning}} of a {{light water}} reactor (LWR), which is licensed under § 7 of the German Atomic Energy Act, following the post-operational phase requires a comprehensive licensing procedure including in particular radiation protection aspects and possible impacts to the environment. Decommissioning includes essential changes in requirements for the systems and components and will mainly lead to the direct dismantling. In this context, neutron induced activation calculations for the structural components have {{to be carried out}} to predict activities in structures and to estimate future costs for conditioning and packaging. To avoid an overestimation of the radioactive inventory and to calculate the expenses for decommissioning as accurate as possible, modern state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo-Techniques (MCNP™) are applied and coupled with present-day activation and decay codes (ORIGEN-S). In this context ADVANTG is used as weight <b>window</b> <b>generator</b> for MCNP™ i. e. as variance reduction tool to speed up the calculation in deep penetration problems.

The validation shows that the applied calculation procedure is suitable for the determination of the radioactive inventory of a nuclear power plant. Even the measured gamma dose rates in the post-operational phase at different positions in the reactor building agree within a factor of 2 to 3 with the calculation results.

40|$|A {{bilateral}} subtraction filter {{has been}} implemented as a hardware module {{in the form}} of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). In general, a bilateral subtraction filter is a key subsystem of a high-quality stereoscopic machine vision system that utilizes images that are large and/or dense. Bilateral subtraction filters have been implemented in software on general-purpose computers, but the processing speeds attainable in this way even on computers containing the fastest processors are insufficient for real-time applications. The present FPGA bilateral subtraction filter is intended to accelerate processing to real-time speed and to be a prototype of a link in a stereoscopic-machine- vision processing chain, now under development, that would process large and/or dense images in real time and would be implemented in an FPGA. In terms that are necessarily oversimplified for the sake of brevity, a bilateral subtraction filter is a smoothing, edge-preserving filter for suppressing low-frequency noise. The filter operation amounts to replacing the value for each pixel with a weighted average of the values of that pixel and the neighboring pixels in a predefined neighborhood or window (e. g., a 9 9 window). The filter weights depend partly on pixel values and partly on the window size. The present FPGA implementation of a bilateral subtraction filter utilizes a 9 9 window. This implementation was designed to take advantage of the ability to do many of the component computations in parallel pipelines to enable processing of image data at the rate at which they are generated. The filter can be considered to be divided into the following parts (see figure) : a) An image pixel pipeline with a 9 9 - pixel <b>window</b> <b>generator,</b> b) An array of processing elements; c) An adder tree; d) A smoothing-and-delaying unit; and e) A subtraction unit. After each 9 9 window is created, the affected pixel data are fed to the processing elements. Each processing element is fed the pixel value for its position in the window as well as the pixel value for the central pixel of the window. The absolute difference between these two pixel values is calculated and used as an address in a lookup table. Each processing element has a lookup table, unique for its position in the window, containing the weight coefficients for the Gaussian function for that position. The pixel value is multiplied by the weight, and the outputs of the processing element are the weight and pixel-value weight product. The products and weights are fed to the adder tree. The sum of the products and the sum of the weights are fed to the divider, which computes the sum of products the sum of weights. The output of the divider is denoted the bilateral smoothed image. The smoothing function is a simple weighted average computed over a 3 3 subwindow centered in the 9 9 window. After smoothing, the image is delayed by an additional amount of time needed to match the processing time for computing the bilateral smoothed image. The bilateral smoothed image is then subtracted from the 3 3 smoothed image to produce the final output. The prototype filter as implemented in a commercially available FPGA processes one pixel per clock cycle. Operation at a clock speed of 66 MHz has been demonstrated, and results of a static timing analysis have been interpreted as suggesting that the clock speed could be increased to as much as 100 MHz...|$|E

Sn-doped In 2 O 3 is the transparent conducting oxide most widely used in scientific and industrial applications. Sn-doped In 2 O 3 can be integrated into solar cells, smart <b>windows,</b> photocurrent <b>generators,</b> displays, and light-emitting diodes [7, 8]. However, most studies on Sn-doped In 2 O 3 have mainly focused on its thin-film structure because of the numerous applications of this material in optoelectronic and electronic devices [9, 10]. By contrast, there are few works on Sn-doped In 2 O 3 regarding its 1 D structure. Recently, comprehensive investigations on the 1 D nanostructures of In 2 O 3 have been conducted. In 2 O 3 1 D nanostructures have been synthesized using several chemical and physical methodologies [11, 12]. Thermal evaporation is the simplest method used to synthesize In 2 O 3 nanostructures with a large density and high crystalline quality [13]. The source materials used to grow 1 D In 2 O 3 nanostructures through thermal evaporation include metallic In powder and ceramic In 2 O 3 powders mixed with carbon powders. Generally, a high growth temperature is required to obtain In 2 O 3 nanostructures when using ceramic powders as the source material. In addition to the source materials, the evaporative synthesis of these nanostructures can be further classified depending on whether or not a metallic catalyst is used during crystal growth. For optoelectronic nanodevice applications, In 2 O 3 nanostructures are doped with trace Sn to enhance their optical and electrical characteristics [14, 15]. Sn-doped In 2 O 3 nanostructures have several superior properties including a high metallic conductivity, excellent oxidation resistance, and good thermal stability. However, recent works on Sn-doped In 2 O 3 nanostructures with various morphologies have been limited to synthesis using mixed ceramic powders composed of various elements, such as In 2 O 3 with SnO 2 or InN with SnO 2, on the substrates, with or without an Au catalyst layer [14, 16]. Some Sn-doped In 2 O 3 nanostructures were synthesized using mixed metallic In and Sn powders on Au catalyst-coated substrates [17]. In this study, Sn-doped In 2 O 3 nanostructures with various morphologies were synthesized using mixed In and Sn powders. No metal catalyst was used to grow the nanostructures. This paper presents the detailed investigation of nanostructures that were produced through self-catalytic growth and reports the related microstructures and self-catalytic growth mechanisms of the In-Sn-O nanostructures.|$|R

The practical demonstration of thermoelectric windows has been validated using a finite element model to predict the behavior of thermoelectric window under variety of varying conditions. MEMS based characterization platform has been fabricated for thermoelectric characterization of thin films employing van der Pauw and four probe modules. Enhancement of thermoelectric properties of the nano- manufactured pillars due to nano-structuring, achieved through mechanical alloying of micro-sized thermoelectric powders, has been explored. Modulation of thermoelectric properties of the nano-structured thermoelectric pillars by addition of sulfur to nano-powder matrix has also been investigated in detail. Using the best possible p and n type thermoelectric materials, this novel energy generation technique promises 304 watts of thermoelectricity from a 9 m 2 glass window utilizing temperature difference of 20 OC. In addition to be useful even during off sunshine hours of the day, these energy harvesting windows will be capable of power generation {{even in the absence of}} a cooling systems inside the building as long as a natural temperature gradient exists between the two counter environments. With an increasing trend of having the exterior of buildings and high rises entirely made up of glass, this work offers an innovative transformation of these building exteriors into mass scale energy harvesters capable of running average lighting loads inside the building hence providing a complimentary source of electricity to the main power grid...|$|R
40|$|A PV/T {{collector}} {{has been}} developed and evaluated {{at the department of}} Energy and Building Design at the Technical University of Lund, LTH in Sweden. The PV/T, a “solar window” made of PV cells laminated on solar absorbers is placed in a window behind the glazing. The solar window is built into a single family house, Solgården, in Älvkarleö outside Gävle {{in the eastern part of}} Sweden. To reduce the costs of the solar electricity reflectors have been placed in the construction to focus light onto the solar cells. In this way expensive solar cells can be replaced by considerably cheaper reflector material. The tiltable reflectors give the user a possibility to control the amount of sunlight being let into the building. The reflectors can also be used to reduce the thermal losses through the window. A calculation model for electricity and hot water production was created. The simulation program, in Excel, can perform yearly energy simulations where different effects such as shading of the cells or the glazing effects can be included or excluded. The simulation can be run with the reflectors in an active, up right, position or with the reflectors in a passive, horizontal, position. The simulation programme was calibrated against a prototype window placed in Lund in the south of Sweden and against the solar window in Solgården Älvkarleö. The calculation model serves as a basis for the module written for the simulation program TRNSYS. A “TRNSYS-deck” was built and calibrated for the building Solgården. The energy balance for the system shows that the control of the reflectors is of great importance. A good control strategy for the reflectors can lower the annual energy demand and improve the indoor climate. A control mechanism that incorporates the indoor and outdoor temperatures can for instance decide to open the reflectors during summer nights to cool the building. Yearly simulations of the energy balance for a house with the solar window was compared to simulations where the 16 m 2 solar window was replaced with a 8 m 2 normal window. The results show the annual amount of auxiliary is lower with a developed solar window compared to the normal window case. The developed solar window has considerably lower U-values than the existing solar window. A simulation was run to investigate the over heating of the building using different control strategies for the reflectors. The simulation was also run for the normal window. The results show that the reflectors of the solar window work fine as a sun shade, keeping the overheating to a minimum. A normal window has to be supplemented with a sun shade of some kind to keep the over heating during the summer on an acceptable level. An Improvement of the solar window that can be of great importance is to add some sort of low-e coating on the glazing to reduce the U-value even further. However, it must be taken into account that the transmittance of the glazing will be affected in a negative way if low-e coating is added. Lower transmission means lower electricity and hot water production. Other improvements that can be made are better insulation of the reflector and the absorber. The most important way to improve the annual electricity production is to use better solar cells. Today cells of standard quality with an efficiency of about 16 - 17 % can be obtained. The electric system at Solgården is built up around a battery bank that can be charged from the solar <b>window,</b> the Stirling <b>generator</b> or from the grid. To have continuous power for some time during a black out and also the relatively low fuse that is needed for the house are two advantages with this system. Simulations show that the day to day storage of electricity in the batteries evens out the power peaks from the load and the electric production, and that further storage is of limited use. Simulations show that the production of electric energy from a combination of solar cells and a Stirling generator is in good agreement with the load during the full year. Solgårdens two parallel electric systems, 230 V and 12 V, has many advantages such as electric security and low energy consumption. To save electric energy is of extra interest when solar cells are used as an energy source. Due to the high price for solar cells large energy saving investments ought to be made before a solar cell installation is economically interesting. To move the energy use from electricity to hot water use is profitable for a stand alone house since solar heating and bio fuel is considerably cheaper compared to solar electricity. Tumble driers, washing machines and dishwashers can for instance use a circulating hot water system instead of electricity in order to minimize the electric use. Normally the energy balance between produced electric energy and produced thermal energy is in better agreement if hot water is used instead of electric energy. Other important investments to make the electric usage more efficient are to use low energy light bulbs and modern kitchen appliances, pumps, fans and computers. This can save as much as 80 % of the electricity compared to old standard techniques. Solgården is in practice working with the main fuses of the sizes of 3 - 4 A only. This can be accomplished because of the battery bank and since no equipment with a high current demand is connected to the power system. A high slope of the PV-modules has the advantage that the power during the summer is decreased. On the other hand a module tilt of 45 ° is to prefer both from an energy and a power view. A 45 ° tilted module gives a higher annual output in kWh per monitored kWp than a vertical module...|$|R
