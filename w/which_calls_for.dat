5|$|Missoula's {{system of}} {{government}} has changed four times since 1883 when an aldermanic form of government was approved with the town charter. The city adopted a commission-council form of government in 1911 {{with the opening of}} new City Hall and a council–manager government in 1954 before returning to an aldermanic form of government in 1959. Since January 1, 1997, Missoula has been governed in accordance with the Missoula City Charter, <b>which</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> a mayor-council {{system of government}}.|$|E

She was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2014, winning for British Artist of the Year.

5|$|In {{the middle}} {{statement}} of the principal theme (between the C minor and A-flat major sections) there is a notational error which, in a literal performance of the score, causes a harmonic clash between the piano and the winds. Mozart probably wrote the piano and wind parts at different times, resulting in an oversight by the composer. Alfred Brendel, who has recorded the concerto on multiple occasions, argues that performers should not follow the score literally but correct Mozart's error. Brendel further argues that the time signature for the whole movement is another notational error: played in cut common time, <b>which</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> two beats per bar rather than four, the movement is, in his view, too fast.|$|E

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech <b>which</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} right to do peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E

30|$|The {{choice of}} {{business}} model {{may depend on}} the type of innovation; indeed, Pisano (2006) distinguishes between “types of pharmaceutical innovations <b>which</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> vertical integration and <b>which</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> alliance-building and R&D outsourcing”. However, for new, small technology companies the high risk and high cost of developing and commercializing a new product on their own make the platform-based and hybrid business models attractive.|$|R

25|$|A cult is a {{religious}} perversion.

A cult may take many forms but it is basically a religious movement which distorts or warps orthodox faith to the point where truth becomes perverted into a lie. A cult is impossible to define except against the absolute standard of the teaching of Holy Scripture.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the later}} canons, of especial note are Canon 33, enjoining celibacy upon all clerics, married or not, and all who {{minister}} {{at the altar}} (the most ancient canon of clerical celibacy). Also relating {{to the subject of}} clerical celibacy is Canon 27, <b>which</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> bishops and other clergy to refrain from living with women unless they are of relation. This canon is believed to be condemning the practice of Syneisaktism, or spiritual marriage, which was growing more and more popular among ascetic men and women.|$|E
25|$|Research {{published}} in January 2013 by Dr. Anthony Ruocco at the University of Toronto has highlighted two patterns of brain activity that may underlie the dysregulation of emotion indicated in this disorder: (1) increased {{activity in the}} brain circuits responsible for the experience of heightened emotional pain, coupled with (2) reduced activation of the brain circuits that normally regulate or suppress these generated painful emotions. These two neural networks are seen to be dysfunctionally operative in the frontolimbic regions, but the specific regions vary widely in individuals, <b>which</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> the analysis of more neuroimaging studies.|$|E
