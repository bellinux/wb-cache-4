5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scorpio {{has managed}} to capture a secret agent named Mr. Bont. Scorpio intends to have Bont killed with a laser, but Bont uses a coin to free himself from his {{restraints}} before attempting to flee. However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Springfield. At first, Homer is opposed to this, saying {{that he has been}} doing a great job {{for the first time in}} his life, but nobody else is happy. Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the U.S. military, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place. He finds Scorpio, explains the situation, and asks what to do. Scorpio advises Homer that he should do what is best for his family.|$|E

25|$|When Titanic sank at 2:20a.m., Boxhall {{suggested}} to the occupants {{that they should}} go back to pick people up from the water. However, they refused outright. Boxhall found this puzzling, as only a short time before the women had pleaded with Smith for their husbands to be allowed to accompany them, yet now they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> save them (although actually only one woman, Mrs. Walter Douglas, had left a husband on board).

The brilliance of the show under Levinson was lost this season. It's like watching {{the sinking of the}} Titanic. The problem is that the iceberg is the guys who built the ship [...] the producers.

500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E

Irene, who had been treating Andy with disdain over the way Erin spoke of him, sees that he is a nice person and encourages Erin to go back with him.

5000|$|According to Attila, {{the band}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make an album that [...] "sounded like Mayhem." [...] He said that [...] "After the Ordo album, {{which was a}} little bit progressive—maybe a little bit too much—almost like a fusion album where riffs were not {{repeated}} and the rhythm was always out or different or kind of twisted, we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> from there instead of going forward in that direction. Every Mayhem album has a kind of unique aspect, but we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a little bit more traditional extreme metal. Of course, there’s all these elements that Mayhem has built up for itself as a band, but we still <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> something that was straightforward musically and a little more brutal and more like extreme metal." ...|$|R

[...] "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out." [...] Norris acknowledged, [...] "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid." [...] On April 29, Norris suggested that [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] be called off: [...] "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead.

2500|$|Halloween in the Castro {{was tied}} to the LGBT culture of San Francisco and [...] began in the 1950-1960s in the Tenderloin/Polk street area of the city where the {{mainstream}} gay bars were first centralized. The event traces its history to the ostracism of LGBT people {{in the first half}} of the 20th century from mainstream culture which led to community identity and using gay bars as a focal point for socializing, networking and organizing politically. After World War II, in the 1940s, the San Francisco Bay Area became a haven for LGBT military personnel who didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their old lives. In the 1950s, a group of gay bars in San Francisco's Tenderloin area helped create a strip of venues for [...] "sex, drugs and late night fun". There has also been a South-of-Market (SoMa) leather subculture and BDSM bar scene with gay-focussed sex clubs sharing Folsom street, a tradition which is carried on with the annual Folsom Street Fair. The nearby business- and tourist-oriented area, Union Square, was also popular for cruising for sex and was open to gay men whereas the Tenderloin was where drag queens, t-girls and prostitutes of all orientations were known to congregate publicly in the city, because they were unwelcome in gay bars at that time.|$|E
