5|$|After {{learning}} {{that they have}} lost Prestige Direct, Jim, Dwight and Harry retreat outside for a coffee break. They end up having a conversation over what they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> their lives, {{if they were not}} working for Dunder Mifflin. Jim jokingly says that he would be a beet growing competitor during the national contests while Harry would retire after selling one big item such as an airplane. Before he leaves, Harry says that Robert will be the ruin of the company and says they will not be working for Dunder Mifflin in six months, leaving a look of concern on Dwight and Jim's faces.|$|E
5|$|Karl Schäfer {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{to when the}} player arrives in a remote town {{in the mountains of}} Tibet in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by René Auberjonois. At the time of his appearance, he has been living in the village for 70 years. During World War II, he had led an Ahnenerbe expedition to find the entrance of Shambhala. However, afraid of what the Nazis <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the power found in the Cintamani Stone, Schäfer shot and killed all {{of the members of the}} expedition but himself.|$|E
5|$|Like most stadiums {{demolished}} {{during this}} time whose replacements were located nearby (including the Civic Arena over a decade later), the site of Three Rivers Stadium mostly became a parking lot. Much like the Pittsburgh Penguins <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the site of Civic Arena, the Steelers retained development rights {{to the site of}} Three Rivers, and would later build Stage AE on portions of the site, as well as an office building that hosts the studios for Root Sports Pittsburgh, the headquarters of StarKist Tuna, and the regional headquarters of Del Monte Foods. On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Franco Harris made the reception in the parking lot. In 2015, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette moved into a new office building also built on a portion on the site after 53 years in the former Pittsburgh Press building and more than two centuries in Downtown.|$|E

25|$|The MRAP {{program has}} been criticized for its high, nearly $50billion cost, the {{potential}} logistical difficulties due to high fuel consumption and varied designs, a greater disconnection between troops and the local population due to MRAPs' massive size and menacing appearance conflicting with current counter-insurgency (COIN) strategy, and unclear disposal. In 2007, it was unknown what the U.S. military <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> MRAPs following its withdrawal from Iraq, since they are expensive to transport and operate. MRAP funding has pulled money away from other tactical vehicle programs, most noticeably the Humvee replacement, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which has been delayed by two years.|$|E

25|$|After a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at {{the front}} of the drive is {{manually}} lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle clamping hub, and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some 5¼-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer 5¼-inch drives and all 3½-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button. On Apple Macintosh computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation.|$|E

[...] Worsley would often direct the helmsman from the crow's nest, from where he could see any breaks in the ice.

500|$|Although the duo had deleted {{their back}} {{catalogue}} in the UK with immediate effect, international licensees retained the contractual right to distribute KLF recordings {{for a number}} of years. The KLF, like any other artist, were also entitled to Performing Right Society royalties every time one of their songs was played on the radio or television. Rather than spend these earnings or invest them for personal gain, the duo decided the money would be used to fund a new art foundation - The K Foundation. [...] "Having created an artistic machine that created money", said GQ Magazine, [...] "they [...] invented a machine for destroying it."

500|$|As they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> {{all their}} operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and {{alterations}} {{after the first}} performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, [...] "I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself towards me. Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain {{at the end of}} Act II." [...] The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.|$|E

[...] Ryan McCaffrey of IGN gave Halo 4 a very positive review, considering {{it to be the}} best game of the series to date and the best Xbox 360 game of 2012; he called it [...] "a bar-raising triumph for the entire first-person shooter genre." [...] Wesley Yin-Poole of Eurogamer remarked that although he was initially sceptical of changes being made to the formula, 343's greatest achievement was managing to stay true to what Halo is.

500|$|After an American tour in 1970, {{bass player}} Glenn Cornick {{was fired from}} the band, and was {{replaced}} with Jeffrey Hammond, {{an old friend of}} Ian Anderson's. Aqualung would be the first recording Hammond <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the band. It would also mark the first time John Evan had recorded a full album with the band, as his only prior involvement was to provide several keyboard parts on the previous 1970 album, Benefit. The album {{was one of the first}} to be recorded at the newly opened studios of Island Records in Basing Street, London. Led Zeppelin were recording their untitled fourth album at the same time. In an interview on the 25th anniversary edition of the album, Tull's bandleader Ian Anderson said that trying to record in that studio was very difficult, because of its [...] "horrible, cold, echoey" [...] feel. There were two recording studios at the location; Led Zeppelin worked in the smaller studio while Tull got the larger, which was the main body of a converted church. The orchestrals were arranged by David Palmer, who had worked with the band since 1968's This Was, and would later join as a keyboard player. Aqualung would be the last Jethro Tull album to include Clive Bunker as a band member, as he retired shortly after recording to start a family.|$|E
500|$|Barr {{received}} some media exposure {{a few days}} after his nomination by visiting New York City to appear on both the Colbert Report and on Glenn Beck's Headline News program for an hour-long interview. The former appearance was part of the campaign's strategy to inform young voters and former Ron Paul supporters about the campaign. During the interview with Colbert, Barr was asked why he [...] "voted for the PATRIOT Act" [...] if he was such a [...] "big advocate of personal privacy." [...] He responded by saying that the Bush Administration [...] "went back on everything they told us [...] they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the PATRIOT Act." [...] In early June, the campaign dealt with the issue of racism when a white supremacist group posted a Barr endorsement on Stormfront.org, urging whites to vote for the [...] "best man" [...] rather than the [...] "liberal" [...] John McCain. The Barr campaign repudiated this endorsement. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated, [...] "We do not want and will not accept the support of haters. Tell the haters I said don't let the door hit you in the backside on the way out." [...] He emphasized that [...] "anyone with love in their heart for our country and for every resident of our country regardless of race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation is welcome with open arms." ...|$|E

500|$|Two stadium {{legs were}} {{tentatively}} planned and {{dependent on the}} success of the arena tour: the North American [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg from August–November 1992, and the European [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg from May–August 1993. While their playing stadiums was motivated by pragmatic concerns, U2 saw it as an artistic challenge as well, imagining what Salvador Dalí or Andy Warhol <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> such spaces. Rehearsals for [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] began in Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pennsylvania, in early August 1992; a public rehearsal show was held on 7 August. Technical problems and pacing issues forced refinement to the show. Six days before the official leg-opening Giants Stadium show, the group delayed the concert by a day, due to the difficulty of assembling the large outdoor production and the destruction of the largest screen in a windstorm. By the time [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] began, Achtung Baby had sold fourmillion copies in the US. Tickets for the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg went on sale in November 1992. The leg, which began in May 1993, was the band's first full stadium tour of Europe and marked the first time they had visited certain areas. Scheduling for the [...] "Zoomerang" [...] stadium leg in the Pacific from November–December 1993 afforded the band more off-days between shows than previous legs, but this amplified the exhaustion and restlessness that had set in by the tour's end.|$|E
500|$|Unlike later albums, Thriller did {{not have}} an {{official}} tour, but the Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson held a press conference and announced that he would donate his share of the proceeds, an estimated , to charity. His charitable work and humanitarian awards continued with the release of [...] "We Are the World" [...] (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie. The song was recorded on January 28, 1985 and released worldwide in March 1985 to aid the poor in the United States and Africa. The song earned $63 million for famine relief, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. Although the American Music Award directors removed the charity song from the competition because they felt it would be inappropriate, the AMA show in 1986 concluded with a tribute to the song in honor of its first anniversary. The project's creators received two special AMA honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and entertainment promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.|$|E
500|$|This {{question}} (regarding {{the script}} development) {{was put to}} Ridley Scott by Total Film magazine: [...] "There were lots of rewrites on Hannibal—what was the main problem with the original material?" [...] Scott replied: [...] "That's inaccurate, because {{there were very few}} rewrites once I brought in Steve Zaillian. If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business, Steve Zaillian would be one of them. We discussed Hannibal endlessly." [...] Asked if he had read Mamet's draft, he said: [...] "Yes. He is very fast, very efficient, but he was off doing a film. 'Hannibal' was green lit and his first draft only took about a month. But I was scared {{that he would not be}} able to give me enough attention, because that draft needed a lot of work. So I moved on basically." [...] Scott has said there were writing and [...] "structural problems" [...] as to what they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> parts of the film. One of Zaillian's key objectives was to revise the script by David Mamet until it pleased all parties, meaning the [...] "love" [...] story would need to be done by suggestion instead of by [...] "assault". Scott worked through the script with Zaillian for 28 days making him [...] "sweat through it with him and discuss every inch of the way with him." [...] After 25 days Scott suddenly realized that Zaillian was [...] "exorcising the 600 pages of the book. He was distilling through discussion what he was gonna finally do...Frankly I could have just made it." ...|$|E
