Wyzanski or a (Judge) Learned Hand. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> respect for the law, a knowledge of the principles and a desire to do the best job you can. Good lawyers make good judges. Any lawyer can make a judge look bad. But a good lawyer playing by the rules, playing it straight makes a good case, and the judge is merely incidental, truly an impartial arbiter. A judge should just be there with a knowledge of the law and leave the lawyering to the lawyers." ...|$|E

Il Sole 24 Ores political analyst Stefano Folli said: [...] "...this is yet another reason for Italy to feel close to the reconfirmed leader the United States and Europe know they either stand together or fall together." [...] Nomisma research institute's Alessandro Politi agreed that the Eurozone's future depends on systemically managing dialogue with the United States to coordinate the differing economic policies of each of its member states. [...] "We need to stop losing time on personal interests. Obama's re-election gives Europe one more opportunity to help itself and to fix the crisis, but the single currency region has to grasp it with firmer belief." [...] The London-based Royal United Services Institute's analyst Shashank Joshi also said: [...] "With the re-election of Obama, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong confidence on the British side that the U.S. administration will be engaged more on Syria from the get-go." ...|$|E

5000|$|With {{the word}} [...] "stretch", Penny is {{referring}} to the editing effect {{of the same name}} in Photoshop. [...] "Anamorph" [...] is an optics term that refers to the illusion created when a distorted image appears as if is in normal perspective when viewed from a particular angle. Instead of working from a normal image, skewing it in Photoshop, and then rendering it in clay, as one might expect, Penny creates his three-dimensional sculptures from a skewed sketch of an imaginary character which he then moulds into clay. Penny describes the process in the following geometric terms. If you stretch out a cube by each of the eight corners in completely different directions and angles until there are no right angles or parallel lines left, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> three-dimensional rhomboid. When viewed at a certain angle it may appear to be a normal cube, but physically it remains distorted. When photographed Penny’s sculptures can be compressed in Photoshop to create a very realistic two-dimensional image of a naturally proportioned person, but everything around them will be distorted.|$|E

[...] In a later interview on NPR's Studio 360, Williams stated he was raised on country music: [...] "Black music didn't start 'til 10 at night until 4 in the morning and I was in bed by then... If you strip my tracks, take away all the horns and guitar licks, <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> country song." [...] However, he also continued to write and produce deep soul songs for other musicians, including Z. Z. Hill and Irma Thomas. In 1971 in collaboration with co-producer and writer the legendary George Semper he released [...] "Monster Walk Pt. 1 and 2" [...] by the Rhythm 'N' Blues Classical Funk Band on Mankind Records label. Produced for Jerry Williams Productions, Inc.and in spite of modest sales the record once again demonstrated his entrepreneurial skill as an artist.|$|E

Many also said getting alcohol and drugs was easy there.A 2016 HM Inspectorate of Prisons report stated the prison was dangerous with far too much violence. Mike Rolfe of the Prison Officers Association said: [...] <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> really unhelpful mix around the prison estate of prisoner-staff relationships now, where staff numbers have been cut so that staff don’t feel confident or empowered {{to be able to}} do their role. That’s led to a breakdown of the relationship. [...] Rolfe added a good relation was needed where prison officers could encourage prisoners to work or study and help prisoners turn their lives round. Rolfe has also described Swaleside as [...] "a particularly difficult place to work" [...] because of an [...] "acute staff shortfall" [...] and high levels of violence.Former Swaleside governor, John Podmore, said prisons were “undoubtedly dangerous” and added: We should be sending fewer people to jail in absolute terms but we need to be looking at who we are locking up, why we are locking them up and how we deal with the way in which they are offending against society.

40|$|To {{start with}} a {{caricature}} and physical metaphor, this text is about how to turn a supertanker {{by the force of}} a mixmaster. More literally, it is about how a project group varying in size between two and five researchers has been working for a period of six years on organizational change in the production units of the largest Oil Company in Norway [...] a company whose contribution constitutes approximately 10 % of the Norwegian BNP. When what you need to be is a set of tug boats but <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mixmaster, simple engine tuning is not enough; so this text is about experiences of interventions, small as well as large, in a large scale system. The text outlines and highlights glimpses of the actions taken during this period and experiences of what works; it offers theoretical conceptualisations of leadership and organizational change; and it represents an indirect shift in perspective of project actions which entailed moving from organizational development interventions, toward the integration and institutionalisation of leadership development for the purpose of organizational development.
