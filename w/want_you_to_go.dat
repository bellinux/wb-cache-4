500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none {{of the rest of us}} Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Senate but the people would send you." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2014, Paul {{joined the}} Tea Party-affiliated {{conservative}} advocacy group FreedomWorks in filing a class-action lawsuit {{charging that the}} federal government's bulk collection of Americans' phone records metadata {{is a violation of}} the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Commenting on the lawsuit at a press conference, Paul said, [...] "I'm not against the NSA, I'm not against spying, I'm not against looking at phone records... I just <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a judge, have an individual's name and [...] a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says." [...] He also said there was no evidence the surveillance of phone metadata had stopped terrorism. Critics, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Steven Aftergood, the director of the American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, called the lawsuit a political [...] "stunt". Paul's political campaign organization said that the names of members of the public who went to Paul's websites and signed on as potential class-action participants would be available in the organization's database for future campaign use. On the announcement of the filing of the lawsuit, Mattie Fein, the spokeswoman for and former wife of attorney Bruce Fein, complained that Fein's intellectual contribution to the lawsuit had been stolen and that he had not been properly paid for his work. Paul's representatives denied the charge, and Fein issued a statement saying that Mattie Fein had not been authorized to speak for him on the matter and that he had in fact been paid for his work on the lawsuit.|$|E
500|$|Within a few weeks, Hall {{was making}} {{preparations}} for a sledging trip {{with the aim}} of beating Sir William Parry's furthest north record. Mistrust amongst the men in charge showed again when Hall told Tyson that [...] "I cannot trust that man (Captain Budington). I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with me, but don't know how to leave him alone with the ship." [...] There is some evidence that Budington may have been an alcoholic; on at least three occasions he raided the ship's stores, including the alcohol kept by the scientists for preservation of specimens. Hall had complained about Budington's drunken behavior, and it fully came to light from the crew's testimony at the inquest following the expedition. With Tyson watching over the ship, Hall took two sledges with first mate Chester, and the native guides Ebierbing and Hendrik, leaving on Oct 10, 1871. The day after leaving, Hall sent Hendrik back to the ship to retrieve a number of forgotten items. Hall also sent back a note to Bessels, reminding him to wind the chronometers at the right time every day. In his book Trial by Ice, Richard Parry postulated that such a note from the uneducated Hall must have rankled Bessels, who held a number of degrees from Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Jena. It was another example of Hall's micromanagement of the expedition. Before he left on the overland trip, Hall gave Budington a detailed list of instructions regarding how to manage the ship in his absence. This likely did not sit well with a sailing master with over 20years of experience.|$|E

2500|$|Encouraging a Response by Frustrating It - This {{paradoxical}} approach acts {{directly on}} the patient's own resistance to change.

United States (1935), the Court also voted {{unanimously}} to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional {{on the grounds that}} it gave the president [...] "unfettered discretion" [...] to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was [...] "the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history."

2500|$|Lamon's {{professional}} association with Lincoln started in 1852. Lamon became the prosecuting {{attorney for the}} Old Eighth Judicial district and subsequently moved to Bloomington, Illinois, in 1858. [...] While Lamon had Southern sympathies and his hatred of abolitionism set him apart from Lincoln, they remained friends, despite their very different characters. Lamon joined the then-young Republican Party and campaigned for Lincoln in 1860. [...] Lincoln was up against New York Senator William Seward for the Republican nomination, and Lamon proved his friendship by printing up extra tickets for the convention to fill the hall with Lincoln supporters. [...] When Lincoln was elected President, Lamon hoped for a foreign diplomatic post, but {{received a letter from}} his friend that said, [...] "Dear Hill, I need you. [...] I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Washington with me and be prepared for a long stay." [...] Lamon then accompanied him as he traveled from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington D.C. in February 1861. [...] This trip would prove to be eventful.|$|E
2500|$|On November 19, 1823, at age 25, Smith died {{of mercury}} {{poisoning}} from calomel, {{which had been}} administered to cure a case of “bilious colic.” Smith was a believer in his brother Joseph's claim that Joseph was to recover an ancient record from a nearby hill. His death occurred two months after Joseph’s {{first visit to the}} hill from which he was eventually said to have recovered the golden plates that would later be claimed as the source for the Book of Mormon. According to a history written by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith, as Smith lay dying he called each member of his family to his bedside to give them counsel. To his brother Hyrum, Smith said, [...] "I have done all I could to make our dear parents comfortable. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on and finish the house." [...] He urged his brother Joseph to fulfill all of the requirements to obtain the record. Smith's death had a significant effect on the family, resulting in Joseph taking more of a leadership role.|$|E

[...] (According to John Dean, Goldwater actually suggested that good Christians ought to kick Falwell in the [...] "nuts", but the news media [...] "changed the anatomical reference.") Goldwater also had harsh words for his one-time political protegé, President Reagan, particularly after the Iran–Contra Affair became public in 1986. Journalist Robert MacNeil, a friend of Goldwater's from the 1964 Presidential campaign, recalled interviewing him in his office shortly afterward. [...] "He {{was sitting in his}} office with his hands on his cane... and he said to me, 'Well, aren't you going to ask me about the Iran arms sales?' It had just been announced that the Reagan administration had sold arms to Iran. And I said, 'Well, if I asked you, what would you say?' He said, 'I'd say it's the god-damned stupidest foreign policy blunder this country's ever made!'", though aside from the Iran–Contra scandal, Goldwater thought nonetheless that Reagan was a good president. In 1988 during that year's [...] presidential campaign, he pointedly told vice-presidential nominee Dan Quayle at a campaign event in Arizona [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and tell George Bush to start talking about the issues." ...|$|E

[...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England.

[...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard.

Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to think at the screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents.
