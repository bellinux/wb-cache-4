Hence, the period {{for which there is}} no {{evidence}} that Matthew's ideas are present in Darwin's work, the records of his development of ideas, and expression of those concepts in his writing can be shown to extend from the time he was leaving for the Beagle voyage, up until the coalescence of his ideas into his cohesive system of evolution by natural selection in 1858. Niles Eldredge, points out the very valid point that seeing Matthew’s descriptions at any point during that extended period, would likely have resulted in an integral, preformed model being described by Darwin from the outset, whereas what <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> in his notes is realisation of the full picture from development of incremental sketches, ...|$|E

2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have,</b> and new laws would not give us any more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.|$|E

5000|$|Of course, {{the result}} of rule (1) is {{ungrammatical}} while {{the result of}} rule (2) is grammatical. So, rule (2) is (approximately) what <b>we</b> <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> in English, not rule (1). The claim, then, first is that children don't see sentences as complicated as this one enough to witness {{a case where the}} two hypotheses yield different results, and second that just based on the positive evidence of the simple sentences, children could not possibly decide between (1) and (2). Moreover, even sentences such as (1) and (2) are compatible with a number of incorrect rules (such as [...] "front any auxiliary). Thus, if rule (2) was not innately known to infants, we would expect half of the adult population to use (1) and half to use (2). Since that doesn't occur, rule (2) must be innately known.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} to Billboard, Ross said that [...] "Dark Side" [...] was the first song written for the album and it generated inspiration for the band to write other songs.

And then we just kept writing songs and beating off songs that we previously had. We had a checklist; We'd be like, 'Alright, 'Dark Side' is better than this song, so it'll take that song's spot, and then this song can take this other song's spot.' We basically worked our way down and replaced the whole record". The funky guitar riffs came about with a bass line from Rocky, then the band sprinkled a little synth on top".
