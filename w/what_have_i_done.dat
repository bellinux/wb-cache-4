500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was modified}} {{from its original}} draft form during the film's shooting. [...] Price himself suggested numerous dialogue changes for his character. [...] In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier. [...] Don Medina responds: [...] "Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. (turning) What brings you to us?" [...] Price penciled in the suggestions [...] "that must be kept in constant repair" [...] and [...] "that cannot be stopped". [...] Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence. [...] During Nicholas' death scene, after falling {{to the bottom of}} the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, [...] "Elizabeth. [...] <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> to you? [...] (beat) [...] <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> to you?" [...] The camera was to then cut directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden. [...] Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.|$|E
500|$|On 3 November, Frederick and {{his entourage}} {{departed}} for San Remo. At San Remo two days later, on 5 November, Frederick entirely lost his voice and experienced severe pain throughout his throat. Upon examination, Dr. Hovell discovered a new growth under the left vocal cord; when the news reached William and the German government, it caused great consternation. The following day, Mackenzie issued a bulletin stating that while {{there was no immediate}} danger to the Crown Prince, his illness had [...] "unfortunately taken an unfavourable turn," [...] and that he had requested advice from other specialists, including the Austrian professor of laryngology Leopold Schrötter and Dr. Hermann Krause of Berlin. On 9 November, Schrötter and Krause diagnosed the new growth as malignant, and said it was unlikely Frederick could live another year. All the doctors in attendance, including Mackenzie, now concluded that Frederick's disease was indeed laryngeal cancer, as new lesions had appeared {{on the right side of}} the larynx, and that an immediate and total laryngectomy was required to save his life; Moritz Schmidt, one of the doctors, subsequently said that the earlier growths found in May had also been cancerous. Frederick was devastated by the news, bursting into tears upon being informed by Mackenzie and crying, [...] "To think I should have such a horrid disgusting illness ... I had so hoped to have been of use to my country. Why is Heaven so cruel to me? <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> to be thus stricken and condemned?" [...] Even at this stage, however, Frederick, in a private discussion with his wife, decided against the laryngectomy as it was itself highly risky. He sent his doctors a written statement that he would remain in Italy and would only submit to a tracheotomy if he was at risk of suffocating due to his condition. The news was greeted with shock in Berlin and generated further hatred against Victoria, now seen as a domineering [...] "foreigner" [...] who was manipulating her husband. Some politicians suggested that Frederick be made to relinquish his position in the line of succession in favour of his son Wilhelm, but Bismarck firmly stated that Frederick would succeed his ailing father [...] "whether he is ill or not, [...] whether the K is then unable permanently to perform his duties," [...] would then be determined per the relevant provisions of the Prussian Constitution. [...] Despite the renewed diagnosis of cancer, Frederick's condition appeared to improve after 5 November, and he became more optimistic; through January 1888 there remained some hope that the diagnosis was incorrect. Both Frederick and Victoria retained their faith in Mackenzie, who reexamined Frederick's throat several times in December and gave a good prognosis, again doubting whether the growths had been cancerous.|$|E

2500|$|In a November 2015 phone {{interview}} with NME, Robert Carlyle confirmed {{he would be}} returning for the sequel to play Begbie. According to Carlyle, he {{and other members of}} the Trainspotting cast had already read John Hodge's script, which would take place 20 years (much like its intended 2016 release) after the original plot. Filming started on 16 May 2016, Carlyle praised Hodge's screenplay and hinted that T2 [...] "is going to be quite emotional for people. Because the film sort of tells you to think about yourself. You are going to be thinking: 'Fuck. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> with my life? ...|$|E
2500|$|Educated at the {{independent}} Tonbridge School, Fincham studied at Churchill College, Cambridge. He joined the Cambridge Footlights production team as musical director, alongside a committee which included Griff Rhys Jones, Jimmy Mulville, Rory McGrath and Clive Anderson. After leaving Footlights, Fincham composed songs, {{none of which}} were picked up for recording, and then worked on the touring version of Godspell. During a period of increasingly common unemployment, Fincham was walking on Wandsworth Common {{in the rain and}} thinking to himself: [...] "Oh my God. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>done?</b> I have made the wrong decision?" [...] Fincham applied for a job at the BBC in 1984, a position as a researcher on The Late, Late Breakfast Show after his friend Helen Fielding left to concentrate on her writing career. However, he was unsuccessful in this application.|$|E
