5|$|As {{frigatebirds}} rely {{on large}} marine predators such as tuna for their prey, overfishing threatens to significantly impact on food availability and jeopardise whole populations. As frigatebirds nest in large dense colonies in small areas, they {{are vulnerable to}} local disasters that could <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the rare species or significantly impact the widespread ones.|$|E
5|$|Despite the club's relegation, off the field, {{chairman}} Julian Rhodes {{had announced}} {{a deal to}} slash the price of watching professional football to just £138, the equivalent of £6 per match, and the cheapest season tickets in England. In June 2007, Rhodes was also joined by Mark Lawn as new joint chairman of the club. Lawn signed a deal to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the club's debts.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War the Warsaw Pact countries, {{fearing a}} food shortage, decried the beetle as a CIA plot {{to destroy the}} {{agriculture}} of the Soviet Union. Officials launched a Warsaw Pact-wide campaign to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the beetle, villainizing them in propaganda posters and pulling schoolchildren from class to gather the bugs and drown them in buckets of benzene or spirit.|$|E

50|$|The Zoidian race, {{known as}} the Ancient Zoidians in the anime, were <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> long before human colonists {{discovered}} Zi. The event that <b>wiped</b> <b>out</b> the Ancient Zoidians was not the destruction of Zi's third moon by a comet, but {{the creation of the}} Death Saurer.|$|R

5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> small populations.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. Season three of the series shows the ship enter the Delphic Expanse {{to search for a}} Xindi superweapon in response to an attack on Earth. In this episode, Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and Sub-commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) travel back to early 21st century Earth to find a group of Xindi-Reptilians who were seeking to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the human race by using a biological agent.|$|E

5|$|The Incredibles is a 2004 American computer-animated superhero film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Brad Bird, produced by Pixar Animation Studios, and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film follows a family of superheroes who are forced to hide their powers and live a quiet suburban life. Mr. Incredible's desire to help people draws the entire family into a battle with Syndrome, a former fan who now plots to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> all superheroes with his killer robot.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{was able to}} quickly replace lost birds – {{there is a high}} proportion of non-breeding, non-territorial birds able to fill vacant territories. The habitat conserved with gamebirds in mind also suited this species and its prey; gamekeepers' more successful efforts to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the northern goshawk and pine marten – predators of the Eurasian sparrowhawk – may have benefited it. The population increased markedly when this pressure was relaxed, for example during the First and Second World Wars.|$|E
5|$|The {{staff was}} then hidden deep below the castle and inscribed with {{powerful}} magical symbols to protect it. Before he died, Karnath broke the key into sixteen pieces and hid them throughout his castle. Centuries later, an aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, ventures inside the castle {{in order to}} defuse the orb before midnight. Should he fail, its power would be unleashed, and the resulting inter-dimensional rip would <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the human race.|$|E

5|$|Although B.cuneata {{was first}} {{collected}} before 1880, {{it was not}} until 1981 that Australian botanist Alex George formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This Banksia is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As Banksia cuneata is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency—fires recurring within four years could <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. Banksia cuneata is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.|$|E
5|$|During the episode, Walter {{is shown}} to be agoraphobic and unwilling to leave his lab after Olivia {{arranged}} his release from a mental asylum. He becomes panicked when he briefly sees images of a man, Peter, in the lab; Olivia attributes this to Walter lacking any foothold in reality. That evening, Walter is preparing for bed while September, outside, readies a device he has assembled to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the remains of Peter's existence. But {{at the last moment}} September disarms the device and walks away. Later Walter sees yet another image of Peter on his television and is terrified.|$|E
5|$|Finding Konrad's {{executed}} command team, Walker uses a small {{radio to}} communicate with who he believes to be Konrad himself, who challenges the morality of his actions throughout the story. Konrad then manipulates Walker into executing an Emirati survivor or a 33rd soldier, who both committed serious crimes. Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading a raid on the city's last water supply. Delta aids Riggs {{with the aim of}} crippling the 33rd's operations, but Riggs destroys the supply instead, admitting he wanted to <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the remaining population of Dubai to cover up the atrocities of the 33rd.|$|E

5|$|Houlding died in 1902, and in 1905 the {{ownership}} of the club was restructured. Of the existing 3,000 shares, 2,000 were held by the Houlding family. The club owed a debt of £10,000 to Houlding, and a further £5,000 bank overdraft was guaranteed by his family. The family offered {{to give up the}} 2,000 shares and <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee. The board agreed, and a new share issue was released in 1906 with 15,000 shares available for £1 each. Following the share issue, McKenna became chairman of the club.|$|E
5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed to continue its military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, Banksia caleyi {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.caleyi belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings take at least three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may <b>wipe</b> <b>out</b> local populations of reseeders.|$|E
