50|$|John R. Oishei (1886-1968) {{formed the}} Tri-Continental Corporation in 1917. This company {{introduced}} the first windshield wiper, Rain Rubber, for the slotted, two-piece windshields found {{on many of}} the automobiles of the time. Today Trico Products is one of the world's leading manufacturers of windshield wiping systems, windshield <b>wiper</b> <b>blades</b> and refills, with wiper plants on five continents.

50|$|On {{his wedding}} night in 1953, an errant {{champagne}} cork renders college engineering professor Robert Kearns (Greg Kinnear) almost completely blind {{in his left}} eye. A decade later, he is happily married to Phyllis (Lauren Graham) {{and the father of}} six children. As he drives his Ford Galaxie through a light rain, the constant movement of the windshield wipers irritates his troubled vision. The incident inspires him to create a <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> mechanism modeled on the human eye, which blinks every few seconds rather than continuously.|$|E

50|$|The XT {{was loaded}} with {{features}} rarely found on small cars, such as a turbocharger, a computer-controlled engine and transmission, adjustable height suspension and an optional digital instrument cluster. The air suspension was inspired by various manufacturers who used Hydropneumatic suspension, such as Citroen, and Mercedes-Benz. The XT also had some features found on few other cars, such as an electronic in-dash trip computer, retractable flaps covering the door handles, and a single <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> for the entire windscreen. Pass-through folding rear seats and racing style front seats were standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|In 1946 a Chicago Police officer's {{salary was}} $2900 per year. The first parking ticket Jack wrote was for an {{illegally}} parked car on Argyle Street; {{as he was}} tucking the ticket under the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade,</b> the man that owned the car ran up and tried {{to persuade him to}} tear it up. He was a small political figure in the city, and when the court case came up, the judge threw it out. This incident {{had a profound impact on}} Muller and set the stage of fighting with corrupt city officials for his entire career.|$|E
50|$|To combat this drying, {{nearly all}} inkjet {{printers}} include {{a mechanism to}} reapply moisture to the printhead. Typically there is no separate supply of pure ink-free solvent available to do this job, and so instead the ink itself is used to remoisten the printhead. The printer attempts to fire all nozzles at once, and as the ink sprays out, some of it wicks across the printhead to the dry channels and partially softens the hardened ink. After spraying, a rubber <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> is swept across the printhead to spread the moisture evenly across the printhead, and the jets are again all fired to dislodge any ink clumps blocking the channels.|$|E

McCann then left the band {{in the middle of the}} night before the band was set to fly to Arizona for a gig. When the band woke up and McCann was nowhere to be found; only a Dear John letter was left behind underneath the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> of the band's van parked outside. The band still boarded the plane and flew down to Arizona without a drummer. The band hooked up with the drummer from Where Eagles Dare, a hardcore punk outfit from Arizona, and used their drummer for the show, teaching him the songs the night before the gig.|$|E
50|$|New {{features}} include the unique FrontBass system (it uses the free {{spaces in the}} aluminium structures {{in front of the}} footwell as resonance spaces for the bass loudspeakers) and adaptive windscreen wipe/wash system MAGIC VISION CONTROL, which supplies water from the <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> as required and depending on the direction of wipe. The R231 is also available with two different suspension systems: semi-active adjustable damping as standard. The optional active suspension system ABC (Active Body Control) is available as an alternative. Both suspension variants are combined with a new electromechanical Direct-Steer system featuring speed-sensitive power steering and a ratio that can be varied across the steering wheel angle and it also reduces the amount of steering required when parking and manoeuvring.|$|E
5000|$|The Trico Plant No. 1 was {{the first}} factory built by Trico, which {{went on to become}} a major {{manufacturer}} of windshield wipers. The company was founded by John R. Oishei, who in 1917 was the manager of the Teck Theater in Buffalo, when while driving in a heavy rain he struck a bicyclist with his car. [...] This inspired Oishei to team up with John Jepson to market the windshield <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> Jepson had invented. The business first rented manufacturing space in North Buffalo, but in 1919 the Pierce Arrow Motor Company contracted the manufacturer to supply manually operated wipers for its luxury cars, and in 1920 Cadillac, Packard, and Lincoln did the same. The growing business, now fully owned by Oishei, purchased and moved its operations to the former ice house of the Christian Weyand Brewery at 624 Ellicott Street, recently made vacant by Prohibition.|$|E

5000|$|... 1956: Panoramic Rainbow or “P-R” Blades. The first {{windshield}} <b>wiper</b> <b>blades</b> {{to have an}} arc. A pair of spring-tensioned levers pre-flexed {{the blades}} to maintain constant pressure on the windshield. It was TRICO's most popular blade up to and through the late 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside a}} laser printer is somewhat delicate and, once damaged, often impossible to repair. The drum {{in particular is}} a critical component: it must not be left exposed to ambient light {{for more than a}} few hours, as light is what causes it to lose its charge and will eventually wear it out. Anything that interferes with the operation of the laser such as a scrap of torn paper may prevent the laser from discharging some portion of the drum, causing those areas to appear as white vertical streaks. If the neutral <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> fails to remove residual toner from the drum's surface, that toner may circulate on the drum a second time, causing smears on the printed page with each revolution. If the charge roller becomes damaged or does not have enough power, it may fail to adequately negatively charge the surface of the drum, allowing the drum to pick up excessive toner on the next revolution from the developer roll and causing a repeated but fainter image from the previous revolution to appear down the page.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of three methods {{for the prevention}} {{and the removal of}} ice on an airplane windshield has been completed. The methods were: electric heating; hot-air heating; and an alcohol-dispensing, rotating <b>wiper</b> <b>blade.</b> The results showed that vision through the airplane windshield could be maintained during severe icing conditions by the use of heat. When put in operation prior to the formation of ice on the windshield the rotating <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> prevented the formation of ice. A combination of heated air and a rotating <b>wiper</b> <b>blade</b> would appear to protect against formation of ice on the windshield exterior, to prevent frost on the interior and to provide for the removal of rainfall...|$|E

Relation between these variables was cleared through test. Also, designed and proposed tester for measuring friction coefficient of <b>wiper</b> <b>blade...</b>|$|E
