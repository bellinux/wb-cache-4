40|$|Traditional {{measurement}} of multimedia systems, e. g. linear impulse response and transfer function, are sufficient but not faultless. For these methods the pure linear system is considered and nonlinearities, {{which are usually}} included in real systems, are disregarded. One {{of the ways to}} describe and analyze a nonlinear system is by using Volterra Series representation. However, this representation uses an enormous number of coefficients.

The components of the vectors are invisible and formally inaccessible, although expressions for the components could be constructed. Expressions that have been built from the scalar and vector products can be simplified using a rule-based system. In order to develop and specify the system, an axiomatic system for a vector-product space is given. In addition, a brief description is given of an implementation in Aldor.

In this <b>work</b> rule-driven <b>simplification</b> and transformation of point-free terms are studied in more detail. For this purpose a tool called SimpliFree was developed. The main idea is to automate the construc-tion of a Haskell file that applies some given strategies to point-free terms, by the use of generic traversals. Some default strategies were included in the tool, that can simplify most terms and can be easily updated by the user, to minimise the needed intervention. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. When {{two or more}} {{databases}} {{are combined}} into a global one, integrity may be violated even when each database is consistent with its own local integrity constraints. Efficient methods for checking global integrity in data integration systems are called for: answers to queries can then be trusted, because either the global database {{is known to be}} consistent or suitable actions have been taken to provide consistent views. The present <b>work</b> generalizes <b>simplification</b> techniques for integrity checking in traditional databases to the combined case. Knowledge of local consistency is employed, perhaps together with given a priori constraints on the combination, so that only a minimal number of tuples needs to be considered. Combination from scratch, integration of a new source, and absorption of local updates are dealt with for both the local-as-view and global-as-view approaches to data integration. ...|$|R

40|$|This <b>work</b> {{discusses}} <b>simplification</b> algorithms for {{the generation}} of a multiresolution family of solid representations from an initial polyhedral solid. We introduce the Discretized Polyhedra Simplification (DPS), a framework for polyhedra simplification using space decomposition models. The DPS {{is based on a}} new error measurement and provides a sound scheme for error-bounded, geometry and topology simplification while preserving the validity of the model. A method following this framework, Direct DPS, is presented and discussed. Direct DPS uses an octree for topology simplification and error control, and generates valid solid representations. Our method is also able to generate approximations which do not interpenetrate the original model, either being completely contained in the input solid or bounding it. Unlike most of the current methods, our algorithm can deal and also produces faces with arbitrary complexity. An extension of the Direct method for appearance preservation, called Hybrid DPS, is also discussed. Postprint (published version...|$|R
