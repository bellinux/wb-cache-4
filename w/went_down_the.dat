5|$|American Philo McGiffin, who was {{on board}} Zhenyuan, {{reported}} after the battle {{that there had been}} a variety of stories about the fate of the ship, but one that the survivors agreed on was the tale of the interaction between Captain Deng and his dog. As the ship <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> captain ended up clinging to a piece of debris. However, his dog swam to him. Deng released the debris, and unable to swim, he drowned along with the dog. Chinese sources have subsequently stated Captain Deng made the decision to go down with Zhiyuan. In this retelling, the dog attempted to drag him to safety, but he refused to be moved and both died.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} then <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River {{and joined}} the army {{on the way to}} Yorktown. At midnight on September 2, 270 of the regiment and other units arrived at Christiana Bridge over the Delaware. The units unloaded the boats and transported supplies for the Continental Army to Elk Landing during the three days before the boat carriages arrived. On September 24, Hazen was given command of the second brigade of Marquis de Lafayette's Light Division, to which the Canadian Regiment (now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Antill) was assigned. After cantonment at Williamsburg, the regiment arrived at Yorktown on September 28.|$|E

5|$|The legendary saga Yngvars saga víðförla {{describes}} the last expedition of the Vikings into the Caspian, dated to 1041 and possibly {{connected with the}} Georgian-Byzantine Battle of Sasireti in which a Varangian force participated around the same time; in the saga much legend is conflated with the historical facts. This expedition was launched from Sweden by Ingvar the Far-Travelled, who <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Volga into {{the land of the}} Saracens (Serkland in Norse). There are no less than twenty-six Ingvar Runestones, twenty-three of them being in the Lake Mälaren region of Uppland in Sweden, referring to Swedish warriors who went out with Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands, an expedition whose purpose was probably to reopen old trade routes, now that the Bulgars and the Khazars no longer proved obstacles. A stone to Ingvar's brother indicates that he went east for gold but that he died in the Saracen land. Afterwards, no attempts were made by the Norsemen to reopen the route between the Baltic and Caspian seas.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit of stepping outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} race start, reports of rain falling on the track caused the start to be delayed by around ten minutes. Race control {{eventually}} deemed the race to be dry enough {{to be called a}} dry race, thus the rain tyres were not necessary, but would be required later in the race. Dario Franchitti and Alex Tagliani led the field to the line, with the circuit still being dusty from the previous night's repair work. Dust clouds engulfed the start-finish straight, blinding many of the midfield runners. The top five runners managed to negotiate the first chicane cleanly, while behind, half a dozen cars were involved in a first-corner crash. Takuma Sato misjudged his braking into the first corner and clipped the rear of Will Power's Penske machine, which spun him into Scott Dixon. Hélio Castroneves could not avoid running into Dixon's stationary car at the first corner. After many drivers <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> escape road to avoid being involved in the crash, a separate accident took place between Marco Andretti and Mario Moraes. Moraes lost control of his KV Racing Technology car behind Ana Beatriz, hit Andretti and became airborne before coming to rest across the cockpit of Andretti's car. It took several minutes to extricate Andretti from his damaged machinery, but was uninjured and very critical of Moraes' driving. The crash resulted in a seven-lap caution period, and eliminated Sato, Moraes and Andretti from the race. Dixon and Castroneves both recovered to the pit lane to repair damage.|$|E

25|$|Hell Hole Dam was {{partially}} completed {{at the time}} of extremely heavy storms in December 1964. The D/S rockfill portion was up ~220' above the river bottom, but the impervious core and adj zones were only up ~35'. Debris from extreme storm runoff U/S from the dam blocked the diversion outlet and water rapidly accumulated behind the partially constructed dam. As the water came up it was seeping thru the rockfill-and when it crested the entire mass collapsed in a matter of minutes. A surge <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> canyon-washing out 2 older suspension bridges below the Long Canyon influx and at the Spanish Dry Diggings crossing near Greenwood. It then washed out the State Highway 49 bridge over the American River just below Auburn. Folsom Dam reservoir absorbed the surge below that point.|$|E
