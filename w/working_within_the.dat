5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against {{the wishes of the}} SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E

In {{the first phase of}} the plan, 50 bombs from 60–100 kt would be procured. In phase two, another 200 bombs would be procured. To clarify definitively whether nuclear tests should be carried out in Switzerland, the military chief of staff Jacob Annasohn requested of Federal Councillor Paul Chaudet, head of the Military Department, to obtain authorization for the total budget of 20 million Swiss francs from the Federal Council.|$|E

5|$|On {{the opening}} day of free agency, Hodgson signed a one-year {{contract}} with the Nashville Predators. Hodgson made the opening night roster of the Predators to begin the 2015–16 season. He was used primarily in a depth role, centering the fourth-line. After posting 8 points in 39 games, Hodgson was placed on waivers by the Predators on January 13, 2016. Hodgson passed through waivers unclaimed and was subsequently assigned to AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals the following day. Hodgson was not offered a new contract by the club, and became an unrestricted free agent on July 1. On October 3, it was announced that Hodgson had retired and would be <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Predators organization, coaching for their Little Preds Learn to Play Program.|$|E
5|$|The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde. First {{performed}} on 14 February 1895 at the St James's Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy {{in which the}} protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations. <b>Working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> social conventions of late Victorian London, the play's major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage, and the resulting satire of Victorian ways. Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus {{that it was the}} culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most enduringly popular play.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E

5|$|The term {{in office}} of Senator from Florida David Levy Yulee expired in 1850. He sought reappointment, but he had aligned himself too {{strongly}} with the Fire-eaters, and also had antagonized some commercial interests in the state. The moderates who favored <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Union still dominated Florida politics, and they successfully sought to put Mallory {{in place of the}} radical Yulee. The selection process in the Florida state legislature was somewhat irregular, and Yulee protested, carrying his protest {{all the way to the}} Senate itself. That body determined that the Florida legislature had acted within its authority in certifying Mallory, and so he was seated.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Neo-Gothic {{school of}} design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead {{they sought to}} return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created by the Firm included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though his}} father {{was a member of the}} Conservative Party, Muñoz Rivera decided to follow his uncle, Vicente Muñoz Barrios ideals and in 1883 joined the Liberal Party. While <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> organization, Muñoz Rivera {{established}} a store along Quintín Negrón Sanjurjo, which had limited success. He gained the confidence of the Liberal Party and was named president of Barranquitas' committee and became a member of the municipal council. In 1885, Muñoz Rivera ran for a position in the Juana Diaz district's representation in the Provincial Assembly, but he was not elected. That same year, he began publishing his writings in newspapers and magazines, including El Clamor del Pueblo, La Revista de Puerto Rico and El Pueblo. Other poems published by Muñoz Rivera were: Retamas, Tropicales, Horas de Fiebre, El paso del déspota, Minha terra, Cuba rebelde, A cualquier compatriota, Las campanas, Turba multa, Alea jacta est, Judas, El general, Abismos, Patriota, Himno, Parias and Poemas Liricos.|$|E

5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
5|$|The AEC commissioners {{asked for}} Major General Lauris Norstad, {{the head of}} the Operations and Plans Division, but neither the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, nor the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, was willing to release him. The commissioners then {{selected}} McCormack. The job came with a promotion to brigadier general. The commissioners got the kind of officer that they wanted. McCormack was willing to accept the post as a staff job, and took a pragmatic approach to the custody issue. Like most military officers, he was convinced that the men who had to use the nuclear weapons in battle needed to have experience in their proper maintenance, storage and handling. However, he was also aware of the sensitivity of the issue of custody, which Congress had assigned to the AEC. Rather than continue to press for changes in the law, he accepted the situation as it was, and strove {{to make the best of}} it, <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> existing framework.|$|E

Scout Networks are mainly member led, but are assisted by a Network Leader who ensures that the Network is <b>working</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> rules of the association. In addition to adult leadership, the association encourages its members themselves to take on positions of responsibility for their section meetings. This can be through responsibility {{for a group of}} members, such as the Patrol Leader and Assistant Patrol Leader in Scouts and Sixers and Seconders in Cubs, or through sectional forums to feedback on programmes. The Scout section also have the role of Senior Patrol Leader, usually someone about to move on to Explorers who overlooks all the patrols, {{and the members of the}} Explorer section are openly encouraged to run evenings and to plan their own meetings.|$|E
