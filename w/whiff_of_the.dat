[...] Obama quoted the lyrics of the Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields song [...] "Pick Yourself Up" [...] from the musical comedy Swing Time, saying that [...] "starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."

The anime received a mostly positive review from Bradley Meek THEM Anime Reviews. Bradley appreciated the animation, saying that [...] "It does wonders for the mood in the series, adding a tangible layer of mysticism and fantasy." [...] However, he criticized the series being [...] "cheesy and melodramatic more often than not." [...] He concluded the review saying, [...] "Despite some laughable melodrama, the raw emotions and Shaft's hypnotic animation makes ef ~a tale of memories~ a memorable romance. The plotting is slow, though, so it's not for people with short attention spans." ...|$|E

500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music {{stated that}} he thought the song was {{not as good as}} [...] "Toxic" [...] by Britney Spears but was {{incredibly}} similar. After dubbing it a weaker version of [...] "Toxic", he said, [...] "And that just leaves us here with a song [...] which is all stomp and huff, a dramatic bang of a thing, which seeks to drag all the bad girls to the dancefloor so they can holler their evil intentions to into the faces of nervous men. It's a song which makes the most of Nicole's unwholesome sexiness– as opposed to wholesome, you understand, I'm not saying there's anything gross about her– and has drama and fury on its side." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that [...] "Scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an (ahem) debut single". He described the song's busy production as [...] "having a <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berline [...] "teknoklub" [...] that is a [...] "racket in the best possible way". Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song, awarding it five out of five stars. He gave [...] "Poison" [...] a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger's previous attempt, [...] "Baby Love" [...] (2007), which he only awarded three out of five stars, stating that it was the wrong single to launch the career of a world-class superstar.|$|E
500|$|Of the reviewers, Time rated it an A-minus and added, [...] "Burton and Depp infuse the {{brilliant}} cold steel of Stephen Sondheim's score with a burning passion. Helena Bonham Carter and a superb supporting cast bring focused fury to this musical nightmare. It's bloody great." [...] Times Richard Corliss named the film {{one of its}} top ten movies of 2007, placing it fifth. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it four stars out of four, lauding Burton's visual style. In his review in Variety, Todd McCarthy called it [...] "both sharp and fleet" [...] and [...] "a satisfying screen version of Stephen Sondheim's landmark 1979 theatrical musical ... things have turned out uniformly right thanks to highly focused direction by Tim Burton, expert screw-tightening by scenarist John Logan, and haunted and musically adept lead performances from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Assembled artistic combo assures the film will reap {{by far the biggest}} audience to see a pure Sondheim musical, although just how big depends on the upscale crowd’s tolerance for buckets of blood, {{and the degree to which}} the masses stay away due to the <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highbrow." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-plus in its Movie Reviews section and stated, [...] "To stage a proper Sweeney Todd, necks must be slit, human flesh must be squished into pastries, and blood ought to spurt in fountains and rivers of death. Enter Tim Burton, who... has tenderly art-directed soup-thick, tomato-red, fake-gore blood with the zest of a Hollywood-funded Jackson Pollock." [...] She went on to refer to the piece as [...] "opulent, attentive... so finely minced a mixture of Sondheim's original melodrama and Burton's signature spicing that it's difficult to think of any other filmmaker so naturally suited for the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|... dril tweets often riff on his {{relationships}} with family members—particularly an unnamed wife, ex-wife, and multiple sons—in a manner reminiscent of father figures in American sitcoms like Married… With Children. Jia Tolentino, {{a staff writer}} for The New Yorker, credited dril as an originator of the [...] "large adult son" [...] trope. The trope, which Tolentino noted is common on social media and online sports journalism, involves particular observations of hapless male behavior that is [...] "endlessly excusable: though [...] does nothing right, he can do no wrong." [...] The character of dril repeatedly refers to his [...] "sons," [...] who are usually involved in the kind of [...] "classic large-adult-son behavior" [...] Tolentino describes as [...] "alarming, with a <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surreal." [...] The sons are compared to Trump's sons, particularly Eric Trump and Donald Jr., and Mike Huckabee's sons, David and John Mark.|$|E

50|$|By 1984, {{the public}} had largely lost {{interest}} in theatrically released slashers. Production of slashers plummeted, and a <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> desperation surrounded <b>the</b> few new releases.

Although it was rare to see slasher films on the big screen in 1984, reissues and new video productions brought the genre to a whole new generation.|$|R

500|$|For [...] "Saturn", Holst again used a previously-composed vocal piece, Dirge and Hymeneal, as {{the basis}} for the movement, where {{repeated}} chords represent <b>the</b> relentless approach <b>of</b> old age. [...] "Uranus", which follows, has elements of Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique and Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in its depiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magician who [...] "disappears in a <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> smoke as <b>the</b> sonic impetus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement diminishes from fff to ppp in <b>the</b> space <b>of</b> a few bars". [...] "Neptune", the final movement, concludes with a wordless female chorus gradually receding, an effect which Warrack likens to [...] "unresolved timelessness... never ending, since space does not end, but drifting away into eternal silence". Apart from his concession with [...] "I Vow to Thee..."', Holst insisted on <b>the</b> unity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole work, and opposed <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> individual movements. Nevertheless, Imogen wrote that the piece had [...] "suffered from being quoted in snippets as background music".|$|R

500|$|Spence D. of IGN Music {{added that}} Beyoncé's [...] "crisp voice" [...] seems {{at odds with}} the beats {{featured}} in the song. However, he continued saying that it [...] "when it gets muted and overlapped on the chorus, it sounds purely hypnotical." [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music described the track as a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "strutting" [...] one. Jon Pareles <b>of</b> <b>The</b> New York Times stated: [...] " [...] rhythm-driven songs, especially 'Get Me Bodied', could be high-tech upgrades of an old African-American form, the ring shout [...] ". Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, said that the song manages dancing into a contact sport with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> cheerleader hand-claps. Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic considered [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three production triumphs on B'Day. Richard Cromelin of Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] sounds [...] "like fun" [...] for Beyoncé, connecting her with deep, vital cultural roots. He also went on saying that [...] "the playful chant" [...] suggests both children's street game and traditional work song, and <b>the</b> <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> Louisiana in <b>the</b> beat taps her own Creole heritage.|$|R

Some people {{in the outside world}} thought that library education must amount to little more than training students to stamp books and be fussy. And if these outsiders did not understand that regular librarians needed master’s degrees, then they certainly would not understand that the professors had Ph. D. s. Even within the academy, some faculty members from other fields might have occasionally suggested that library science was not much of a science (not even a social science). I am not saying that their defensiveness was not justified—the discipline does struggle for recognition. Indeed, many library students and librarians themselves roll their eyes and scoff at <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> pursuing a doctorate. Who would want to write a dissertation about any of that stuff...|$|R

50|$|After {{beginning}} his football education with local side BSG Einheit Osterburg in 1950, he joined SC Aufbau Magdeburg {{where he played}} in the youth and reserve teams. In 1962 he had his debut in the DDR-Oberliga in a 0-1 loss at Dynamo Berlin on 27 May 1962. However, Fritz Wittenbecher was sacked at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> that season, and his successor Ernst Kümmel did not have much use for the outside forward and he left the club to join local rivals BSG Turbine Magdeburg. That side had just been promoted to the second-tier DDR-Liga and Abraham soon became the team captain. After Turbine was relegated in 1965, Abraham played for BSG Lok Stendal where he had <b>the</b> first <b>whiff</b> <b>of</b> glory when <b>the</b> team faced BSG Chemie Leipzig in the 1966 FDGB-Pokal final.

The club had just been relegated from the Oberliga, but under new manager Heinz Krügel immediately won promotion, with Abraham contributing 16 goals. After promotion, Abraham provided the assist for the first goal in the Oberliga, scored by Hermann Stöcker in a 1-all draw against SG Dynamo Dresden. With Magdeburg, he won his first title, the Oberliga championship in 1972. Abraham was the side's top goalscorer in that season, providing 13 goals, seven of which came from penalties.|$|R
