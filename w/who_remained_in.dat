5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints <b>who</b> <b>remained</b> <b>in</b> Iowa or Missouri {{were poor}} and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and {{supplies}} that would be required for the trip.

By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund.|$|E
