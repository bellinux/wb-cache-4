40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore new}} options for connecting homes and small businesses to high-speed communications networks, such as the Internet. Fundamental to this inquiry was an interest in looking at options which are newly enabled through changes in technology and regulation, and which go beyond the traditional topdown, centralized model for local access. In particular, the authors focused on opportunities for end-user and community-level investment. This project was intended to investigate the opportunities presented by the decreasing cost of computing and networking platforms, the unbundling of local exchange network elements, and the intelligent endpoints model of networking best exemplified by the Internet. Do these factors, along with communications technologies such as spread spectrum <b>wireless,</b> digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> services, {{and the ability to}} modulate a communications signal over the electric power line infrastructure, enable new models for end-user investment in intelligent infrastructure as a leverage point for accessing the broadband network? This question was first explored through a two-day conference held at the Freedom Forum in Arlington, Virginia, October 29 and 30, 1996. The workshop addressed issues in the consumer adoption of new communications technologies, use of the electric power line infrastructure, the role of municipalities, and the use of alternative technologies, such as XDSL, satellite, spread spectrum wireless, LMDS, and others. The best of these papers have been further developed, with editorial guidance provided by Harvard, and compiled {{in the form of a}} book (The First 100 Feet: New Options for Internet and Broadband Access, Deborah Hurley and James Keller, eds., MIT Press, 1998) to be published as part of the MIT Press Spring 1998 catalogue. A summary of topics covered by the book is given in this report...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} switching networks {{consisting of}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> and crosswires connected by switches. A connection between two subscribers is made along one crosswire via two switches. We determine the {{minimum number of}} switches necessary for such a switching network to be rearrangeably nonblocking and construct a switching arrangement which achieves this minimum for any (even) number of <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> Two procedures for assignment of crosswires to <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> pairs are described. One makes correct choice of connection route without backtracking provided all connections are known beforehand; the other determines a rearrangement of existing assignments when a new connection is required. We characterize the switching networks which have the minimum number of switches for networks with up to eight <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines</b> and give nonisomorphic solutions for larger networks...|$|R

50|$|Asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) {{is a type}} {{of digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) technology, a data {{communications}} technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less common symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL). In ADSL, Bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed by others.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, pair gain is the {{transmitting}} {{of multiple}} POTS signals over the twisted pairs traditionally {{used for a}} single traditional <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> in telephone systems. Pair gain {{has the effect of}} creating additional <b>subscriber</b> <b>lines.</b> This is typically used as an expedient way to solve <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> shortage problems by using existing wiring, instead of installing new wires from the central office to the customer premises. The term was invented in the middle 20th century by analogy with earlier use of gain to extend telephone local loops far from the telephone exchange.|$|R

50|$|A {{symmetric}} digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL) is {{a digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) that transmits digital data over the copper wires {{of the telephone}} network, where the bandwidth in the downstream direction, from the network to the subscriber, {{is identical to the}} bandwidth in the upstream direction, from the subscriber to the network. This symmetric bandwidth can be considered to be the opposite of the asymmetric bandwidth offered by asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) technologies, where the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth. SDSL is generally marketed at business customers, while ADSL is marketed at private as well as business customers.|$|R
