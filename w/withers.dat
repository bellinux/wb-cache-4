5|$|Brother Richard Scott <b>Withers</b> (born 1955) is an American consecrated hermit. In 1974, <b>Withers</b> {{converted}} to Catholicism and was baptized; shortly after, {{he started to}} live a religious life. In 1989, <b>Withers</b> and Sister Margaret McKenna moved to inner city Philadelphia and founded New Jerusalem Laura, a drug treatment center. <b>Withers</b> petitioned the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to become a consecrated hermit several times but was rejected. In 2001, <b>Withers</b> was consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the Archbishop of Philadelphia. He was the first hermit to be consecrated in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. <b>Withers</b> lives in a hermitage, a converted rowhouse, {{in the city of}} Philadelphia where he {{spends most of his time}} in prayer.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1991, <b>Withers</b> {{bought a}} {{derelict}} rowhouse {{from the city}} of Philadelphia for $1 and parted ways with McKenna. This would become his hermitage. He fixed the building, which lacked doors, windows, or a working roof and then went on to build furniture for it by himself. After the 1983 revision of Canon 603, the option of being a consecrated hermit while independent of the system of religious orders had been permitted. In 1995, <b>Withers</b> attempted to be consecrated by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia but was rejected. In 2001, <b>Withers</b> was finally approved and consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and took his public vows. <b>Withers</b> was the first hermit to be consecrated by the Archdiocese.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wither,</b> co-authored with Joseph Gangemi, was {{his first}} {{published}} novel. Columbia Pictures purchased the film rights to <b>Wither</b> in a preemptive, pre-publication bid. In 2000, <b>Wither</b> won the Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in a First Novel. Passarella followed <b>Wither</b> with the media tie-ins Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Ghoul Trouble and Angel: Avatar. Next came his stand-alone sequel to <b>Wither,</b> <b>Wither's</b> Rain.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wither</b> is a 1999 supra-natural {{novel about}} ghosts and witches by John Passarella and Joseph Gangemi writing under the {{pseudonym}} [...] "J.G. Passerella". <b>Wither</b> {{was nominated for}} an International Horror Guild Award and won the Horror Writers Association's Bram Stoker Award for First Novel in 1999. <b>Wither</b> was later followed by the sequels <b>Wither's</b> Rain, <b>Wither's</b> Curse, and <b>Wither's</b> Legacy.|$|R

5|$|General Sir Ian Hamilton {{presided over}} the memorial's {{unveiling}} on Sunday, 9 October 1927, at a ceremony attended by Lutyens. The unveiling itself was performed by a local veteran, Bertie <b>Withers.</b> <b>Withers</b> was selected at random after candidates were solicited from the city's ex-servicemen who met four criteria: that they were natives of Norwich; had enlisted prior {{to the implementation of}} conscription in 1916; had served overseas; and had been permanently disabled {{as a result of their}} service. <b>Withers</b> enlisted on 1 September 1914 and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915; after a bout of illness he rejoined his unit to fight in the First Battle of Gaza, where his battalion suffered heavy casualties. <b>Withers</b> himself was injured and, after his evacuation, his left leg was amputated below the knee. Upon his return to England he spent a year in the Norwich and Norfolk Hospital.|$|E
5|$|As a hermit, <b>Withers</b> {{lives in}} solitude. He does not own {{a car or}} television; he gets his news from {{the people around him}} and gets around on a bicycle that he found, broken, {{on the side of the}} road. Though he has an open-door policy for people that come to visit him, he himself visits family only twice a year. He does have a computer, which he uses to keep in touch with other hermits via email. To earn his food and {{clothing}} allowance, which amounts to less than $5,500 per year, <b>Withers</b> makes pottery to sell and works one day a week for a scientific-instrument company. At the end of each year, he donates any funds that remain to charity.|$|E
5|$|Newkirk's widow, Virginia Jane {{remarried}} {{after his}} death, marrying U.S. diplomat Charles Dudley <b>Withers,</b> {{who later became}} the U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, serving in that role from April 1963 until September 1966. She died on 16 July 1982 in Naples, Florida; leaving no children.|$|E

5|$|When Alben Barkley {{resigned}} his Senate seat {{to assume}} the office of vice president in 1948, Clements had appointed Garrett L. <b>Withers</b> to fill the vacancy. Barkley's term was to expire in 1950, and {{near the end of}} the term, <b>Withers</b> resigned, allowing Clements to run in a special election to fill both the remainder of Withers' term and a full six-year term simultaneously. He won the election over Republican Charles I. Dawson by a vote of 300,276 to 256,876. On November 27, 1950, he resigned as governor {{to assume the}} seat.|$|E
5|$|Klingsor appears {{and throws}} the Spear at Parsifal, but it stops in midair, above his head. Parsifal takes it {{and makes the}} sign of the Cross with it.

50|$|The larvae feed on {{the stem}} of Teucrium scorodonia, just below some leaves. These soon <b>wither</b> away. The larvae then {{continue}} living underneath these <b>withered</b> leaves. Pupation takes place on the stem under the <b>withered</b> part, under a leaf or on adjacent foliage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withering</b> {{refers to}} the wilting of fresh green tea leaves. The purpose of <b>withering</b> {{is to reduce the}} {{moisture}} content in the leaves and to allow the flavor compounds to develop. While it can be done outdoors, controlled <b>withering</b> usually takes places indoors. Freshly plucked leaves are laid out in a series of troughs and subjected to hot air forced from underneath the troughs. During the course of <b>withering,</b> the moisture content in the leaf goes down by about 30%, making the leaf look limp and soft enough for rolling. Additionally, the volatile compounds in the leaf, including the level of caffeine and the flavors, begin to intensify. A short <b>wither</b> allows the leaves to retain a greenish appearance and grassy flavors while a longer <b>wither</b> darkens the leaf and intensifies the aromatic compounds.|$|R
50|$|During {{a quarrel}} with Eli Bard, <b>Wither</b> transforms, {{revealing}} that Selene has used her powers {{to make him}} an immortal vampire, much like Bard. Bard is killed immediately after their argument by Selene herself. Elixir and <b>Wither</b> face against one another. <b>Wither</b> accuses Elixir of failing to save Wallflower. This causes him to switch from his Gold Healing form to his Black Death form, which overwhelms <b>Wither's</b> destructive power. Elixir kills him, completely disintegrating his body.|$|R
5|$|On 18 June 1904, Malone {{suffered}} {{the loss of}} his wife Elinor in childbirth. Their baby son also died. The following year, Malone married Ida Katharine <b>Withers,</b> and would go on to have three more children. Ida had been a friend of Elinor's and had also tutored the Malone children.|$|E
5|$|Only one Horsa with {{a platoon}} of {{infantry}} from the Staffords landed near the bridge. Its commander, Lieutenant <b>Withers,</b> divided his men into two groups, one of which swam across the river and took up position on the opposite bank. Thereafter the bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault from both sides. The Italian defenders from the 120th Coastal Infantry Regiment abandoned their pillboxes on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Whitlam's dismissal, the Labor {{leadership}} {{decided to}} introduce a motion that the Senate pass the appropriation bills. With ALP senators unaware of Whitlam's sacking, that plan went ahead. Senator Doug McClelland, manager of the ALP Government's business in the Senate, informed Coalition Senate leader Reg <b>Withers</b> of Labor's intent at about 1.30. <b>Withers</b> then attended a leadership meeting and learned of Fraser's appointment; he assured the new Prime Minister he could secure supply. When the Senate convened, the ALP Senate leader, Ken Wriedt, made the motion. Even as Wriedt did so, {{he was told that}} the government had been sacked, which he initially refused to believe. Authoritative word did not reach Wriedt until 2.15pm, by which time {{it was too late to}} withdraw the motion and instead obstruct his party's appropriation bill to hinder Fraser. At 2.24pm, Labor's appropriation bills passed the Senate, fulfilling Fraser's first promise of providing supply.|$|E

40|$|<b>Withering</b> is {{the first}} step in tea {{processing}} and has a significant impact on final product quality. During the tea green leaf <b>withering</b> and its preparation for the next stage of processing (curling), reduction in moisture content of the leaf is accompanied by occurrence of biochemical interactions that play an important role in product quality; its aroma in particular. Air flow rate and <b>withering</b> time are two important parameters that affect <b>withered</b> tea leaves. In the present study, impact of <b>withering</b> on the quality of black tea product was examined based on environmental conditions and green tea quality through sensory evaluation method. A laboratory scale trough was used for <b>withering</b> operation. Two factors of air flow rate and <b>withering</b> time duration were considered with three and five levels respectively. Results showed that the impact of the air flow rate on dry tea appearance, liquor color, taste, aroma, infused leaves and final product quality (black tea) is significant at the 1 % level. The interaction between air flow rate and <b>withering</b> time was also significant on dry tea appearance, liquor color, infused leaves and final product quality at 1 %, and aroma at 5 % probability levels respectively...|$|R
40|$|Post-harvest <b>withering</b> of grape berries {{is used in}} the {{production}} of dessert and fortified wines to alter must quality characteristics and increase the concentration of simple sugars. The molecular processes that occur during <b>withering</b> are poorly understood, so a detailed transcriptomic analysis of post-harvest grape berries was carried out by AFLP-transcriptional profiling analysis. This will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of berry <b>withering</b> and will provide an opportunity to select markers {{that can be used to}} follow the drying process and evaluate different drying techniques. AFLP-TP identified 699 withering-specific genes, 167 and 86 of which were unique to off-plant and on-plant <b>withering,</b> respectively. Although similar molecular events were revealed in both <b>withering</b> processes, it was apparent that off-plant <b>withering</b> induced a stronger dehydration stress response resulting in the high level expression of genes involved in stress protection mechanisms, such as dehydrin and osmolite accumulation. Genes involved in hexose metabolism and transport, cell wall composition, and secondary metabolism (particularly the phenolic and terpene compound pathways) were similarly regulated in both processes. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular events underpinning post-harvest <b>withering</b> and could help to define markers for different <b>withering</b> processes...|$|R

5|$|The {{height of}} horses is usually {{measured}} at the highest point of the <b>withers,</b> where the neck meets the back. This point is used {{because it is a}} stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.|$|E
50|$|Watt {{has enjoyed}} a close musical {{relationship}} with Dan Willson of <b>Withered</b> Hand. As well as performing together in the band Love Gestures, Watt helped write the song Oldsmobile Car along with Neil Pennycook of Meursault which appeared on <b>Withered</b> Hand's You're Not Alone EP (a version of the song was also released by Meursault as Red Candle Bulb). Enfant Bastard also released a chip-tune version of <b>Withered</b> Hand's For the Maudlin on his Master Dude album, while Walls by Enfant Bastard was covered by <b>Withered</b> Hand on his Inbetweens EP. In 2014 Watt animated the video to the <b>Withered</b> Hand single 'Black Tambourine'.|$|R

5|$|A {{national}} tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran {{for five years}} and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie and Ray Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks to process them. Jeanne Bal and Iva <b>Withers</b> were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Limousin region was characterised by the mediocrity of its animals. Texier-Olivier Louis, prefect of the Haute-Vienne, observed that Limousin cattle weighed 300 to 350kg and measured 1.5 metres at the <b>withers.</b> The defect was considered to be attributable to poor genetics, nutrition and breeding practices. In competitions, Limousin cattle were among the worst performers. The breed was considered to be a working breed, but poorly shaped and with poor milk.|$|E
