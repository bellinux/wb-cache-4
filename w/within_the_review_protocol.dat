40|$|AbstractThe EORTC Cancer in the ElderlyTask Force (ETF) aims to develop, conduct, {{coordinate}} {{and stimulate}} research on elderly patients with cancer. Towards this goal, the ETF has established close interactions with disease-oriented EORTC groups by having representatives {{from most of}} these groups attend the ETF meetings. In addition, <b>the</b> ETF <b>reviews</b> every new <b>protocol</b> for elderly-specific questions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>protocol</b> <b>review</b> process of <b>the</b> EORTC aiming to reduce ageism within study protocols. Since 2006, the ETF decided to focus on three aspects: open a discussion on specific methodology for clinical trials in the older population; create a common language for describing heterogeneity between older individuals, the EORTC minimal dataset for geriatric assessment in older cancer patients; and develop specific clinical trials in the older population. This article reports {{the achievements of the}} ETF in these three domains and discusses its future strategies...|$|R

40|$|Introducing {{mobility}} to Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) puts {{new challenges}} particularly in designing of routing protocols. Mobility {{can be applied}} to the sensor nodes and/or the sink node in the network. Many routing protocols have been developed to support the mobility of WSNs. These protocols are divided depending on the routing structure into hierarchical-based, flat-based, and location-based routing protocols. However, the hierarchical-based routing protocols outperform the other routing types in saving energy, scalability, and extending lifetime of Mobile WSNs (MWSNs). Selecting an appropriate hierarchical routing protocol for specific applications is an important and difficult task. Therefore, this paper focuses on <b>reviewing</b> some of <b>the</b> recently hierarchical-based routing protocols that are developed in the last five years for MWSNs. This survey divides the hierarchical-based routing protocols into two broad groups, namely, classical-based and optimized-based routing protocols. Also, we present a detailed classification of <b>the</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>protocols</b> according to <b>the</b> routing approach, control manner, mobile element, mobility pattern, network architecture, clustering attributes, protocol operation, path establishment, communication paradigm, energy model, protocol objectives, and applications. Moreover, a comparison between <b>the</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>protocols</b> is investigated in this survey depending on delay, network size, energy-efficiency, and scalability while mentioning the advantages and drawbacks of each protocol. Finally, we summarize and conclude the paper with future directions...|$|R

Treatment effects on SOFA were calculated as the between-group SOFA standardized difference. Treatment effects on mortality were calculated as log odds ratio (OR) of treatment vs. control group mortality. We used random-effects meta-regression to: (i) quantify the linear relationship between RCT treatment effects on mortality (logOR) and SOFA; (ii) quantify residual heterogeneity (expressed as I 2 and tau). <b>The</b> <b>review</b> <b>protocol</b> was prospectively registered (CRD 42016034014).|$|R

30|$|There are two {{important}} points {{that are worth}} noting. First, even though the consumers who did not deviate will also receive low utilities due to the raised prices, the protocol is designed {{in such a way}} that consumers still want to carry out such a punishment. Second, the utilities obtained by the consumers in the punishment phase are lower than those in <b>the</b> <b>review</b> phase. However, they are the same as in the scenario where there was no <b>review</b> strategy <b>protocol</b> being deployed. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>review</b> strategy-based <b>protocol</b> is guaranteed to achieve better system performance than that which can be obtained without deploying the protocol. Importantly, the protocol designer needs to carefully design the protocol such that this punishment does not take place too frequently since it reduces all consumers’ utilities. We rigorously characterize the performance of deploying review strategies and determine the optimal design (optimal billing cycle, punishment phase length, etc.) for various smart grid deployment scenarios. It is also important to note that <b>the</b> proposed <b>review</b> strategy-based <b>protocol</b> can be deployed in conjunction with any DSM scheme besides the smart pricing scheme which is used for illustration in this paper, which may take into account find-grained load scheduling (e.g., hourly scheduling). The scheduling results of any DSM scheduling schemes can serve as the input of our design framework, and the output is <b>the</b> <b>review</b> strategy-based <b>protocol.</b>|$|R

We provide a thorough <b>review</b> of <b>the</b> existing authentication protocols faced to this constraint, and extend our analysis with the privacy property. We show that none of <b>the</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>protocols</b> fits <b>the</b> required prop-erties in case of compromised readers.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThis paper (1) {{presents}} the protocol of an on-going systematic literature <b>review</b> on <b>the</b> methods of structuring electronic health record (EHR) data and studying {{the impacts of}} implemented structures, thus laying basis {{for the analysis of}} the empirical articles (2) describes previous <b>reviews</b> published on <b>the</b> subject and retrieved during the search of bibliographic databases, and (3) presents a summary of the results of previous reviews. MethodsCochrane instructions were exploited to outline <b>the</b> <b>review</b> <b>protocol</b> – phases and search elements. Test searches were conducted to refine the search. The abstracts and/or full texts of review papers captured by the search were read by two of the team members independently, with disagreements first negotiated between them and if necessary eventually resolved in the team meetings. Additional review articles were picked from the reference lists of <b>the</b> <b>reviews</b> included in our search results. The elements defined in the search strategy and analytic framework were converted to a data extraction tool, which was tested by extracting data from <b>the</b> <b>reviews</b> captured by <b>the</b> search. Descriptive analysis of the extracted data was conducted. ResultsThe 12 -stage <b>review</b> <b>protocol</b> that we developed includes definition of the problem, the search strategy and search terms, testing the strategy, conducting the search, updating search from references found, removing duplicates, defining the inclusion and exclusion criteria, exclusion and inclusion of papers, definition of the analytic framework to extract data, extracting data and reporting results. Our searches in fifteen electronic bibliographic databases retrieved 27 reviews, of which 14 were included for full text analysis. Of these, 11 focused on medical and three on nursing record structures. The data structures included forms, ontologies, classifications and terminologies. Some evidence was found on data structure impact on information quality, process quality and efficiency, but not on patients or professionals. ConclusionsThe 12 step <b>review</b> <b>protocol</b> resulted in a variety of reviews of different ways to structure EHR data. None of them compared outcomes of different structuring methods; all had a narrower definition of the Intervention (a specific EHR structure) and Outcome (a specific impact category). Several reviews missed a clear connection between the data structures (interventions) and outcomes, indicating that the methods and applications for structuring patient data have rarely been viewed as independent variables. <b>The</b> <b>review</b> <b>protocol</b> should be defined in a manner that allows replication of <b>the</b> <b>review.</b> There are different ways of structuring patient data with varying impacts, which should be distinguished in further empirical studies, as well as reviews...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are {{generally}} designed to support applications in long-term deployments, and thus WSN protocols are primarily {{designed to be}} energy efficient. However, the research community has recently explored new WSN applications such as industrial process automation. These mission-critical applications demand not only energy efficient operation but also strict data transport performance. In particular, data must be transported to a sink in a timely and reliable fashion. Both WSN's data transport performance and energy consumption pattern are mainly defined by the employed medium access control (MAC) protocol. Therefore, this survey paper explores to what extent existing MAC protocols for WSNs can serve mission-critical applications. <b>The</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>protocols</b> are classified according to data transport performance and suitability for mission-critical applications.
