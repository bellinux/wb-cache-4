40|$|This article {{constitutes}} a detailed critical reading of Edgar Wind’s early work, focussing, in particular, on his German philosophical writings concerning art, {{art history and}} art-historical methodology. Through comparisons with the authors <b>Wind</b> <b>tackled</b> (Alois Riegl, Heinrich Wölfflin, Hans Tietze) and by whom he was inﬂuenced (Erwin Panofsky, Alois Riegl), this article shows Wind’s contribution towards a redefinition of art history as an autonomous discipline and his plan of a concrete systematic study of art (konkrete Kunstwissenschaft) confronting the important heritage of the thought of Riegl. By following the path which brought Wind {{to the definition of}} a systematically organized table of ‘artistic problems’ - which are fundamental to the art interrogation - supposed to work as a kind of compass for the art historian, this article aims to contribute to the understanding and interpretation of such concepts as ‘style’ and the Riegelian Kunstwollen...|$|R

Firefighters {{had to deal}} with 50 mph <b>winds</b> as they <b>tackled</b> a huge barn blaze which {{destroyed}} hundreds of tonnes of hay, straw and wood. Crews used a nearby stream to tackle the fire and had to increase the water pressure due to the heavy winds.The blaze destroyed 300 tonnes of hay and straw and 100 tonnes of wood as well as machinery, which included two trailers. However, the crews prevented the fire from spreading to an 8,000-litre diesel tank or propane gas cylinders, and saved 60 tonnes of bagged nitram fertiliser.|$|R
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{lateral loads}} acting upon building structures are earthquake and wind induced forces. If wind load {{is much greater}} than earthquake load, the lateral force resisting system required to <b>tackle</b> <b>wind</b> loading may be enough to resist the smaller earthquake load. In this situation, a seismic base isolator will not bring any benefit to the building system. Furthermore, if time period of a building without isolator is greater, incorporation of isolator will not bring much difference to the building behavior with respect to seismic load. Additionally, for buildings with lower structural time periods, incorporation of an isolator will greatly alter the seismic behavior. In light of all of these facts, this study examines the buildings in Dhaka, intended for different heights and plan area, to establish critical height up to which earthquake is the dominant lateral load. It also examines the relationship that exists between building height and time period. The study shows that though seismic base shear governs up to larger building height, in case of greater heights, time periods are much larger than the most suitable value of limiting time period for incorporating an isolator. Realistic structural time period and governing seismic load envisage that a seismic base isolator can be efficiently incorporated for up to 30 similar to 40 m structural height at low to medium soil conditions for aseismic RCC building structures.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of wind energy technology, several methods have become mature and are seen today as {{standard}} for predicting and forecasting the wind. However, their results are still site dependent, and the increasing sizes of both modern wind turbines and <b>wind</b> farms <b>tackle</b> limits of existing methods. Some triggered processes extend to the junction between microscales and mesoscales. The main objectives of this thesis are thus to identify, implement and evaluate an approach allowing for microscale and mesoscale ABL flow modelling considering the various challenges of modern wind energy applications. A literature review of ABL flow modelling from microscales to mesoscales first {{provides an overview of}} the specificities and abilities of existing methods. The combined mesoscale/large eddy simulation (LES) modelling appears to be the most promising approach, and the Compressible Community Mesoscale Model (MC 2) is elected as the basis of the method in which the components required for LES are added and implemented. A detailed description of the mathematical model and the numerical aspects of the various components of the LES-capable MC 2 are then presented so that a complete view of the proposed approach along with the specificities of its implementation are provided. This further allows to introduce the enhancements and new components of the method (separation of volumetric and deviatoric Reynolds tensor terms, vertical staggering, subgrid scale models, 3 D turbulent diffusion, 3 D turbulent kinetic energy equation), as well as the adaptation of its operating mode to allow for LES (initialization, large scale geostrophic forcing, surface and lateral boundaries). Finally, fundamental aspects and new components of the proposed approach are evaluated based on theoretical 1 D Ekman boundary layer and 3 D unsteady shear and buoyancy driven homogeneous surface full ABL cases. The model behaviour at high resolution as well as the components required for LES in MC 2 are all finely evaluated, including: the dynamic kernel at high resolution; space and time discretization of the 3 D turbulent diffusion; five subgrid scale models; and the sensitivity of the model to numerical parameters. Furthermore, LES test cases are thoroughly studied, showing that a longer time interval for post-processing than in the reference studies is needed due to a high but normal level of scatter in the results. In the end, the obtained LES-capable mesoscale model is shown to perform on par with other similar reference LES models, albeit it is slightly more dissipative. It is thus demonstrated that the adapted MC 2 is suitable for both micro- and mesoscales providing a strong foundation for more advanced studies...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{interest}} in small-scale electricity generation located near customers, known as Distributed Generation (DG), is driven primarily by emerging technologies, environmental regulations and concerns, electricity market restructuring, and growing customer demand for increased quality and reliability of the electricity supply. Wind turbines {{are one of the}} renewable DG technologies that have become an important source of electricity {{in many parts of the}} world. Wind power can be used in many places to provide a viable solution to rising demand, energy security and independence, and climate change mitigation. This research aims broadly at facilitating the integration of wind-based DG without jeopardizing the system’s economics and reliability. To achieve this goal, the thesis <b>tackles</b> <b>wind</b> power from three perspectives: those of the policy maker, the investor, and the system operator. Generally, the economic viability of a project is determined within the framework of relevant policies. Therefore, these policies influence the decisions of potential investors in wind power. From this perspective, chapters 3 and 4 investigate the influence of policies on the economic viability of wind-based DG projects. In chapter 3, the role of Ontario’s taxation and incentive policies in the economic viability of wind-based DG projects is investigated. In this study, the effects of provincial income taxes, capital cost allowances, property taxes, and relevant federal incentives are considered. Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for different scenarios are used to assess the project’s viability under the Ontario Standard Offer Program (SOP) for wind power. In chapter 4, the thesis proposes the use of wind power as a source of electricity in a new city being developed in the Duqm area of Oman, where no policies supporting renewable energy exist. The study shows that the cost of electricity produced by wind turbines is higher than that of the existing generation system, due to the subsidized prices of domestically available natural gas. However, given high international natural gas prices, the country’s long-term Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) export obligations, and the expansion of natural gas-based industries, investments in wind power in Duqm can be justified. A feed-in tariff and capital cost allowance policies are recommended to facilitate investments in this sector. From a wind-based DG investor’s perspective, the optimal selection of wind turbines can make wind power more economical, as illustrated in chapters 5 and 6. In chapter 5, the thesis presents a new generic model for Capacity Factor (CF) estimation using wind speed characteristics at any site and the power performance curve parameters of any pitch-regulated wind turbine. Compared to the existing model, the proposed formulation is simpler and results in more accurate CF estimation. CF models can be used by wind-based DG investors for optimal turbine-site matching applications. However, in chapter 6, the thesis demonstrates that using CF models as the sole basis for turbine-site matching applications tends to produce results that are biased towards higher towers but do not include the associated costs. Therefore, a novel formulation for the turbine-site matching problem, based on a modified CF formulation that does include turbine tower height, is introduced in chapter 6. The proposed universal Turbine-Site Matching Index (TSMI) also includes the effects of turbine rated power and tower height on the initial capital cost of wind turbines. Chapter 7 <b>tackles</b> <b>wind</b> power from a power system operator’s perspective. Despite wind power benefits, the effects of its intermittent nature on power systems need to be carefully examined as penetration levels increase. In this chapter, the thesis investigates the effects of different temporal wind profiles on the scheduling costs of thermal generation units. Two profiles are considered: synoptic-dominated and diurnal-dominated variations of aggregated wind power. To simulate wind profile impacts, a linear mixed-integer unit commitment problem is formulated in a GAMS environment. The uncertainty associated with wind power is represented using a chance constrained formulation. The simulation results illustrate the significant impacts of different wind profiles on fuel saving benefits, startup costs, and wind power curtailments. In addition, the results demonstrate the importance of the wide geographical dispersion of wind power production facilities to minimize the impacts of network constraints on the value of the harvested wind energy and the amount of curtailed energy...|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{wind energy}} {{is seen as}} the most {{promising}} source of electricity generation for achieving the European renewable energy targets. A number of wind farms are planned and under installation to collect the huge potential of wind energy at farther distances in the North Sea. The number of HVDC links in the North Sea is expected to increase with the development of offshore installations in Round 3 of the UK offshore windfarm programme. The increasing number of HVDC links and high power transfer control requirements leads to the formation of Multi-Terminal HVDC (MTDC) grid systems, which have become possible due to the technical advancements of VSC based HVDC systems. Additionally, a meshed MTDC grid structure can also provide interconnections for power trade across the Europe, which can help in better utilisation of power from offshore installations and can also support the AC network in <b>tackling</b> <b>wind</b> power variation issues. However, the integration of the meshed MTDC grid with the existing AC grid has more challenges to overcome alongside the added advantages. One of the major challenge is to ensure the secure and optimal operation of the combined AC/MTDC grid considering stability requirements of the AC and DC grids in different operating conditions. The behaviour of the DC grid is governed by the fast acting controllers due to the high number of power electronic equipment unlike AC grid. In combined operation the response to a disturbance of two integrated grids can be different. The power balancing, co-ordination and dispatch requirements need to be identified, to implement appropriate controls and formulate a control structure for combined operation of two grids with different characteristics under normal and disturbance conditions. In this thesis, the basic principles of well-established three-layered AC grid control is employed to identify the power balancing, coordination and dispatch requirements of the DC grid. Appropriate control methods are proposed for primary, secondary and tertiary control layers in order to accomplish the identified requirements for the secure and optimal operation of combined AC/MTDC grids. Firstly, a comparison study is performed on different power balancing controls to find the most suitable control method for the primary control of the meshed DC grid. Secondly, the combined AC/DC grid power flow method is proposed to provide updated references of the VSC station in order to maintain coordinated power flow control under secondary control layers. Finally, security constraint optimization method for combined AC/DC grid is proposed for economic dispatch under the tertiary control layer of the three-layered hierarchal control. A number of case studies are performed to implement the proposed control methods on a combined AC/DC test case network. The performance of the proposed control methods is validated in a hierarchical control structure for secure and optimal operation integrated AC/MTDC grids...|$|R
