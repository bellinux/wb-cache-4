5|$|As {{a show of}} {{communist}} rule and Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the Polish anti-Nazi underground were brought to trial in Moscow in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded {{the possibility of a}} democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats <b>without</b> <b>protest.</b> The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by Tomasz Arciszewski, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.|$|E

25|$|Shulchan Aruch (שולחן ערוך), a {{condensation}} of {{his decisions}} in Beth Yosef. Finished in 1555, this code {{was published in}} four parts in 1565.

25|$|A {{significant}} command change {{occurred on}} the evening of May 24. Grant and Meade had had numerous quarrels during the campaign about strategy and tactics and tempers were reaching the boiling point. Grant mollified Meade somewhat by ordering that Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside and his IX Corps would henceforth report to Meade's Army of the Potomac, rather than to Grant directly. Although Burnside was a more senior major general than Meade, he accepted the new subordinate position <b>without</b> <b>protest.</b>|$|E

25|$|From 1906 to 1922 both Frank Lloyd Wright and Shimoda Kikutaro, who {{had been}} active {{together}} in Chicago, submitted separate design proposals for the rebuilding of the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo. Shimoda had submitted {{a proposal for a}} Japanese style roof set on a low profile masonry building before Wright had become involved in the project. Wright did not sign a memorandum with the Imperial Household for the project until March 1916, and not <b>without</b> <b>protest</b> from Kikutaro, who claimed that his design had been appropriated by Lloyd.|$|E

By calling Muralitharan from the bowlers' end Hair overrode what is normally regarded as the authority of the square leg umpire in adjudicating on throwing.

Meanwhile in the distance, Susannah organizes the others into changing {{the shape of the}} Long Man into a more feminine one by lying down in white boiler suits to give the symbol pigtails, hips and breasts. The event does not come <b>without</b> <b>protest,</b> where Pagans gather in an attempt to stop the proceedings. The episode ends with Trinny and Susannah taking off in a helicopter to view the Long Man with a female form.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), {{responding}} to repeated requests from local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership.

25|$|Busch had {{to contend}} with several attacks when the Red Army {{commenced}} its winter operations in late 1943. He showed little independence in exercising his command and often deferred to Hitler's orders <b>without</b> <b>protest.</b> When fighting around Vitebsk threatened to cut off one of the divisions of Generaloberst Georg-Hans Reinhardt's 3rd Panzer Army, he had to seek Hitler's permission to allow it to withdraw. Hitler declined and the division was only saved when Reinhardt, on his own initiative, ordered it to retreat. In May 1944, Busch also conceded to Hitler's instructions to transfer his LVI Panzer Corps to Army Group North Ukraine despite this leaving his own command with minimal tanks.|$|E
25|$|Walayah is {{translated}} from Arabic as “guardianship” and denotes “Love and devotion for God, the Prophets, the Aimmat and Imām uz Zaman, and the Dai.” It also denotes Ta'at (following every order <b>without</b> <b>protest,</b> but with one's soul's happiness, knowing {{that nothing is}} more important than a command from God and that the command of His vicegerents is His Word). In Ismāʿīlī doctrine, God is the true desire of every soul, and He manifests himself in the forms of Prophets and Imāms; to be guided to his path, one requires a messenger or a guide: a Dai. For the true mawali of the Imam and Dai, heaven is made obligatory. And only with this crucial walayat, they believe, will all the other pillars and acts ordained by Islam be judged or even looked at by God.|$|E

The {{relationship between the two}} species may occasionally border on apparent [...] "friendship", as some coyotes have been observed laying their heads on their badger companions or licking their faces <b>without</b> <b>protest.</b> The amicable interactions between coyotes and badgers were known to pre-Columbian civilizations, as shown on a Mexican jar dated to 1250–1300 CE depicting the relationship between the two.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s Oslo Sporveier {{experimented with}} their livery. Some {{received}} a darker blue, either entirely {{or with a}} cream-colored upper section. Consultants had concluded that Oslo Sporveier should introduce a uniform red color with dark blue detailing on all modes of transport: buses, metro trains and trams. This went <b>without</b> <b>protests</b> on the other two modes, but when the trams were pained red it was met with a storm of protests and a unison public demanded that they retain their light blue color. This resulted in a new uniform light blue color scheme which was introduced on the SM83 units. Most of the SM53 retained their original colors.|$|R
500|$|Orenstein and Zank both comment that, {{although}} Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging {{only one}} composition a year, it included {{some of his}} finest works. In 1920 he completed La valse, {{in response to a}} commission from Diaghilev. He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, [...] "a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling". It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, [...] "It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet. It's the portrait of a ballet". Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict <b>without</b> <b>protest</b> or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him. Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died. A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of La valse followed in December. The following year Daphnis et Chloé and [...] L'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra.|$|E
500|$|De Castries' {{seclusion}} in his bunker, {{combined with}} his superiors' inability to replace him, created a leadership vacuum within the French command. On 24 March, an event took place which {{later became a}} matter of historical debate. The historian Bernard Fall records, based on Langlais' memoirs, that Colonel Langlais and his fellow paratroop commanders, all fully armed, confronted de Castries in his bunker on 24 March. They {{told him he would}} retain the appearance of command, but that Langlais would exercise it. De Castries is said by Fall to have accepted the arrangement <b>without</b> <b>protest,</b> although he did exercise some command functions thereafter. Phillip Davidson stated that the [...] "truth would seem to be that Langlais did take over effective command of Dien Bien Phu, and that Castries became 'commander emeritus' who transmitted messages to Hanoi and offered advice about matters in Dien Bien Phu". Jules Roy, however, makes no mention of this event, and Martin Windrow argues that the [...] "paratrooper putsch" [...] is unlikely to have ever happened. Both historians record that Langlais and Marcel Bigeard were known to be on good terms with their commanding officer.|$|E

50|$|Another notable claim made by Koonz is {{that women}} who most {{successfully}} asserted themselves in the Third Reich were also the women who violated the norms of civilized society such as Ilse Koch. Koonz maintains that only women who were opposed to Nazism 100% can {{be considered to be}} a resistance; those women who protested against sterilization and the Action T4 program <b>without</b> <b>protesting</b> the deportation of Jews to death camps are not considered by Koonz {{to be part of the}} resistance. Koonz's views have often had her pitted against Gisela Bock in a battle some have referred to as the Historikerinnenstreit (quarrel among historians of women).|$|R
5000|$|The 1941 North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement moved WHDH to 850 kilocycles, {{and allowed}} the station to {{broadcast}} on a full-time basis.

For two years, from 1943 until 1945, WHDH was the local affiliate of the Blue Network, the former [...] "NBC Blue", replacing WBZ as Blue affiliate; WHDH ceded the affiliation to WCOP after the Blue Network also chose to affiliate with Lawrence's WLAW (the facilities of which were subsequently sold to WNAC).|$|R

[...] Later that year, the controversial councillor Rob Ford was elected mayor. His support was based on voters in the former suburbs, highlighting a political schism between the suburbs and the core over spending and services at City Hall. His four-year term was marked by much controversy at City Hall and several drug scandals, leading to City Council suspending his powers and his entry into drug rehab.|$|R

In 1874, Muybridge {{discovered}} that a drama critic known as Major Harry Larkyns might have fathered Flora's seven-month-old son Florado. On 17 October, Muybridge went to Calistoga to track down Larkyns. Upon finding him, Muybridge said, [...] "Good evening, Major, my name is Muybridge and here's {{the answer to the}} letter you sent my wife", and shot him point-blank. Larkyns died that night, and Muybridge was arrested <b>without</b> <b>protest</b> and put in the Napa jail.|$|E
2500|$|From 1601, in {{the last}} years of Elizabeth I's life, certain English politicians, notably her chief {{minister}} Sir Robert Cecil, maintained a secret correspondence with James to prepare in advance for a smooth succession. Cecil advised James not to press the matter of the succession upon the queen but simply to treat her with kindness and respect. The approach proved effective: [...] "I trust that you will not doubt," [...] Elizabeth wrote to James, [...] "but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them you in grateful sort." [...] In March 1603, with the queen clearly dying, Cecil sent James a draft proclamation of his accession to the English throne. Strategic fortresses were put on alert, and London placed under guard. Elizabeth died in the early hours of 24 March. Within eight hours, James was proclaimed king in London, the news received <b>without</b> <b>protest</b> or disturbance.|$|E
