5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} claimants to the Duchy {{began to see}} that Sforza would be a greater threat than the Ambrosian Republic. Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.|$|E
5|$|Several facts {{point to}} a {{political}} motive behind the assassination. Leontovych's participation in the independence movement, such as commissioning Ukrainian Republic Capella, aimed at promoting Ukraine as an independent state, earned him many enemies. His older daughter Halyna later recalled her father saying, shortly before his death, that he had documents {{to leave the country}} to Romania, and that he had these documents with him among his sheet music during a concert. However, after returning from tea following the concert, Leontovych noticed that someone had gone through his papers. His plans to leave the country, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was killed by a Soviet agent, also indicate political reasons for his death.|$|E

25|$|Todd's {{spiritual journey}} was crafted {{as a man}} who wanted {{forgiveness}} for his past misdeeds. In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> initiated a gang rape on her. Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.|$|E
25|$|Yonge soon was at sea again. During {{this period}} he {{undertook}} several voyages with the Newfoundland fisheries. The first was in May 1663 when aged 16, he took {{passage in the}} ship Reformation. Yonge spent time on land and used to walk between settlements, making sketches and observations on the industry. In January 1666, during the Second Dutch War, his ship, the Bonaventure was captured by the Dutch and he was shackled together with other prisoners, for fifty one days. (The biography of the Victorian writer Charlotte Yonge by Christabel Coleridge refers to Yonge being a galley slave of the Moors, possibly conflating {{the time he was}} a Dutch prisoner <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did serve off Algiers whilst in the Navy.) In September 1666 he was exchanged for a relative of the secretary of the Dutch Admiralty, who was a prisoner at Harwich.|$|E

25|$|The tenth {{book in the}} Sweep {{series is}} not from Morgan's point of view. Instead the book is in Hunter's point of view. Hunter was {{in a search for}} his parents who have been missing since Hunter was a child. Hunter {{receives}} information about the whereabouts of his parents, which inevitably lead him to Canada. There he finds his father, Daniel Niall, and discovers that his mother died just before Yule, when he was training Morgan. Hunter soon discovers that his father is talking to his mother (who is dead) using a Bith Dearc which is the use of what {{is considered to be a}} form of dark magick, against the wishes of Hunter's mother. Hunter must attempt to stop his father from doing this, while investigating a witch by the name of Justine Courceau, a witch collecting the true names of other witches, on the order of the International Council of Witches. He ends up kissing her, and then is faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has to tell Morgan about it.|$|E
25|$|Vincent is {{stalling}} {{getting married}} to Katherine, unwilling to commit {{and give up}} {{his life as a}} bachelor. One night at the Stray Sheep Bar, a drunken Vincent meets with Catherine, a woman who fulfills his fantasies. He sleeps with her in what he thinks is a one-night stand, but she takes it as a sign of his commitment to her. Faced <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is cheating on Katherine, Vincent begins being drawn into a Nightmare realm where himself and other men become trapped and must climb towers of interlinked blocks while outrunning terrifying monsters; if they fail, they will die in the real world. The pressure of keeping Catherine and Katherine apart increases when Katherine lies about being pregnant to test him, worsening his visits to the Nightmare. He also encounters others from the Stray Sheep Bar in the NightmareOrlando is beset by guilt for driving his wife away after the failure of his business, Johnny is torn between his loyalty to Vincent and unspoken love for Katherine, and Erica is guilty about pulling Toby into a relationship where they cannot have children.|$|E
25|$|Before Robin's funeral, Emma {{stands at}} Hook's grave and cries, {{trying to cope}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is truly gone now. Suddenly, a wave of magic flies through the air, causing her to stumble. She hears her name called from behind her and turns around and is shocked to see Hook. She happily embraces Hook, who tells her Zeus sent him back {{as a reward for}} {{stopping}} Hades. After informing him that Robin is gone, Emma decides to break the news about Hook's return to Regina as delicately as possible. However, when an earthquake occurs, Hook rushes to see if Emma is okay. It turns out the earthquake was caused by Mr. Gold tethering magic to the Olympian Crystal fragment. Emma works with Regina to find it, only to later have Gold explain that Henry used his Author power to steal the crystal to destroy magic (again). Both follow Henry to New York, where it turns out Gold got the crystal back. At the same time, Hook, David, Snow and Zelena are accidentally sucked into another realm, which they could become trapped in without any magic in the Real World. Henry succeeds in destroying magic, only to be later convinced by the Dragon to get enough belief to recharge the crystal. It works and everyone is brought home. Once back in Storybrooke, Emma shares a passionate kiss with Hook.|$|E

500|$|Bede {{describes}} Æthelberht's {{relationship with}} Rædwald, king of East Anglia, in a passage {{that is not}} completely clear in meaning. It seems to imply that Rædwald retained ducatus, or military command of his people, even while Æthelberht held imperium. This implies that being a bretwalda usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also {{that it was more}} than that, since Æthelberht is bretwalda despite Rædwald's control of his own troops. Rædwald was converted to Christianity while in Kent but did not abandon his pagan beliefs; this, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> retained military independence, implies that Æthelberht's overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in Bede should be translated as [...] "Rædwald, king of the East Angles, who while Æthelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people"; if this is Bede's intent, then East Anglia firmly was under Æthelberht's overlordship.|$|E
500|$|The medieval chronicler Matthew Paris {{said that}} Boniface was [...] "noted more for his birth than for his brains." [...] He showed little {{concern for the}} spiritual duties of his office. His exactions and his {{overbearing}} behaviour, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a foreigner, offended the English. He was heavily involved in advancing the fortunes of his family on the continent, and spent fourteen of the twenty-nine years he was archbishop outside England. He made strenuous efforts to free his office from debt, as he had inherited a see that was in debt over 22,000 marks, but managed to clear the debt before his death. He did this by securing the right to tax his clergy, for seven years, from the papacy. When a number of bishops refused to pay, they were suspended from office. He also worked for the canonisation of Edmund of Abingdon {{while he was at}} the papal court-in-exile at Lyon from 1244 to 1249.|$|E

500|$|The Silent Hill series uses {{symbolism}} and psychology; {{the town of}} Silent Hill draws upon the psyche of its visitors, ultimately creating an [...] "otherworld," [...] a twisting of reality that manifests delusions and elements of their subconscious minds, varying from character to character. Specifically, {{in the case of}} Silent Hill 2s primary player character James Sunderland, the version of the town he explores is influenced by him. Many of the monsters that roam the town symbolize his guilt, wish for punishment, for wife's three-year-long illness, and cease to exist after James comes to terms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> killed his wife Mary, partially to end her suffering and partially out of resentment and frustration. James knew she had a terminal illness, which has been speculated to be cancer, and he often read medical textbooks, searching for something to help her. During her last days alive, she became physically repulsive {{as a result of the}} illness and treated James abusively, ordering him to leave one moment and begging him to comfort her the next. The knowledge of her terminal illness caused her to become angry and to hurt her loved ones, particularly James, and it pained him to visit her in the hospital. Pyramid Head functions as an executioner of Maria, a delusion of James' who strongly resembles Mary. Through Maria's repeated deaths, Pyramid Head reminds James of Mary's death and causes him to experience guilt and suffering. His appearance as an executioner stems from a picture that James saw while visiting the town three years ago with Mary.|$|E

2500|$|After a {{year and}} a half in Spain, Hunt {{returned}} to his assignment at DODS. Following a brief tenure on the Special Activities Staff of the Western European Division, he became Chief of Covert Action for the region (while remaining based in the Washington metropolitan area) in July 1968. Although he was lauded for his [...] "sagacity, balance and imagination" [...] and received the second-highest rating of Strong (signifying [...] "performance... characterized by exceptional proficiency") in a performance review from the Division's Chief of Operations in April 1969, this was downgraded to the third-highest rating of Adequate in an amendment from the Division's Deputy Chief, who recognized Hunt's [...] "broad experience" [...] but opined that [...] "a series of personal and taxing problems" [...] had [...] "tended to dull his cutting edge." [...] Hunt would later maintain that he [...] "had been stigmatized by the Bay of Pigs" [...] and had come to terms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> [...] "would not get promoted too much higher." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was also}} {{known to have}} been the {{decision}} maker in who was the head boss of the Mexican cartels. He justified these actions by saying in private meetings that [...] "he felt they could do their best in picking the better of the bad apples". These events, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was linked to personally overseeing who ran the heads of each Mexican cartel, together with the increasing current account deficit fostered by government spending, caused alarm among Mexican and foreign T-bill (tesobono) investors, who sold them rapidly, thereby depleting the already-low central bank reserves (which eventually hit a record low of $9billion). The economically orthodox thing to do, {{in order to maintain the}} fixed exchange rate (at 3.3 pesos per dollar, within a variation band), would have been to sharply increase interest rates by allowing the monetary base to shrink, as dollars were being withdrawn from the reserves. Given the fact that it was an election year, whose outcome might have changed as a result of a pre-election-day economic downturn, the Bank of Mexico decided to buy Mexican Treasury Securities in order to maintain the monetary base, and thus prevent the interest rates from rising. This, in turn, caused an even more dramatic decline in the dollar reserves. These decisions aggravated the already delicate situation, to a point at which a crisis became inevitable and devaluation was only one of many necessary adjustments.
