The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
25|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{conservation}} hypothesis, people can exert self-control despite ego depletion if {{the stakes are}} high enough. Offering cash incentives or other motives for good performance counteracts the effects of ego depletion. This may seem surprising but in fact it may be highly adaptive. Given the value and importance of the capacity for self-control, it would be dangerous for a person to lose that capacity completely, and so ego depletion effects may occur because people start conserving their remaining strength. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> exert themselves on the second task, they deplete the resource even more, as reflected in severe impairments on a third task that they have not anticipated.|$|E

Theron described Mary, [...] "She makes this conscious decision to live in suburbia and be this soccer mom to her stepson and be the perfect wife—she lives in this bubble. But <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> that it usually means they are hiding some characteristic inside themselves that scares them. That is Mary's case.

50|$|In 1854, an {{epidemic}} of cholera decimated the population. The town closed down for two months in that summer, trying to contain the epidemic at a time <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not understand how it was transmitted. More than 100 people died. Other towns along the Maumee also suffered high losses from the epidemic, and Providence, Ohio was abandoned. It had suffered a disastrous fire {{less than a decade}} before.|$|R
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Bourdieu {{extended}} {{the notion of}} capital, defined as sums of money or assets put to productive use. For Bourdieu, these assets could take many forms which had not received much attention when he began writing. Bourdieu habitually refers to several principal forms of capital: economic, symbolic, cultural and social. Loic Waquant describes their status in Bourdieu's work in these terms: [...] "Capital comes in 3 principal species: economic, cultural and social. A fourth species, symbolic capital, designates the effects of any form of capital <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not perceive them as such." ...|$|E

[...] Her post featured a graphic that used gunsight crosshairs {{to mark the}} Democrats' districts. [...] She also tweeted to her supporters, [...] "'Don't Retreat, Instead – RELOAD!' Pls see my Facebook page." [...] Palin critics said she was inciting violence. [...] One of the targeted Democrats, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, objected to the graphic, saying, [...] "we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> that, they've got {{to realize that there}} are consequences to that action."

40|$|The present {{research}} examined when self-evaluation influences creativity. Based on objective self-awareness theory, the authors predicted that feeling able to improve would buffer against the detrimental effects of self-evaluation on creativity. Two experi-ments manipulated self-evaluation (varying self-awareness, Study 1; providing objective performance standards, Study 2) and perceived ability to improve potential failure on the creativ-ity task. Self-evaluation reduced creativity (generating remote associates, finding unusual uses for a knife) in both experi-ments, but only <b>when</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> {{not expect to}} improve. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> felt able to improve, self-evaluation did not affect creativ-ity.

2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} Scripture employs {{the idea of}} God's hiding God's face to {{designate}} the manifestation of a certain work of God. Thus, Moses the prophet foretold misfortune by saying (in God's words in [...] ), [...] "And I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured." [...] For, Maimonides interpreted, when people are deprived of Divine protection, {{they are exposed to}} all dangers, and become the victim of circumstance, their fortune dependent on chance — a terrible threat. Further, Maimonides taught that the hiding of God's face results from human choice. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not meditate on God, they are separated from God, and they are then exposed to any evil that might befall them. For, Maimonides taught, the intellectual link with God secures the presence of Providence and protection from evil accidents. Maimonides argued that this principle applies equally to an individual person and a whole community.|$|E
