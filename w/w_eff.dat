40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a serious}} contemporary health issue. Psychological co-morbidities such as anxiety and depression are common in COPD. Current evidence for treatment options to reduce anxiety and depression in patients with COPD was examined. There is evidence available for the efficacy of pharmacological treatments, cognitive behavioural therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, relaxation therapy and palliative care in COPD. Therapeutic modalities {{that have not been}} proven effective in decreasing anxiety and depression in COPD, but which have theoretical potential among patients, include interpersonal psychotherapy, self-management programmes, more extensive disease management programmes, supportive therapy and self-help groups. Besides pulmonary rehabilitation that is only available for a small percentage of patients, management guidelines make scant reference to other options for the treatment of mental health problems. The quantity and quality of research on mental health treatments in COPD have historically been insufficient to support their inclusion in COPD treatment guidelines.

We aimed to reach expert consensus on the most relevant set of self-management behaviors that can be targeted and influenced to maximize reduction of exacerbation impact. Materials and methods: A 2 -round Delphi study was performed using online surveys to rate the relevance and feasibility of predetermined self-management behaviors identified by literature and expert opinion. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analyses were used. Results: An international expert panel reached consensus on 17 self-management behaviors focusing on: stable phase (n= 5) : pharmacotherapy, vaccination, physical activity, avoiding stimuli and smoking cessation; periods of symptom deterioration (n= 1) : early detection; during an exacerbation (n= 5) : early detection, health care contact, self-treatment, managing stress/anxiety and physical activity; during recovery (n= 4) : completing treatment, managing stress/anxiety, physical activity and exercise training; and after recovery (n= 2) : awareness for recurrent exacerbations and restart of pulmonary rehabilitation.

The prevalence rate of COPD in the general Saudi population is estimated to be 2. 4 % and 14. 2 % among smokers. Not much is known about current health care services for patients with COPD in Saudi Arabia. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the current care services for patients with COPD provided by government hospitals in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Directors of the Department of Internal Medicine from all 22 general government hospitals that are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Higher Education in this region were asked to participate. Data were collected using a questionnaire. Results: The study results indicated that there are limited hospital facilities for patients with COPD: no respiratory departments in any of the included hospitals, no spirometry in 77. 3 % of the hospitals, no intensive care units in 63. 7 % of the hospitals, and no pulmonary rehabilitation program in any of the hospitals. Among the included 22 hospitals, 24 respiratory physicians, 29  respiratory therapists, and three physiotherapists were involved in COPD care. Conclusion: In conclusion, current care services provided by government hospitals in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia for patients with COPD do not meet international recommendations for COPD management. Increased awareness, knowledge, and implementation of COPD guidelines by health care providers will most probably improve COPD management in Saudi Arabia. In addition, the government could improve dissemination of information about COPD management through national programs and by offering specific education regarding respiratory diseases.

Study design and setting: In the COPE-II study, intervention patients received a standardized physiotherapeutic reactivation intervention (COPE-active) and control patients received usual care. The latter could include regular physiotherapy treatment. Information about the adherence of physiotherapists with the study protocol was collected by performing a single interview with both intervention and control patients. Patients were only interviewed when they were currently receiving physiotherapy. Interviews were performed during two separate time periods, 10 months apart. Nine characteristics of the COPE-active intervention were scored. Scores were converted into percentages (0 %, no aspects of COPE-active; 100 %, full implementation of COPE-active). Results: Fifty-one patients were interviewed (first period: intervention n = 14 and control n = 10; second period: intervention n = 18 and control n = 9). Adherence with the COPE-active protocol was high (median scores: period 1, 96. 8 %; period 2, 92. 1 %), and large contrasts in scores between the intervention and control group were found (period 1 : 96. 8 % versus 22. 7 %; period 2 : 92. 1 % versus 25. 0 %). The scores of patients treated by seven physiotherapists who trained patients of both study groups were similar to the scores of patients treated by physiotherapists who only trained patients of one study group.

40|$|The {{electroweak theory}} has been probed to {{a high level of}} {{precision}} at the mass scale of the Z 0 through the joint contributions of LEP at CERN and the SLC at SLAC. The E 158 experiment at SLAC complements these results by measuring the weak mixing angle at a Q 2 of 0. 026 (GeV/c) 2, far below the weak scale. The experiment utilizes a 48 GeV longitudinally polarized electron beam on unpolarized atomic electrons in a target of liquid hydrogen to measure the parity-violating asymmetry A PV in Møller scattering. The tree-level prediction for A PV is proportional to 1 – 4 sin 2 q W. Since sin 2 q W ≈ 0. 25, the effect of radiative corrections is enhanced, allowing the E 158 experiment to probe for physics effects beyond the Standard Model at the TeV scale. This work presents the results from the first two physics runs of the experiment, covering data collected in the year 2002. The parity-violating asymmetry A PV was measured to be A PV = - 158 ppb± 21 ppb stat ± 17 ppb sys. 1 The result represents the first demonstration of parity violation in Møller scattering.

The aim of this systematic review of counseling interventions for people with COPD was to describe: 1) counseling definitions, 2) targeted health behaviors, 3) counseling techniques and 4) whether commonalities in counseling techniques were associated with improved health behaviors. Ten databases were searched for original randomized controlled trials which included adults with COPD, used the term “counseling” as a sole or component of a multifaceted intervention and {{were published in the}} previous 10 years. Data extraction, study appraisal and coding for behavior change techniques (BCTs) were completed by two independent reviewers. Data were synthesized descriptively, with meta-analysis conducted where possible. Of the 182 studies reviewed as full-text, 22 were included. A single study provided a definition for counseling. Two key behaviors were the main foci of counseling: physical activity (n= 9) and smoking cessation (n= 8). Six studies (27 %) reported underlying models and/or theoretical frameworks. Counseling was the sole intervention in 10 studies and part of a multicomponent intervention in 12. Interventions targeting physical activity included a mean of 6. 3 (± 3. 1) BCTs, smoking cessation 4. 9 (± 2. 9) BCTs and other behaviors 6. 5 (± 3. 9) BCTs. The most frequent BCTs were social support unspecified (n= 22; 100 %), goal setting behavior (n= 11), problem-solving (n= 11) and instructions on how to perform the behavior (n= 10). No studies shared identical BCT profiles. Counseling had a significant positive effect for smoking cessation and positive but not significant effect for physical activity. Counseling for health behavior change was rarely defined and effectiveness varied by target behavior. Provision of specific details when reporting studies of counseling interventions (definition, BCTs, dosage) would allow clarification of the effectiveness of counseling as an approach to health behavior change in people with COPD.

This study aimed to summarize the evidence on effectiveness of self-management interventions and identify subgroups of COPD patients who benefit most. Methods: Randomized trials of self-management interventions between 1985 and 2013 were identified through a systematic literature search. Individual patient data of selected studies were requested from principal investigators and analyzed in an individual patient data meta-analysis using generalized mixed effects models. Results: Fourteen trials representing 3, 282 patients were included. Self-management interventions improved health-related quality of life at 12 months (standardized mean difference 0. 08, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 00 – 0. 16) and time to first respiratory-related hospitalization (hazard ratio 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 66 – 0. 94) and all-cause hospitalization (hazard ratio 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 69 – 0. 90), but {{had no effect on}} mortality. Prespecified subgroup analyses showed that interventions were more effective in males (6 -month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction P= 0. 006), patients with severe lung function (6 -month all-cause hospitalization: interaction P= 0. 016), moderate self-efficacy (12 -month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction P= 0. 036), and high body mass index (6 -month COPD-related hospitalization: interaction P= 0. 028 and 6 -month mortality: interaction P= 0. 026). In none of these subgroups, a consistent effect was shown on all relevant outcomes. Conclusion: Self-management interventions exert positive effects in patients with COPD on respiratory-related and all-cause hospitalizations and modest effects on 12 -month health-related quality of life, supporting the implementation of self-management strategies in clinical practice. Benefits seem similar across the subgroups studied and limiting self-management interventions to specific patient subgroups cannot be recommended.
