5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded Tierra del Fuego and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, von Spee detached Gneisenau and Nürnberg to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching Port Stanley, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> up steam. Von Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, Gneisenau and Nürnberg had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off Cape Horn.|$|E
5|$|TSN {{offered to}} {{broadcast}} her funeral live {{and to make}} the signal available to any other stations at no charge. Her husband, Shannon England, agreed to the broadcast on the condition that the family would not be shown during the service. CBC also broadcast the service, marking the first time a Canadian athlete's funeral had been televised live on two networks. The Brier <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> underway and games in the afternoon draw were delayed to allow curlers and fans to watch the funeral, which was broadcast on screens at the rink. Regina's Agridome and Schmirler's home Caledonian Curling Club also opened to show the funeral. Nine hundred people attended the service at the Regina Funeral Home, thousands watched at satellite locations around the province, and hundreds of thousands watched on television. The funeral was conducted by the Rev. Don Wells, and Sandra was eulogized by Brian McCusker, teammate Joan McCusker's husband.|$|E
5|$|The storm also {{affected}} the United Kingdom {{as it moved}} across the southern portion of the country. In Wales, Charley produced record-breaking daily rainfall, which surpassed 4inches (100mm) in Dyfed. Some locations received hundred-year rainfall. The storm struck the area during the Late Summer Bank Holiday, creating unfavorable conditions for driving and resulting in several accidents. Heavy rainfall flooded rivers, which swept away several people. This prompted officials to deploy boats and helicopters to assist in rescues, although at least three deaths were reported due to drowning in the rivers. Severe flooding was reported in Cumbria and Gloucestershire. The storm also left roads blocked by fallen trees and power lines. At {{the start of the}} storm, the inaugural Birmingham Super Prix motorsport race <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> underway but poor visibility from precipitation contributed to an accident which temporarily called halt to proceedings. In Whitland, Wales, local soldiers assisted rescuing people, and later contributed to the cleanup of the town. Throughout the country, five people were missing after the storm, all of whom are presumed to have drowned; an additional death was confirmed in Newry, Northern Ireland.|$|E

25|$|When he met Capote in 1948, Dunphy {{had written}} a well-received novel, John Fury, and <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> over a painful divorce from McCracken. In 1950 the two writers settled in Taormina, Sicily, in a house where the author D. H. Lawrence had once lived. Ten years older than Capote, Dunphy {{was in many ways}} Capote’s opposite, as solitary as Capote was exuberantly social. Though they drifted more and more apart in the later years, the couple stayed {{together}} until Capote's death.|$|E
25|$|Indianapolis {{businessman}} Carl G. Fisher first envisioned {{building the}} speedway in 1905 after assisting friends racing in France and seeing that Europe held {{the upper hand}} in automobile design and craftsmanship. Fisher began thinking of a better means of testing cars before delivering them to consumers. At the time, racing <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> started on horse tracks and public roads. Fisher noticed how dangerous and ill-suited the makeshift courses were for racing and testing. He also argued that spectators did not get their money's worth, as they were only able to get a brief glimpse of cars speeding down a linear road.|$|E

25|$|The {{limited number}} of copies {{available}} at first were targeted at a select fashionable readership. The late Autumn literary season <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> under way as the first reviews appeared, and by early January the book {{was the subject of}} conversations at elite literary gatherings. At venues such as Buckingham Palace and Lady Byron's parties, cosmic evolution became a topic of discussion {{for the first time in}} many years. Reforming medical journals including The Lancet for 23 November 1844 carried favourable reviews, while criticising specific points. In January the Unitarian quarterly Prospective gave powerful support, but the influential prestige quarterlies which could determine the long term success of books were still looking for reviewers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 July, Captain Ross and Colonel Fremantle made an {{inspection}} {{of the town of}} Gettysburg itself, intending to get to the cupola of the seminary, which had been used by General John Buford as a vantage point two days earlier. The commencement of the Union bombardment stopped the two observers, and so they returned to Longstreet's headquarters early in the afternoon. Fremantle alone found the General sitting on a small fence. Thinking that the battle <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> under way, Fremantle commented to Longstreet that he 'wouldn't have missed this for anything'. Longstreet wryly pointed out to his guest that the attack had already happened, and had been repulsed. Longstreet asked if Fremantle had anything to drink, at which the Englishman made a gift to the general of his silver hip flask.|$|E
500|$|The Championships {{were at risk}} {{of decline}} when in 2008 the Rotary Club {{declared}} that its members were simply too old to stage an annual event of its size. The Sinodun president, David Caswell stated: [...] "The trouble {{is there is a}} lot of heavy work staging the event. Some of our members are over 70, and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> too much". However, the Rotary Club of Oxford Spires declared that its members would continue hosting the event, thus preserving the competition for future generations. The President of Oxford Spires for 2008–2009, Liz Williamson, stressed that it should continue as the event was popular locally and demonstrated quirky English nature to a worldwide audience.|$|E

We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> it wrong. And he said after a concert, 'Phew, it's been a hard day's night.'" ...|$|E

Wade, then a sophomore at Marquette, went home for Christmas {{to be with his}} mom, who he believed was clean and sober {{for the first time in}} his life.

500|$|American {{producers}} Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Penelope Magnet, known {{collectively as}} RedZone Entertainment, presented Spears {{with the third}} song they had written and produced, [...] "Pop Culture Whore". While her management liked the track, she rejected it, telling them the song [...] "sucked". After bonding with Spears during a night in New York City to [...] "get in her world", as Magnet explained, {{it was easier to}} [...] "actually write and know what she would and wouldn't say, to know where her real vibe is". Stewart and Magnet began working on the first version of the song; Stewart came up with the track, while Magnet developed the melody on a piano and some of the lyrics. American producer The-Dream became involved after Stewart proposed him to work together on the track for Spears. He explained, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> into the business. I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] I hung up and just screamed out joyous sounds." [...] During the recording sessions, Stewart recalls that the studio's air-conditioning died for three days, but Spears [...] "didn't complain or anything, and for me that shows she's where she is for a reason." ...|$|E

[...] The Chatham team contained no players of note except for the ubiquitous Mr George Louch, no less, who <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> into his stride at this time and had already earned some rave reviews for his fielding in minor matches.

2500|$|A {{second round}} of {{recruiting}} for new regiments <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>getting</b> underway when Col. Borland began receiving reports of enemy movements in Missouri.

The Union army was massing troops in southeast Missouri mainly {{for the purpose of}} a thrust down the Mississippi River. But this posed a very real threat to all areas of northeast Arkansas. Col Borland indicated that he had reliable information [...] "that there are 300 infantry and 150 cavalry at Rives’ Station, on Black River, 35miles north of Pitman’s Ferry. Also that there is a strong infantry force-7,000-at Greenville, 15miles north of Rives’ Station." [...] Borland was maintaining a regular correspondence with Brig Gen. M.

They recorded two BBC sessions during the interim. The first single, [...] "Keep Yourself Alive" [...] (the Mike Stone mix, now considered the standard album version) was released a week before the album (UK dates, 6 and 13 July respectively).
