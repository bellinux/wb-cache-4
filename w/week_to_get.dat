25|$|The Tour is {{important}} for fans in Europe. Millions line the route, some having camped for a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the best view.

25|$|While Flood {{eventually}} got the higher salary he wanted, he believed Busch {{had intended to}} punish him for his costly error. He was further persuaded of this when the owner publicly chewed out the team during spring training before the next season, after players had successfully boycotted spring training for a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the owners to contribute more to their pension fund. Without mentioning any player by name, Busch excoriated players for forgetting that fans {{were the most important}} thing in the game.|$|E
25|$|Tampa Bay did not {{win their}} first game until the 13th week of their second season, {{starting}} {{with a record of}} 0–26 (though the Bucs had beaten the Atlanta Falcons 17–3 in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season). Until the Detroit Lions in 2008, the 1976 Bucs were the worst team in NFL history. Their losing streak caused them to become the butt of late-night television comedians' jokes. Their first win came in December 1977, on the road against the New Orleans Saints. The Saints' head coach Hank Stram was fired after losing to the Buccaneers. Tampa Bay only needed one more <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> their second victory, a home win over the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1977 season finale. The Cardinals also fired their coach, Don Coryell, shortly afterward. The team continued to improve in 1978, although injuries to several key players kept the team from achieving the winning record promised by McKay.|$|E

500|$|The Klingon Targ {{was created}} by {{dressing}} a tamed wild boar (named Emmy Lou) in an outfit created by costume designer William Ware Theiss. Executive producer Robert Justman later recalled, [...] "That pig smelled horrid. A sweet-sour, extremely pungent odor. I showered and showered, {{and it took me}} a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of it!" [...] To appear as the Traveler, Eric Menyuk wore a prosthetic piece (created by Michael Westmore) on his forehead which ran into his hairline.

500|$|Corzine {{had long}} insisted that state {{employees}} must bear {{part of the}} cost of their health benefits after retirement. As of July 1, 2007, in agreements with the Communications Workers of America, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, active State employees in those unions (as well as certain other non-union employees) are now required to contribute 1.5% of their salary to offset health care costs. State and local employees’ contributions to the two largest pension systems increased by 10%, from 5% to 5.5% of their annual salaries and increased the retirement benefit age for new public employees, from 55 to 60 years. In 2008, Corzine approved a law that increased the retirement age from 60 to 62, required that government workers and teachers earn $7,500 per year to qualify for a pension, eliminated Lincoln's Birthday as a state worker holiday, allowed the state to offer incentives not to take health insurance and required municipal employees work 20 hours per <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> health benefits.|$|E
500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E

60|$|Each {{of these}} {{endorsements}} necessitates something vexatious, personal attendance, photography, stamps, rubber stamps, mysterious signatures and the like, and always {{the payment of}} fees. Also they necessitate delays. The other day I had occasion to go to Moscow, and I learnt that it takes three <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a visa for Finland and three <b>weeks</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a visa for Esthonia. You see you can't travel about Europe at all without weeks and weeks of preparation. The preparations for a little journey to Russia the other day took three whole days out of my life, cost me several pounds in stamps and fees, and five in bribery.|$|R

2500|$|In-patient {{residential}} treatment for alcohol abuse is usually quite expensive without proper insurance. [...] Most American programs follow a traditional 28–30 day program length. [...] The length [...] is based solely upon providers' {{experience in the}} 1940s that clients needed about one <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over the physical changes, another week to understand the program, and another week or two to become stable. 70 to 80 percent of American residential alcohol treatment programs provide 12-step support services.

2500|$|In the {{run up to}} the 15th {{anniversary of}} Within Temptation, the band was asked by Belgian radio station Q-Music to choose and perform an {{existing}} track in a [...] "Within Temptation style" [...] once a week during fifteen weeks during their special program Within Temptation Friday. The covers consist most part of pop songs in which the band transformed into a more symphonic oriented form. Lead vocalist Sharon den Adel stated that:“Our approach was to really make the cover a new Within Temptation song. So not going the easy way by using only a piano or an acoustic guitar for example, but really trying to put {{all the elements of}} a Within Temptation track in this new version. It was quite a challenge because we had only one <b>week</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right, while recording an original Within Temptation song can sometimes takes up half a year! But this pressure also gave us an creative boost and it was very rewarding to get it done in time each week. Also, we learned a lot from the in-depth analysis we needed to make on these hits, written by others, in combination with implementing our own sound and style in each new cover. We are glad that we’ve taken up this challenge and are very proud of the result." [...] They covered artists such as Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, Lana del Rey, The Who among others. On [...] April 19, 2013, 11 of the 15 covers made by the band were them released in a cover album entitled The Q-Music Sessions. On the same day, the band released the official music video of their cover of Titanium.|$|E
