2500|$|Oracle Team USA was {{defending}} the America's Cup May 26–June 27, 2017 {{on behalf of}} the Golden Gate Yacht Club in Bermuda where racing took place on the Great Sound. Preliminary races were held in Portsmouth, Gothenburg, and Bermuda in foiling AC45s. After the 2013 America's Cup, the Golden Gate Yacht Club accepted a notice of challenge from the Hamilton Island Yacht Club, with whom a new protocol and a smaller [...] <b>wingsail</b> foiling catamaran class rule were proposed in cooperation with participating challengers. The Hamilton Island Yacht Club withdrew from the America's Cup in July 2014, citing unanticipated cost in mounting its challenge. The exiting challenger of record was replaced by a challenger committee, where decisions are made by popular vote. When an even smaller 50ft <b>wingsail</b> foiling catamaran class rule amendment was voted in April 2015, Luna Rossa Challenge also withdrew, citing significant costs wasted {{on the development of the}} larger vessel. [...] Yachts from France, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, and the UK remained in the competition to challenge for the cup. In June 2016, for the first time in history, an America's Cup race included fresh water sailing, [...] when preliminary races were held on Lake Michigan, based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, North America. Emirates Team New Zealand won the 2017 Louis Vuitton Cup and challenging the defender, Emirates Team NZ, won the America's Cup with a score of 7 to 1.|$|E
2500|$|Race eight brought Team New Zealand to {{the brink}} of disaster. Leading from the start to midway up the third leg, TNZ was tacking back to {{starboard}} to once again cover Oracle. However, a lack of hydraulic power at a crucial moment during the turn meant that the large <b>wingsail</b> did not move in time. The boat's starboard hull rose {{out of the water and}} Aotearoa came within a degree of capsizing. [...] To add insult to injury, Barker was penalised for failing to give way to Oracle who was on starboard tack at the time. Merely glad to have their boat in one piece, the New Zealanders followed Spithill to the finish 52 seconds behind.|$|E
50|$|Wingsails change camber (the {{asymmetry}} {{between the}} top and the bottom surfaces of the aerofoil), depending on tack, and wind speed. A <b>wingsail</b> becomes more efficient with greater curvature towards on the downwind side. Since the windward side changes with each tack, so must sail curvature change. This happens passively on a conventional sail, as it fills in with wind on each tack. On a <b>wingsail,</b> a change in camber requires a mechanism. Wingsails also change camber to adjust for windspeed. On an aircraft flaps increase the camber or curvature of the wing, raising the maximum lift coefficient—the lift a wing can generate—at a lower speeds of air passing over it. A <b>wingsail</b> has the same need for camber adjustment, as windspeed changes—a straighter camber curvature as windspeed increases, more curved as it decreases.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Wingsails</b> are of {{two basic}} constructions that create an airfoil, [...] "soft" [...] (fabric-shaped) and [...] "hard" [...] (rigid-surfaced). L. Francis Herreshoff pioneered a {{precursor}} rig that had jib and main, {{each with a}} two-ply sail with leading edges attached to a rotating spar. The C Class Catamaran class has been experimenting and refining <b>wingsails</b> in a racing context since the 60s. Englishman, John Walker, explored the use of <b>wingsails</b> in cargo ships and developed the first practical application for sailing yachts in the 1990s [...] <b>Wingsails</b> have been applied to small vessels, like the Optimist dinghy and Laser, to cruising yachts, and most notably to high-performance multihull racing sailboats, like USA-17. The smallest craft have a unitary wing that is manually stepped. Cruising rigs have a soft rig that can be lowered, when not in use. High-performance rigs are often assembled of rigid components and must be stepped (installed) and unstepped by shore-side equipment.|$|R

50|$|Other {{non-rotating}} airfoils {{that power}} sailing craft include <b>wingsails,</b> which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power some wind-powered vessels, {{but do not}} employ a mast to support the airfoil and are {{beyond the scope of}} this article.|$|R

50|$|The International C-Class Catamaran Championship, (ICCCC or I4C), is a {{match racing}} sailing {{competition}} featuring the highly innovative International C-Class Catamarans, predominantly with a <b>wingsail</b> rather than conventional sail plan.|$|E
50|$|On 17 October 2012, Oracle Racing's AC72 pitchpoled (somersaulted) and capsized, causing {{severe damage}} to the yacht. The <b>wingsail</b> was {{completely}} destroyed while being swept under the Golden Gate Bridge by a strong ebb tide.|$|E
50|$|Whereas {{conventional}} sails form an airfoil {{with one}} layer of fabric, <b>wingsails</b> comprise {{a structure that}} has material on both sides to form an airfoil—much like a wing placed vertically on the vessel—and are {{beyond the scope of}} this article.|$|R
50|$|Mechanisms for camber {{adjustment}} {{are similar}} for soft and hard <b>wingsails.</b> Each employs independent leading and trailing airfoil segments that are adjusted independently for camber. More sophisticated rigs allow for variable adjustment of camber with height {{above the water}} to account for increased windspeed.|$|R
50|$|Propulsion {{systems for}} ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, sailing, and {{mechanical}} propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, {{which was used}} even on large galleys. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the turbosails, rotorsails, and <b>wingsails</b> have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.|$|R
50|$|Close-hauled: At 30° {{apparent}} wind, the <b>wingsail</b> has a 10-degree {{angle of}} attack and more lift, compared to the conventional sail plan and its angles of attack of 15° for the jib and 20° for the mainsail.|$|E
5000|$|Louis Vuitton also {{sponsored}} the heats to the 2013 and 2017 America's Cups; These [...] "world series" [...] were sailed in smaller 45ft <b>wingsail</b> catamarans, the AC45. Participation was compulsory {{to take part}} in the Louis Vuitton Cup.|$|E
5000|$|Beam reach: At 90° {{apparent}} wind, the <b>wingsail,</b> positioned {{across the}} boat, functions efficiently as a wing, providing forward lift, whereas the jib {{of the conventional}} sail plan suffers from being difficult to shape as a wing (the main sail is still relatively efficient).|$|E
50|$|Propulsion by sail {{generally}} {{consists of}} a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays, and controlled by lines made of rope. Sails were the dominant form of commercial propulsion until the late nineteenth century, and continued to be used well {{into the twentieth century}} on routes where wind was assured and coal was not available, such as in the South American nitrate trade. Sails are now generally used for recreation and racing, although innovative applications of kites/royals, turbosails, rotorsails, <b>wingsails,</b> windmills and SkySails's own kite buoy-system have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.|$|R
25|$|At low to {{moderate}} speeds, a lightweight catamaran hull experiences resistance to passage through {{water that is}} approximately proportional to the square of its speed. A displacement monohull, by comparison, experiences resistance that is at least the cube of its speed. This means that a catamaran would require four times the power in order to double its speed, whereas a monohull would require eight times the power to double its speed, starting at a slow speed. For powered catamarans, this implies smaller power plants (although two are typically required). For sailing catamarans, low forward resistance allows the sails to derive power from attached flow, their most efficient mode—analogous to a wing—leading {{to the use of}} <b>wingsails</b> in racing craft.|$|R
50|$|Sailing {{employs the}} wind—acting on sails, <b>wingsails</b> or kites—to propel a craft {{on the surface}} of the water (sailing ship, sailboat, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of navigation. A course defined with respect to the true wind {{direction}} is called a point of sail. Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from sails on a point of sail that is too close into the wind. On a given point of sail, the sailor adjusts the alignment of each sail with respect to the apparent wind direction (as perceived on the craft) to mobilize the power of the wind. The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft to allow steering the course.|$|R
50|$|The AC72 (America's Cup 72 class) is a <b>wingsail</b> {{catamaran}} box rule, {{governing the}} construction and operation of the yachts {{to be used in}} the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup and the 2013 America's Cup. The class was subsequently replaced by the smaller AC50 class.|$|E
50|$|Broad reach: At 135° {{apparent}} wind, the <b>wingsail</b> may be eased in such {{a manner}} that it still functions efficiently as a wing, whereas the jib and main sail no longer provide lift—instead they present themselves perpendicular to the wind and provide force from drag only.|$|E
50|$|He also {{designed}} a remarkable boat, called the <b>Wingsail.</b> It had a rigid sail design {{mounted on a}} catamaran hull. Though he formed a company to market the design, {{it was not a}} success, as both the sail and the catamaran were ahead of their time.|$|E
40|$|There {{is a wide}} {{selection}} of methods and models {{that can be used to}} predict and monitor energy utilisation in ships. There is, however, no single model/method that can be applied generally to a vessel to increase its energy efficiency. The shipping industry faces the challenge of reducing fuel consumption and air emissions. There is a need to understand how much energy is needed and used by the entire energy system of a ship but with a resolution that can analyse this usage at a subsystem or component level. This report presents a state-of-the-art investigation of published models and methods within the research area of ship energy efficiency. Emphasis is placed on the existing models and methods for energy systems modelling (prediction, monitoring and improvements) and their applicability, strengths and weaknesses. The report also presents a review of green ship energy concepts such as wind power as auxiliary propulsion in ships, together with ship routing optimisation. The outcome of the study highlights two important issues. First, there is a need to develop a generic holistic model that would be applicable for ship energy efficiency analysis and simulations. The current state-of-the-art shows that parts of such a model exist, but they need to be combined to interact on a common basis. Second, the potential of wind power to act as auxiliary propulsion and ship routing optimisation can significantly reduce energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency of ships. Several technical concepts have been evaluated and tested, and <b>wingsails</b> are a solution that, together with ship routing algorithms, can significantly lower fuel consumption...|$|R
40|$|Propelling a boat {{forward by}} {{converting}} wave energy into propulsive thrust was first proposed in 1858 and first successfully done in {{practice in the}} 1890 s - to the author's knowledge. Several experimenters have since demonstrated the feasibility of wave-powered boats, both in model and full scale. The {{most common type of}} wave-powered boat, and also the type studied in this thesis, is a boat with foils that convert the vertical motion in waves into propulsive thrust. In addition to saving fuel, another benefit of these foils, called wavefoils in this thesis, is that they significantly reduce the most violent vessel motions. Previous theoretical models of wavefoils have neglected the effect of stall, which is reasonable only for small wave height and/or if the ship speed is high. To be able to simulate all wave conditions in real-time or faster, a slightly modified version of the Leishman-Beddoes dynamic stall model for the wavefoil forces was implemented in the time-domain ship simulator VeSim from MARINTEK. This model was compared with experiments and was found to give good estimates of the average foil thrust, although the experimental force histories were not always well reproduced by the model. The drawback of a spring-loaded wavefoil, which is commonly used to reduce the maximum angle of attack below the stall limit, is that the spring stiffness needs to be tuned for the instantaneous wave condition. In this thesis, two experiments where the foil was pitched automatically by a motor - so-called active pitch control - are presented. A model of a platform supply vessel was outfitted with a wavefoil with pressure sensors on and near the leading edge. The purpose of the pressure sensors was to relate the leading-edge pressure to the angle of attack. The actively pitch-controlled foil resulted in less ship resistance in waves than the fixed foil in some cases but could potentially have performed better with a stiffer pitch actuation mechanism. Another method of pitch control, where freely-rotating vanes near the foil detected the angle of attack, was also tested, with an improved pitch actuation mechanism. This method of pitch control relies on the value of a parameter in the control algorithm to result in reduced ship resistance, and this was also observed in the experiments. A spring-loaded foil was tested without the ship model and produced higher thrust than the actively pitch-controlled foil with angle of attack vanes. The added mass force is believed to have caused a more beneficial pitch motion for the springloaded foil than for the vane-based pitch-controlled foil. The experiments were compared with simulations in VeSim. Foil thrust and ship motions agreed fairly well in simulations and experiments, but there was less agreement for the ship resistance. At moderate speed, pitching the foil, either actively with a motor or passively with a spring, was shown to only be important for the wave periods producing the most violent ship motions. Simulated fuel savings for the vessel operating in irregular waves, with one wave height and three wave periods commonly found in the North Sea, were well above 30 % when sailing at 8 knots for several wave directions but decreased with increasing speed. A ship entirely powered by renewable energy was proposed and simulated. The ship was propelled by wind and wave energy using <b>wingsails</b> and wavefoils, while solar panels provided the necessary electricity for onboard use. Sailing between the Azores and Madeira, round-trip, the expected ship speed was 5 - 6 knots {{with a standard deviation of}} approximately 4 knots, for all four seasons. Experiments were performed with a small radio-controlled ship model, outfitted with a spring-loaded wavefoil underneath the bulb. The influence of the springstiffness on the ship speed was small in the experiments, and this was also found in simulations. Although the wavefoil was only beneficial for two of the three wave periods tested in the experiments, and only in head seas, simulations showed that the wavefoil is much more beneficial in full scale...|$|R
50|$|The World Series uses AC45 {{catamaran}}s, a one-design <b>wingsail</b> catamaran {{designed specifically}} for the event by Oracle Racing. The AC45 was conceived as a smaller version of the larger AC72 class rule which {{was used for the}} 2013 America's Cup. In 2015, the class was modified to AC45F which incorporated hydrofoiling capability for improved performance, with boats achieving peak speeds of 37kt.|$|E
5000|$|Early wings {{include the}} Patient Lady designs by Dave Hubbard and Duncan McLane, the Edge series by Lindsey Cunningham, {{and the very}} early wing sails found on the Hellcat series. The solid <b>wingsail</b> used by [...] "Oracle" [...] in the 2010 America's Cup {{successful}} challenge, and the AC45 and AC72s rely heavily on developments pioneered by the C Class community.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of rigging, supporting the mast {{of a conventional}} fore-and-aft rig limits sail geometry to shapes that are less efficient than the efficient narrow chord of the <b>wingsail.</b> However, conventional sails are simple to adjust for windspeed by reefing. Wingsails typically are a fixed surface area. Conventional sails can be furled easily; some flexible wingsails can be dropped, when not in use; rigid wingsails must be removed when exposure to wind is undesirable.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the load-bearing portions of the vaka hulls and aka are primarily of unidirectional carbon fiber composite over a nomex core. These are then faired using heat shrink membrane over foam cores.

The <b>wingsail</b> is made of a heat shrink membrane over a lightweight foam core.|$|E
50|$|The rig on Wharrams {{since the}} early 1980s is the 'Wharram <b>Wingsail</b> Rig', an {{appropriate}} tech squareheaded rig with low turbulence pocket round the mast and a short adjustable gaff at the head. The advantages of this rig are simplicity, low turbulence {{and the fact that}} it can be lowered in a following wind at any time. The Centre of effort on all Wharram rigs is kept low, giving them very good stability. No full-size Wharram has been known to have capsized.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wingsail</b> is a variable-camber {{aerodynamic}} {{structure that}} is fitted to a marine vessel {{in place of}} conventional sails. Wingsails are analogous to airplane wings, except that {{they are designed to}} provide lift on either side to accommodate being on either tack. Whereas wings adjust camber with flaps, wingsails adjust camber with a flexible or jointed structure (for hard wingsails). Wingsails are typically mounted on an unstayed spar—often made of carbon fiber for lightness and strength. The geometry of wingsails provides more lift, and a better lift-to-drag ratio, than traditional sails. Wingsails are more complex and expensive than conventional sails.|$|E

This has changed since to smaller, very lightweight boats. The Yellow Pages Endeavour, a highly optimized one-way proa design using a rigid <b>wingsail</b> lost its decade old 1993 500m record to a windsurfer in 2004. This was followed by frequently changing records, with windsurfers holding the record through 2008, when it was taken by a succession of kitesurfers. In 2009, in a radical shift away from the tiny surfboard based craft, the trimaran Hydroptère, with a length of 18.28 meters and a displacement of 6.5 metric tons, took the 500m speed record back for the D class boats.|$|E
50|$|The 2017 Louis Vuitton Challenger’s Trophy (officially, the Trophy {{was given}} to the winner of the 2017 Louis Vuitton America’s Cup Challenger Playoffs) was a {{competition}} held to determine the challenger in the 2017 America's Cup. The races ran from 5 to 12 June 2017 in Bermuda and were preceded by the 2015-16 America's Cup World Series. It was won by Emirates Team New Zealand who defeated Artemis Racing in the final. The races were conducted using AC50 yachts, a new class of 50 ft hydrofoiling <b>wingsail</b> catamarans, larger than the AC45F yachts used in the world series and smaller than the AC72 yachts used in 2013. Emirates Team New Zealand went on to compete with defending champions Oracle Team USA in the 2017 America's Cup match.|$|E
50|$|On November 8, 2009, {{the team}} {{announced}} that a rigid sail wing had been built for the yacht. The <b>wingsail</b> was initially 190 ft tall and some 80 percent larger than the wing of a Boeing 747 airplane; it was later extended to 223 ft. The wing has a very high aspect ratio, meaning {{that it is very}} tall and narrow. It can change camber to adjust lift in order to optimize performance. The wing consists of two main elements, separated by a vertical slot through which air can flow. The rear element is made up of several separate sections, whose angle can be adjusted separately, much like the flaps on an airplane's wing. Thus the lift of the sail can be controlled very finely, both overall, and for each section.|$|E
5000|$|Dragons {{are also}} capable of telekinesis, though this ability is unknown {{and used in}} an {{unconscious}} manner (to augment flight) until it is discovered as a conscious ability by the green dragon Zaranth and her rider Tai in the Thirty-first Turn of the Ninth Pass. It is speculated that the undersized wings were intentionally created in the dragons by Kitti Ping to reduce the surface area of a dragon that is exposed to possible Thread injury, and that the telekinetic abilities were intended {{to make up for}} the loss of <b>wingsail.</b> It is said in many books that a dragon can carry whatever it thinks it can carry. This is likely an extension of the telekinesis, mentally [...] "lifting" [...] the extra load. This is the most likely explanation for the great loads that dragons sometimes carry during emergencies.|$|E
