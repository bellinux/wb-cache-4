As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze.

500|$|During a {{scene when}} Gale's {{neighbor}} calls police to report his murder, a clock in Gale's apartment reads 10:13. This is a deliberate {{reference to the}} number 1013, which frequently appeared in The X-Files, where Vince Gilligan worked {{as a writer and}} producer and Bryan Cranston as an actor. It refers to the name of X-Files creator Chris Carter's production company Ten Thirteen Productions, which in turn is a reference to Chris Carter's birthday, October 13. A copy of Everything's Eventual, {{a collection of short stories}} by Stephen King, can be seen in Gale's apartment. After Walter and Jesse are released by Gus, they eat lunch at Denny's, a coffee shop and family restaurant chain. During this scene, they are wearing matching T-shirts with country music singer Kenny Rogers on them. The T-shirts are deliberately not explained in the episode, but Vince Gilligan said he believed Mike simply bought the first articles of clean clothing he could find for Walter and Jesse after their clothes were soaked with Victor's blood. During the final scene of [...] "Box Cutter", when Walter <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> to his condominium, the Alex Ebert song [...] "Truth" [...] plays in the background.|$|E

After Steph's funeral, Lee shows {{her family and friends}} individual films that Steph had recorded for all of them. However, she died before she could film Frankie's. On 11 March 2011, Cindy returns and Darren tells her about Steph and plays her the goodbye message. On 26 December, Steph made a one-off appearance as a ghost to Doug Carter (PJ Brennan).|$|E

500|$|An extended, eight-minute {{video for}} [...] "Pyramids", also {{directed}} by Elderkin, was later released on September 8, 2012. The video follows a loose narrative, with stream-of-consciousness scenes, and utilizes several songs from Ocean's album channel ORANGE. It begins with Ocean drinking four shots of absinthe at a bar, before opening fire upon the bar itself; {{a segment of}} [...] "Pink Matter" [...] plays during this portion. A title card appears as Ocean boards his motorcycle (the song [...] "Start" [...] appears.) As he rides off into the desert, a snippet {{of the first half}} of [...] "Pyramids" [...] plays before transition directly into the second half. Shots of Ocean singing on his motorbike are interspersed with slow-motion scenes of Ocean walking through a strip club in a hallucinogenic haze, occasionally bursting into laughter; the club employs vampy women. Ocean is then seen in front of a large neon triangle with the Kabbalahian Tree of Life in neon upon it, from which John Mayer emerges and performs an entirely new guitar solo exclusive to the video. James Montgomery of MTV News characterizes the scene as an inadvertent [...] "vision quest". Ocean falls down backwards, instantly re-appearing in the desert as a plane flies overhead. The song [...] "End" [...] appears as Ocean <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> to his motorcycle, picks up his helmet and walks down the highway towards a pyramid in the distance.|$|E
500|$|Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{is trying}} to get the Doctor's (Matt Smith) {{attention}} while he fixes the TARDIS. She discovers that her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) is helping the Doctor by installing thermal couplings underneath the glass floor of the TARDIS. Rory and Amy then start a small argument about Amy cheating when she took her driving test, when the TARDIS suddenly shakes and the lights go out. The Doctor asks Rory if he dropped a thermal coupling, which Rory admits to and apologises for doing. Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor's confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor when he dropped the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through [...] "emergency materialisation" [...] which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available. The lights come on, revealing another TARDIS inside the control room— the TARDIS has materialised inside itself. The Doctor experimentally walks through the door of the TARDIS inside the control room and instantly <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> into the control room through the door of the outer TARDIS. The Doctor tells Rory and Amy that they are trapped in a [...] "space loop" [...] and that nothing can enter or exit the TARDIS ever again. Despite the Doctor's words, another Amy enters through the TARDIS door saying, [...] "Okay, kids, this is where it gets complicated." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{dictionary}} definition of the word [...] "diva", before cutting to a parking lot outside of a warehouse. Beyoncé, {{wearing a pair of}} [...] "dangle shades", walks past a car full of mannequin parts into the warehouse. From here, she is accompanied by her two dancers and a variety of high fashion outfits. When she states [...] "Diva's gettin' money..." [...] she waves a fan made of $100 bills. During the bridge to the climax, Beyoncé dances on a single light and then during the climax, she is seen very glossy in another wardrobe choice dancing in robotic movements to the beat with gold punctuating the black and white scene. In one scene, Beyoncé is seen dancing robotically in front of a set of gold-tinted mannequins; while in another, she dances against a wall with two large chains hanging from the ceiling. During the last chorus, Beyoncé is in her last wardrobe change in front of window which is where the paparazzi had taken photos of her. At the end of the song, Beyoncé <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> out to the parking lot. She lights up a cigar and throws the lighter into the car, letting it explode. As she walks away, the intro to [...] "Video Phone" [...] (a track from I Am... Sasha Fierce) plays. The explosion retains its original fiery colors in contrast with the black and white.|$|E
50|$|Five years later, {{the band}} held a reunion gig in 1999, and this led on {{to a new}} album, <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home, with the band now working on a {{part-time}} basis. The <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home album combines eight songs that were brand new compositions, previously unreleased tracks, or released only with limited availability, with nine previously released Deacon Blue songs. In this sense, it is not purely a studio album nor a typical compilation album. Because, however, <b>Walking</b> <b>Back</b> Home {{marked the beginning of}} a new period of reformation and activity for the group, it is a significant album in their catalogue. The band released another album, Homesick, in 2001.|$|R

Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that she knows it was Den's baby. Chrissie, Zoe and Sam Hunter (Kim Medcalf) plan revenge on Den; Chrissie for his lies and adultery, Zoe for forcing her to fake a pregnancy and then sleep with him, and Sam for losing her pub to Den in a corrupt scheme that both he and Chrissie were involved in. Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding {{at the other side}} of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den <b>walks</b> <b>back</b> in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock all the doors. A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic." [...] so Chrissie picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.|$|E
