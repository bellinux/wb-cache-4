5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot understand what Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> revel in the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word that is always bleeped over.|$|E

From 1972 until 1983 he made pink films for the Shochiku subsidiary, Tōkatsu. L'ambition dans le miroir (1972), his first film for the studio, {{was one of}} Kobayashi's largest productions.

25|$|The {{language}} of Richard II is more eloquent {{than that of}} the earlier history plays, and serves to set the tone and themes of the play. Shakespeare uses lengthy verses, metaphors, similes, and soliloquies to reflect Richard's character as a man <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> analyse situations rather than act upon them. He always speaks in tropes using analogies such as the sun as a symbol of his kingly status. Richard places great emphasis on symbols which govern his behaviour. His crown serves as a symbol of his royal power and is of more concern to him than his actual kingly duties.|$|E
25|$|Frank is a wheeler-dealer <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> {{think of}} himself as a 'big player' in the {{business}} world, but in reality he {{is little more than a}} wily conman. He is a smooth-talker and full of charm, but his actions are often thoughtless and he tends to run instead of facing up to his responsibilities, leaving his loved ones to pick up the pieces. His love affair with Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) stems back to his teens, and he can never quite let her go, always breaking her heart, disappearing, and returning to break it all over again.|$|E
25|$|Aqua is {{the goddess}} of water who judged humans to send to the RPG world, up until Kazuma dragged her along with him. She is an {{energetic}} and inattentive girl <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> receive reverence for her status, particularly from her Axis cult, and gets upset easily. As an archpriest and a goddess, she is powerful against demons and the undead, {{and is able to}} resurrect recently deceased people as well as purify water supplies. However, despite her high stats in magic, her intelligence and luck are among the worst; additionally, rather than learning skills which would benefit her party, she spends most of her skill points learning party tricks.|$|E

Haley, <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> explore {{historical}} {{questions as}} a hobby, later {{told me that}} {{it is likely that the}} Russians – and not the Germans as is popularly supposed – founded the first rocket society in the world. At least Moscow had an interplanetary travel group as early as 1924, and three years later, at the time the Germans founded their first rocket society, the Russians were hosts to the first International Exhibition of Space Navigation. In 1928 and during the following four years Professor Nikolai Rynin published a formidable nine-volume encyclopedia entitled Interplanetary Communications. It was the first authoritative summary of man’s knowledge of space travel.|$|E
25|$|Sangakkara is a left-handed top order batsman <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> hit {{the ball}} square of the wicket on the off-side. While the cut and the pull are natural strokes for him, he tends to play off the front foot. The cover drive {{is one of his}} regular scoring shots. Sangakkara {{averaged}} 57.40 in Test cricket. In ODI cricket, he retired with an average of 42. Sangakkara handed his wicket-keeping duties in Test cricket to Prasanna Jayawardene in 2006. He played as a specialist batsman in Tests, and retired as a wicket keeper-batsman in other formats of the game. He is the first on the list of wicket keepers who contributed to the most number of dismissals in ODI cricket, With 499. He is also the wicket keeper with the highest number of stumpings—99—in ODI cricket.|$|E
25|$|James Cook (Jack O'Connell), Freddie McClair (Luke Pasqualino) and JJ Jones (Ollie Barbieri) {{have been}} best friends since childhood. Though Cook is charismatic and sociable, {{he is also}} boisterous and not afraid of authority. His womanising drives many of {{the events in the}} series. By contrast, Freddie is an easy-going skater <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> smoke weed, and as the more {{sensible}} and responsible friend, is often put out by Cook's behaviour. Cook and Freddie are both drawn to Effy, which drives a rift in their friendship. JJ's autism makes it difficult for him to fit in socially, but he has learnt to use magic tricks to make friends. His friends view him kindly but with a degree of amusement and sometimes irritation, but he knows Cook and Freddie will always take care of him. He is the kindest of the three, and by far the least worldly.|$|E

25|$|Safina is an {{aggressive}} baseliner <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> take {{the ball on}} the rise with full power on every shot. Her sharp angled forehand can force a return that she can hit with a big and heavy forehand for a winner. Her backhand can be flat, heavy, and devastating. She boasts a powerful first serve that sometimes lacks consistency in tight moments. Her primary weakness is her mental toughness, particularly in Grand Slam finals, although it has improved. Her emotions on court can hurt her game. A tenacous fighter, Safina made several notable comebacks, including at the 2008 French Open: down 6–7, 2–5 against Maria Sharapova, she fought off match point and won 6–7, 7–6, 6–2. She was also {{regarded as one of the}} most healthy and fit players on tour. Though an adequate lateral mover, she is less nimble moving forward and tends to avoid net play.|$|E
25|$|Malla {{is known}} as the {{dependable}} batsman of Nepal's team <b>who</b> <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> build the innings under pressure. He has been an important member of the national team and has contributed to many of Nepal's historic successes. He holds the record of hammering six '4s' in an over on his way to scoreing the fastest half-century for Nepal in One-Day matches off just 17 deliveries against Saudi Arabia in the 2012 ACC Trophy Elite. He then scored 212 runs with the impressive average of 42, including 2 fifties, which helped Nepal to win the title for the first time. His 86 runs against Canada in the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, 66 runs against USA in the final of 2012 Division Four, 76* against Qatar in the 2008 ACC Trophy Elite, 75 important runs against USA in the 2008 Division Five, and 67* off just 21 balls against Karnataka Institute of Cricket (India), (SAARC Under-25 Twenty20 Cup 2011) are some of the more memorable innings of his career.|$|E
