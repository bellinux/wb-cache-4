40|$|Medication {{management}} {{is one of}} the major roles of a nurse leader in any health care setting particularly in the nursing homes. Evidence suggests that errors do occur at any stage of the medication use process (prescribing, documenting/transcribing, dispensing, administering and monitoring) and these might pose significant risks to older people in nursing homes. Thus, this change project was carried out to reduce the incidence of medication errors, ensure resident’s safety and promote compliance with professional and national standards on medication management. A multiple approach using the PDSA cycle and Kotter’s eight steps change model was adopted to guide the change project. Data were collected 4 weeks prior to the implementation of this change project and the following types and frequency of error were detected : error detected through chart review include transcription error (2), omission error (4) and wrong time error (2); error detected through observation include <b>wrong</b> <b>form</b> (crushing medication- 4), wrong time (1), wrong patient (2) and wrong dose (5) while medication incident reporting form detected omission error (1) and wrong dose error (1). At the end of 5 months, data were collected through chart review, medication error reporting form and observation. Results showed that there was reduction in errors associated with lack of nurses’ knowledge on medication given resulting in brand name versus generic name confusion leading to transcription error. Wrong dose, wrong time, omission, wrong resident and <b>wrong</b> <b>form</b> errors were also observed to be significantly reduced...|$|R

The names extracted from that source were compared with names written in the staff lists of the three Universities in Nigeria. The wrongly written names were recorded on tapes and some native speakers were asked {{to listen to them}} to determine their correctness. We argue that <b>wrong</b> <b>forms</b> of some Yorùbá sentential/personal names are common occurrences and establish that they are traceable to the freedom granted by Yorùbá orthography developers.

In the Vana Parva, Chapter 194, the Mahabharata recommends that one must, [...] "conquer the mean by charity, the untruthful by truth, the wicked by forgiveness, and dishonesty by honesty". The Bhagavata Purana discusses when dāna is proper {{and when it is}} improper.

But, the major pitfall of this kind of approach is that, if in case, a <b>wrong</b> <b>form</b> of the function is chosen, it can lead to poor predictions.

Such a core in the novels by Bobrowski (and it was taken in his stories), the narrator speaks, as the author defines, “the master of narration”, who determines the internal unity of the novel: he freely connects time, space, country, people, and events.
