After a period of time passes, Jake begins absentmindedly narrating the events around him. Finn and BMO are drawn into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration.|$|E
5|$|After several disappointing seasons, Coughlin {{retired after}} the end of the 2015 season as head coach and {{replaced}} with previous offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo. McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 with a much improved defense (despite a mediocre offense). He was the first Giants coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his first year as head coach. On December 11, 2016, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a <b>walkie</b> <b>talkie</b> on the field.|$|E

5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Jake tries to fulfill a bizarre lifelong {{ambition}} of being a brick inside a shack as it collapses. Finn, being supportive, leaves a <b>walkie</b> <b>talkie</b> with Jake, who absentmindedly begins to narrate the events around him. Finn and BMO are drawn into Jake's storytelling, and Finn uses Starchy's radio station to broadcast Jake's narration of the trials and tribulations of a rabbit.

25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock razor wire fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). <b>Walkie</b> <b>talkie</b> announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E
500|$|Nikki then runs {{onto the}} beach, before {{collapsing}} where Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) are playing ping pong. As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her, she says something barely audible. She is soon pronounced dead. Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said {{before she died}} {{and come to the}} conclusion that she said, [...] "Paulo lies", although she actually said [...] "paralyzed". Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle. Sawyer finds a <b>walkie</b> <b>talkie</b> in Nikki and Paulo's tent, and concludes they were working with the Others, due to the similarity. Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp, but Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) reminds them that she was abducted nearby (unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her). Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he will do a perimeter sweep. Meanwhile, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who feels guilty, confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her. Sawyer returns, having found the diamonds, and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning. He gives the diamonds to Sun, but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because [...] "they're worthless here." [...] The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo, where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave. Nikki's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer are filling the grave, burying her and Paulo alive.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to gentrification, Williamsburg often saw {{tension between}} its Hasidic {{population}} and its black and Hispanic groups. In response to decades of rising {{crime in the}} area, the Hasidim created a volunteer patrol organization called [...] "Shomrim" [...] ("guardians" [...] in Hebrew) to perform citizens' arrests and {{to keep an eye}} out for crime. Over the years, the Shomrim have been accused of racism and brutality against blacks and Hispanics. In 2009, Yakov Horowitz, a member of Shomrim, was charged with assault for striking a Latino adolescent on the nose with his <b>Walkie</b> <b>Talkie.</b> In 2014, five members of the Hasidic community, at least two of whom were Shomrim members, were arrested in connection with the December 2013 [...] "gang assault" [...] of a black gay man.|$|E
2500|$|Gotti and Gravano {{arrived at}} the {{restaurant}} shortly before 5 o'clock and, after circling the block, parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance. Around 5:30, Gravano spotted Castellano's Lincoln Town Car stopped at a nearby intersection and, via <b>walkie</b> <b>talkie,</b> alerted the team of hitmen stationed outside the restaurant of Castellano's approach. Castellano's driver, Thomas Bilotti, pulled the car up {{directly in front of}} the entrance. As Castellano and Bilotti exited the Lincoln, the roughly half dozen shooters moved in and opened fire, killing both men in a barrage of bullets. As the hat-and-trench-coat-adorned men slipped away into the night, Gotti calmly drove the car past the front of the restaurant to get a look at the scene. Looking down at Bilotti's body from the passenger window, Gravano remarked, [...] "He's gone." ...|$|E

50|$|VHF is {{the first}} band at which {{wavelengths}} are small enough that efficient transmitting antennas are short enough to mount on vehicles and handheld devices, so the VHF and UHF wavelengths are used for two way radios in vehicles, aircraft, and handheld transceivers and <b>walkie</b> <b>talkies.</b> Portable radios usually use whips or rubber ducky antennas, while base stations usually use larger fiberglass whips or collinear arrays of vertical dipoles.|$|R

50|$|Intended {{as a cost}} savings, some systems employ {{vehicular}} chargers {{instead of}} a mobile radio. Each radio user is issued a <b>walkie</b> <b>talkie.</b> Each vehicle {{is equipped with a}} charger system console. The <b>walkie</b> <b>talkie</b> inserted into a vehicular charger or converter while the user is in the vehicle. The charger or converter 1) connects the <b>walkie</b> <b>talkie</b> to the vehicle's two-way radio antenna, 2) connects an amplified speaker, 3) connects a mobile microphone, and 4) charges the walkie talkie's battery. The weak point of these systems has been connector technology which has been proven unreliable in some installations. Receiver performance is a problem in congested radio signal and urban areas. These installations are sometimes referred to as jerk-and-run systems.|$|E

50|$|An {{intercom}} (intercommunication device), talkback or doorphone is {{a stand-alone}} voice communications system for use within a building or small collection of buildings, functioning {{independently of the}} public telephone network (Azori 2016). Intercoms are generally mounted permanently in buildings and vehicles. Intercoms can incorporate connections to public address loudspeaker systems, <b>walkie</b> <b>talkies,</b> telephones, and to other intercom systems. Some intercom systems incorporate control of devices such as signal lights and door latches.|$|R
50|$|Portable {{devices have}} also become usable when worn. For example, most <b>walkie</b> <b>talkies</b> {{come with a}} voice {{operated}} transmit capability {{so that they will}} work hands-free, when used with a wearable microphone. Many telephones such as the Motorola Star Tac also feature an earpiece that allows the phone to be worn and used hands-free. The Star Tac was the first wearable cellular telephone, {{in the sense that it}} was the first that could be used while being worn.|$|R
50|$|User {{equipment}} {{designs are}} similar to commercial land mobile two-way radio except the maximum legal output power is 5 Watts. External antennas are permitted and commercially manufactured antennas have gains as high as 12 dB. Handheld transceivers (<b>walkie</b> <b>talkies)</b> are permitted and have transmit power from 500 mW to 5 W (full legal power) and are relatively cheap compared to full-sized transceivers. Operation in the band is restricted to modes F3E and G3E (FM or PM of analogue voice telephony).|$|R
