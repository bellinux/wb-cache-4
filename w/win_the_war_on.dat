After a drug dealer who is prostituting Caroline refuses to reveal her whereabouts, Robert breaks into a seedy hotel room and finds a semi-conscious Caroline {{in the company of}} an older man. He breaks down in tears as Seth quietly leaves. Robert returns to Washington, D.C., to give his {{prepared}} speech on a [...] "10-point plan" [...] to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> drugs. In the middle of the speech, he falters as he realizes how futile this all is, then tells the press that the War on Drugs implies a war even on some people's own family members, which he cannot endorse.

2500|$|Morey {{has also}} written {{predictions}} that World War III will be caused by Islam. According to {{an article in the}} Orange County Weekly, in November 2001 Morey told a San Diego church audience that he had advised the State Department to blow up Mecca and Medina (Muslim holy cities) in order to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> terror quickly, but the State Department had not taken his advice because it is [...] "full of wusses." [...] Daniel Pipes said of Morey in a 1998 Middle East Quarterly book review that Robert Morey [...] "sees Islam primarily as 'a form of cultural imperialism' that seeks to impose the ways of seventh-century Arabia on twentieth-century America." [...] A detailed (18 page) criticism of Morey's methods has been written by Shabir Ali, President of the Islamic Information and Da’wah Centre International, Toronto, Canada, who charges Morey with deception, contradictions, and poor scholarship.|$|E
60|$|I {{have given}} the {{impression}} {{that at the time}} of my visit there was no lack of food in England, but I fear that I have not done justice to the frugality of the people, much of which was self-imposed for the purpose of helping to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>On</b> very, good authority I have been given to understand that food was less abundant during the winter just past; partly because of the effect of the severe weather on our American railroads, which had trouble in getting supplies to the coast, and partly because more and more ships were required for transporting American troops and supplies for these troops, to France. This additional curtailment was most felt by families of small income, whose earners were at the front or away on other government service. Mothers had great difficulty in getting adequate nourishment for growing children. But the British people cheerfully submitted to this further deprivation. Summer is at hand. It is to be hoped that before another winter sets in, American and British shipping will have sufficiently increased to remedy the situation.|$|E
