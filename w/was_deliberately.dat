5|$|By 2008 many Democrats were {{considering}} this approach {{as the basis}} for healthcare reform.

5|$|The {{building}} <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> mined {{after the}} Arabs had captured the area. Together with that major synagogue, another 57 Jewish sanctuaries were purposely and systematically {{destroyed by the}} Jordanians soon after their occupation of the Old City in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> alloyed {{with steel}} in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost.

5|$|Catholic worship <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> low key, {{usually in}} the private houses of recusant landholders or in {{domestic}} buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere and simply furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added. Gardner's Art Through the Ages and Silverman presents a similar view that the bust <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> kept unfinished. Hawass suggested that Thutmose had created the left eye, but it was later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, {{the ship}} was rearmed with light weapons and was {{converted}} into a blockship and was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets.

5|$|The art {{historian}} Hans J. Böker claims that Foliot began {{the construction of}} the Bishop's Chapel at Hereford Cathedral. Böker contends that the architectural style of the chapel (which was destroyed in 1737) resembled that of the German imperial chapels, and <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> chosen by Foliot to demonstrate his loyalty to King Henry. However most sources credit Robert of Hereford, bishop from 1079 to 1095, as the builder of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{theatrical}} release <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> small-scale, {{most likely}} undertaken {{to ensure that}} Going Clear met the eligibility criteria for an Oscar nomination.

5|$|This Court, {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process. For when, {{in the name of}} constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.|$|E
5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen flanking the damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.|$|E
5|$|Apple Computer {{announced}} an intention to acquire NeXT on December 20, 1996. Apple paid $429million in cash, which {{went to the}} initial investors and 1.5million Apple shares, which went to Steve Jobs, who <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> not given cash {{for his part in}} the deal. The main purpose of the acquisition was to use NeXTSTEP as a foundation to replace the dated classic Mac OS, instead of BeOS or the in-development Copland. The deal was finalized on February 7, 1997, bringing Jobs back to Apple as a consultant, who was later appointed as interim CEO. In 2000 Jobs took the CEO position as a permanent assignment.|$|E

5|$|Both Conte di Cavour and {{her sister}} ship, , participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940, where the latter was lightly damaged. They were both present when British torpedo bombers {{attacked}} the fleet at Taranto in November 1940, and Conte di Cavour was torpedoed. She <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> grounded, with most of her hull underwater, and her repairs were not completed before the Italian surrender in September 1943. The ship was then captured by the Germans, but they made no use of her. She was damaged in an Allied air raid in early 1945 and capsized seven days later. Conte di Cavour was eventually scrapped in 1946.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, most of {{the ships}} had been {{withdrawn}} to secondary roles, with Elba having {{been converted into a}} seaplane tender. Puglia was {{the only member of the}} class to take an active role, based out of Durazzo. Etruria <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> blown up by the Regia Marina as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary. The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of Puglia was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Southern Rhodesians' {{service on}} Britain's behalf in the World Wars, {{particularly}} the Second, {{was an integral}} part of the colony's national psyche. The territory had also latterly contributed to British counter-insurgency operations in Malaya, Aden and Cyprus, as well as Operation Vantage in Kuwait. The colonial government's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 <b>was</b> <b>deliberately</b> made on 11 November, Armistice Day, in an attempt to emphasise the territory's prior war record on Britain's behalf. The proclamation was signed at 11:00 local time, during the customary two-minute silence to remember the fallen.|$|E
