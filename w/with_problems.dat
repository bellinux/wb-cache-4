40|$|This {{study is}} a {{research}} on {{the stress of the}} secondary school students. The whole work included the construction of the Daily Hassle Scale of the Secondary School Students and the research on the mediate factors of the stressors. Six kinds of the daily hassle were found by the factor analysis: <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> academic performance, <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> school life, <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> teachers, <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> family, <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> heterosexual relation, <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> self-esteem. The reliability and validity of the scale is high. By the regression analysis of the SCL- 90 score, we found that the factors which influence the physical and mental health of the secondary school students are the personal character(neuroticism, locus of control), daily hassle (<b>problem</b> <b>with</b> academic performance, <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> heterosexual relation) and age. 本研究是针对中学生应激进行的研究。整个工作包括中学生日常烦恼问卷的建构和缓冲因素的研究。通过对中学生日常烦恼的因素分析，发现其由 6 个因素构成：与学业压力有关因素，与党校有关因素，与教师有关因素，与家庭有关因素，与异性有关因素和与自尊有关因素；该问卷具有良好的信，效度。通过对SCL－ 90 得分的多元回归分析，发现对中学生身心健康有重要影响的因素是个人心理特征（神经质，控制源倾向）， 日常烦恼（与学业压力有关因素，与异性交往有关因素）和年龄...|$|R

5|$|A secessionist {{rebellion}} {{in the southern}} province of Cisplatina in early 1825, and the subsequent attempt by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to annex it, led the Empire into the Cisplatine War. In March 1826, PedroI briefly became king of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Dona MariaII. The situation worsened in 1828 when {{the war in the}} south resulted in Brazil's loss of Cisplatina. During the same year in Lisbon, MariaII's throne was usurped by Prince Dom Miguel, PedroI's younger brother. The Emperor's concurrent and scandalous sexual affair with a female courtier tarnished his reputation. Other difficulties arose in the Brazilian parliament, where a struggle over whether the government would be chosen by the monarch or by the legislature dominated political debates from 1826 to 1831. Unable to deal <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, on 7 April 1831 PedroI abdicated in favor of his son Dom PedroII, and sailed for Europe.|$|E

5|$|Fiscal chaos, coupled <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> of {{transportation}} and the requisition of metal led to a general economic collapse as factories ran out of raw materials and laid off workers. The crisis especially afflicted Belgium's large manufacturing industries. As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid off workers. Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organisations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The policy escalated {{after the end of}} the German policy of deportation in 1917 which later created major problems for Belgian economic recovery {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
