40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} exercise on serum levels of creatin kinase (CK) in athletes with persistent hyperCKemia <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> (CK group) and in healthy athletes (control group). Prospective controlled study. Eighteen male Caucasian athletes with high serum CK <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> (CK between 80 and 150 U/L) and 25 male Caucasian athletes with normal serum CK <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> (CK between 10 and 80 U/L) Main Outcome Measures. Blood samples were collected <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> 30 minutes, 6 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours after a progressive cycloergometer test to exhaustion. The levels of serum CK and its isoenzymes were measured. In the control group, serum CK values <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> were normal (48. 18 ± 14. 14 U/L). After exercise, they increased slightly, though they always remained < 80 U/L, decreasing to the rest level after 48 hours. The CK group had serum CK <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> higher than normal (116. 56 ± 33. 30 U/L). Serum CK levels were still outwith the normal range after 48 hours (130. 11 ± 46. 95 U/L) and 72 hours (116. 55 ± 24. 84 U/L). Serum CK levels were significantly different in both groups {{both before and after}} progressive cycloergometer test to exhaustion. In athletes with high serum CK <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> serum CK <b>levels</b> remained elevated and had a different kinetics after exercise when compared with healthy athletes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{measured}} plasma atrial/brain natriuretic peptide (ANP/BNP) <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> {{and during}} exercise and correlated the results with various clinical findings, particularly with myocardial ischemia, in asymptomatic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BackgroundIn patients with HCM, ANP and BNP levels are elevated and exercise-induced myocardial ischemia is common. However, {{it has not}} yet been elucidated how these <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and their change with dynamic exercise are related to ischemia. MethodsLevels of ANP and BNP were measured <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and <b>at</b> peak exercise during 99 mTc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy in 31 asymptomatic patients with non-obstructive HCM and in 10 control subjects. ResultsLevels of ANP and BNP <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and the change of ANP and BNP levels (pg/ml) from rest to exercise were significantly greater in HCM than in control subjects (ANP: rest, 53. 2 ± 31. 8 vs. 11. 6 ± 6. 1; exercise, 114. 5 ± 74. 8 vs. 28. 3 ± 23. 4. BNP: rest, 156. 7 ± 104. 1 vs. 9. 8 ± 9. 6; exercise, 201. 6 ± 131. 5 vs. 13. 2 ± 14. 5). Septal perforator compression (SPC) and exercise-induced ischemia were observed, respectively, in 20 (64. 5 %) and in 19 (61. 3 %) patients with HCM. The increment of ANP during exercise was similar between HCM subgroups with or without inducible ischemia. However, BNP <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and BNP increments during exercise were significantly greater in the HCM subgroup with inducible ischemia than in the subgroup without (rest, 190. 5 ± 116. 2 vs. 103. 1 ± 48. 3; exercise, 250. 5 ± 142. 2 vs. 124. 2 ± 58. 6). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that SPC and BNP <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> were independently associated with exercise-induced ischemia. ConclusionsMeasurement of plasma BNP <b>levels</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> may be useful in predicting silent myocardial ischemia in HCM...|$|R
