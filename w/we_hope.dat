5|$|American Express {{had been}} in discussions to {{potentially}} live stream Lady Gaga's performance during Sunday's ArtRave event. American Express decided not {{to proceed with the}} live stream because of an inability to reach a mutual agreement on the production of the event. However, American Express honored its commitments to Lady Gaga and her team, and the event was able to proceed without an official role for American Express. Lady Gaga is an incredible artist and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> to work together in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} your command is, to destroy with fire and sword (if practicable) the Indian town and {{settlement}} at Sandusky, by which <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> to give ease and safety to {{the inhabitants of}} this country; but, if impracticable, then you will doubtless perform such other services in your power as will, in their consequences, {{have a tendency to}} answer this great end.|$|E

Let the bell be cast by the best workmen & examined carefully before it is Shipped with the following words well shaped around it vizt.|$|E

40|$|These {{studies were}} {{undertaken}} to ascertain what fungi are borne by barley kernels produced in Saskatchewan, and their possible pathogenic relations to their host. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> {{to develop a}} standard technique {{which could be used}} in testing seed samples for the presence of pathogens. <b>We</b> <b>hoped,</b> also, to show What fungi, if any, are associated with the commonest discolorations of barley in Saskatchewan...|$|R

5|$|So {{long as we}} exclude one community, {{we cannot}} as a {{political}} {{speak on behalf of}} or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as <b>we</b> <b>hope,</b> provincial autonomy is given to the provinces {{as a result of the}} reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.|$|E
25|$|This label wasn’t {{established}} to release throw-back records; instead <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> {{to make music}} that throws {{you back to the}} way you felt during the golden era of Hip Hop.|$|E

25|$|We {{know not}} whether some {{remarkable}} affronts {{given to the}} Devils by our disbelieving those testimonies whose whole force and strength is from them alone, may not put a period unto {{the progress of the}} dreadful calamity begun upon us, in the accusations of so many persons, whereof some, <b>we</b> <b>hope,</b> are yet clear from the great transgression laid unto their charge.|$|E
25|$|We {{prefer to}} look upon science and {{religion}} as separate domains which need not be in serious conflict and, therefore, need no reconciliation. If we seek the blending of science and religion and the integration of secular knowledge with sacred wisdom, then {{it is not in}} the subject matter of these fields but rather within the personality of the individual that <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> to achieve the synthesis.|$|E
25|$|We devoutly {{wish that}} a means {{had been found}} to avoid the May 4th events {{culminating}} in the Guard shootings and the irreversible deaths and injuries. We deeply regret those events and are profoundly saddened by the deaths of four students and the wounding of nine others which resulted. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> that the agreement to end the litigation will help to assuage the tragic memories regarding that sad day.|$|E

25|$|On 21 April 2005 Yusuf gave a short talk {{before a}} {{scheduled}} musical performance in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, {{on the anniversary}} of the prophet Muhammad's birthday. He said: There {{is a great deal of}} ignorance in the world about Islam today, and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> to communicate with the help of something more refined than lectures and talks. Our recordings are particularly appealing to the young, having used songs as well as Qur'an verses with pleasing sound effects...|$|E
25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid {{lies in the fact that}} we create large, utopian lists of things <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> to accomplish, without the means to actually see them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E
25|$|We {{may have}} to ASSASSINATE {{some of the people}} you elect on Nov. 7! This could be your LAST ELECTION CHANCE, to save this Republic... Sorry to have to be so blunt, but the country is in mortal danger from our present {{government}} and our liberty is already near dead because of this government. If you are too stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> our method does not become necessary.|$|E

25|$|In 1805, Detroit {{experienced}} a devastating fire, which destroyed {{most of the}} city's French colonial architecture. Shortly afterward, Father Gabriel Richard said, Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus, meaning, <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> for better things; it will arise from the ashes, which became the city's official motto. For Detroit, Justice Augustus B. Woodward devised a plan similar to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's design for Washington, D.C.. Detroit's monumental avenues and traffic circles fan out in a Baroque styled radial fashion from Grand Circus Park {{in the heart of}} the city's theater district.|$|E
25|$|We see a one-of-a-kind {{chance to}} make an {{investment}} that is true {{to all of our}} values and our giving priorities and that embodies the kind of flexible, creative, and transformative philanthropy we believe in. At its best, <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> our involvement may bolster the spirit of positive engagement and creativity in Detroit, catalyzing others to invest strategically across the region. It does not mark the start of philanthropy as a solution to public insolvency. This is a unique, clear-eyed move to push forward positive negotiations, with our philanthropic dollars being exclusively pegged for two roles: safeguarding the DIA and protecting pensions.|$|E
25|$|The second {{so-called}} sura, entitled al-Hafd (haste) {{translates as}} follows: 'O Allah, we worship You and to You we pray and prostrate and to You we run and hasten to serve You. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.' Obviously these two pieces constitute so-called 'qunut', i.e. supplications which Muhammad sometimes {{said in the}} morning prayer or witr prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran. They are in fact identical to some parts of qunut reported in the collections of hadith. See: Nawawi, al-adhkar, Cairo, 1955, pp.57–8.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, an hour ago; six kegs, by the carrier's van, of a {{hundredweight}} each. Not {{so much as}} <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> for, but something, though, as {{the cannon}} has not come--for the King's folk had none--it is of no use." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{increase}} and {{high percentage of}} respondents in Hungary who hold negative views of Jews are disturbing. More than {{a decade after the}} fall of Communism, <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> that such anti-Jewish attitudes would have begun to diminish rather than increase".|$|R
25|$|Oh, praised be {{the beauty}} of this earth; the beauty, and the bloom, and the mirthfulness thereof. We lived before, and shall live again; and as <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> for a fairer world than this to come; so we came from one less fine. From each {{successive}} world, the demon Principle is more and more dislodged; he is the accursed clog from chaos, and thither, by every new translation, we drive him further and further back again. Hosannahs to this world! so beautiful itself, and the vestibule to more. Out of some past Egypt, we have come to this new Canaan, and from this new Canaan, we press on to some Circassia.|$|E
25|$|We {{would like}} to make it {{perfectly}} clear here at camp LED that we do not in any way condone any such behavior related to these charges. We, however, are not a judge or a jury and don't want to be one any time soon. We are however a band that really just wants to continue playing music. We know that these times have been severely trying for Dominic and the accuser. <b>We</b> <b>hope</b> for the best outcome for all parties. However, Dominic will no longer be playing music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death. This matter that he faces requires all of his attention right now and we wish him well as I know all of you do.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} reason for Kol Nidre was {{suggested by the}} Zohar; God has already threatened and vowed terrible punishments upon the Jewish people for their sins, but by our own demonstration that we can unbind ourselves from vows using Kol Nidre <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> to persuade God to similarly annul His own vows of calamity. As stated in the Orot Sephardic mahzor: According to the holy Zohar, Kol Nidre is recited on Yom Kippur because, at times, the Heavenly judgment is handed down as an 'avowed decree' for which there can normally be no annulment. By reciting the Kol Nidre annulment of vows at this time, we are asking of God that He favor us by annuling any negative decrees of judgment that await us, even though we are undeserving of such annulment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I, too, am sorry," [...] agreed Zellerndorf. [...] "I {{can assure}} you that the news <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> Captain Maenck would bring from America would have gone a long way toward {{restoring}} you to the confidence and good graces of the king." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} we broke camp and started off for the strange place which <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> to capture. A hundred miles it was across the {{trackless}} wilds, and each man was ordered to carry on his back provisions for four days only.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} Bastin retired down the path, {{realising}} {{that he had}} to do with cannibals. We said that we preferred to look at the girls alive and would meet them again to-morrow morning, when <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> that the house would be ready.|$|R
