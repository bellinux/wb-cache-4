5|$|Critics {{argued that}} the {{confusing}} format of The Million Second Quiz, along with its lack of drama and technical issues with the show's app during {{the first days of}} the series, caused viewers to lose interest in <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> on air. Although peaking at 6.52 million viewers for its premiere, ratings steadily dropped during the show's run before rising again near the finale.|$|E

The laughter lifts Jack out of his bad mood, and he tells Liz what an important friend she is.|$|E

On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E

Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by treating them to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car.

5|$|Polo was {{introduced}} into the area of Manipur state {{as early as the}} seventh century, and Manipuri ponies were one of the first breeds used in the game. The British learned of polo during the 19th century while <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> played on Manipuri ponies in India. The breed is still used for polo today in India, but other breeds are more popular in Europe and America. Manipuri ponies are often also used to play sagol kangjei, a version of polo believed to be close to what was originally played when the sport was invented. Sagol kangjei is more demanding than modern polo, as ponies are used for the entire match instead of being changed between periods. Manipuri ponies are also used for racing. During their early history, they were in demand as cavalry horses, and men that rode these ponies were thought well-mounted. They continue to be in demand for military uses.|$|E

5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E
5|$|At this time, other Hurricanes {{were already}} in action with Bf 110s from Zerstörergeschwader 26 (ZG 26). The Irish ace Timber Woods {{attacked}} a formation of Bf 110s positioned above him. One of the Bf 110s detached itself and dived on the RAF pilot. Pattle, instinctively knowing that the German had the advantage and the Hurricane pilot had acted foolishly, dived toward the Bf 110. He engaged the Bf 110, knowing he too would likely be followed and attacked from behind. He succeeded in shooting it down in flames, but not before it had fired at point-blank range into the Hurricane, with the same effect. Woods died when his fighter crashed into the harbour. Pattle avoided a German counter-attack and climbed instead of attempting a dive, since the Bf 110s could out-dive the Hurricane. He fired into another Bf 110 and avoided a collision with a third. No RAF pilot saw Pattle die for certain. Jimmy 'Kettle' Kettlewell, one of Pattle's unit, {{arrived on the scene}} moments after Pattle had scored his victory. He saw a lone Hurricane diving towards the sea, its pilot slumped forward over the controls and flames engulfing the engine compartment. Two Bf 110s were still firing at it. Seizing the opportunity, he engaged and shot one of them down <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> and the Hurricane hit the sea simultaneously. Kettle did not specify the fate of the German crew — the victory was his fifth, making him an ace. It is possible Kettlewell's victim was one of two 5./ZG 26 Bf 110s that were lost: Bf 110E, Wrk Nr. 4272, Oberfeldwebel Georg Leinfelder and Unteroffizier Franz Beckel who were killed in action or Bf 110E, Wrk Nr 4299, Oberleutnant Kurt Specka and Günther Frank. A third Bf 110 crash-landed with severe damage. Kettlewell was shot down and wounded in the same battle.|$|E

25|$|Production on {{the pilot}} episode of TV Nation began in January 1993. Moore {{initially}} turned {{to friends and}} colleagues in many production areas, while also making a point to ensure the show's employees were unionized. For the show's title sequence, graphic designer Chris Harvey put together the images, and music group tomandandy wrote the TV Nation theme. After completing the pilot in three months, both NBC executives and focus groups were highly impressed with the show. But without room in their fall 1993 schedule, NBC indefinitely delayed committing to a full season. That winter, the head of BBC2 heard about the pilot, and after <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> offered to buy the show. With firm interest in the show, NBC offered to put TV Nation into its summer 1994 lineup.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Jeopardy! series, {{hosted by}} Art Fleming, premiered at 11:30a.m. Eastern (10:30 Central) on March 30, 1964, originating from the NBC headquarters in New York City's Rockefeller Center. NBC moved {{the program to}} 12:00 noon Eastern (11:00a.m. Central) after 18 months, making it accessible to businessmen coming home for their lunch break or else <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> on restaurant or bar sets, and college students departing their classes for the day. These two constituencies, who ordinarily {{did not have the}} time or interest to view other daytime programs, made the show a runaway hit, propelling its ratings to second place among all daytime game shows {{by the end of the}} decade—second only to its immediate lead-in, The Hollywood Squares. The show had practically no trouble whatsoever against soap operas such as Love of Life on CBS and mostly sitcom reruns on ABC.|$|E
25|$|After an off day, the Blue Jays {{played against}} the Orioles at home. Toronto {{would win the}} first game of the series, 13–6. Tensions nearly boiled over when Jason Garcia threw behind Jose Bautista, and three pitches later, Bautista hit a home run, <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> all the way and slowly {{rounding}} the bases. Between innings Bautista and Adam Jones exchanged words, and after the game Jones claimed that Garcia's pitch was unintentional. Bautista cited the previous series against Baltimore, in which reliever Darren O'Day threw behind him and he would hit a home run off O'Day in the same at-bat. Bautista would miss the following game with a right shoulder strain. Devon Travis returned to the lineup and hit a go-ahead two-run home run in the fifth inning to lead Toronto to a 4–2 victory. The Blue Jays would complete their first sweep of the season, beating Baltimore 7–6 on April 23. Drew Hutchison pitched 8 innings, taking a perfect game into the sixth inning, and became the first Toronto starter to go 8 innings in the 2015 season.|$|E
25|$|I had {{my editor}} count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in the}} film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are <b>watching.</b> <b>It</b> is.|$|E
5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly <b>watched</b> <b>it.</b> 77% of preschoolers <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups <b>watched</b> <b>it</b> before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly were less likely to be regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|R

25|$|This series {{marked the}} return of Billy Murdoch as Australia’s leader, and pitched him against The Champion, WG Grace. The Australian side was good, {{but they were still}} without some of their best players. 1890 was a wet summer, and the rain {{affected}} all of the three planned Tests. The first Test was the most eagerly anticipated match of the English summer, with 30,279 spectators <b>watching</b> <b>it</b> over the 3 days, though Stoddart and Briggs did not play. Rain on the 2 days before the match left the pitch slow, but it got steadily better and better, and was at its best on the last day, when England scored 137 to win by 7 wickets, with Grace, who was out for a duck in the first innings, scoring 75 not out. The second Test at the Oval was particularly tense, partly, no doubt, because Andrew Stoddart (an amateur) chose to play for Middlesex, whilst Peel and Ulyett (professionals) were claimed by Yorkshire. Rain before the first day’s play contributed to 22 wickets falling for 197 runs on day 1. On day 2, England only needed 95 to win, they lost eight wickets to Charles Turner and Ferris before getting them, with the winning run being scampered as Australia missed a clear run out chance. A planned third Test match at Old Trafford, Manchester was washed out, thereby becoming the first Test to be abandoned entirely because of the weather.|$|E
