5|$|On a {{beach in}} Côte d'Ivoire, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered by Solomon Merkmallen, a biology professor. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> it to his office and places it together with a similar artifact, the two suddenly fuse and fly across the room, becoming embedded in a Bible. Merkmallen then travels to the U.S. to meet with Steven Sandoz, an American University biologist who has a third artifact. However, he is murdered by a man posing as Sandoz; when the real Sandoz finds the body, he flees.|$|E
5|$|One of the outlaws, a {{black man}} named James Middleton, leaves {{the safety of the}} group to be with his wife, Pauline. James is {{subsequently}} killed by Loco <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> Pauline hostage. Vengeful, Pauline writes to Silence, requesting him to kill Loco. Meanwhile, the newly-elected Governor, hoping to have order maintained before declaring an amnesty regarding the outlaws, assigns the righteous but bumbling soldier Gideon Burnett as the sheriff of Snow Hill. On his way, Burnett encounters the outlaws, who steal his horse for food. After getting lost in the snow, he finds a stagecoach travelling to Snow Hill, on which he meets Silence, and later, Loco. Upon arrival, Silence meets Pauline, who promises to raise his reward.|$|E
5|$|Shaw wrote The Christening, {{his only}} novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both {{of his mother and}} a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E

25|$|Mehmet is a Turkish Cypriot and {{the older}} brother of the {{original}} owner of the Bridge street café, Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). He is first seen in Albert Square in June 1985 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> part in one of Ali's regular late-night poker games. Like his brother, Mehmet is a serial gambler and whenever he gambles the stakes are often foolishly high. Unlike his brother, Mehmet doesn't live in Walford but Stoke Newington.|$|E
25|$|Ratmir is {{interrupted}} in his journey {{by a young}} maiden who beckons him into a castle, where he finds himself enveloped in luxury. He soon forgets Ludmila. Ludmila eludes Chernomor’s henchmen by remaining invisible, but then is tricked by the wizard into revealing herself <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the form of Ruslan and calls to her in his voice. He is thwarted {{by the sound of}} a horn and hurries off, leaving his hat behind.|$|E
50|$|His best bowling {{season was}} 1932 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> 80 wickets. In later years, he was {{inclined}} to be expensive and bowled less, but his best bowling performance of 9 for 42 in an innings in the Roses match against Yorkshire came in 1937, a season <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> only 28 wickets in all matches.|$|R

25|$|Jepson, a right-arm fast-medium bowler, {{made his}} county debut as a 23-year-old in 1938. He had his best summer in 1947 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> 115 wickets at 27.78, the only {{occasion}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> more than 100 wickets in a season.

25|$|In 2010, Saavedra and Shulman {{associate}} {{produced the}} New York premiere of Craig Wright's Mistakes Were Made Off-Broadway at the Barrow Street Theatre. The comedy, directed by Dexter Bullard, starred Academy Award-nominated actor Michael Shannon as Felix Artifex, a B-list Off-Broadway producer who gets in way over his fast-talking head <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> on a gargantuan epic about the French Revolution which {{he thinks is}} going to be his ticket to professional and personal reclamation. While trying to land a big star for the lead role, he uses all his powers of persuasion, seduction and intimidation to strong-arm the writer into massively rewriting his play.|$|E
25|$|On 4 May, Acevedo Vilá marched from La Fortaleza, the Governor's house, to the Capitol. It was {{the first}} time in Puerto Rican history that such an event has happened. In Puerto Rican custom, the Governor walks from the Capitol to La Fortaleza <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the oath of office. Acevedo Vilá was criticized due to the {{similarities}} between this march and an episode of the TV series The West Wing, in which the President of the United States (portrayed by Martin Sheen) walks from the White House, home of the President, to the U.S. Capitol, home of the U.S. Congress, in order to resolve a federal budget crisis.|$|E
25|$|Max Guazzini, a media man, {{wanted to}} develop the club as a modern {{business}} and use marketing methods. He never hesitates {{when it comes to}} promoting his club and creating a buzz. As a result, the club has been attracting an equal number of cheers and criticisms. The first objective was to offer a nice show to people who would then become regular paying fans. Guazzini also introduced female cheerleaders, music before kick-off, the sound of bells to mark the end of each half (instead of a more traditional siren), fireworks at the end of evening matches and a radio-controlled car to bring the tee to the kicker <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> a penalty or a conversion kick.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a general}} {{similarity}} running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt {{be accounted for by}} the extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding on too much design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.|$|E
25|$|There {{will be a}} lot {{of sympathy}} for Watkins <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas do not agree with the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E
25|$|Season 5, the show's final season, {{introduces}} {{several new}} cast members, chief amongst them Spike (James Marsters), an old vampire ally/foe of Angel's who also starred in Buffy. In this series, Spike reluctantly fights beside Angel as their rivalry continues – now tinged with Spike existing as another vampire with a soul, {{and by the}} romantic feelings {{that both of them}} have for Buffy Summers. One of the legendary Old Ones, Illyria (Amy Acker) starts off as an adversary of the team after taking over Fred's body, but comes to join the team as she must learn to cope with the changed world and the new emotions she feels as a result of taking over a human. Finally, there's Harmony Kendall (Mercedes McNab), another Buffy alumna and former friend of Cordelia who was turned into a vampire. Resembling the old personality of Cordelia, Harmony is grudgingly accepted by Angel as his secretary <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> over the Los Angeles branch of Wolfram & Hart.|$|E

500|$|Down on {{his luck}} and starved for inspiration, Lisa {{recommends}} Homer visit the Springfield Art Museum. But {{none of the}} art Homer sees serves to inspire him; he feels inadequate when he sees what other artists have done, and it only worsens the situation <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him. He goes back home, discouraged, but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa. She tells him about the artist Christo, causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking. He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire hydrants (having covered the sewer drains with the city's doormats, including their own) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo (so {{that they do not}} drown). Surprisingly, Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer's work, and enjoy the newly made [...] "Grand Canals of Springfield" [...] along with the swimming zoo animals.
