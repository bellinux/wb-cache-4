5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of the media coverage of cricket, Agnew developed a love for playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{could also}} be {{regarded}} as dragonlike, such as rams. It was said that a rooster, a gander, or a turkeycock could grow a pair of little wings beneath their natural wings, thus becoming powerful dragons. A dragon rooster dug a hole beneath the threshold of his owner's house. As soon as dark clouds appeared, the rooster <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hole, and his spirit would fly out from his body into the clouds to fight with ale. One day the owner killed the rooster, and immediately went mad. Another dragon rooster, with two combs, would {{fall to the ground}} and lie as if dead during thunderstorms. The Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian and smok in Bulgarian) was regarded as a very beneficial animal. People avoided disturbing it in any way. The Aesculapian snake which inhabited a crop field or a vineyard was seen as its guardian. The snake was said to fly into the hail clouds and drive them away from its field or yard, or it dispersed the clouds by raising its head high in the air and hissing as strong as it could. In the region of Niš, the Aesculapian snakes were said to help the dragon boy in his fights against ale. If an Aesculapian snake attained a certain age, it would grow wings and become a dragon.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a legend}} {{that takes place}} in the time of Nabeshima Mitsushige, the second daimyo of the Saga Domain, Hizen Province, {{concerning}} the bakeneko. Mitsushige's retainer Ryūzōji Matashichirō served as the daimyos opponent in the game of go. Ryūzōji displeased Mitsushige and was put to the sword. Ryūzōji's mother, while telling of the sorrows in her heart to the cat that she raised, committed suicide. The cat licked the mother's blood and became a bakeneko. It <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> castle and torment Mitsushige every night. Mitsushige's loyal retainer Komori Hanzaemon finally killed it and saved the Nabeshima family.|$|E
25|$|At WWDC 1996, Apple's new CEO, Gil Amelio, {{used the}} keynote to talk almost {{exclusively}} about Copland, {{now known as}} System 8. He repeatedly stated {{that it was the}} only focus of Apple engineering and that it would ship to developers at the end of summer with a full release planned for late fall. Very few, if any, demos of the running system were shown at the conference. Instead, various pieces of the technology and user interface that <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> package (such as a new file management dialog) were demonstrated. Little of the core system's technology was demonstrated and the new file system that had been shown a year earlier was absent.|$|E

25|$|Come late October, {{and with}} the season rapidly approaching, DIG chose not {{to go forward with}} the offer to buy the team. Differences between Wojcicki and the others about control over {{operations}} of the team were part of the problem. DIG at one time even offered to buy the team outright from Wojcicki, but an agreed upon price could not be achieved. This {{due in large part to}} the group being unable to verify the finances of the club. The newly appointed commissioner of the league flew to Edmonton and met with Best in a last-ditch attempt to have the group move forward with the purchase however no positive resolution could be made.Thus, Wojcicki <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> season financing the club alone.|$|E
25|$|Chad's eschatological {{consciousness}} {{and its effect}} on others is brought to life in a reminiscence attributed to Trumbert, who was one of his students at Lastingham. Chad used to break off reading whenever a gale sprang up and call on God to have pity on humanity. If the storm intensified, he would shut his book altogether and prostrate himself in prayer. During prolonged storms or thunderstorms he <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church itself to pray and sing psalms until calm returned. His monks obviously regarded this as an extreme reaction even to English weather and asked him to explain. Chad explained that storms are sent by God to remind humans of the day of judgement and to humble their pride. The typically Celtic Christian involvement with nature was not like the modern romantic preoccupation but a determination to read in it the mind of God, particularly in relation to the last things.|$|E
25|$|This {{corresponds}} to the kinetic energy the expelled reaction mass would have at a speed equal to the exhaust speed. If the reaction mass had to be accelerated from zero speed to the exhaust speed, all energy produced <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reaction mass and nothing would be left for kinetic energy gain by the rocket and payload. However, if the rocket already moves and accelerates (the reaction mass is expelled in the direction opposite to {{the direction in which}} the rocket moves) less kinetic energy is added to the reaction mass. To see this, if, for example, =10km/s and the speed of the rocket is 3km/s, then the speed of a small amount of expended reaction mass changes from 3km/s forwards to 7km/s rearwards. Thus, although the energy required is 50 MJ per kg reaction mass, only 20 MJ is used for the increase in speed of the reaction mass. The remaining 30 MJ is the increase of the kinetic energy of the rocket and payload.|$|E

25|$|General Marshall managed some {{cooperation}} {{early in}} his mission, when both groups agreed {{to meet with him}} and form a top-level negotiating Committee of Three. Chiang Kai-shek appointed General Chang Chun as his representative, and Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, appointed Zhou Enlai. The committee held its first formal session at Chungking on January 7, 1946, and three days later, agreed on a cease-fire to take effect at midnight on January 13. The terms of the agreement were simple: Both sides were to cease hostilities and halt all troop movements except those of the Nationalist forces into and within Manchuria, where government sovereignty was being reasserted. An Executive Headquarters would be established at Peking following the Committee of Three pattern to supervise the cease-fire agreement, and operational teams– including a Nationalist, a Communist, and an American officer– <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> field to ensure compliance with cease-fire provisions. It was made clear, however, that American participation {{in the work of the}} Executive Headquarters would be restricted to aiding the Chinese members. In effect, each American team member acted as did General Marshall, but in a greatly restricted capacity.|$|E
500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] aided Thriller in {{becoming}} the biggest selling album {{of all time}} and has been referenced by performers such as Justin Timberlake, Chris Brown and Usher. The Guardian reflected that [...] "more thought went into the production of this single than <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> entire recording careers of Axl Rose, Coldplay, Shania Twain or Gwen Stefani." [...] The song and accompanying performances contributed to Jackson's status as a legendary pop icon.|$|E
500|$|While {{the deal}} was {{initially}} for a [...] "one-week dialogue polish", Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography. The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg {{and members of the}} cast and crew to decide what <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors' improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set, most notably Roy Scheider's ad-lib of the line [...] "You're gonna need a bigger boat." [...] John Milius contributed dialogue polishes, and Sugarland Express writers Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood also made uncredited contributions. Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material. One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark's death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a [...] "big rousing ending". The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to {{try to come up with}} something better."In the early 1980s, the media began to call this style [...] "breakdance," [...] which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was [...] "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz." [...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E
500|$|At the time, the South Vietnamese {{government}} {{was plagued by}} infighting. A civilian government and cabinet led by Prime Minister Nguyen Ngoc Tho was appointed by the MRC to ease some of the workload on non-military matters. However, the presence of Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Tôn Thất Đính in both the civilian cabinet and the MRC paralyzed the governance process. Dinh and Don were subordinate to Tho in the cabinet, but {{as members of the}} MRC they were superior to him. Whenever Tho gave an order in the civilian hierarchy with which they disagreed, they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> MRC and give a counter-order. The junta was paralyzed because all twelve generals in the MRC had equal power. Each member of the MRC had the power of veto, enabling them to stonewall policy decisions. The press strongly attacked Tho, accusing his government of being [...] "tools" [...] of the MRC. The media further derided Tho for the personal benefits that he gained as a landlord from the Diệm administration's token land reform policy. On January 1, 1964, a Council of Notables comprising sixty leading citizens met for the first time. Its job was to advise the military and civilian wings of the government with a view towards reforming human rights, the constitution and the legal system. The council, which consisted almost entirely of professionals and academic leaders, soon became engaged in endless debate and never achieved its initial task of drafting a new constitution.|$|E
500|$|The Tide {{went ahead}} in the second quarter. [...] Greg McElroy threw for only 58 yards on 6 of 11 passing for Alabama, but 23 of those yards came on a {{completion}} to Julio Jones that advanced {{the ball to the}} Texas 12. [...] Three plays later Mark Ingram ran it in from two yards out, and Alabama went ahead 7–6. [...] After an exchange of punts, Bama took possession on the Texas 49-yard line, and on the second play Trent Richardson burst {{through a hole in the}} middle and raced 49 yards untouched for the touchdown, extending the lead to 14–6. [...] Texas continued to struggle for offense in McCoy's absence, and on the next possession a Texas drive ended when Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass at the Alabama 25. [...] Following a short punt late in the quarter, Bama drove to the Texas 9, and increased their lead to 17–6 following a successful 26-yard Leigh Tiffin field goal. [...] It appeared that the Crimson Tide <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> locker room leading 17–6. [...] However, after gaining nine yards on a rush up the middle, Texas called time out with 15 seconds left. With the ball at the Texas 37, Gilbert threw a shovel pass to D.J. Monroe, who bobbled the ball and batted it into the arms of Alabama defensive lineman Marcell Dareus, who lumbered 28 yards for a touchdown that made the halftime score 24–6.|$|E
