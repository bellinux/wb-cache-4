40|$|Analysis of the {{fuelwood}} {{situation has}} been hampered {{by lack of}} reliable information, and {{has been the subject}} of considerable debate. The present paper assesses the implications of recent information on the subject. New data and recent more accurate projections show that increasing urbanisation and rising incomes lead to fuelwood users shifting to charcoal and other fuels. The rate of increase in fuelwood use is slowing down and in some areas consumption is now in decline. In contrast, charcoal use is growing strongly and is becoming a much larger part of the <b>woodfuels</b> total in some regions. In general, the new information supports arguments that fuelwood use seldom requires major interventions to maintain or augment supplies, though in some areas charcoal may. However, though <b>woodfuels</b> may be less of a concern to the security of the forest estate than was previously feared, huge numbers of people continue to rely on <b>woodfuels</b> as a source of energy or income, and will continue to do so. The review argues that these linkages constitute a larger component of the contribution that forestry can make to poverty alleviation than appears to be currently reflected in most forestry and agroforestry policies and programmes. Areas that could need attention in order to address such neglect are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{significance}} of biomass energy {{in developing countries}} has increasingly attracted {{a great deal of}} attention. The basis of the interest in biomass energy is often considered to be the 1973 oil crisis, which, among other things, focused attention on renewable sources of energy. As a result of the crisis, it became apparent that traditional biomass fuels [...] firewood, charcoal, crop residuals, and cow dung [...] were the primary cooking and heating fuels {{for the majority of the}} population in developing countries, especially the rural and urban poor. The situation remains the same today, biomass fuels are the primary domestic fuels for the majority of the population in developing countries. However, the main reason for the growing interest in biomass energy in developing countries is the concern that, in these countries, biomass energy is in jeopardy because of the combined effects of increasing demand and diminishing supplies of the traditional fuels;This study examines the status of biomass energy in Zambia. In its current usage, the concept of biomass energy often implies <b>woodfuel</b> because <b>woodfuel</b> is the main biomass energy. This study develops an econometric model of household <b>woodfuel</b> demand and also evaluates the supply of <b>woodfuel</b> in Zambia;The study finds that there are significant sectoral differences in <b>woodfuel</b> demand between the rural and urban sectors. In the rural sector, inflation is by far the most significant determinant of household <b>woodfuel</b> demand.

Currently 85. 2 % of households’ land holding is less than 1 ha, insufficient to grow food and fuelwood for a household of the average size of 5. 5 persons. Without well documented reports of the individual impact of each deforestation factor, woodfuels have been most blamed. This paper investigates how the current <b>woodfuel</b> industry impacts on energy, poverty and forests and analyses the <b>woodfuel</b> policy instruments.

The profitability of replacing existing heating units by investing in a new district heating (DH) scheme is very dependent on the available investment support, price level of woodchips and substituted light fuel oil, and the amount of sold energy.

40|$|Wood biomass {{forms the}} basis for a variety of {{products}} and it represents an important source of technical energy. <b>Woodfuels</b> and forests play an important role for climate change mitigation, by their ability to replace fossil fuel and sequester atmospheric carbon. At the same time, wood extraction is an important driver for deforestation. However, large uncertainties relate to the amount and spatio-temporal pattern of wood use. We here present a comprehensive assessment of wood biomass flows in 11 world regions from 1990 to 2010. We found that global total biomass appropriation (TBA) amounts to 1. 81 GtC/year in 1990 and 1. 94 GtC/year in 2010 (+ 7 %). In 2010, TBA represents 4 % of the global forest net primary production. Only 54 % of TBA enters socioeconomic systems while 46 % remain in forests or represent waste flows. About 56 % of economically used wood biomass enters the energy sector. There are considerable regional variations in wood biomass flows among world regions, owing to differences in population, affluence, and area. Global demand for wood is expected to increase in the near future, putting additional pressure to forest ecosystems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Household {{energy in}} sub-Saharan Africa is largely derived from <b>woodfuels</b> burned in simple stoves with poor {{combustion}} characteristics. These devices emit products of incomplete combustion [PICs] that both damage {{human health and}} negatively impact the atmospheric radiation budget. We use empirical studies and published emission factors to estimate the pollution associated with production, distribution and end-use of common household fuels and assess the impacts of these emissions on {{public health and the}} global environment. We find that each meal cooked with charcoal has 2 - 10 times the global warming effect of cooking the same meal with firewood and 5 - 16 times the effect of cooking the same meal with kerosene or LPG depending on the gases that are included in the analysis {{and the degree to which}} wood is allowed to regenerate. However, although charcoal is worse than other fuels with respect to GHG emissions, it can lead to reductions in concentrations of pollutants like particulate matter (PM). Concentrations of PM in households using charcoal were found to be 88 percent lower than households using open wood fires (charcoal: 465 ± 387 µg/m 3; open wood fires: 3764 ± 714 µg/m 3 (mean± 95 % CI)). Two years of health data collected from Kenyan families using wood and charcoal shows that charcoal users experienced 44 - 65 percent fewer cases of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) compared to wood users.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 This report {{presents}} the off-design analysis of various wood-fired combined-cycle power plants {{using a computer}} model to simulate plant performance. The combined-cycle systems investigated are characterized by having a <b>woodfueled</b> combustor, an indirect-fired gas turbine, and a Rankine steam cycle. This work was conducted {{as part of a}} larger biomass energy project at Oregon State University. Three particular systems were studied in this report. First, system 5 utilizes a wet-cell combustor requiring little fuel preparation. Hot combustion gases leave the combustor and flow through a heat exchanger where steam produced in the heat recovery steam generator is superheated. The combustion gases then flow through a second heat exchanger heating pressurized air supplied by the compressor. The hot, compressed air stream is returned to the gas turbine driving the gas turbine-compressor set after which the turbine exhaust is used as combustion air. After leaving the heat exchangers, the combustion gases flow into the heat recovery steam generator where feedwater is converted to steam. Finally, the relatively cool combustion gases flow through air pollution devices before being discharged to the atmosphere. With system 2, the wet-cell combustor is replaced with a suspension burner requiring additional fuel preparation (fuel moisture content dried to 12 percent wet basis and a smaller particle size). A trimburner unit is implemented in system 7 raising the temperature of the air entering the gas turbine to 1612 F. Other than the previously noted exceptions, systems 2, 5 and 7 are identical in design except for changes in heat transfer area. To facilitate fuel drying, the gas temperature entering the dryer is increased by reducing the heat recovery steam generator size approximately 45 percent in system 2. The computer simulation consists of a main program and component models. The main program coordinates the transfer of information between component models and checks for convergence of the solution. Equations describing individual processes occurring in each component are evaluated in their respective model. Unknown variables require an initial guess when commencing program execution. Variables are continuously updated during each subsequent iteration until convergence is obtained. The computer simulation allowed various system component operating limitations to be analyzed over a range of anticipated off-design conditions. Based on monthly variations in fuel moisture content and ambient temperature, the power output and efficiency of each plant were simulated over an entire year. Recommendations for improved plant design are also discussed...|$|R

A nuanced examination of <b>woodfuel</b> supply, demand, use, and markets illuminated options to turn stagnant policies based on charcoal 'bans' and fuel-substitution into proactive, realistic ones acknowledging <b>woodfuel</b> dominance and its socio-economic importance. Findings revealed growing, spatially differentiated <b>woodfuel</b> deficits in southern and central Malawi and around Blantyre, Zomba and Lilongwe cities. Poverty, limited electricity access, reliability and generation exacerbated by tariff subsidies, and complex fuel-allocation decisions restricted energy-ladder transitions from woodfuels to electricity, producing an enduring urban-energy mix dominated by charcoal, thereby increasing wood consumption. Diverse socio-political interests prevented lifting of the charcoal 'ban' despite progressive forest laws. Despite implementation challenges, lessons already learnt, efficiency and poverty-reduction arguments, limited government capacity, growing illegal production of charcoal in forest reserves, and its staying power, make targeted community-based forest management (CBFM) approaches more practical for regulated, commercial production of woodfuels than the status quo.

40|$|The {{expected}} {{increase in}} future demand of biomass feedstock in Rwanda cannot be met because of constraints at the supply side. This {{has a negative}} effect on the energy security for Rwandese in the future and the income generated for the Rwandan population involved in biomass feedstock production. There are, however, opportunities to stimulate the typically informal private sector in such a manner that the biomass energy production is made more sustainable. This thesis conducts research into the REDD+ mechanism (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (UN, 2011)) and the role it can play for the Rwandan biomass feedstock market. Next, an exploration is made of the current charcoal and fuelwood value chains to be able to better promote sustainable production of biomass. Then, an adapted version of business model generation theory from Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010) of Vastbinder, Kroesen, Blom, and Ortt (2011) is applied to generate sustainable business models. It is shown through a charcoal and a fuelwood cooperative business model that existing, improved and economically viable techniques exist in Rwanda which can be exploited to improve the sustainability of practices within the charcoal and fuelwood value chains; and leverage private investment. It is also shown that REDD+ can provide the financial argumentation for private smallholders to provide a tangible benefit of being in a cooperative, but that {{there is a lack of}} data available to prove it. Based on the research findings, the Government of Rwanda is recommended to build institutional capacities at different levels of Government in order to: (1) Align laws and policies applying in the different sectors involved in biomass energy production so that competition for land between energy, agriculture and forestry is decreased; (2) Develop and implement laws and policies specifically addressing charcoal and fuelwood in Rwanda which can be monitored uniformly and are applied consistently across the various levels of Government; (3) Promote increased social, economical and ecological benefits of improved charcoal and fuelwood production cooperatives to reach more formal organization of the charcoal and fuelwood sector and more equally distributed income across the value chains; (4) Gain insight in what the economic characteristics of the charcoal and fuelwood markets in Rwanda are, so that intervention to create long-term economic sustainability is founded on better reasoning; (5) Operationalize additional value of their project-involved activities, so that sustainable benefits of practical intervention can be proven and continued funding for the longer term can more easily be derived. Based on the research findings, it is recommended to DGIS (the Directorate General for International Cooperation) to: (1) Reconsider their food security definition to include domestic cooking energy for developing countries which are densely populated and rely on traditional biomass. The current food security definition increases competition between wood production for domestic energy provision and agricultural food production - without the energy to cook there are no means to achieve food security; (2) Convince the international developing aid community that a reconsideration of the food security definition is needed; (3) Provide aid to the Government of Rwanda through bilateral agreements for: a. Capacity building activities (e. g. institutional or business); b. Gaining an insight in the economic characteristics of the charcoal and fuelwood markets in Rwanda; (4) Develop guidelines for the REDD+ mechanism on which data can be collected in what way to be able to prove additional value of certain projects. Currently these guidelines do not exist. Hence, sustainable benefits of practical intervention are short term. This is because involved parties lack the time and resources to consider long-term sustainability – potentially through carbon finance – since short-term results are needed; (5) Follow up on the previous recommendation so that current and future funding of projects requires not just a focus on practical intervention, but focuses on proven long-term additionality of practices as well; (6) Research opportunities to develop a mechanism by which such supply-side interventions in woody, traditional biomass value chains can be funded. Although these interventions are beneficial in terms of sustainable development, the old-fashioned image of <b>woodfuels</b> and the complexities with terrestrial carbon – including forest carbon – calculations hamper the possibilities for funding of wood energy interventions at the supply side.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of the <b>woodfuel</b> energy situation in rural Ghana. Despite the high degree of <b>woodfuel</b> dependency, which may perpetuate a near-subsistence level of economic development and potential degradation of the environment, {{there is a lack of}} detailed information at the critical use levels of the farm village and its household units upon which to assess the situation and as a basis for energy planning. This thesis attempts to combine the need for detailed data acquisition and the need to describe and explain the actual <b>woodfuel</b> situation. The field study covered households in three villages in Eastern Ghana based on methods which included measurement, weighing, interviewing, observation, and diary keeping. Data was collected over a period of 10 months.;The basic data confirmed the overall level of dependence on <b>woodfuel</b> for virtually all energy requirements. However, whereas all three villages were broadly similar as to <b>woodfuel</b> use, there were important distinctions between them as to quantity and quality used and, especially, the local availability and sectors of use. Based on initial data presentation, further analysis was undertaken of a wide range of household variables using both univariate and multivariate analytic techniques. Although some postulated variable relationships were confirmed, the overall situation was found to involve a number of critical variables whose significance varied somewhat between villages and in relation to sources and uses of <b>woodfuel.</b> The underlying nature of the ecosystem and its overt reflection in terms of the farming system are strong determinants of <b>woodfuel</b> supply in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Potentially, the most critical impacts of <b>woodfuel</b> use are those of an ecological nature [...] the loss and/or degradation of the natural vegetation. While the situation is not yet critical in terms of depletion, evidence suggested widespread degradation, especially in the two villages in the drier forest zones. The socio-economic impacts are more varied, including time and physical efforts spent collecting, as well as the actual and potential problems of development in a constrained energy situation.;The conclusion to the study stresses the complex nature of the <b>woodfuel</b> situation even at the relatively homogeneous farm village household level. Given this complexity and the level of dependency on <b>woodfuel</b> that will likely continue, energy planning must be undertaken at the rural village level, based on detailed acquisition and use of information...|$|E

Many forestry specialists and environmentalists are putting up ideological resistance. Others question the capacity of existing forests to meet this increased demand in a sustainable way. At the very least, a trend toward industrialization and privatization of the <b>woodfuel</b> sector would have major implications for ownership and forest management. However, despite concerns surrounding <b>woodfuel,</b> we argue that the extent of the energy demand to be met and the pressure from new private industrial players will oblige the forestry sector to broaden its position. It will have to consider the possibility of entering a new transformative era that not only includes <b>woodfuel</b> but also has implications for forest management, rights of access, justice, and sustainability.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of <b>woodfuel</b> studies focuses on the political dynamics behind access to the <b>woodfuel</b> trade, providing better insights into patterns of inclusion and exclusion and options for resource management. Institutional mechanisms that govern access are difficult to untangle {{in the context of}} informal trade. This paper analyzes institutions and how they regulate access to commercialize <b>woodfuel</b> in two areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A review of empirical data (surveys and interviews) and secondary data on wood energy value chains in the DRC is used to examine the ways that <b>woodfuel</b> institutions affect access to resources and to markets. The main findings are that existing formal mechanisms regulating access to the <b>woodfuel</b> trade are hardly enforced. Informal, socially embedded institutions generally govern access, and the trade is open to less privileged and rural actors. People who benefit from these informal arrangements have many vested interests, and current production patterns are unsustainable and not sufficiently mitigated by these institutions. New strategies are required that promote the positive aspects of informality, while supporting initiatives that contribute to long-term resource sustainability and meet the high levels of urban demand, given the lack of alternative energy sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of specific <b>woodfuel</b> types utility, which are prolifically cultivated in the Northern Greece context, is examined {{as an alternative}} energy source in the conventional coal-based energy network. The examined parameters included the High Heating Values (HHVs), the densities, the annual total production and the annual proportional allocation of the available woodfuels. Particularly, the proposed <b>woodfuel</b> types were the sessile oak, the white poplar and the chestnut tree, since their mean proportional <b>woodfuel</b> production coverage constantly exceeds the 60 % of the total <b>woodfuel</b> Greek production. The determining process of the proposed study focuses on the successful estimation of the actual energy demand in domestic hot water and space heating applications and consequently on the precise evaluation of energy production from the proposed woodfuels exploitation. The study's prosperity is further implemented through a detailed in an optimum environmental, economic and socioeconomic conditions overview. © 2010 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at the {{introduction}} of specific <b>woodfuel</b> types, which are prolifically cultivated in the Northern Greece context, in the relevant energy network. The examined parameters included the 'high heating values', the densities, the annual total production, the annual proportional allocation of the available woodfuels, {{as well as the}} reference year of each project implementation. Especially, the examined <b>woodfuel</b> types were the sessile oak, the white poplar and the chestnut tree, since their mean proportional <b>woodfuel</b> production coverage exceeds the 60 % of the total <b>woodfuel</b> Greek production, over the examined period 2004 - 2007. Additionally, through the investigation of the relevant energy demand among the proposed projects, two different scenarios of projects materialisation were applied and the optimum environmental, economic and socioeconomic conditions were evaluated. Finally, a critical comparison between relevant studies outcomes revealed the significant determining parameters of the scenarios prosperity...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{proposal}} of biofuels {{introduction to the}} existing energy network of European countries is directed through the recent European Legislation. The above proposal's implementation would be successfully materialized by exploiting the Renewable Energy Sources, which are abundant in the Greek context. At the present study, the biofuels entrance to the Greek energy network is investigated through the three <b>woodfuel</b> biomass sources of Common Beech, Aleppo Pine and Common Fir. The above selection of the three specific <b>woodfuel</b> types is further examined via the potential imports of the above biomass from the nearby Balkan countries. The above <b>woodfuel</b> quantities are accumulated to the existing local <b>woodfuel</b> production, after appropriate modification of Part I experimental parameters. Additionally, the relevant proportion among the woodfuels types is examined and an environmental, economic and socioeconomic evaluation is conducted. Finally, a critical comparison between the Part I and Part II studies outcomes revealed the significant determining parameters of the scenarios' prosperity. © Springer-Verlag 2009...|$|E
40|$|Local beer breweries in Burkina Faso absorb a {{considerable}} amount of urban <b>woodfuel</b> demand. We assess the <b>woodfuel</b> savings caused by the adoption of improved brewing stoves by these micro-breweries and estimate the implied welfare effects through the <b>woodfuel</b> market on private households as well as the environmental effect. We find substantial wood savings among the breweries, 36 % to 38 % if they fully switch to an improved stove. In absolute amounts, they save about 0. 176 kg of fuelwood per litre of dolo brewed. These savings imply huge reductions in CO 2 -emissions and reduce the overall demand for <b>woodfuel,</b> which is predominantly used by the poorer strata for cooking purposes. We provide estimates for the price decrease that might result from this and show that the urban poor are likely to benefit. Thus, the intervention under study is an example for a green growth intervention with pro-poor welfare gains - something green growth strategies should look for. Copyright...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{has been}} used as fuel for millennia, meeting humanity’s basic needs for cooking, boiling water, {{lighting}} and heating. Today <b>woodfuel,</b> i. e. firewood and charcoal, accounts for around 10 % of global energy supply, but it dominates energy provision {{in many parts of the}} developing world. In particular, the inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) benefit significantly from <b>woodfuel,</b> with the highest regional per capita consumption of 0. 69 m 3 /year in 2011, 2. 5 times higher than the global average of 0. 27 m 3 /year.
