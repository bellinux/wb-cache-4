These strangers had that stamp, and their surprise proved he <b>was</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Here</b> the innkeeper showed signs of uneasiness, and seconded the surprise of his customers. No more was said at the instant, and the two rather hurriedly went out.|$|E

60|$|If he <b>was</b> <b>right,</b> <b>here</b> was our quiet English house {{suddenly}} {{invaded by}} a devilish Indian Diamond--bringing after it a conspiracy of living rogues, set loose on {{us by the}} vengeance of a dead man. There was our situation as revealed to me in Mr. Franklin's last words! Who ever heard the like of it--in the nineteenth century, mind; {{in an age of}} progress, and in a country which rejoices in the blessings of the British constitution? Nobody ever heard the like of it, and, consequently, nobody can be expected to believe it. I shall go on with my story, however, in spite of that.|$|E
60|$|This {{announcement}} was received with consternation. How could naked men smuggle anything past an inspection? Only my pal and I were safe. But it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> that the convict barbers got in their work. They passed {{among the poor}} newcomers, kindly volunteering {{to take charge of}} their precious little belongings, and promising to return them later in the day. Those barbers were philanthropists--to hear them talk. As in the case of Fra Lippo Lippi, never was there such prompt disemburdening. Matches, tobacco, rice-paper, pipes, knives, money, everything, flowed into the capacious shirts of the barbers. They fairly bulged with the spoil, and the guards made believe not to see. To cut the story short, nothing was ever returned. The barbers never had any intention of returning what they had taken. They considered it legitimately theirs. It was the barber-shop graft. There were many grafts in that prison, as I was to learn; and I, too, was destined to become a grafter--thanks to my new pal.|$|E
60|$|Tongue-tied by {{inexperience}} and by {{excess of}} ardor, wooing unwittingly and awkwardly, Martin continued his approach by contact. The touch {{of his hand}} was pleasant to her, and something deliciously more than pleasant. Martin did not know it, but he did {{know that it was}} not distasteful to her. Not that they touched hands often, save at meeting and parting; but that in handling the bicycles, in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills, and in conning the pages of books side by side, there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand. And there were opportunities, too, for her hair to brush his cheek, and for shoulder to touch shoulder, as they leaned together over the beauty of the books. She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair; while he desired greatly, when they tired of reading, to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs. On Sunday picnics at Shellmound Park and Schuetzen Park, in the past, he had rested his head on many laps, and, usually, he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their love. To rest his head in a girl's lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now, and now he found Ruth's lap inaccessible and impossible. Yet it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>here,</b> in his reticence, that the strength of his wooing lay. It was because of this reticence that he never alarmed her. Herself fastidious and timid, she never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse. Subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him, while he, sensing the growing closeness, longed to dare but was afraid.|$|E

50|$|He {{began his}} career as a mountaineer on his home mountain, the Matterhorn, {{climbing}} new routes and repeating various prestigious ones. After growing up in the shadow of this mountain, it <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> where Hervé completed various extreme solo ascents. The most noteworthy of these ascents include the first solo ascent of the Via Casarotto Grassi in 2002 (ED, 1300m), the first solo ascent in 2005 of the Via Deffeyes (ED, 1300m) completed in under four hours, and in 2007 the first solo ascent of the Spigolo dei fiori on the Via Machetto route: all routes on the south face of the Matterhorn. A further noteworthy ascent was the first solo ascent and first repetition of the Via Direttissima which was first climbed in 1983 by his father Marco.|$|E

In the most diverse university in all of New England, I look out at a sea of faces that are African-American and Hispanic-American and Asian-American and Arab-American.

5000|$|In the anime reboot Sailor Moon Crystal, Black Lady {{was created}} from Chibiusa by Wiseman {{manipulating}} and twisting her memories.

She then appeared before Tuxedo Mask in a vision, who assured him that [...] "she" [...] <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> in front of him. In episode 23, she confronts the five Sailor Soldiers directly and fully intends to annihilate them all to further strengthen the malefic Back Crystal's evil energy. Similar to the manga, upon seeing Pluto's death, she begins to recount her memories with Pluto, claiming the Time-Space Guardian to be [...] "Her one and only friend". She cries in anguish, expressing her remorse for Pluto's death, and thus her tears breaks the seal of the future Legendary Silver Crystal, which ultimately led to her awakening as Sailor Chibi Moon.|$|E

5000|$|On {{her final}} {{appearance}} of the season, Majestic Roi was returned to Group One level for the Sun Chariot Stakes over one mile at Newmarket on 6 October {{in which she was}} again partnered by Holland and started a 16/1 outsider. The five-year-old Echelon started favourite after a win in the Matron Stakes, whilst the other seven runners included Simply Perfect, Nannina, Speciosa and Wake Up Maggie. She was restrained towards the rear of the field as Speciosa set the pace, before beginning to make progress three furlongs from the finish. She was switched to the left approaching the final furlong and produced a strong late run to overtake Nannina in the closing stages and win by three quarters of a length. After the race Channon said [...] "You've got to believe in the horses, and she's a good filly. She ran very well at Royal Ascot despite softer ground and she's had no luck - she got a dreadful run at Doncaster last time. But the ground <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> and you never know with fillies at this time of year. Little things have gone wrong, but we've always thought a lot of her.

5000|$|The {{first single}} {{released}} from the album <b>was</b> <b>Right</b> <b>Here,</b> Right Now (My Heart Belongs to You), covered from Agnes Carlsson, winner of the Swedish Pop Idol. The song was released {{the day after the}} Idols final for digital download only. Three days later, Sony BMG had announced that the song was downloaded over 40,000 times, certifying the single gold before its release. An amazing first achievement for Raffaëla, because of the fact {{this is the first time}} something like it happened. A week after the final, the song was certified again. This time it was certified platinum, meaning over 80,000 copies were downloaded already. Her second record in one week. On 17 March 2006, the CD single was released. The single debuted and peaked at the number one position in the Dutch Top 40 (national Dutch chart, similar to U.S.' Billboard Hot 100) and many other Dutch Mega Charts. [...] "Right Here Right Now" [...] remained her most successful single to date. [...] "Mijn Houten Hart", the second single, that was recorded with Paul de Leeuw, flopped commercially. The single was released on 9 June 2006 and received little promotion. A music video was made for the song, showing Raffaëla and De Leeuw recording the song in a studio, but due Raffaëla's pregnancy - the doctors advised her not to use her voice for singing in front of a big audience till the baby is born - she is not allowed to sing and promote the song. The song entered the Dutch Mega Top 100 Singles at #63, rose the following week up to #18 and dropped again to #33 in its third week.|$|E
5000|$|Mian Shaukat Hussain was {{a disciple}} or student of renowned tabla maestro Mian Qadir Baksh, {{founder of the}} Punjab gharana of tabla players who also was the teacher of many tabla players that later gained {{international}} recognition. Mian Qadir Baksh was known throughout the world for his skill and mastery of tabla. After learning the art of tabla playing from Mian Qadir Baksh, Mian Shaukat Hussain soon started gaining recognition in the music circles in Pakistan and was the music group accompanist of choice for Pakistan's great classical music vocalists and instrumentalists including Amanat Ali Khan-Bade Fateh Ali Khan classical-music-singing-duo, Roshan Ara Begum, Mehdi Hassan, Ghulam Ali and many others during the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. When these artists performed on Pakistan Television shows, they frequently selected Mian Shaukat Hussain as tabla player to accompany them on stage. Also riding on a wave of success, Mian Shaukat Hussain toured Europe, Africa, India and Bangladesh with these artists.
