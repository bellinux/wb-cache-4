50|$|A hypoid {{is a type}} of {{spiral bevel}} gear whose axis does not {{intersect}} with the axis of the meshing gear. The shape of a hypoid gear is a revolved hyperboloid (that is, the pitch surface of the hypoid gear is a hyperbolic surface), whereas the shape of a spiral bevel gear is normally conical. The hypoid gear places the pinion off-axis to the crown <b>wheel</b> (<b>ring</b> gear) which allows the pinion to be larger in diameter and have more contact area. In hypoid gear design, the pinion and gear are practically always of opposite hand, and the spiral angle of the pinion is usually larger than that of the gear. The hypoid pinion is then larger in diameter than an equivalent bevel pinion.|$|E

40|$|Stress {{analysis}} and preliminary design/optimization procedures are presented for gyroscope momentum wheel rings composed of metallic, metal matrix composite, and polymer matrix composite materials. The design of these components involves simultaneously minimizing both true part volume and mass, while maximizing angular momentum. The stress analysis results are {{combined with an}} anisotropic failure criterion to formulate a new sizing procedure that provides considerable insight into the design of gyroscope momentum <b>wheel</b> <b>ring</b> components. Results compare the performance of two optimized metallic designs, an optimized SiC/Ti composite design, and an optimized graphite/epoxy composite design. The graphite/epoxy design appears to be far superior to the competitors considered unless a much greater premium is placed on volume efficiency compared to mass efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{gear system}} used for large torque {{transmission}} consists of one <b>wheel</b> <b>ring</b> with diameter 1264 mm and three pinions with diameter 224 mm. This assembly {{can be used}} to 440 kNm and 20 Hz dynamical torque transmission. On the basis of FEM, 3 -D gear model was established and modal analysis was constructed by using software ANSYS. Two modal analysis methods were used. One of which was equivalent contact stiffness by simplified into a spring model and the other method was considering the pre-stress in the strength analysis. The latter method is more reasonable than the first one because it contains the nonlinear contact factors. The results show that there is no vibration mode with the frequency below 100 Hz and no resonance will appear in the following dynamical torque loading tests...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of advanced materials with high selectivity and efficiency {{is essential to}} realize practical carbon capture and sequestration. Here, we have investigated the interactions of the Co@B/Co@B and M@B/M@B (M = Ir, Rh, Ru) clusters with CO, N, and CH gas molecules theoretically. We found that neutral boron clusters have weak interaction with CO, N, and CH molecules. Similarly, the clusters with their negative charge states have also weak interaction with N and CH molecules. However, anionic clusters have a strong interaction with CO, which {{can be explained by}} the Lewis acid-base interaction as CO (Lewis acid) can gain electron easily from the electron-rich anionic clusters. Moreover, the kinetic stability of the formed complexes after CO capture has been validated by ab initio molecular dynamics. In all, the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that the anionic boron <b>wheel</b> <b>ring</b> clusters can be used as potential advanced materials for CO capture and separation from flue gas and natural gas mixtures.

Nevertheless, the Streamliner station wagon remained the most expensive Pontiac model.|$|R
