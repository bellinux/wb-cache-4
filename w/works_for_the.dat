40|$|Under Federal Government budget {{proposals}} {{there will}} be a mass mobilisation of Australia’s jobseekers into <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole schemes. This is being called an ‘expanded <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole’. How is this <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole different from previous versions of <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole? <b>For</b> <b>the</b> first time <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole includes older jobseekers (up to the age of 50). Previous versions of <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole had young people working on community projects. Community projects can still happen but this expanded <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole will have a greater emphasis on putting people in individual work placements. The Government has said that the individual placements have to be with local councils, not-for profit organisations (including schools) and federal and state government agencies. TasCOSS estimates that approximately 8441 <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole placements will need to be found for Tasmanians aged 18 to 2911 and approximately 8635 for Tasmanians aged 30 to 49 {{in the next four years}} 12.

40|$|<b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole has {{a unique}} {{importance}} as the default option in Australia’s mutual obligation system. The only substantial independent review of <b>the</b> <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole program covered a period ending in June 2003.

This paper makes a further overall evaluation of <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole. It confirms that employment outcomes are positive and surprisingly high by international standards. However, {{the changes in the}} program have not brought the increase in effectiveness in <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole that one would expect. To a large extent this is because Job Network members are slow to see <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole as a valuable option for particular clients, rather than routinely referring people to <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dole when they reach the mutual obligation legal requirement. ...|$|R
