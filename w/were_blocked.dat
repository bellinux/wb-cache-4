5|$|The storm {{passed to}} the south of most of the Greater Antilles, though its outer rain bands crossed many of the islands, and {{delivered}} hurricane force winds to Jamaica. Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands were mostly spared, though Hurricane Dean passed 50 to 60mi (80 to 95km) south of Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane. In Jamaica the rain caused flooding on {{the eastern side of the}} island and landslides on the northeast end. At least two direct deaths were confirmed. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane force winds, and 1,582 of the 3,127 damaged homes were uninhabitable. Landslides and fallen trees blocked hundreds of roads, particularly in the rural northeast region. As in the Lesser Antilles, Jamaica suffered severe damage to its agricultural sector. Forty percent of the sugarcane crop, 80 to 100% of the banana crop, 75% of the coffee trees under three years old, and 20% of the top layer of the cocoa crop were lost. Hurricane Dean affected 248 roads, including 186 that were blocked: 10 <b>were</b> <b>blocked</b> in the Kingston metropolitan region, 14 sections <b>were</b> <b>blocked</b> in St. Andrew, 43 roads <b>were</b> <b>blocked</b> in St. Catherine, eight roads <b>were</b> <b>blocked</b> in the Western Region (Saint James, Hanover, Westmoreland, and Trelawny), and 110 roads <b>were</b> <b>blocked</b> in the Northeast region.|$|E

Months later, Hong Kong immigration officials denied visas to several members of the Falun Gong-affiliated Shen Yun dance company, which was scheduled to perform in the territory in January 2010. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho said the denial of the visas was a worrying new erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms, and damaged the reputation of Hong Kong as a liberal and open society. A court ruling in March 2010 overturned the Immigration Department's decision.|$|E

50|$|Regardless of the {{anaesthetic}} agent (drug) used, {{the desired effect}} <b>is</b> to <b>block</b> the transmission of afferent nerve signals from peripheral nociceptors. Sensory signals from the site <b>are</b> <b>blocked,</b> thereby eliminating pain. The degree of neuronal blockade depends on the amount and concentration of local anaesthetic used and {{the properties of the}} axon. Thin unmyelinated C-fibres associated with pain <b>are</b> <b>blocked</b> first, while thick, heavily myelinated A-alpha motor neurons <b>are</b> <b>blocked</b> moderately. Heavily myelinated, small preganglionic sympathetic fibers <b>are</b> <b>blocked</b> first. The desired result is total numbness of the area. A pressure sensation is permissible and often occurs due to incomplete blockade of the thicker A-beta mechanoreceptors. This allows surgical procedures to be performed with no painful sensation to the person undergoing the procedure.|$|R
