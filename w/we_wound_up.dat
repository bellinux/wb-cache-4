500|$|Their small {{budget was}} another reason to use the ship {{for much of the}} storytelling. When the {{characters}} did go off the ship, the worlds all had Earth atmosphere and coloring because they could not afford to design alien worlds. [...] "I didn't want to go to Yucca Flats every other episode and transform it into Bizarro World by making the sky orange", recalled Whedon. As Meyer recalled: [...] "I think in the end the feel was that <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> using a lot of places or exteriors that just felt too Western and we didn't necessarily want to go that way; but at some point, it just became the lesser of two evils—what could we actually create in three days?" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{decade after}} Allegros premiere, after {{learning}} of his fatal cancer, Hammerstein {{returned to the}} musical, hoping to correct its flaws, {{but he did not}} complete the project. [...] While recording an oral history tape for Columbia University, Hammerstein stated, [...] "I intended Dick to write music for it [...] but <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> reciting the chorus instead... I'm not blaming anyone, because we all accepted it, we all collaborated... but it was a mistake." [...] Rodgers later stated that the show was [...] "too preachy, which was the one fault that Oscar had, if any," [...] and [...] "othing to be ashamed of, certainly". [...] Rodgers further defended the play, [...] "The comments we made on the compromises demanded by success, {{as well as some of}} the satiric side issues—hypochondria, the empty cocktail party—still hold." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Bhasker, {{one of the}} song's producers, {{explained}} the track's roots as it [...] "came {{in the middle of}} the process of putting together the album". He further elaborated; [...] "We were just having a jam session, tracking some things, and Bruno started playing this groove and making up something on the spot; we all thought it was pretty good. <b>We</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> working a long time on that, trying to get it just right." [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] began as a [...] "cha-cha-style duet, à la Santana's [...] "Smooth"." [...] Ronson asked the Dap-Kings to collaborate on the track in order to get a [...] "crisply syncopated, locked-in groove." [...] Regarding the song, Mars says [...] "Man, there's a good pocket on this song right now. Let's keep it going." [...] He also mentioned that it took a long time to create it, commenting [...] "People didn't see us going at each other's throats in the studio and pulling out our hair." [...] He added, [...] "Trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line." [...] Lawrence believes the lack of [...] "heavy hitting drums" [...] and the presence of a small guitar solo allows the song to be carried by Mars.|$|E
60|$|Her death, {{with which}} <b>we</b> {{invariably}} <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> the afternoon, was another conscientious effort. Indeed, her groans and writhings would sometimes frighten me.

6000|$|The {{morning we}} started for Eisenach was foggy and rainy. This was unfortunate, {{as we were}} {{changing}} from a dead level country to one of extreme beauty. The Thuringian Forest, with its high, wooded points crowned here and there with many a castle and many a ruin, loomed up finely through the mist, and several times I exclaimed, [...] "There is the Wartburg," [...] or [...] "That must be the Wartburg," [...] long before we were near it. It was raining hard when we reached Eisenach station, and engaged a carriage {{to take us to}} the Wartburg. The mist, which wreathed thickly around, showed us only glimpses as <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> slowly <b>up</b> the castle hill--enough, however, to pique the imagination, and show how beautiful it might be in fair weather.|$|R
60|$|At the {{threshold}} of Kaga we turned abruptly to the left, and attacked the pass leading over into Etchiu. As <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> our way <b>up</b> the narrow valley, day left the hollows to stand on rosy tiptoe {{on the sides of}} the hills, the better to take flight into the clouds. There it lingered a little, folding the forests about with its roseate warmth. Even the stern old pines flushed to the tips of their shaggy branches, while here and there a bit of open turned a glowing cheek full to the good-night kiss of the sun. And over beyond it all rose the twilight bow, in purplish insubstantiality creeping steadily higher and higher, above the pine-clad heights.|$|R
500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what}} was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
500|$|While Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and Tim Hill {{were writing}} the pilot [...] "Help Wanted", Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create SpongeBob's personality. The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker. Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence for the role of voicing Squidward. Drymon said [...] "We knew Doug from Rocko, where he was a storyboard director and where he also did the voice of Filburt. We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg loved the voice and decided to let Lawrence play a variety of incidental characters, including Plankton.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} season, the writing staff used {{most of the}} story ideas that were in Hillenburg's series bible and they had {{problems}} on how to generate new ideas. At one point, the writing staff went to the beach for inspiration for a possible episode. However, the day [...] "was overcast and cold, so we [...] {{had to stay in}} the car." [...] Drymon said [...] "We didn't come up with too many ideas that day." [...] Story editor Peter Burns left, and the crew had Merriwether Williams to overtake. Hillenburg said to Williams that [...] "it was her responsibility to get us [...] to come up with new ideas." [...] Drymon said [...] " [...] is a tall order." [...] Williams gave Drymon a book called Zen in the Art of Writing, written by Ray Bradbury, that catalogs a collection of essays about writing processes. One of the ways in the book to inspire plots was [...] "to write nouns that interested him [...] on a note card and hang them in his office. He felt just having the word in his eyesight would get his mind working." [...] Williams took this scheme and made it into [...] "a writing exercise." [...] In writing meetings, the staff would all enumerate 10 nouns on strips of paper and place them in a hat. The hat would be passed throughout and a writer would have a limited time to spawn an idea based on the noun he wrote. Drymon said [...] "It would almost always start a discussion, and <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> getting a lot of episodes out of it." [...] Furthermore, Drymon said that Williams [...] "really came up with a great addition to the process." ...|$|E
50|$|Tweet {{has stated}} that he {{designed}} Over the Edge to be more improvisational and open-ended than other role-playing games. On his website, he writes:I designed Over the Edge to be crazy and spontaneous, so that's how I ran it. I'd generally mix alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine to get my head right for OTE. I invented whatever came to mind as <b>we</b> played, and <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> generating dozens of weird clues to uninvented mysteries, many of which the players never followed up. The setting was a challenge enough, so I didn't feel I needed to present the players with hard-edged combat challenges. There were plenty of fights, but the challenge was {{to get into the}} right fights more than it was to win a particular fight.|$|R
5000|$|.....In {{the former}} age {{there was an}} ideal {{business}} model {{that was based on}} a quality product. In this age the ideal business model is based on a good marketing department, as a result what <b>we</b> have <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> with is shit in a fancy box, which amounts to lower quality of life. But what's worse than {{the fact that we have}} seen a decline in the quality of life, is the fact the whole system has become dishonest. We now have a culture of dishonesty, everything you see and read in popular culture is an insidious attempt to make you buy something that you don't actually want. And when we participate in the insidious lie, when we believe the lie and act in the ways that we have been programmed to act we forfeit our status as free agents. We lose our souls.But there is a counter culture, that's where punk rock comes in. Punk rock is considered a style of music, but it's not. If you listen to what was considered punk 25 years ago, and compare it to what is considered punk today, it's obvious that they are totally different styles of music. Punk Rock in its purest form is an ideology. It's a rejection of the insidious lie that has come to be status quo, and an embracing of honesty in the form of anti-status quo. ..." ...|$|R

Regarding this event, Nas later recalled [...] "Rae would come out to Queensbridge, I would go to Staten Island. We'd just ride and hang out all night. We didn't call each other to work. We called each other to hang out. Somehow <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> in the studio. RZA had a couple of beats. He played them for me. I got on both of them. The other one never came out.

Apart from his farm, Mr. Ashley owned large grist-and saw-mills and did a flourishing business, with the details of which Miss Gussie seemed so conversant that I lost all doubt of her ability to run the whole thing as she had claimed. I felt quite ignorant in the light of her superior knowledge, and our walk was enlivened by some rather too lively discussions between us. We walked about together, however, till the shadows of the firs by the mills stretched nearly across the pond and the white moon began to put on a silvery burnish. Then <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> by a bitter dispute, during which Gussie's eyes were very black and each cheek had a round, red stain on it.

He is not handsome, but he is good- looking, as boys go, and has a pleasant smile. Robina says it is his smile that maddens her. Dick agrees with me that there is sense in him; and Veronica, not given to loose praise, considers his performance of a Red Indian, both dead and alive, the finest piece of acting she has ever encountered. <b>We</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> the evening with a little singing.
