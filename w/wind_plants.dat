Market-based economic evaluations provide meaningful insight into the effects of integration on energy prices and revenue to various market participants.

5000|$|In the United States, [...] "merchant wind power" [...] {{refers to}} plants built to serve spot {{electricity}} markets. Typically, <b>wind</b> <b>plants</b> in the US are built based on long-term (10-20 years) contracts or [...] "power purchase agreement" [...] with a wholesale purchaser (such as a regulated utility or power marketing firm).

However, in a merchant power arrangement, the wind plant is built without (or with little) prior commitment of its output to contractual off-takers. Instead, the power is sold on a spot or short-term contract basis, such as on the PJM Interconnection, NYISO, or ISO-NE independent system operator power markets that have developed in the Northeastern US.|$|E
5000|$|Aristolochia littoralis is a {{climbing}} vine {{that can}} reach about 3 - 4.5 m in length. The slender stems are woody {{and the leaves}} are bright green, cordate, amplexicaul, 7 - 9 cm long and 5 - 10 cm wide, forming a dense attractive foliage.

The inner surface of the flared mouth is completely purplish-brown. The flowering period extends through all summer. These plants are pollinated by flies which are attracted by the unpleasant carrion-like odor produced by the flowers. The numerous winged seeds are borne in dry dehiscent capsules that split like small parachutes.

50|$|Wind {{influences}} the way leaves regulate moisture, heat, and carbon dioxide. When no wind is present, {{a layer of}} still air builds up around each leaf. This {{is known as the}} boundary layer and in effect insulates the leaf from the environment, providing an atmosphere rich in moisture and less prone to convective heating or cooling. As wind speed increases, the leaf environment becomes more closely linked to the surrounding environment. It may become difficult for the plant to retain moisture as it is exposed to dry air. On the other hand, a moderately high wind allows the plant to cool its leaves more easily when exposed to full sunlight. Plants are not entirely passive in their interaction with <b>wind.</b> <b>Plants</b> can make their leaves less vulnerable to changes in wind speed, by coating their leaves in fine hairs (trichomes) to break up the air flow and increase the boundary layer. In fact, leaf and canopy dimensions are often finely controlled to manipulate the boundary layer depending on the prevailing environmental conditions.|$|E
