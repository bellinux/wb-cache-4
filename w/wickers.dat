500|$|The British {{version of}} Venture began in September 1963, {{and ran for}} 28 {{numbered}} issues, through December 1965; the editor was Ronald R. <b>Wickers.</b> The stories selected from F for the UK edition of Venture did not overlap with material already reprinted in the UK edition of F. [...] The first five issues had pictorial covers, but thereafter the cover simply listed {{the names of the}} contributing authors. [...] This unattractive presentation, and the lack of {{much in the way of}} interior artwork, probably hurt sales. [...] Atlas's stated reason for ending the magazine was that it was [...] "due to the expiration of available material", but there were in fact many stories available to reprint. [...] It is more likely that the real reason was that the US edition of F was by then easily available in the UK, and that circulation was falling.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Wicker</b> is not {{actually}} a material, but {{a method of}} weaving. The word {{is said to be}} derived from the Scandinavian word [...] "vika" [...] which means [...] "To bend." [...] Traditionally, natural plant materials were used to manufacture a variety of different products including baskets, trays, indoor and outdoor furniture. <b>Wicker</b> was originally made from natural fibers, such as rattan, a material derived from the so-called rotan tree, a vine like plant. The term rattan is sometimes used interchangeably with <b>wicker,</b> but in fact depicts the fiber used to create the <b>wicker</b> work. Rattan is somewhat elastic and often used to produce baskets, hampers and chairs. The branch-like material is woven together for the purpose of constructing various <b>wicker</b> items. Resin <b>wicker</b> is a similar looking material. Synthetic polyethylene fiber resin <b>wicker</b> is generally durable, resistant to the sun's UV radiation and water. Resin <b>wicker</b> is often used over an aluminum frame to create lightweight outdoor furniture.|$|R
