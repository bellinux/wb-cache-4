5|$|The Welsh border {{situation}} remained unsettled however, and in {{the decades}} after 1250 security grew significantly worse, as the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd conducted numerous raids into English territories.

Theories which predict that an outcome of voting will be one that has a certain relation to individual preferences <b>are</b> <b>particularly</b> difficult to test because an empirical test requires information on those individual preferences, and such information is not available.

5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; {{they were used to}} project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside.

5|$|Belgian {{soldiers}} fought rearguard actions {{while other}} Belgian units {{already on the}} Dyle line worked tirelessly to organise better defensive positions in the Leuven–Antwerp gap. The 2nd Regiment of Guides and the 2nd Carabineers Cyclists of the 2nd Belgian Cavalry Division covered the retreat of the 4th and 7th Belgian divisions and <b>were</b> <b>particularly</b> distinguished at the Battle of Tirlemont and the Battle of Halen.|$|E

Production now reached some 150 Ju 87 D airframes per month, but spare parts were failing {{to reach the}} same production levels. Undercarriage parts <b>were</b> <b>particularly</b> in short supply. Milch ordered production to 350 Ju 87s per month in September 1942. This was not achievable due to the insufficient production capacity in the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Carson and {{the others}} {{involved}} with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They <b>were</b> <b>particularly</b> concerned {{about the possibility of}} being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and 1920s, oil {{exploration}} and production continued to expand and stabilize. Oil production became established in North Texas, Central Texas, the Panhandle, and the Permian Basin in western Texas. The finds in North Texas, beginning with the 1917 strike in Ranger west of Dallas-Fort Worth, <b>were</b> <b>particularly</b> significant, bringing substantial industrialization to the area. Texas soon became dominant as the nation's leading oil producer. By 1940, Texas production was twice that of California, the next largest U.S. producer.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the war, a British {{blockade}} on shipments to Germany affected the Reich economy. The Germans <b>were</b> <b>particularly</b> dependent on foreign supplies of oil, coal and grain. To safeguard Swedish iron ore shipments to Germany, Hitler ordered an attack on Norway, which took place on 9 April 1940. Much of the country was occupied by German troops by the end of April. Also on 9 April, the Germans invaded and occupied Denmark.|$|E
5|$|German {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in North America in the mid-seventeenth century.

By 1683, the German population was large enough to form communities such as Germantown (now a neighborhood in Philadelphia).

In the same year, a National Bureau of Standards study concluded that the proposed standard would present few problems. A year later, a COBOL-80 compiler was released to DEC VAX users, who noted that conversion of COBOL-74 programs posed few problems. The new EVALUATE statement and inline PERFORM <b>were</b> <b>particularly</b> well received and improved productivity, thanks to simplified control flow and debugging.|$|E

Both {{mainstream}} press and science fiction reviewers generally credit Eccleston and his incarnation of the character as helping to re-establish the show following its hiatus between 1996 and 2005. The character's interactions with his archenemies, the Daleks, <b>were</b> <b>particularly</b> praised.
