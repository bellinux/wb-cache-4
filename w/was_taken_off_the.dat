Tottenham managed to withstand pressure from Arsenal for most of the second half, but came unstuck in the 73rd minute when Pirès scored the decisive goal.|$|E

In 2016, it was sold to the Eclectic Bar Group, headed by former PizzaExpress owner Luke Johnson, who renamed the pier back to Brighton Palace Pier in July.|$|E

The album's first half, Niandra Lades, was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992; during {{the recording of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The second half, Usually Just a T-Shirt, was recorded while the band was on tour {{in the months leading}} up to Frusciante's departure.

5|$|On 10 November Belfast <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} {{patrol and}} reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. This squadron was {{to form an}} independent striking force based at Rosyth. On 21 November, Belfast was {{to take part in}} the force's first sortie, a gunnery exercise. At 10:58am she struck a magnetic mine while leaving the Firth of Forth. The mine broke Belfasts keel, and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms. Twenty officers and men required hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion, and a further 26 suffered minor injuries. One man, Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton, was hospitalised but later died of a head injury, having been thrown against the deckhead by the blast. The tugboat Krooman, towing gunnery targets for the exercise, released her targets and instead towed Belfast to Rosyth for initial repairs.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Division <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{front line}} in late March {{and placed in}} reserve status. 1 to 11 April, the Division was put through {{additional}} combat training at Torre Astura. The training was so intense that Murphy felt his men needed relief and refused to put them through the required close order drill. Although already recommended for a promotion to technical sergeant, his refusal {{on behalf of his}} men cost him the promotion. Upon completion of the training, Murphy and his men occupied the area of Campo Morto-Padigliano. On 1 May, the 3rd Division was sent back to Torre Astura, where they remained until 21 May. Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B, 15th Infantry, including Murphy, were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May. Murphy was also awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star.|$|E

5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which {{decisions}} were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out a Monday game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E
5|$|Three {{losses in}} four games, capped by a 5–0 defeat against the Boston Bruins on March 27 left the Flames six points {{out of the}} eighth and final playoff spot with seven games remaining. The team also lost second-line centre Daymond Langkow after he <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ice on a {{stretcher}} in Minnesota after being struck {{in the back of}} the neck by a slapshot. However, a 5–3 road victory against the Eastern Conference leading Washington Capitals and a 2–1 home win against the Phoenix Coyotes, coupled with the Colorado Avalanche losing six of their final seven games to end the month of March, left the Flames two points behind the Avalanche heading into April.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{confronted by}} Scully, Sharon denies that Max brought a {{radioactive}} substance aboard the plane, but divulges {{that she is}} not actually Max's sister. She also gives up details about his underground life. Scully subsequently tells Mulder that Max worked at an environmental energy plant in Colorado under an alias, and believes that he may have caused the crash after bringing plutonium on board; Mulder, however, believes that Max <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> plane by a UFO, and that Rehbun's injuries were caused by exposure to the craft. Scully informs Mulder that Max's body has already been pulled from the crash site. Meanwhile, Sharon is abducted from her hotel room.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} Vancouver signed defenceman Jason Garrison to a six-year contract worth $27.6 million. While the Canucks brought in Garrison, they lost longtime defenceman Sami Salo. The Canucks wanted to re-sign Salo, {{though they were}} unwilling to sign him to a two-year contract and offered only a one-year deal. Salo chose to leave and signed a two-year $7.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was believed that Garrison would step in {{and contribute to the}} power play and replace the departed Salo, who had performed a similar role. However, he struggled to adjust with his new team. He <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> power play unit and dropped to the third pairing within the first month. After the injuries to Bieksa, Garrison was moved from left defenceman to the right side pairing with Dan Hamhuis. The coaching staff came to consider this pairing to be the best and most trusted. Garrison finished the season with eight goals and eight assists, scoring three goals and three assists on the power play, and registering a +18 rating. His plus-minus was second on the team and led all defenceman.|$|E
5|$|The Rainmen {{entered the}} Finals series without playing a single game in 16 days and were {{defeated}} by Windsor in Game 1, 104–113. Chris Commons led the Express with 33 points and 8 rebounds and Tony Bennett added 25 points. Halifax struggled with fouls {{in the first}} quarter, and point guard Cliff Clinkscales most notably committed three fouls in the first 12 minutes of the game. He would finish the contest with six penalties. By {{the end of the}} game, seven Rainmen players had committed over three personal fouls and the team totaled for 48, allowing Windsor to get 55 free throw attempts. The Express, on the other hand, finished with 32 personal fouls. In the fourth quarter, Halifax's Liam McMorrow took a hard fall to his shoulder and <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> court with a stretcher. He would undergo a CT scan and MRI after feeling tingling in the injured area.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} month of the 2009–10 season, Booth {{sustained}} a concussion after being hit by Philadelphia Flyers forward Mike Richards during a game on October 24, 2009. Skating up to the Flyers' blueline, Booth had shot the puck into the offensive zone when Richards hit him in the head with his shoulder. Rendered unconscious, Booth <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ice on a stretcher and brought to a Philadelphia hospital. In addition to his concussion, he sustained a cut above one eye that required stitches; he was released from hospital the next day. While Richards received a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct for intent to injure, he was not suspended for the play. The decision not to further penalize Richards proved to be a highly contentious issue. Panthers General Manager Randy Sexton and defenceman Keith Ballard voiced their opinion that Richards' hit was directed at the head while knowing Booth was in a vulnerable position, warranting a suspension. The Flyers captain expressed concern for Booth's health both in the media and to Panthers Head Coach Peter DeBoer personally, but asserted that he was not intending to hurt him. Another concern was the timing of Richards' hit, as Booth had already released the puck. In response, NHL Vice President Bill Daly explained that the hit was not late enough to justify a suspension.|$|E

5|$|Fagan's {{retirement}} in May 1985 and Dalglish's subsequent promotion to player-manager meant {{that instead of}} gradually succeeding Dalglish as Liverpool's main striker Walsh instead {{had to contend with}} a rival for his position as the club's manager. He missed 1985–86 pre-season after undergoing a hernia operation. He returned to fitness against Oxford United on 14 September, but had a bitter argument with Dalglish at half-time which initially seemed to spell the end to his Liverpool career as he was placed on the transfer list. He returned to the first team though and <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> transfer list by his own request and soon entered a scoring streak, though his form was ended after he ruptured his ankle ligaments in a collision with Manchester United's Kevin Moran on 9 February. He returned to action six weeks later but continued to suffer with ankle trouble and was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season, ending the campaign with 18 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions throughout the campaign. His injury caused him to miss the 1986 FA Cup Final, though he secured a First Division winners medal as Liverpool won the league by a two-point margin over Everton. His contribution to the club's success was not forgotten as he was named in the First Division's PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Mark Lawrenson.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{came to the}} {{attention}} of Netherlands manager Guus Hiddink whilst playing in England for Leeds United, and made his international debut on 27 May 1998 in a 0–0 draw in a friendly with Cameroon at the GelreDome in Arnhem; he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Marc Overmars. On 1 June he scored his first goal in a 5–1 friendly victory over Paraguay, and a few days later scored his second goal in another 5–1 friendly victory over Nigeria. He was part of the Dutch squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, as back-up to established international strikers Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp and Pierre van Hooijdonk and wingers Boudewijn Zenden and Marc Overmars. With other strikers not fully fit, Hasselbaink started the opening game against Belgium at the Stade de France, but missed a scoring opportunity in the 0–0 draw and was taken off for Bergkamp after 65 minutes. Kluivert was sent off in the match but Bergkamp was played as the only striker in the next game against South Korea, and van Hooijdonk <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bench to replace him. In the third group game against Mexico at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard Hasselbaink came on for Bergkamp after 78 minutes, which was to be his last appearance at the tournament as Kluivert returned from suspension to leave Hasselbaink as Hiddink's fourth choice forward; Netherlands ended the tournament in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Tolliver was {{selected}} by the San Diego Chargers {{in the second round}} of the 1989 NFL Draft. The Chargers traded third, fourth, and seventh-round picks in exchange for the New York Giants' second-round pick in order to draft him. Tolliver was signed on July 31, 1989, after a short holdout. He was to compete for the starting job alongside Mark Malone and David Archer, a spot which eventually went to Jim McMahon after the Chargers traded for him. As the 1989 season began with McMahon as the helm, Tolliver was slated to play the second half of the final preseason game against the Phoenix Cardinals. After 13 completions in 23 attempts, Tolliver ran the ball late in the game and broke his collarbone, sidelining him for at least six weeks. After spending the first seven games on the injured reserve list, Tolliver <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> list and named the starter for the game against the Seattle Seahawks on October 29, replacing McMahon who had disappointed at quarterback. In Tolliver's first start, he played three quarters, throwing six completed passes in 17 attempts for 41 yards and throwing an interception in a 10–7 loss. Tolliver subsequently lost the starting job back to McMahon. However, in late November, Tolliver was given the starting job back, remaining the starting quarterback the rest of the season. Tolliver finished the season having played five games with 89 completions in 185 attempts, 1097 yards, five touchdowns, eight interceptions, and a 57.9 quarterback rating.|$|E
