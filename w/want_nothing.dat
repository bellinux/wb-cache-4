500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> {{more than a little}} peace and quiet; however, {{they have to deal with}} screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wolverines {{were the}} {{unanimous}} pre-season Number 1 pick in 1981 but lost their opener to Wisconsin 2114. In the team meeting the next day, Schembechler {{walked into the}} room and wrote [...] "Ed Muransky" [...] and [...] "Stan Edwards" [...] on the chalkboard, and then barked out, [...] "The rest of you are quitters. I <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> more to do with you," [...] and left. According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked at everyone and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. If we start to play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E

2500|$|A {{memorial}} {{was constructed}} in Rockaway Park, Belle Harbor's neighboring community, {{in memory of the}} 265 victims of the crash {{at the south end of}} Beach 116th Street, a major commercial street in the area. It was dedicated on November 12, 2006, the fifth anniversary of the incident, in a ceremony attended by then Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg. A ceremony commemorating the disaster is held annually at the memorial every Nov 12, featuring a reading of the names of those killed aboard the aircraft and on the ground, with a formal moment of silence observed at 9:16a.m., the estimated time of the crash. The memorial wall, designed by Dominican artist Freddy Rodríguez and Situ Studio, has windows and a doorway looking toward the nearby Atlantic Ocean and angled toward the Dominican Republic. It is inscribed with the names of the victims. Atop the memorial is a quotation, in both Spanish and English, from Dominican poet Pedro Mir, reading [...] "" [...] (Translation: [...] "Afterwards I <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> more than peace.") ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1875, Sioux {{delegations}} {{headed by}} Spotted Tail, Red Cloud, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington, D.C. in an eleventh-hour attempt to persuade President Ulysses S. Grant to honor existing treaties and stem {{the flow of}} miners into their territories. [...] They met with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward Smith. [...] The US leaders said that the Congress wanted to pay the tribes $25,000 for the land and have them relocate to Indian Territory (in present-day Oklahoma). [...] The delegates refused to sign a new treaty with these stipulations. [...] Spotted Tail said, [...] "You speak of another country, {{but it is not}} my country; it does not concern me, and I <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with it. [...] I was not born there... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone." [...] Although the chiefs were unsuccessful in finding a peaceful solution, they did not join Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull in the warfare that followed.|$|E
2500|$|The Blackhawks {{have worked}} with the American Indian Center to help educate their {{community}} and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, {{the executive director of}} the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, [...] " [...] are far and away ahead of everyone else in forward-thinking. What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) <b>want</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with native people but yet they're trying to say they respect us." [...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive." ...|$|E
