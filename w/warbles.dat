5|$|The Sind sparrow's {{chirping}} chup call is softer, less strident, {{and higher}} pitched {{than that of}} the house sparrow, and is easily distinguished. The song of breeding males includes chirrups interspersed with grating t-r-r-rt notes and short <b>warbles</b> or whistles.|$|E
5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich <b>warbles.</b> It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may sing in flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current body condition) and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male <b>warbles</b> throughout the flight.|$|E

5|$|The {{rippling}} preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} the Alpine chough {{are quite different}} from the more typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling churr alarm call, and a variety of quiet <b>warbles</b> and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{song of the}} American {{goldfinch}} is {{a series}} of musical <b>warbles</b> and twitters, often with a long note. A tsee-tsi-tsi-tsit call is often given in flight; it may also be described as per-chic-o-ree. While the female incubates the eggs, she calls to her returning mate with a soft continuous teeteeteeteete sound. The young begin to use a call of chick-kee or chick-wee shortly before fledging, which they use until they have left the nest entirely. There are two defense calls made by adults during nesting; a sweeet call made to rally other goldfinches to the nest and distract predators, and a bearbee used to signal to the nestlings to quiet them and get them to crouch down in the nest to become less conspicuous.|$|E
500|$|Contact calls: The most {{commonly}} heard contact call is {{a three to}} five syllable barking [...] "wow wow wow" [...] sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can {{be confused with the}} territorial calls of tawny owls). The [...] "wow wow wow" [...] call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the [...] "wow wow wow" [...] call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting <b>warbles</b> similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.|$|E

500|$|Pinnipeds {{can produce}} a number of vocalizations such as barks, grunts, rasps, rattles, growls, creaks, <b>warbles,</b> trills, chirps, chugs, clicks and whistles. Vocals are {{produced}} both in air and underwater. Otariids are more vocal on land, while phocids are more vocal in water. Antarctic seals are more vocal on land or ice than Arctic seals {{due to a lack}} of terrestrial and pagophliic predators like the polar bear. Male vocals are usually of lower frequencies than those of the females. Vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons. Dominant male elephant seals advertise their status and threaten rivals with [...] "clap-threats" [...] and loud drum-like calls that may be modified by the proboscis. Male otariids have strong barks, growls, roars and [...] "whickers". Male walruses are known to produce distinctive gong-like calls when attempting to attract females. They can also create somewhat musical sounds with their inflated throats.|$|E
500|$|When alone, a magpie {{may make}} a quiet musical warbling; these complex melodious <b>warbles</b> or subsongs are pitched at 2–4 [...] KHz and do not carry for long distances. These songs have been {{recorded}} up to 70 minutes in duration and are more frequent {{after the end of}} the breeding season. Pairs of magpies often take up a loud musical calling known as carolling to advertise or defend their territory; one bird initiates the call with the second (and sometimes more) joining in. Often preceded by warbling, carolling is pitched between 6 and 8 [...] kHz and has 4–5 elements with slurring indistinct noise in between. Birds will adopt a specific posture by tilting their heads back, expanding their chests, and moving their wings backwards. A group of magpies will sing a short repetitive version of carolling just before dawn (dawn song), and at twilight after sundown (dusk song), in winter and spring.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the music}} video for [...] "Ego" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities {{with the one}} for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the video as [...] "Single Ladies (Part 2)". Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as [...] "an ode to multiple personalities, leotards and all things 'diva.'" [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics' opinions whether it is [...] "a sexy, burlesque-inspired variation on the theme [...] established {{in the other two}} videos from the Sasha Fierce side of the album, or just a 'Single Ladies' retread with more crotch and rump". Leah Greenblatt of the magazine Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review for the video, saying that it was very similar to the one for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] noting [...] " [...] 'Ego' feels an awful like the (admittedly awesome) 'Single Ladies' with a spiral perm." [...] Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song, writing that it looks like a dress rehearsal of the video for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] but [...] "in drag". She further wrote, [...] "Anyway, while the '80s horns-and-organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor, I'm not feeling the circa-2002-Christina-Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves. And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous. And when Beyonce says 'It's too big, it's too wide, it's too strong, it won't fit, it's too much,' I'm not even positive that she's really referring to an ego." [...] Nadia Mendoza of The Sun noted that Beyoncé's appeal is [...] "fast disppearing the more she morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce" [...] further describing the dance moves in the video as [...] "bizarre". She finished her review by writing, [...] " [...] <b>warbles</b> along to her track while shaking her booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid. But unfortunately for her, Ego is not half as catchy." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rhesus macaques {{interact}} using {{a variety}} of facial expressions, vocalizations, body postures, and gestures. Perhaps the most common facial expression the macaque makes is the [...] "silent bared teeth" [...] face. This is made between individuals of different social ranks, with the lower-ranking one giving the expression to its superior. A less-dominant individual also makes a [...] "fear grimace", accompanied by a scream, to appease or redirect aggression. Another submissive behavior is the [...] "present rump", where an individual raises its tail and exposes its genitals to the dominant one. A dominant individual threatens another individual by standing quadrupedally and making a silent [...] "open mouth stare" [...] accompanied by the tail sticking straight. During movements, macaques make coos and grunts. These are also made during affiliative interactions, and approaches before grooming. When they find rare food of high quality, macaques emit <b>warbles,</b> harmonic arches, or chirps. When in threatening situations, macaques emit a single loud, high-pitched sound called a shrill bark. Screeches, screams, squeaks, pant-threats, growls, and barks are used during aggressive interactions. Infants [...] "gecker" [...] to attract their mother's attention.|$|E
