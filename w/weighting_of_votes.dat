40|$|This study applies a {{relational}} influence {{approach to}} analyse the European Union (EU) Nice Treaty negotiation process (2000) and explain its outcome, {{focusing on the}} influence of the Dutch cabinet {{in the context of the}} other participating actors (14 member states, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council Secretariat). The study attempts to answer the following research question: To what extent has the Dutch cabinet exerted its influence during the negotiation process that resulted in the Treaty of Nice, and how can this influence be explained? The method to assess and explain the influence of the Dutch cabinet consists of two parts. The first part is a before-after analysis, which involves a measurement of the extent of goal-achievement of the Dutch cabinet and the other participating actors on the Nice Treaty issues selected for this study (24 issues from the following five dossiers: Court of Auditors, European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), Closer cooperation, Commission size and <b>Weighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> in the Council). The second part of the influence analysis is a process analysis, which is divided into three steps, based on as accurate a reconstruction of the negotiation process as possible and addressing all 18 participating actors. The first step aims at assessing whether the Dutch cabinet actually exerted its influence regarding the issues on which it partially or fully achieved its goals. In doing this, the focus is on the relationship between influence attempts and goal-achievement, examining whether mechanisms other than explicit influence might account for the relationship between the two variables. The second step aims at explaining the extent of the Dutch cabinet’s influence thus found. This deductive step consists of testing the expectations of the agency and structural variables of the conceptual model. The third, inductive step considers whether yet other variables might explain the extent of the Dutch cabinet’s influence. The influence analysis is mainly based on primary, written sources. Formal written sources, such as position papers, Presidency papers and (draft) Treaty texts, are primarily utilised to apply the before-after analysis. Informal written sources, particularly hundreds of internal, confidential notes and reports of the negotiations in general and of (almost) all the specific meetings, are employed to apply the process analysis. These informal written sources were consulted in the archives of the Dutch Foreign Affairs Ministry and the European Commission, to which special access was obtained...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{article is}} a {{contribution}} to 50 years´ anniversary of signing the Rome Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, to better understanding the European Union, {{the relationship of the}} Union and the Member States. The issue of the European Union´s Constitution deadlock including the special issue of the <b>weighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> as well as the issue of Poland´s and the Czech Republic´s position on the US offer to install a US led anti-missile system in the two EU Member States : these issues are demonstrating the one crucial identity issue of the relationship of the European Union and its Member States, the relationship of the whole and the parts. Viewing at transdisciplinary comparative reflections on the relationship of the whole and the parts in philosophy, philosophy of economics and in natural science {{as well as in the}} law and policy making system of the European Union: the author concludes that the parts do not constitute the whole as an end in itself, they are subject, however, to a functional dialectical role to achieve common objectives, they are bound by the rationalism´s principle of effectiveness which is one of the constitutional essentials of the Treaty establishing the European Union as the legal incorporation of the functional dialectical approach of combining integrative, cooperative and competitive interactions between the Member States. The author has a deeper look at the biology/cytology system of the cell as a complex network of intracellular and extracellular structures the individual components of which are highly interconnected and practice the dynamics of the dialectical relationship of the cell and its structural components of interconnected cooperative and competitive levels of the complex network: ensuring the vitality of the cell and preventing the cell´s intracellular components from losing their independent identity and getting mixed in the cytoplasm. What prevents the smaller Member States of an enlarged European Union from losing identity, from mixing in the “cytoplasm” of the larger European Union: it is the Union´s complex multileveled network system of the functional approach of the dialectical dynamic cooperative and competitive relationship of the Union and the Member States, the whole and the parts, and that dialectical functional relation prevents the enlarged European Union from being dismantled, as well. Part of that system the Membership of which Poland´s Government had signed is the legal and political commitment to respect Treaty obligations: to consult each other within the EU´s Council before undertaking bilateral actions having direct impact on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to consult within the EU´s Council a common position before consulting the matter within NATO and,actually, before accepting the US offer to install a anti-missile shield in Central Europe...|$|E

Biomedical named entities (NEs) include mentions of proteins, genes, DNA, RNA etc. which, in general, have complex structures and are difﬁcult to recognize. We have developed a large number of features for identifying NEs from biomed–ical texts. Two robust diverse classiﬁcation methods like Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the set of features and/or feature templates.

40|$|After the 2008 presidential {{election}} season concludes, {{no doubt there}} will be calls to change the presidential nomination system, especially on the Democratic Party side. Already before the current season began, Congress explored legislation to prevent the frontloading of the primary process {{through the creation of}} a series of rotating regional primaries. The close contest for the Democratic Party nomination this winter and spring revealed additional issues beyond the timing question. Critics have argued that the caucus system used in some states is unfair and poorly administered, that the unequal <b>weighting</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> for purposes of delegate selection violates democratic principles, and that the fate of the Democratic Party presidential nomination should not turn on the votes of unelected superdelegates. It is certainly possible that the parties themselves will change their nomination rules in response to these criticisms, as the parties have done in the past. But in the event the parties cannot agree on changes, Congress may consider legislation imposing changes to make the nomination rules comply more with the typical one person, one vote norms applicable to general elections. At the extreme, Congress might require presidential nominations to occur through state-by-state direct primaries conducted under one person, one vote principles. Here, I explore the question whether Congress has the power to impose such primaries on the parties and the states if the parties, states, or both object. I do not consider the wisdom of such legislation. As I explain, the main argument that parties can advance against Congressional (or for that matter, state) imposition of a direct presidential primary is that it violates the First Amendment associational rights of political parties to determine their method for choosing their standard bearers. This argument would appear to have much force given recent Supreme Court cases recognizing the parties 2 ̆ 7 rights to overrule the states on the open or closed nature of political primaries. On the other hand, the Court has also accepted as 2 ̆ 2 too plain for argument 2 ̆ 2 a governmental power to require parties to use direct primaries to choose their nominees to assure fairness of the process. So resolution of the question is uncertain. The second argument that the parties or the states may raise against Congress is that Congress lacks the power under the Constitution to set the rules for {{presidential election}}s. Such an argument reads Congressional power under Article II of the Constitution narrowly, limited to setting the time for choosing presidential electors. Though the textual argument under Article II has some force, both Court precedent and policy suggest that the courts could well accept Congressional power to impose at least some regulations on the primary process, such as regulations setting the timing of primaries or caucuses. It is not clear whether congressional power would extend as far as to the imposition of a direct presidential primary against the parties 2 ̆ 7 and states 2 ̆ 7 wishes. Part I of this Essay briefly reviews complaints from the 2008 election season about the presidential nominating process. Part II considers the party autonomy argument against congressional legislation imposing a direct presidential primary. Part III considers the Congressional power argument. This Essay concludes by noting that even if Congress may lack the power, the threat of congressional action could spur the parties to reform themselves...|$|E

40|$|This Article {{argues that}} {{weighted}} voting {{should be used}} to comply with the constitutional one-person, one-vote requirement while preserving representation for political units on the legislative body. First, this Article demonstrates that weighted voting satisfies the quantitative one-person, one-vote requirement by equalizing the mathematic <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> each <b>vote.</b> Second, this Article demonstrates that weighted voting has the potential to remedy several negative consequences of equal-population districts. Specifically, this Article argues that by preserving local political boundaries, weighted voting eliminates the decennial redistricting process that gives rise to claims of partisan gerrymandering, enables local governments to function both as administrative arms of the state and as independent political communities and provides a format for regional governance. Third, this Article recognizes that while weighted-voting equalizes the mathematic <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> each <b>vote,</b> it does not equalize all aspects of legislative representation. In particular, this Article explains that weighted-voting generates inequality in the functional representation each voter receives, inflates the political power and <b>voting</b> power <b>of</b> legislators from more populous districts, and increases the risk <b>of</b> minority <b>vote</b> dilution.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{different}} types of electoral systems create different incentives to cultivate a personal vote and that there may be variation in intra-party competition within an electoral system. This article demonstrates that flexible list systems - where voters can choose to cast a vote for the list as ordered by the party or express preference votes for candidates - create another type of variation in personal vote-seeking incentives within the system. This variation arises because the flexibility of party-in-a-district lists results from voters' actual inclination to use preference votes and the formal <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> preference <b>votes</b> in changing the original list order. Hypotheses are tested which are linked to this logic for the case of Belgium, where party-in-a-district constituencies vary in their use <b>of</b> preference <b>votes</b> and the electoral reform of 2001 adds interesting institutional variation in the formal impact <b>of</b> preference <b>votes</b> on intra-party seat allocation. Since formal rules grant Belgian MPs considerable leeway in terms of bill initiation, personal vote-seeking strategies are inferred by examining the use of legislative activity as signalling tool in the period between 1999 and 2007. The results establish that personal vote-seeking incentives vary with the extent to which voters use preference votes and that this variable interacts with the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> preference <b>votes</b> as defined by institutional rules. In addition, the article confirms the effect of intra-party competition on personal vote-seeking incentives and illustrates that such incentives can underlie the initiation of private members bills in a European parliamentary system...|$|R
