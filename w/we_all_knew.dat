You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the game stems {{primarily from the}} graphic {{manner in which the}} player executes enemies. In 2007, former Rockstar employee Jeff Williams revealed that even the game's staff were somewhat uncomfortable about the level of violence; [...] "there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game". Williams explained that the game [...] "just made us all feel icky. It was all about the violence, and it was realistic violence. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> there was no way we could explain away that game. There was no way to rationalize it. We were crossing a line." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{the circle of}} friends with whom Presley {{constantly}} surrounded himself until his death {{came to be known}} as the [...] "Memphis Mafia". [...] "Surrounded by the parasitic presence", as journalist John Harris puts it, [...] "it was no wonder that as he slid into addiction and torpor, no-one raised the alarm: to them, Elvis was the bank, and it had to remain open." [...] Tony Brown, who played piano for Presley regularly in the last two years of the singer's life, observed his rapidly declining health and the urgent need to address it: [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it was hopeless because Elvis was surrounded by that little circle of people... all those so-called friends". In the Memphis Mafia's defense, Marty Lacker has said, [...] " [...] was his own man.... If we hadn't been around, he would have been dead a lot earlier." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{individual}} {{identities of}} the Pankhurst children began to emerge {{around the time of}} their father's death. Before long they were all involved in the struggle for women's suffrage. Christabel enjoyed a privileged status among the daughters, as Sylvia noted in 1931: [...] "She was our mother's favourite; <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it, and I, for one, never resented the fact." [...] Christabel did not share her mother's fervour for political work, however, until she befriended the suffrage activists Esther Roper and Eva Gore-Booth. She soon became involved with the suffrage movement and joined her mother at speaking events. Sylvia took lessons from a respected local artist, and soon received a scholarship to the Manchester School of Art. She went on to study art in Florence and Venice. The younger children, Adela and Harry, had difficulty finding a path for their studies. Adela was sent to a local boarding school, where she was cut off from her friends and contracted head lice. Harry also had difficulty at school; he suffered from measles and vision problems.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Sullivan of MTV {{stated that}} Principal Figgins [...] "stole {{the show with}} his {{outburst}} and the passing reference to Finchel", and VanDerWerff said his was [...] "a very funny moment in the episode", and also complimented the sequence for having alluded to [...] "how it’s still much harder to have a same-sex kiss on a broadcast network {{than it is to}} have Rachel and Finn neck disgustingly". The God Squad, however, was not well received: Canning described it as [...] "conveniently arriving for the sake of one storyline in this episode" [...] and debating [...] "a forced issue that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> would result in acceptance", and VanDerWerff pointed out that as [...] "we already know how the other three kids are going to shake out", it was [...] "surprisingly undramatic" [...] and its sole purpose to [...] "watch a new character decide if he's okay with gay people". Futterman, on the other hand, felt that the sequence [...] "tastefully incorporated religion's views into the show's ongoing look at gay relationships".|$|E
500|$|The next session, {{according}} to John Payne, occurred {{early in the}} morning, {{but it did not}} work and nothing from this session worked for the final album. [...] "It just didn't happen'" [...] says Payne. [...] "It was the wrong time of day for jazz musicians to create. I think {{that by the end of}} that session <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that nothing was going to be used. They just said, let's forget it." [...] Jay Berliner was not available, so Barry Kornfeld was recruited [...] to play lead guitar in his place. According to Merenstein, there was tension at this second session and it was stopped after about three hours. [...] Morrison was quoted by Ritchie Yorke as saying the album was recorded in [...] "two eight-hour sessions, plus two overdub sessions. That was the whole album." [...] In his biography, Clinton Heylin gives the date for the second session as [...] 1 October and states that [...] "Only 'As Young Lovers Do' from this session would make the album" [...] contending that this is the reason for the different [...] "lounge-jazz sound" [...] on this track. Other biographers have primarily noted that the early morning first of October session was abandoned without producing any of the songs on the album.|$|E

500|$|... "Original Song" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reception from critics upon its initial airing. James Poniewozik of Time called it a [...] "solid" [...] episode and wrote that [...] "it did well {{by a couple of}} ongoing relationship stories." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times opined that it delivered several [...] "long-anticipated moments [...] and several more we only wish we'd thought to anticipate." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald deemed it a [...] "great" [...] episode, [...] "filled with many great moments." [...] Robert Canning of IGN rated it 8/10, signifying a [...] "great" [...] episode. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly praised the development of [...] "Original Song", and wrote: [...] "One great thing about the episode was that after last week's plot-bomb-filled episode, the show didn't completely abandon what we'd learned that week." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded it [...] "B−"; he noted that he enjoyed the scenes, but criticized the show for its inconsistency. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised the episode for [...] "not only [...] retreating into the series’s standard, flailing, everybody-in-the-pool narrative template, or filling this metaphorical slough with more leaden tropes than Richard Serra circa 1968, but by having the results be precisely the inevitabilities <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> would occur." [...] Akash Nikolas at Zap2It praised the new song and its performance {{as a metaphor for the}} show: [...] "New Directions flashed Glee’s trademark “L” sign, which the show has renamed as something cool. And instead of cups full of slush that's usually thrown at the Glee Club, the cups were filled with red confetti and thrown at the audience. This neat moment captured the show’s conceit: taking something ugly and oppressive and turning it into something beautiful and celebratory." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten {{and we did not}} lose a single game in Europe. And, though we said we would do it again next year, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was dragging his body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
