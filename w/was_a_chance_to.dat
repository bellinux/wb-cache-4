The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, three of England's first four batsmen in the Tests, all playing.

5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a {{telemetry}} station. There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part of the reason for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> apply its latest minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E
5|$|The MCC fielded seven {{players who}} would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and {{with two other}} capped players, were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> gain a psychological advantage. After winning the toss, Australia batted first. After the loss of Morris early, Barnes (81) and Bradman (98) set about regaining the ascendancy with a 160-run stand. Bradman scored eleven fours in his 98, which took two hours, and Hassett then took over and added 51. Miller then saw Australia to stumps at 407/5. He continued {{the next day and}} Australia's highest scorer with 163, and Johnson supported him with 80. Despite a collapse which saw the last five wickets fall for 54 runs following the pair's departure, Australia reached 552. Bradman's batsmen gained a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests by attacking the off spin of Jim Laker. They hit nine sixes from the English Test representative on the second morning.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrichthree of England's top four batsmenall playing. Batting at No. 8, McCool made a duck as Australia collapsed late in their innings, losing 5/54 to be bowled out for 552. He was not required to bowl in the first innings as the three pacemen Ray Lindwall, Ernie Toshack and Miller skittled England for 189. McCool was given the shortest spell of the frontline bowlers in the second innings as the fast bowlers again made early inroads. He sent down 7.2 overs, and disposed of the tail, removing the last four wickets, including MCC and England captain Norman Yardley. McCool ended with 4/35 as the MCC lost their last four wickets for 28 to be all out for 205, giving Australia a victory by an innings and 158 runs.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would {{represent}} England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. Morris and Barnes retained their positions {{at the top of}} the order, while Brown played out of position in the middle order. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> players from both sides to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests, but Morris looked uncomfortable, managing only five as Australia amassed 552 and enforced the follow on to win by an innings. In the MCC’s second innings, Morris caught Jim Laker from the bowling of Colin McCool. The Lord’s fixture was followed by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which was against Lancashire. Morris continued to struggle, making five and 22, falling twice to England Test paceman Dick Pollard, In the drawn match against Nottinghamshire, Morris continued his form slump, making 16 in the tourists' only innings.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Kiss {{asked for}} Wendy and the Plasmatics {{to appear as}} a special guest on their tour. Kiss wanted the {{controversial}} street edge that Wendy would bring {{as part of their}} tour and for the Plasmatics it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play in front of different audiences in different markets than they would ordinarily play. By the end of the tour with KISS it was clear that, although the formal notice that Capitol would not pick up their option for a second album did not come in for six months, the relationship with Capitol was done. It had taken months and months for the deal to be done, months to record and release the album and now months {{to get out of the}} deal. Gene Simmons approached Wendy and Rod about producing the next Wendy O. Williams album. So as to avoid any wasted time in legal issues with Capitol Records, it was decided not to use the Plasmatics name on the record at all and was simply called WOW, the initials for Wendy O. Williams. Gene Simmons felt it would give him the freedom he wanted to add more new players to the album.|$|E

The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and was basically a full-strength Test team. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> gain a psychological advantage before the Tests. Australia batted first and Hassett made 51 in an innings win.

500|$|The {{relationship}} between the Ba'athists and the Nasserists were at best, uncomfortable. The Ba'ath Party's rise to power in Iraq and Syria put Nasser, as he put it, [...] "between the hammer and the anvil". The establishment of a union between Iraq and Syria would weaken his credentials as a pan-Arab leader. Nasser started launching bitter propaganda attacks against the party; Aflaq was dismissed as an ineffectual theorist who was mocked as a puppet [...] "Roman emperor" [...] and {{accused of being a}} [...] "Cypriot Christian". In several Ba'ath Party meetings Aflaq responded with pure anger, and became an anti-Nasserist. Because of the position he took, Aflaq had a falling out with al-Bitar who still believed there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> reestablish good ties with Nasser.|$|E
