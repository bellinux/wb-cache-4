500|$|Soon {{after the}} book's publication, Potter's ageing Mrs. Tiggy began {{showing signs of}} failing health. She wrote a friend on February 1, 1906, [...] "I am sorry to say I am upset about poor Mrs. Tiggy. She hasn't seemed well the last fortnight, and {{has begun to be}} sick, and she is so thin. I am going to try some physic but I am a little afraid that the long course of unnatural diet and indoor life is {{beginning}} to tell on her. It is a <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> has lasted so long. One gets very fond of a little animal. I hope she will either get well or go quickly." [...] A few weeks later Potter chloroformed her beloved hedgehog and laid her to rest in the garden at the Potter family home at 2 Bolton Gardens, Kensington.|$|E
500|$|A Times Editor review from The St. Petersburg Times also {{described}} it as sounding similar to other hits: [...] "She hankers for a boy who either doesn't love her back or wants to ditch this small town." [...] Josh Love of The Village Voice thought [...] "preternatural wisdom and inclusiveness" [...] shined through the lyrics and theme of [...] "You Belong with Me"; Love also mentioned {{that it was one}} of Fearless [...] "great songs". The same magazine later ranked the song at number 10 on its annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said Swift's vocals fit the song's melody and instrumentation, which, according to her, is [...] "slick" [...] and [...] "radio-friendly". Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine recommended for readers to download [...] "You Belong with Me", and Jeniffer Webb, also from About.com, predicted that the song would reach different age groups. Webb said, [...] "It continues the artist's tradition of having a little something for everyone, so it's no <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> has such a large fanbase." ...|$|E
500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E

60|$|A great {{sympathy for}} Ann welled up in him. No <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> hated {{the memory of}} Jimmy Crocker.|$|E
6000|$|A shiver {{passed through}} Renouard. <b>She</b> had <b>wondered!</b> What about? Malata was himself. He and Malata were one. And <b>she</b> had <b>wondered!</b> <b>She</b> had [...] .|$|R
60|$|She {{turned and}} looked at him then. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> why <b>she</b> had ever thought him ugly.|$|R

6000|$|At these words, Marianne's eyes {{expressed}} the astonishment which her lips could not utter. After a pause of <b>wonder,</b> <b>she</b> exclaimed-- ...|$|E

60|$|They {{could not}} conceal their curiosity {{in regard to}} Allie, nor their <b>wonder.</b> <b>She</b> had heard them {{whispering}} together whenever they came near.|$|E
60|$|He sprang up, {{strode to}} her with a nervous step, {{smoothed}} her hand. <b>She</b> <b>wondered</b> if <b>she</b> ought to be offended by his caress. Then <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if he liked her hat, the new Oriental turban of rose and silver brocade.|$|R
60|$|Later <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> if <b>she</b> {{had been}} unkind to him. But it was done--and done for ever. Vogue la galère.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rather languid; but Estminster {{is to work}} <b>wonders.</b> <b>She</b> {{declares}} that Northwold is her best cure, and I am speculating whether she will prevail. I think Lady Conway dreads your example.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> had not {{claimed the}} {{protection}} of Chancery for me,' said Darsie; 'or confided me {{to the care of}} some powerful friend.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then said Babbalanja, [...] "Aleema's sons raved not; 'tis true, then, Taji, that an evil deed gained {{you your}} Yillah: no <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> is lost." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{she wants}} to see much of her brother she let him choose rather an unfortunate profession.... I <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> didn't tell you the truth.|$|E

6000|$|Agatha was pleased. He {{had thought}} about her and remembered her dislikes. While <b>she</b> <b>wondered</b> how <b>she</b> could tactfully thank him, he went on-- ...|$|R

6000|$|Was {{the letter}} which I had sent upstairs a {{reply to the}} letter which Minna had seen her mother writing?

If this was the right reading of the riddle, no <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> had sent her daughter out of the room--no <b>wonder</b> <b>she</b> had locked her door! ...|$|E
60|$|And so {{the weeks}} wore away, and Edie {{wondered}} all to no purpose. At last, {{by dint of}} constant <b>wondering,</b> <b>she</b> almost wore out the faculty of wonder, and half ceased {{to think about it}} any longer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{knew all}} about her!" [...] said Dorothea. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> how <b>she</b> bore the change from wealth to poverty: I <b>wonder</b> whether <b>she</b> was happy with her husband! Do you know much about them?" ...|$|R
