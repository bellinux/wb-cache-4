5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} <b>which</b> <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

5|$|The second theme Garner {{identified}} was {{the divide}} between ideal and nonideal theory, which he understands as a way political theory {{may be used to}} contextualise animal ethics and further the debate. Ultimately, for Garner, Cochrane's theory serves as a challenge to abolitionism, which, Garner fears, both polarises the debate and is unrealistic. The themes of this review were built upon in Garner's 2013 book A Theory of Justice for Animals. In the course of his review of the book, Garner looked forward to the release of Cochrane's second book, Animal Rights Without Liberation, <b>which</b> <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> lengthier defence of the interest-based rights theory.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), <b>which</b> <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E

5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, <b>which</b> <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E

According to the brothers, ideas and technology used for the development of Toadstool Tour was also used for Power Tennis. The game was displayed as a playable demonstration in the E3 convention of 2003. Toadstool Tour became part of the Player's Choice label in 2004, <b>which</b> <b>offers</b> <b>a</b> reduced price to games that have sold more than one million copies.
