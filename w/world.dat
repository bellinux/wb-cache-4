40|$|About the book] Virtual <b>worlds</b> are computer-generated {{three-dimensional}} <b>worlds</b> {{in which}} participants adopt digital personae, called avatars, to interact with others. One of the strengths of virtual <b>worlds</b> as platforms {{is that they can}} provide engaging and authentic experiences for participants, enabling simulations of different environments, opportunities to roleplay different activities, and facilitating creativity and imagination. This volume focuses on this use of virtual <b>worlds</b> for providing experiential learning in particular. Some of the questions the volume aims to answer are: To what extent can the experiences of virtual <b>worlds</b> be considered "real"? What types of experiential learning are virtual <b>worlds</b> effective at providing and how can learning design make best use of their potential?; How do different types of learners respond to virtual <b>worlds?</b> How can virtual <b>worlds</b> develop leadership skills? How are courtship rituals and multiracial identity expressed in virtual <b>worlds</b> and what does this reveal about learning?
