2500|$|The <b>Working</b> <b>Timetable</b> of 1887 lists Kaitoke {{as one of}} {{the first}} {{stations}} on the section to receive signals. [...] Instructions for crossing trains required down (southbound) trains to take the siding or loop and up (northbound) trains to take the main line.|$|E
2500|$|In 1898 the <b>working</b> <b>timetable</b> showed four return {{passenger}} trains on the branch, the first into Plymouth arriving at Millbay at 08:35.

2500|$|The {{junction}} {{with the}} main line was at a flag station known as Beach, and the line terminated at Hutt Park, a 122-metre long platform by the western bank of the Hutt River. In the 1901 <b>Working</b> <b>Timetable</b> these two stops are called Petone Junction and Racecourse Platform respectively. [...] Trains ran whenever there was a race meeting, approximately {{four times a year}} for one or two days, from Te Aro {{at the end of the}} Te Aro Extension via Lambton Railway Station, a predecessor of Wellington Railway Station. They were run by the New Zealand Railways Department on behalf of the Hutt Park Railway Company and typically employed a WA class tank locomotive as motive power.|$|E
2500|$|Summit {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{stations}} on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with their being first listed in the <b>working</b> <b>timetable</b> of 1887. [...] Instructions for the crossing of trains laid down that southbound trains were to take the siding or loop, and northbound trains were to take the main line. [...] The safety sidings had ground discs to indicate the position of the points, and both ends of the yard were protected by home signals. [...] The signals in use at the time were of the slotted post semaphore type. [...] In 1903 when the yard was reorganised, the old slotted post signals were replaced with balance-arm semaphore signals.|$|E
2500|$|Cross Creek {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{stations}} on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with the <b>Working</b> <b>Timetable</b> of 1887 being the first to list them. [...] Instructions for the crossing of trains laid down that southbound trains were to take the siding or loop, and northbound trains were to take the main line. [...] There were two safety sidings, each of which had a ground disc to indicate its position. [...] A home signal was also installed at the foot of the incline, and a starting signal controlled trains leaving for Featherston at the other end of the yard. [...] Though there was a building next to the station in which a lever frame was used to set some points using mechanical interlocking, this was never as extensive as at other stations.|$|E
50|$|In 1878 the GWR {{opened a}} loop line between Bewdley and Kidderminster. Most {{of the traffic}} from the Wyre Forest Line {{continued}} via this route, which was described in <b>working</b> <b>timetables</b> as the “Woofferton, Tenbury Wells, Bewdley and Kidderminster Branch”.|$|R
5000|$|In earlier years, {{instructions}} to traincrews {{relating to the}} operation of the railway were included within the <b>working</b> <b>timetables.</b> As the volume of instructions increased, they later came to be published in a separate document, known in full as the [...] "Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetable" [...] or similar.|$|R
25|$|In 1877 {{there were}} 58 daily trips from the MR over the Widened Lines their own South London depots {{and to the}} LB, LC and SER {{destinations}} mentioned above. There {{must have been a}} similar number of workings from the GNR, details of which {{can be found in the}} <b>working</b> <b>timetables</b> at the National Archives.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to a request for the Railways Department to cease blocking access to the Breakwater and Launch wharves in winter months when AB class locomotives were used to heat the carriages of the Steamer Express trains, the Department sought clearance from the Harbour Board to stand the locomotives on the wharf while the carriages were being heated. Approval was granted in June 1966 {{for this to happen}} on the condition that the locomotives venture no further than [...] onto the wharf. This was considered to be a permanent arrangement for wharf no. 2, but only a temporary measure for wharf no. 3 pending the arrival of the second roll on/roll off ferry at which time the ferries and the Steamer Express trains would cease using this wharf. The <b>Working</b> <b>Timetable</b> was later amended in September to authorise the use of AB locomotives up to the shore end of the platform on the wharf.|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial was}} {{successful}} with the locomotive {{noted for its}} clean running {{and the elimination of}} smoke, spark hazard and spark arrestor cleaning. With the grate automatically stoked via a tender-mounted conveyor screw and blower motor, it was now possible to harness the full steam-raising potential of the locomotive's boiler without the stamina of the fireman being a limiting factor. The steam requirements for both engine and booster were able to be met for unlimited periods at maximum steam pressure even against the action of both injectors. Comparative performance tests with black coal-fired X30 revealed that X32 was able to generate a drawbar horsepower output of [...] at , exceeding by 5 to 10% that which could be produced by X30 with good quality Maitland or Lithgow coals. The locomotive gained a reputation for both speed and dependability. On one occasion, X32 hauled a [...] load between Seymour and Melbourne in 105 minutes, where the <b>working</b> <b>timetable</b> for a full [...] load allowed 147 minutes. On 4 April 1951 it replaced a defective S class locomotive in hauling the Spirit of Progress from Wallan to Melbourne, taking 43 minutes to cover the same distance the S class-hauled train would normally cover in 40 minutes, despite having to start the train from standstill and running with a lower permissible maximum speed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>working</b> <b>timetable</b> is {{effectively}} {{the foundation of}} railway safe operations and one of six main instructional publications which employees of Traffic departments in British style railways traditionally had at their disposal. The other publications were the Rule Book, General Appendix to the <b>Working</b> <b>Timetable,</b> Sectional or Local Appendix to the <b>Working</b> <b>Timetable,</b> Regulations for Train Signalling, circulars and weekly notices (names varied between companies).|$|E
30|$|GSD {{provides}} organisations {{with significant}} benefits: lower staff costs owing to wage labour differentials between countries, a greater availability of skilled professionals {{who are not}} accessible in the immediate environment, better access to important markets or customers, longer <b>working</b> <b>timetables</b> when teams do not share the same time zone, and the enriched diversity the distributed participants’ experiences, techniques and skills. However, although working in a global environment has its advantages, {{there are also a}} number of drawbacks to consider (Noll et al. 2010; Holtkamp et al. 2015).|$|R

50|$|While trains only {{operated}} as {{far north}} as Upper Hutt, they were not protected by fixed signals. It was felt that as services were few, slow, and operated only in daylight hours, signals were not necessary. Upper Hutt {{was one of the first}} stations on the Wairarapa Line to receive signals, with initial instructions requiring south-bound trains to wait in the siding or loop, and north-bound trains to take the main line. These signals were first listed in the <b>working</b> <b>timetables</b> of 1887. By 1921, increased traffic was causing operational issues, and it was decided to install new automatic signalling which had been recently developed in the United States.

5000|$|An engine shed. goods shed, and {{a station}} {{building}} were located at Kaitangata, 5.95 km from the Main South Line. [...] Although the station bore much resemblance to {{buildings on the}} national network operated by the Railways Department, the line was never part of its network. Trains were initially operated by the Railways Department {{on behalf of the}} private owners and the line appeared in <b>working</b> <b>timetables</b> as the Kaitangata Branch, but by the 1880s, this practice had ceased and private operation took over. Passenger services were provided until 1937. Until 1963, an extension ran down a road to the Castle Hill Mine, and for much of its life the line was operated by both a tank engine built to the design of a D class engine (built by Scott Brothers Ltd, of Christchurch) and an [...] "Improved F" [...] 0-6-0 tank locomotive, constructed in 1896 by Sharp, Stewart & Co.|$|R
5000|$|Next came Burnham Lane siding, {{and then}} a high embankment, pierced by two brick bridges, which were wide enough for double track, {{although}} they only ever carried a single track, followed by another deep cutting. Haxey station had a passing loop and three sidings. It was originally called Haxey Central, and then Haxey Town AJR, and eventually became Haxey Town. The line continued on an embankment, crossed Ferry Drain and Warping Drain by a brick bridge, {{and turned to the}} south-east to reach the terminus at Haxey Junction Station.

25|$|In the {{earliest}} days of railways in the United States most lines were built as single-track for reasons of cost, and very inefficient <b>timetable</b> <b>working</b> systems were used to prevent head-on collisions on single lines.

50|$|Railway {{companies}} incorporate their {{philosophy of}} service provision into their timetable in numerical, chronological form. In {{the beginning of}} commercial railways, the timetable was the authority for a train {{to be at a}} particular location at a specified time, subject to any restrictions imposed by the rules, regulations and engineered safety controls (which were originally minimal). As such, instructional publications were often referred to as 'appendices' to the <b>working</b> <b>timetable.</b> As the rules and regulations gradually expanded following accidents, the <b>working</b> <b>timetable</b> became more of a guide than an absolute authority.|$|E

We reviewed medical records and <b>working</b> <b>timetables</b> of healthcare workers (HCWs) and conducted a case-control study. We performed an environmental study and took bacteriological samples from HCWs and equipments. According to our case definitions, we identified 16 confirmed cases and 14 probable cases. The attack rate was 42 %. Most cases had skin blisters (28 cases) followed by pustules (five cases) and exfoliation (three cases). The location of the lesion was the trunk (17 cases), neck (14 cases) or armpits (nine cases). Nineteen cases had symptoms onset after discharge from hospital. Median age at onset was 4 days. The strain isolated from an infected newborn shared the same phage type as the contaminated equipment. Insufficient hand hygiene was an observed risk behaviour of HCWs and visitors. Exposure to a nasal carrier of Staphylococcus aureus (adjusted OR: 80. 3, 95 % CI: 4. 8 – 1350. 3) and ward sharing with a symptomatic case (adjusted OR: 35. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 9 – 654. 7) increased the risk of acquiring the infection.
