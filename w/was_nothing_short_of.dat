25|$|The {{reaction}} to the 1911 premiere <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> triumphant. The opera was a complete success with the public and was a great financial boon for the house; it is reported {{that at the time}} of the première, tickets were sold out almost immediately. The response from music critics was overall very positive, although some responded negatively to Strauss's use of waltzes, a music form practically unknown during the era when the story of the opera takes place. Despite this, the opera became one of the composer's most popular works during his lifetime and the opera remains a part of the standard repertoire today.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> a sensation. Lohmann not only became Surrey's leading bowler, but {{was the leading}} first-class wicket-taker with 142 wickets. He also showed his promise as a batsman was no fluke, for he scored 571 runs. In 1886, Lohmann did equally well and played his first Test matches for England against Australia. He took only one wicket at Old Trafford, and none at Lord's, but his continued superb form in other first-class matches saw him retained for the last match at The Oval. Here, Lohmann {{established himself as a}} great bowler with a superb twelve for 104 (7 for 36 and 5 for 68), giving England what is still one of its most decisive wins in an Ashes series. Again being the leading first-class wicket-taker, Lohmann was chosen to tour Australia with Alfred Shaw's team.|$|E

25|$|Sehwag {{had been}} {{suffering}} from a back injury {{and was forced to}} bat at no 7. He was unable to cope with conditions and was dismissed for a duck by James Anderson. The next dismissal, that of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> bizarre. Dhoni skied a ball off Udal, only for Monty Panesar to miss the chance as it landed around 10 feet from where he was, despite having ample time to position himself to take it. Unbelievably, Dhoni attempted a similar shot two balls later, and Panesar this time successfully held the chance. Some television commentators were actually confused by events believing the second shot by Dhoni to have been a replay of the original incident. Dhoni left the field to a chorus of boos by the crowd, stunned by England’s strikes. At this point, the score was 92/7.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it was at}} cricket that he {{achieved}} his best and by 1894 Downes was being described as the best bowler in New Zealand. For Otago he bowled right-arm with {{a great variety of}} pace, a big off-break and a fine length. Downes's bowling record <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> remarkable, especially in Dunedin. Of the 28 matches that he played there for Otago he took 10 or more wickets in a match on 13 occasions. His career bests for an innings were 8 for 35 against Canterbury in 1891–92 and 14 for 103 in a match against Hawke's Bay in 1893–94. He also recorded the unique feat in New Zealand first-class cricket of taking four wickets in four consecutive balls against Auckland in January 1894 on Carisbrook Ground. He played for Grange Cricket Club and Albion Cricket Club. He missed many of Otago's away matches, as he was unable to obtain leave from his work for the travel; of his 51 first-class matches over 26 years, only two were in the North Island.|$|E
25|$|The {{team had}} been known informally as the Blue Bulls since the 1940s and from 8 June 1963 in a {{newspaper}} cartoon by Victor Ivanoff had been portrayed as such. Their name officially changed to the Blue Bulls {{at the end of}} 1997 season and in 1998 after 6 years of not reaching the final and some very heavy defeats at Currie Cup level, the Bulls, captained by another legend, Joost van der Westhuizen, managed to reach the final for a record 24th time after the come-back of the century in the semi-final against a star-studded Sharks outfit. The Bulls' triumph <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> remarkable. After André Joubert's second try early in the second half, which stretched the Sharks' lead from 10-3 to 17-3, even their coach, Eugene van Wyk, believed that they had no chance. But whatever Bulls captain Van der Westhuizen told his team while Gavin Lawless was setting up for the conversion of Joubert's second try, it made them realise that it was now or never. Suddenly, they started playing with new life and new direction. Franco Smith scored a couple of penalties and then prop Piet Boer dived over for a try. The last 12 minutes with the score on 17-all, were dramatic. First, flanker Nicky van der Walt put the Bulls ahead with a magnificent try following Van der Westhuizen's brilliant opportunistic play and great ball skills. And the last nail went into the Sharks coffin when the Bulls were awarded a penalty try for an early tackle by André Joubert on Grant Esterhuizen in the in-goal area. The following Saturday they defeated Western Province 24-20 at Loftus. With only a few minutes left on the clock, Province must have thought they won it when their Springbok-winger Chester Williams went over in the corner, but referee André Watson ruled the pass from Robbie Fleck forward.|$|E

500|$|Fury (1936) was {{the first}} film to prove that Tracy could make a success on his own merit. Directed by Fritz Lang, Tracy played a man who swears revenge after {{narrowly}} escaping death by a lynch mob. The film and performance received excellent reviews. It was popular with the public, going on to make $1.3 million worldwide. Curtis writes: [...] "audiences who, just a year earlier, had no clear handle on him, were suddenly turning out to see him. It was a transition that <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> miraculous... a willingness {{on the part of}} the public to embrace a leading man who was not textbook handsome nor bigger than life." ...|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly's {{second and}} final Ashes tour to England {{as a player}} in 1938 again saw him as the most {{effective}} bowler in the team. His final record of 22 wickets {{at an average of}} 27.72 in the four Tests—the Third Test was rained off without a ball being bowled—was marginally less than 1934, and in all matches he took 104 wickets at 16.59. In its report of the tour, however, Wisdens 1939 edition noted that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> remarkable that despite the moderate support accorded to him he bowled so consistently well and so effectively." [...] Again, O'Reilly was often used defensively where there was no help from the wicket, but, Wisden added, [...] "when... the wicket gave him the least encouragement he robbed the greatest batsmen of initiative, and was most destructive".|$|E
500|$|Arthur's {{imprisonment}} was {{a precursor}} to the final exit of actor Bill Treacher, who decided to leave EastEnders after 11 years playing Arthur. While Arthur goes to pieces in prison, Pauline is heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release. For several months viewers witnessed Willy attempt to woo Pauline, but she eventually uncovers his deception and then resorts to uncharacteristic seduction to gain his confession. A critic for the Sunday Mirror commented, [...] "Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in EastEnders. The way which she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> brilliant." [...] Arthur is exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline is brief, as an injury he sustained in prison leads to a brain haemorrhage and he dies shortly after his release. His death ends an 11-year screen marriage, the longest run of any marriage in the serial.|$|E

500|$|Spears' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed by most critics. Linda Stasi of the New York Post asserted that Spears looked [...] "slim [...] trim and gorgeous" [...] and that [...] "her acting <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> adorably believable". Stasi concluded that Spears' cameo was {{the highlight of}} [...] "Ten Sessions". David Hinckley of New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, avouching that she [...] "proved [...] she can act every bit {{as well as she}} can sing". Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears' {{appearance was}} a [...] "nice change of pace from her latest public appearances", it was nonetheless a [...] "bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer's performance. Bowman opined: [...] "The Big Britney Episode, as it will henceforth be known, wasn't really much to get all huffy over. You can say this for the [...] team: They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars. Britney was a sideshow, and she got her couple of laughs, but she didn't hog the screen time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The next session <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>short</b> <b>of</b> remarkable, as the Indian batting order {{collapsed}} {{in a dramatic}} fashion.
