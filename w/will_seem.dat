25|$|Studies such as Belief in Conspiracy Theories {{state that}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{relating to the}} assassination of JFK, the moon landing and the September 11th attacks are united by a common thread: distrust of the government-endorsed story. This leads the believer to attach other conspiracies as well. Someone with a distrust of the government will likely reject any and all stories or reports directly issued by state agencies or other authorities that are {{seen as part of}} the establishment. Thus, any conspiracy <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> more plausible to the conspiracy theorist because this fits with their worldview.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of homo sapiens {{to the other}} animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entail in the hope—or on the mere off chance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> equally incredible {{that we do not}} notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.|$|E

25|$|Patients with {{keratoconus}} typically present initially {{with mild}} astigmatism and myopia, commonly {{at the onset}} of puberty, and are diagnosed by the late teenage years or early 20s. The disease can, however, present or progress at any age; in rare cases, keratoconus can present in children or not until later adulthood. A diagnosis of the disease at an early age may indicate a greater risk of severity in later life. Patients' vision <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> to fluctuate over a period of months, driving them to change lens prescriptions frequently, but as the condition worsens, contact lenses are required in the majority of cases. The course of the disorder can be quite variable, with some patients remaining stable for years or indefinitely, while others progress rapidly or experience occasional exacerbations over a long and otherwise steady course. Most commonly, keratoconus progresses for a period of 10 to 20 years before the course of the disease generally ceases in the third and fourth decades of life.|$|E
25|$|Back in {{the present}} moment, it is the eighth day after the narrator's plane crash and the narrator is dying of thirst; miraculously, {{following}} a long walk, he and the prince find a well. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his eagerness to see his rose again, who he worries has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if {{it looks as though}} he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that romantic {{involvement}} in adolescence decreases aggression in males and females, but decreases {{at a higher rate}} in females. Females <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> more desirable to their mate if they fit in with society and females that are aggressive do not usually fit well in society, they can often be viewed as antisocial. Female aggression is not considered the norm in society and going against the norm can sometimes prevent one from getting a mate. However, studies have shown that an increasing number of women are getting arrested for domestic violence charges. In many states, women now account for a quarter to a third of all domestic violence arrests, up from less than 10 percent a decade ago. The new statistics reflect a reality documented in research: women are perpetrators as well as victims of family violence. However, another equally possible explanation is a case of improved diagnostics: it has become more acceptable for men to report female domestic violence to the authorities {{while at the same time}} actual female domestic violence has not increased at all. This can be the case when men have become less ashamed of reporting female violence against them, therefore an increasing number of women are arrested, although the actual number of violent women remains the same.|$|E

25|$|Since {{one might}} not travel faster than light, one might {{conclude}} that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then {{never be able to}} reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of time dilation, the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the speed of light (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the Solar System, but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, she or he will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed c, their proper speed (distance as seen by Earth divided by their proper time) can be much greater than c. This is seen in statistical studies of muons traveling much further than c times their half-life (at rest), if traveling close to c.|$|E

500|$|The {{second act}} takes place a week later, when the movie's cast are {{attending}} a decadent party at Gloria's house. Wally and Chicky have conspired {{to use the}} phony engagement of Betty and Wally to win Zeffie's approval of the real relationship between Betty and Chicky. They think she will find Wally so unacceptable that Chicky <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> good in comparison. Meanwhile, Gloria also wants to prove Wally is an unfit match for Betty, by seducing him {{to prove that he}} is unfaithful. She lures Wally to her bedroom suite on the pretense of renewing their relationship, without intending to follow through. She plans to tease him until Zeffie finds them there, but he is prepared for her plan and will not accept any delay; the act ends with him telling her that she must fulfill her [...] "marriage debt" [...] to him.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 38, High {{provides}} more {{detail about the}} einherjar. Gangleri says that [...] "you say that all those men that have fallen in battle {{since the beginning of}} the world have now come to Odin in Val-hall. What has he got to offer them food? I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E
500|$|Ninja Gaiden was {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} the pilot issue of UK magazine Mean Machines in July 1990; the magazine was distributed as part of the July 1990 issue of Computer and Video Games. In its review, Julian Rignall compared the game to its beat 'em up arcade counterpart, which was titled Shadow Warriors. He noted that the game has great graphics that feature diverse backgrounds and character sprites; he gave special praise to its usage of cartoon-like animation sequences between Acts in which the game's plot unfolds. He enjoyed the game's difficulty especially with the bosses, but he noted that the game <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> tough at first until players get accustomed to the controls. He criticized the game for its sound, which he said did not fit with the graphics and was [...] "racy", but said that [...] "what's there is atmospheric and suits the action". He highly recommended the game to fans of the beat 'em up and combat genres.|$|E

Johnny was jaded, worn out, without resilience, while his younger brother seemed bursting and spilling over with exuberance.|$|R
500|$|Up! Close and Personal {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. David Bianculli of New York City's Daily News wrote, [...] "After watching Britney Spears' [...] special last week, Twain's act <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> like {{an exercise in}} restraint. It'll also seem like someone singing, rather than lip-syncing." [...] Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant gave Up! Close & Personal a negative review. He found himself straining to hear Alison Krauss and Union Station, and asked, [...] "And {{when was the last}} time you tuned in to a star's special to hear the background singers?" [...] Furthermore, he would have preferred the band to duet with Twain, rather perform backup for her. Catlin also criticized Twain's decision to model the show after Presley's 68 Comeback Special, believing she did so with far less efficiency. [...] "Not only is she not Elvis, she's not even Alison", he concluded. Allmusic rated Up! Close and Personal three out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|Holmes's fame {{continued}} through his later years. The Poet at the Breakfast-Table {{was published in}} 1872. Written fifteen years after The Autocrat, this work's tone was mellower and more nostalgic than its predecessor; [...] "As people grow older," [...] Holmes wrote, [...] "they come at length to live so much in memory that they often think {{with a kind of}} pleasure of losing their dearest possessions. [...] Nothing can be so perfect while we possess it as it <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> when remembered". In 1876, at the age of seventy, Holmes published a biography of John Lothrop Motley, which was an extension of an earlier sketch he had written for the Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings. The following year he published a collection of his medical essays and Pages from an Old Volume of Life, a collection of various essays he had previously written for The Atlantic Monthly. He retired from Harvard Medical School in 1882 after thirty-five years as a professor. After he gave his final lecture on November 28, the university made him professor emeritus.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive reviews, with [...] "Avalukkenna" [...] being {{particularly well}} received. Pradeep Madhavan of The Hindu (Tamil) states that [...] "Avalukkenna" [...] brought out Nagesh's dancing potential onscreen. M. N.

A reviewer from Radio Mirchi wrote that [...] "Avalukkenna" [...] provided {{a new concept to}} Tamil cinema in terms of lyrics, music and dance. Balachander commented on that song, [...] "Songs like 'Avalukkenna.. [...] Listen to them today, and they <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> so fresh and amazing.

[...] Baradwaj Rangan, writing for The Hindu, said, [...] "Listen to the lazy drawl with which certain words taper off in ‘Avalukkenna,’ an antidote to the rock ‘n’ roll bounce {{in the rest of the}} song." [...] Poga Poga Theriyum" [...] was later included in Old is Gold, an album compiling hit songs from films featuring Muthuraman, and was rated by The Times of India as one of the album's [...] "hot picks".|$|E

500|$|In chapter 38, Gangleri says: [...] "You {{say that}} all men who have fallen in battle from the {{beginning}} of the world are now with Odin in Valhalla. With what does he feed them? I should think the crowd there is large." [...] High responds that this is indeed true, that a huge amount are already in Valhalla, but yet this amount <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> to be too few when [...] "the wolf comes." [...] High describes that there are never too many to feed in Valhalla, for they feast from Sæhrímnir (here described as a boar), and that this beast is cooked every day and is again whole every night. Grímnismál stanza 18 is then recounted. Gangleri asks if Odin himself eats the same food as the Einherjar, and High responds that Odin needs nothing to eat—Odin only consumes wine—and he gives his food to his wolves Geri and Freki. Grímnismál stanza 19 is then recounted. High additionally states that at sunrise, Odin sends his ravens Huginn and Muninn from Valhalla to fly throughout the entire world, and they return in time for the first meal there.|$|E

Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you went to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E
500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} {{as a part}} of History Matters, a campaign led by several heritage organisations such as the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that <b>will</b> <b>seem</b> extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on their lives that day in their submissions.|$|E
