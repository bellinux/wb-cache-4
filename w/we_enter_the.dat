The year's other dump period {{straddles}} summer and fall, and does not lend itself to being as clearly delineated as the winter dump months. In the past it was usually considered to include all of August and September, and in some years still may. But in years with many major summer movies, some may open on {{the first or second}} weekend of August to avoid competing with other such movies, such as Guardians of the Galaxy, the first-ever August release by Marvel Studios, which took in $94 million on the first weekend of that month in 2014. It was the most successful August opening weekend, and it became one of the year's top-grossing films.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, some reviewers found Jawss {{description}} of the shark attacks entertaining. John Spurling of the New Statesman asserted that while the [...] "characterisation of the humans is fairly rudimentary", the shark [...] "is done with exhilarating and alarming skill, and every scene in which it appears is imagined at a special pitch of intensity." [...] Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the novel in a short review for The New York Times, highlighting the [...] "strong plot" [...] and [...] "rich thematic substructure." [...] The Washington Posts Robert F. Jones described Jaws as [...] "much more than a gripping fish story. It is a tightly written, tautly paced study," [...] which [...] "forged and touched a metaphor that still makes us tingle whenever <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> water." [...] New York Magazine reviewer Eliot Fremont-Smith found the novel [...] "immensely readable" [...] {{despite the lack of}} [...] "memorable characters or much plot surprise or originality"; Fremont-Smith wrote that Benchley [...] "fulfills all expectations, provides just enough civics and ecology to make us feel good, and tops it off with a really terrific and grisly battle scene".|$|E

2500|$|On 21 September, German High Command {{considered}} how {{to destroy}} Leningrad. Occupying {{the city was}} ruled out [...] "because it would make us responsible for food supply". The resolution was to lay the city under siege and bombardment, starving its population. [...] "Early next year <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> city (if the Finns do it first we do not object), lead those still alive into inner Russia or into captivity, wipe Leningrad {{from the face of}} the earth through demolitions, and hand the area north of the Neva to the Finns." [...] On 7 October, Hitler sent a further directive signed by Alfred Jodl reminding Army Group North not to accept capitulation.|$|E
2500|$|Courtney Conlogue is a 25 {{year old}} American {{professional}} surfer. In {{an interview with}} ESPN she outlined {{what it takes to}} be a professional surfer. [...] "I think some people perceive surfing as just a lifestyle sport. This will be my sixth year competing professionally on the World Tour, and to be involved in something like this goes to show that we do fine-tune our bodies in order to be as strong as we can when <b>we</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> water. During the offseason, I train three to five days a week, and then I train every day in the water. Depending on the way the swell is -- because our sport is based on Mother Nature -- when the waves are good, I surf probably six hours a day." ...|$|E
