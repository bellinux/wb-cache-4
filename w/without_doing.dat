5|$|Skleros {{eventually}} set {{out from}} the city, and divided his forces into three groups: two divisions were placed in ambush on the wooded {{sides of the road}} leading towards the Rus' camp, while another, probably some 2,000–3,000 men, was placed under himself (or Alakaseus in Skylitzes' account) and went forth to attack the Rus' host. The Byzantine detachment quickly came into contact with the Rus' army, and charged the Pecheneg contingent. The Byzantines executed a gradual orderly retreat, turning at intervals to charge back at the pursuing Pechenegs, who had thus become separated from {{the main body of the}} Rus' army. This conflict was fierce and bloody, taxing the discipline and endurance of the small Byzantine force. According to Leo the Deacon, at one point one of the Pechenegs charged Bardas himself and delivered a sword blow on his helmet, which was deflected by the metal <b>without</b> <b>doing</b> harm. Bardas' young brother Constantine came to his rescue, killing the Pecheneg.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the differences between patients with overactive bladder (OAB) and detrusor overactivity (DO) and those with OAB but <b>without</b> <b>DO.</b> Methods: We prospectively recruited patients with OAB symptoms between December 2008 and September 2009. All patients were required to complete a 3 -day frequency–volume chart. Symptom severity was evaluated using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) questionnaires. All patients also underwent urodynamic studies. Demographics, symptom severity, urinary frequency and volume, and urodynamic variables of patients with and <b>without</b> <b>DO</b> were compared. Results: Of the 133 enrolled patients (76 women and 57 men), DO was diagnosed in 80 patients (60. 2 %). All demographic variables were similar among the OAB patients, regardless of DO status. Total IPSS and OABSS scores did not differ between the OAB and DO groups. However, the nighttime urinary frequency subscore on the OABSS differed significantly between OAB patients with <b>DO</b> and <b>without</b> <b>DO</b> (p =  0. 048). There were no significant differences in terms of urodynamic variables, urinary frequency, or urine volume between OAB patients with and <b>without</b> <b>DO.</b> Conclusion: Patients with OAB symptoms and urodynamic DO show different clinical symptoms than OAB patients <b>without</b> <b>DO.</b> Patients with DO experience more frequent nocturnal urinary episodes...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} autonomic dysfunction {{among patients}} with urinary incontinence (UI) with or <b>without</b> detrusor overactivity (<b>DO),</b> we measured and compared {{heart rate variability}} (HRV) in these groups. Materials and Methods: We studied HRV in 12 female UI patients with DO (mean age, 57. 3 ± 11. 0 years) and 53 female UI patients <b>without</b> <b>DO</b> (mean age, 56. 8 ± 9. 8 years). HRV parameters were measured by SA- 3000 P Ⓡ. Heart rates, the time domain index, and the frequency domain index were compared. To compare time domain indexes, we used the standard deviation of the N-N interval (SDNN), the square root of the mean squared differences of successive N-N intervals (RMSSD), and the frequency domain indexes total power (TP), very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio). Results: RMSSD values were lower in UI patients with DO than in those <b>without</b> <b>DO,</b> but the values of SDNN and HR showed no significant difference. Whereas the values of LF and HF were lower in UI patients with DO than in those <b>without</b> <b>DO,</b> the LF/HF ratio was higher. TP and VLF were not significantly different. Conclusions: RMSSD, HF, and LF were lower in DO patients than in controls <b>without</b> <b>DO,</b> but the LF/HF ratio was higher. This suggests that both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity is attenuated in DO, but the autonomic imbalance is higher...|$|R

25|$|Another {{commonly}} considered {{model is}} the heat pump or refrigerator. Again there are four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir, and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir. Then the work reservoir does work on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than the hot reservoir. The hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir, but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir. Then, by allowing it to expand <b>without</b> <b>doing</b> work on another body and without passing heat to another body, the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir. It can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle.|$|E

Hoapili agreed to release the men on the understanding that Clark would land the women at Lahaina. Clark had left instructions with the mate to fire some shots if Clark had not returned in an hour. Before Clark returned to John Palmer the mate fired five 9-pounder shots towards the house of the missionary William Richards, some of which landed in the yard <b>without</b> <b>doing</b> serious damage.

25|$|British Intelligence did {{not predict}} {{the scale of}} Georgette, {{although}} in fairness the Germans were changing their plans frequently and only finalised their intentions {{a week or so}} beforehand. The Germans enjoyed significant artillery superiority (although less than they would have preferred after the intense fighting in the Somme sector) and some of the BEF line was held by poor-quality Portuguese divisions. Foch visited Haig at 1pm on 9 April, and again refused Haig’s demand that the French take over more BEF line so as to free up a British reserve. Haig felt that Foch’s proposal to deploy 4 French divisions west of Amiens would simply increase Rawlinson’s logistical troubles <b>without</b> <b>doing</b> much to help. On 10 April Georgette was extended northwards, as von Arnim’s Fourth Army also attacked, forcing the evacuation of Armentieres by Du Cane’s XV Corps. Haig yet again demanded that the French take over “some portion” of the British line and give French assistance “in order … to continue the battle”.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{both the}} {{monetary}} hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz {{as well as the}} debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered aggregate demand, a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors <b>without</b> <b>doing</b> damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a credit crunch which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.|$|E
25|$|Although {{he played}} only ten {{first-class}} games in 1879 despite being the official captain of Surrey, Lucas returned to form under severely difficult conditions {{due to the}} abominable weather and was selected for the first Test team in England the following year, where he made 55, his only fifty in five Tests. At the end of 1882 Lucas moved away from Surrey and played for Middlesex under a birth qualification from 1883, when he remained {{near the top of}} the first-class batting averages. He achieved the rare feat of carrying his bat through an innings for the Gentlemen at the Oval, and played an innings of 72 at Lord’s.

25|$|Instead of her psychic knife, Psylocke {{began to}} {{manifest}} a telekinetic katana composed of raw psionic energy. At its lowest intensity her katana functions much like her psychic knife once did, short-circuiting the victim's nervous system on impact. At its highest level, the katana can slice through almost any physical matter. Psylocke's {{control over the}} katana is such that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor, but only leave her opponent stunned or unconscious. Psylocke's telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world, and so she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness. The katana can also affect beings that are more powerful than Psylocke herself. She can also use her sword to shatter telepathic power-inhibitors imposed on others, despite her own lack of telepathy. With no telepathy to guide her when performing this task, she must rely on her instincts to give the blade the sufficient strength necessary to break the inhibitors, <b>without</b> <b>doing</b> permanent damage to the subject in question. During the timeline shift known as House of M, Psylocke showed the ability to summon two telekinetic katanas at the same time. It is unknown if she is capable of this under normal circumstances.|$|E
