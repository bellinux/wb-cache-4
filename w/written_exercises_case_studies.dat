On a more general level we argue that the CSC has considerable potential for further development.

As Pharmacy schools incorporate public health curricular experiences, there is a need to identify best practices. Purpose: Expose Pharm D students to Public Health while engaging them in active learning using current and emerging health issues. Description of innovation: Since 2013, NSU College of Pharmacy offers a public health required course to third year students aimed at providing public health knowledge and skills so that they can apply them to pharmacy practice. It is offered simultaneously, once a week for a semester, to 230 students, some of them at distant campuses. It is highly interactive and includes in-class <b>exercises,</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies,</b> and the assembling of a comprehensive health profile for a country. Students explore current issues that affect public health. Individual and group learning is assessed. Outcomes: Students have assembled 200 health profiles using current data from the CDC, WHO and local and national surveillance information. In-class exercises allowed them to explore issues like the Ebola outbreak, the Zika virus, Flint water quality, new vaccines and treatments for epidemics from a Pharmacy perspective. <b>Case</b> <b>studies</b> were used to explore the role of pharmacy in tobacco, emergency preparedness and immunization from a practice and policy standpoint.

This book will guide the reader through both the basic and more advanced methods of impact evaluation, with a particular focus on impact evaluation within evidence-based policy making and in international development. It will address the design, commissioning, and management of impact evaluations, data management, statistical econometric analyses, and theory-based approaches to impact evaluation. It will also cover other components of evidence-based policy making such as systematic reviews, replication, and ethics in impact evaluation research and practice.

40|$|Background The {{mental health}} of {{children}} and young people (CYP) is a major UK public health concern. Recent policy reviews have identified that service provision for CYP with mental health needs is not as effective, responsive, accessible or child-centred as it could be. Following on from a previous National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) study into self-care support for CYP with long-term physical health needs, this study explored self-care support’s potential in CYP’s mental health. Objectives To identify and evaluate the types of mental health self-care support used by, and available to, CYP and their parents, and to establish how such support interfaces with statutory and non-statutory service provision. Design Two inter-related systematic literature reviews (an effectiveness review with meta-analysis and a perceptions review), together with a service mapping <b>exercise</b> and <b>case</b> <b>study.</b> Setting Global (systematic reviews); England and Wales (mapping <b>exercise</b> and <b>case</b> <b>study).</b> Participants (<b>case</b> <b>study)</b> Fifty-two individuals (17 CYP, 16 family members and 19 staff) were interviewed across six sites. Main outcome measures (meta-analysis) A measure of CYP’s mental health symptomatology. Data sources (literature reviews) MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, All Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) Reviews, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA) and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC). Review methods Titles and abstracts of papers were screened for relevance then grouped into studies. Two independent reviewers extracted data from studies meeting the inclusion criteria. A descriptive analysis and meta-analysis were conducted for the effectiveness review; descriptive analyses were conducted for the perceptions review. These analyses were integrated to elicit a mixed-methods review. Results Sixty-five of 71 included studies were meta-analysable.
