25|$|A {{framework}} has {{a unique}} realization in d-dimensional space if every placement of the same graph with the same edge lengths is congruent to it. Such a framework must necessarily be rigid, because otherwise there exists a continuous motion bringing it to a non-congruent placement with the same edge lengths, but unique realizability is stronger than rigidity. For instance, the diamond graph (two triangles sharing an edge) is rigid in two dimensions, {{but it is not}} uniquely realizable because it has two different realizations, one in which the triangles are {{on opposite sides of the}} shared edge and one in which they are both on the same side. Uniquely realizable graphs are important in applications that involve reconstruction of shapes from distances, such as triangulation in land surveying, the determination of the positions of the nodes in a <b>wireless</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>network,</b> and the reconstruction of conformations of molecules via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.|$|E
