5|$|After the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran <b>with</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> the Syrian government, which was in occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Preckwinkle {{decided to}} paint over two 36-year-old, unmaintained and {{severely}} damaged public murals in the 47th Street Metra underpass. The murals {{had been created}} by graffiti artists, working <b>with</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, and had represented themes that included Latin-American, African, Mayan, Indian, and Native American spiritual practices. The walls were later covered with newly commissioned murals: one {{is made up of}} a series of ceramic tiles and the other is a traditional painted mural featuring the city and important historical South Side figures, including former Alderman Dorothy Tillman.|$|E

5|$|In early 1941 the British press, <b>with</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> the Air Ministry, {{was allowed}} to {{approach}} Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the motivating reasons {{for the lack of}} censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
5|$|Pedro Alvarez (2009) nearly went {{unsigned}} as {{he faced}} a contentious {{process in which}} Alvarez and the Pirates reached an initial deal after the signing deadline (<b>with</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> MLB); his agent Scott Boras and the Players Association filed a grievance challenging this post-deadline deal, and ultimately the Pirates renegotiated a deal with him in September that year. The Pirates have had seven compensatory picks overall since the first draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year.|$|E

5|$|During that period, the Batavia Society of Arts and Sciences, {{whose main}} {{interests}} were in archaeological research and conservation, {{became interested in}} the newly invented albumen print medium. The society felt that the world should know more about Javanese culture as expressed in the old inscriptions, statues, customs and temples. The Society arranged an archaeological tour around Java, headed by J.F.G. Brumund, a priest of the Batavian Evangelic Community and a specialist in Javanese. The Society also commissioned van Kinsbergen to accompany Brumund during his tour in order to illustrate Brumund's publication of Javanese culture and antiquities. The government granted permission for this tour, with the restriction that all wet-prints (cliches) would be government property and that extra printing would only be allowed <b>with</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> the government.|$|E
5|$|Political {{tensions}} between CharlesI and Parliament {{in the second}} quarter of the 17thcentury led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's Trained Bands, a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, CharlesI attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron, the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. <b>With</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir John Conyers. By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} prohibition (on aikido, at least) {{was lifted}} in 1948 {{with the creation}} of the Aiki Foundation, established by the Japanese Ministry of Education <b>with</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> the Occupation forces. The Hombu dojo re-opened the following year. After the war Ueshiba effectively retired from aikido. He delegated most of the work of running the Hombu dojo and the Aiki Federation to his son Kisshomaru, and instead chose to spend much of his time in prayer, meditation, calligraphy and farming. He still travelled extensively to promote aikido, even visiting Hawaii in 1961. He also appeared in a television documentary on aikido: NTV's The Master of Aikido, broadcast in January 1960. Ueshiba maintained links with the Japanese nationalist movement even in later life; his student Kanshu Sunadomari reported that Ueshiba temporarily sheltered Mikami Taku, one of the naval officers involved in the May 15 Incident, at Iwama.|$|E

5|$|Vanaja (Mamatha Bhukya) is the 15-year-old {{daughter}} of Somayya (Ramachandriah Marikanti), a poor, low caste fisherman from rural Andhra Pradesh. Somayya struggles {{to support his}} family due to dwindling catches at sea and mounting debts. One day, Vanaja and her teenage friend Lacchi (Bhavani Renukunta) watch a theatrical performance by a former Kuchipudi (a native classical Indian dance form) great, Rama Devi (Urmila Dammannagari). The sequence of events lead to a soothsayer predicting to Vanaja {{that she will be}} a great dancer. <b>With</b> <b>permission</b> <b>from</b> her father, she goes to work in the house of the local landlady Rama Devi with the hope of learning Kuchipudi. While she is employed as a farmhand, she is entrusted with tending the chickens. When she gets caught playfully chasing them, she lies to conceal her pranks. Her vivaciousness and spunk soon catch the landladyâ€™s eye. To keep her out of trouble, Rama Devi soon promotes her to a kitchen underhand where she meets Rama Deviâ€™s cook, the old, crusty and extremely loyal Radhamma (Krishnamma Gundimalla).|$|E
