5|$|The {{authorized}} {{loudspeaker enclosure}} {{to use with}} a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet, which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a cabinet.

5|$|Constructed in Canada, a 'runway plough', {{assembled}} in Scotland, survives at Eglinton Country Park. It {{was purchased by}} the army in World War II to rip up aerodrome runways and railway lines if an invasion took place as means of causing disruption, making them useless to the occupying forces. It was used at the old Eglinton Estate, which had been commandeered by the army, to provide its army operators <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> experience. It was hauled by a powerful Foden Trucks tractor, possibly via a pulley and cable system.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{originally}} {{played on}} an open pitch in the south-east corner of the newly laid out Stanley Park, the same site where Liverpool F.C. planned a stadium, however abandoned the project.

5|$|Late in 1910, the BX {{fulfilled}} {{a heroic}} role. The Chilco {{had been on}} its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident just above the Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to make one last run with the BX <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without {{as much as a}} scratch on her paint.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} Summer Olympics, Solo {{received}} a public warning from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) after a June 15 urine test concluded the banned substance Canrenone had been detected.

She cooperated with the USADA and provided them <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E

5|$|The {{aggressive}} Weyrother persuaded Archduke John and Lauer {{to launch}} an offensive. The Austrian chief of staff planned to strike {{in the direction of}} Landshut. From there, the Austrians would either wheel left to smash the French left flank or possibly get across their enemies' line of communications to the west of Munich. However, in the last days of November, the Austrian army proved unable to advance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> speed to turn the French north flank. Aware that their adversaries were also advancing, Lauer convinced the archduke to convert the flank march into a direct advance on Munich.|$|E
5|$|The main {{role of the}} 4th Armoured Brigade was {{to provide}} {{detachments}} of tanks to support infantry units. As it was not practical or necessary to deploy large armoured units in the jungle terrain common across the South West Pacific, the brigade was organised into several self-supporting regimental groups. These regimental groups could in turn provide sub-units <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> logistics support to form the armoured component of other units during combat operations. This held in practice; during combat deployments regiments from the 4th Armoured Brigade were attached to infantry divisions or brigades, and their squadrons and troops generally operated independently as part of combined arms forces.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{business}} {{routes of}} US Highway131 {{in the state}} of Michigan, and previously there was one bypass route. All of the business routes are former sections of US Highway 131 (US131). These former sections of the mainline highway, along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> connecting roads, allow traffic to access the downtowns business districts of cities bypassed by sections of US131 built since the 1950s. The extant business loops connect to Constantine, Three Rivers, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Big Rapids, Cadillac, and Manton. The former bypass route in Grand Rapids allowed traffic to bypass that city's downtown at a time when US131 still ran through the heart of the city.|$|E
5|$|Wallace's 1904 book Man's Place in the Universe was {{the first}} serious attempt by a {{biologist}} to evaluate the likelihood of life on other planets. He concluded that the Earth was the only planet {{in the solar system}} that could possibly support life, mainly {{because it was the only}} one in which water could exist in the liquid phase. More controversially he maintained that it was unlikely that other stars in the galaxy could have planets <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> properties (the existence of other galaxies not having been proved at the time).|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E

5|$|The {{sapphire}} bearing Yogo dike is a {{dark gray}} to green intrusive rock known as a lamprophyre. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of silica. The rock has a porphyritic texture with large crystals of orthopyroxene and phlogopite set in a fine grained matrix. The phlogopite crystals {{have been used to}} determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900°C (1,650°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These xenoliths include pieces of limestone, clastic sedimentary rocks, and gneiss. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone breccia in an igneous matrix. One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of spinel and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in chemical equilibrium with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth. Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich shales of the Proterozoic Belt Supergroup sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{unlikely}} expedition team ends {{up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located {{billions of}} light-years from Earth. The ship jumps to FTL shortly after the Stargate shuts down. Rush uses an Ancient communication device to contact Stargate command, taking control of Bill Lee (Bill Dow). When he returns, Rush claims that O'Neill put him {{in charge of the}} expedition, though the others are not quick to believe him. Meanwhile, the ship, having suffered millennia of wear and tear, has a failing life support system and an inadequately sealed hull breach in one of the shuttles, which can be sealed only from inside the shuttle. Senator Armstrong learns of this and, already badly injured, sacrifices his life to seal the shuttle off and buy the team time. However, the main life support is not so easily fixed. The CO2 scrubbers are decayed beyond repair, and within a day carbon dioxide poisoning will kill everyone. The Destiny, apparently aware of the problem, drops out of FTL and dials the Stargate to a desert planet <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> materials to repair the scrubbers. Four other locations are listed but locked out by the dialing computer. A 12-hour countdown begins, {{at the end of which}} the Destiny will continue on its journey automatically.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessary</b> amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E
