5|$|A {{separate}} partnership {{was formed}} between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca {{to develop the}} Adour afterburning turbofan engine. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The new engine, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.|$|E
5|$|The front entry {{leads into}} the living room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs room <b>would</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the children.

5|$|Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had {{decorated}} the blocks of ashlar in his rustication; {{by the end}} of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design. Sometimes the rustication <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|Green Bay Packers {{general manager}} Ron Wolf traded a first-round pick (19th overall, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> running back Tony Smith) for Favre after the 1991 season. Wolf, while an {{assistant}} to {{the general manager of}} the New York Jets, had intended to take Favre in the 1991 NFL Draft, but Favre was taken by the Falcons on the previous pick.|$|E
5|$|On 27 April NVA rockets hit Saigon and Cholon for {{the first}} time since the 1973 ceasefire. It was decided that from this time only C-130s <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the {{evacuation}} due to their greater maneuverability. There was relatively little difference between the cargo loads of the two aircraft, C-141s had been loaded with up to 316 evacuees while C-130s had been taking off with in excess of 240.|$|E

5|$|These {{forces were}} {{supported}} by the Ninth Air Force, which had pin-pointed 75% of the pillboxes along the frontlines and planned an opening bombardment including 360 bombers and 72 fighters; fresh aircraft <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> a second aerial wave, which included the use of napalm.

5|$|A minor Army-Air Force fight {{then broke}} out about what targets <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the Kwajalein tests. The Army favored using its Jupiter design, fired from Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, while the Air Force {{recommended}} using Atlas fired from Vandenberg AFB in California. The Army {{had already begun}} converting the former Thor launchers to Jupiter when an Ad Hoc Panel formed by the Department of Defense considered the issue. On 26 May 1960 they decided in favor of Atlas, and this was made official on 29 June when the Secretary of Defense ended pad conversion and additional Jupiter production earmarked for Zeus testing.|$|E
5|$|C. Rudhraiya, whose former {{name was}} Aarumugam, was {{introduced}} to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three shared {{an interest in the}} works of Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted to experiment with their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he wanted to change the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. K. Rajeshwar was writing a script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the film; the result was Aval Appadithan. The initial script by Rajeshwar consisted of two pages.|$|E

English <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> all legal purposes – in court proceedings, bills, laws, rules and other regulations (Article 348).

5|$|In 1919, local {{politicians}} {{proposed that the}} line be built administratively {{as part of the}} Jæren Line, but this was rejected by the government. Instead, the ministry wanted to again consider the Ålgård Line as part of the Sørlandet Line, and proposed that the Ålgård Line be built with standard gauge—which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the Sørlandet Line—instead of the narrow gauge used by the Jæren Line. However, there would be no need for standard gauge until the Sørlandet Line was extended to Rogaland, so the line was planned to be built with narrow gauge track, but all other installations would be prepared for standard gauge.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Subspecies {{became the}} first American film to be filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Director Ted Nicolaou was {{initially}} apprehensive about shooting on location in Romania, but during a four-day location scout he came to love the location thanks to the free rein he had over the ancient ruins and woodland area. Other Transylvanian areas <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> all Subspecies films, with specific location shootings at Hunedoara, Brașov, and Sinaia. Although, the remnants of communism left in the country, along with cultural differences and the general problems that accompany film productions lent to a difficult experience for the crew while shooting the first Subspecies film.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Indian {{government}} acting for the Bhutanese government, {{conducted a}} feasibility study into {{the viability of}} an international airport near the southern Bhutanese town of Gelephu. In the five-year plan (which covers 2008–2013) the sum of BTN 2,826 million had been allocated by the Bhutanese government for development of the new airport. A preliminary survey was conducted by India in May 2006 and the survey team from the Airports Authority of India was to return and complete the final survey in September 2006. In October 2008 the project was shelved, and the Bhutanese government decided that the airport at Gelephu <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> domestic flights only.|$|E
5|$|In June 1989, the {{municipal}} council voted to locate {{most of the}} Lillehammer venues in the Stampesletta area, and to place Håkons Hall adjacent to Kristins Hall. This was controversial and many councilors voted for the original decentralized plan, with the venues spread out through {{the municipal}}ity. The application for the Olympics called for building up to five ice venues in Lillehammer. For post-Olympic use, Kristins Hall was designated as the main ice rink for Lillehammer, while it was planned that Håkons Hall <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> larger events. On 8 December 1989, the International Olympic Committee rejected two demands from the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for the ability to host a minimum of 12,000 spectators in the larger ice hockey venue and for a women's ice hockey tournament.|$|E

5|$|Lee's {{original}} {{plan called for}} Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed.

5|$|Lockheed {{worked on}} modifying the AH-56 design {{to address the}} {{vibration}} and other issues. As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident. The downward firing ejection seat {{was placed in the}} forward seat in place of the gunner's station. This prototype <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> all remaining envelope expansion flights. Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 turboshaft engine output to be increased from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new canopy eliminated the canopy vibrations.|$|E
