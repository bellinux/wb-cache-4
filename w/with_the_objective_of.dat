Given that {{a large part of}} the land being titled is actually forest land, omissions <b>of,</b> and conflicts <b>with,</b> <b>the</b> <b>objectives</b> <b>of</b> sustainable forest management are critical, and may have harmful ramifications for the preservation of forest resources as well as poverty reduction within forest-dependent communities...|$|R
