40|$|Abstract: TeleCardio-FBC is a {{telemedicine}} system {{developed to}} enable cardiolo-gists at the Unit of Cardiology and Cardiovascular Surgery (UCCV/FBC) {{to cooperate with}} other physicians. The system will provide specialized medical care in cardiology for patients who live far from metropolitan areas, reducing costs and enabling better follow-up of discharged patients. The system was designed considering desktop computers as the only computa-tional platform. As a consequence, the access to the system functionalities on different computer platforms is not possible. The project TeleCardio Mobile consists {{of the development of}} two platform-in-dependent systems, M-TeleCardio and WapCardio, using an approach for reuse of software components. M-TeleCardio will allow the access to the functionalities of TeleCardio-FBC through personal digital assistants, like palmtops and laptops con-nected to the Internet by <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> <b>cards.</b> WapCardio will supply important information, for instance, remote consultation requests and results of medical proce...|$|R
40|$|Target of this Diploma Thesis is the {{development}} of a thermal simulation card to analyze the thermal behavior of a LTE PCIe Mini data card for GSM/UMTS based wireless networks in different environments. The power consumption of modern wireless communication systems has increased dramatically during the last years. Especially {{for the next generation of}} <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> <b>cards</b> the thermal dissipations will be slightly on or even beyond the official guidelines of the components and the whole card. To gain knowledge about the behavior of the data card, it shall be simulated with software as well as real hardware. As the ASIC components are not available yet, a hardware emulation shall be developed. The thesis covers the whole development process from the idea, the conception, the layout to the assembly and the measurements. It starts with finding a way of emulating the mounted components, measuring and powering. Afterwards a card, incorporating the principles found before, will be developed. An additional software simulation gives comparative values against the measurements. After assembling the emulation cards and running reference measurements, trials for temperature improvements will be ran and compared with the simulations...|$|R
50|$|Modems {{which use}} a mobile {{telephone}} system (GPRS, UMTS, HSPA, EVDO, WiMax, etc.), {{are known as}} mobile broadband modems (sometimes also called <b>wireless</b> <b>modems).</b> <b>Wireless</b> <b>modems</b> can be embedded inside a laptop or appliance, or be external to it. External <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> are connect <b>cards,</b> USB <b>modems</b> for mobile broadband and cellular routers. A connect card is a PC Card or ExpressCard which slides into a PCMCIA/PC card/ExpressCard slot on a computer. USB <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> use a USB port on the laptop instead of a PC card or ExpressCard slot. A USB modem used for mobile broadband Internet is also {{sometimes referred to as}} a dongle. A cellular router may have an external datacard (AirCard) that slides into it. Most cellular routers do allow such datacards or USB modems. Cellular routers may not be modems by definition, but they contain modems or allow modems to be slid into them. The difference between a cellular router and a <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> is that a cellular router normally allows multiple people to connect to it (since it can route data or support multi-point to multi-point connections), while a modem is designed for one connection.|$|R

5000|$|A further {{evolution}} is the 3.5G technology HSDPA, which provides speeds of multiple Megabits per second. Several of the mobile network operators that provide 3G or faster wireless internet access offer plans and <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> that enable computers {{to connect to}} and access the internet. These <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> are typically {{in the form of}} a small USB based device or a small, portable mobile hotspot that acts as a WiFi access point (hotspot) to enable multiple devices to connect to the internet. WiMAX based services that provide high speed wireless internet access are available in some countries and also rely on <b>wireless</b> <b>modems</b> that connect to the provider's wireless network. <b>Wireless</b> USB <b>Modems</b> are nicknamed as [...] "Dongles".|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a digital <b>modem</b> <b>card</b> for use within a multi-channel communications payload for a low earth orbit microsatellite.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of this study}} is determined by the rapid development in the portable computer and wireless data transmission technologies. Modern working and living environments have become abundant in radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. This article investigates the effectiveness of intervention measures to reduce laptop computer user’s exposure to the radiofrequency electromagnetic field from wireless networking. Different exposure reduction solutions using 2 G, 3 G, 4 G <b>wireless</b> network <b>modems</b> are studied. Intervention measures include: 1) selecting an area with better wireless network reception and 2) placing the network modem away from the user at different distances. The results show the greatest reduction in exposure when the <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> was placed outside the workplace, away from the line of sight. The reception quality also played a determining role in the output power of the computer’s <b>wireless</b> <b>modem.</b> Therefore, the highest exposure levels were detected while the <b>wireless</b> <b>modem</b> was closest to the user’s body and under the poorest network reception conditions...|$|R
