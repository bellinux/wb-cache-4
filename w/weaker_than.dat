5|$|During December 1965, more {{submarine}} activity occurred 0.9km (0.56mi) {{southwest of}} Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, {{and over the}} following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> the activity at the main vent, and even <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70m (230ft) in height, covering an area of , during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.|$|E

5|$|As {{an element}} with high {{electron}} density and atomic number, iodine absorbs X-rays <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> 33.3keV {{due to the}} photoelectric effect of the innermost electrons. Organoiodine compounds are used with intravenous injection as X-ray radiocontrast agents. This application is often in conjunction with advanced X-ray techniques such as angiography and CT scanning. At present, all water-soluble radiocontrast agents rely on iodine.|$|E
5|$|Critics had a mixed {{reaction}} to the episode, with many characterising it as somewhat <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> others in the series, with the change in tone dividing commentators. Some found the setting and constant noise to be distracting. The writing and production, however, were praised, with the cast being commended both for their performances and their willingness to embrace the episode's concept.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field {{to be much}} <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> that of Earth. This {{magnetic field}} is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|E

5|$|Scholars {{generally}} compare Romeo's short-lived love of Rosaline {{with his}} later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for Rosaline is much <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> that for Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with Rosaline prepares {{him for his}} relationship with Juliet. Later performances of Romeo and Juliet have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making Rosaline a more visible character.|$|E
5|$|All of the Peano axioms {{except the}} ninth axiom (the {{induction}} axiom) are statements in first-order logic. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication {{and the order}} relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The axiom of induction is in second-order, since it quantifies over predicates (equivalently, sets of natural numbers rather than natural numbers), {{but it can be}} transformed into a first-order axiom schema of induction. Such a schema includes one axiom per predicate definable in the first-order language of Peano arithmetic, making it <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> the second-order axiom.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E

5|$|Bunnies & Burrows has the {{advantage}} of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in game worlds that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a fox. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> many of the dangers they face, the game {{is one of the first}} to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.|$|E
5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses {{a potential}} safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses {{on the advice of}} Bates' book, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.|$|E
5|$|Parasite Eve II Original Soundtrack was {{released}} through DigiCube on December 18, 1999 under the catalog number SSCX-10038. The soundtrack {{was released}} in North America through Tokyopop Soundtrax. This edition was released on September 12, 2000 under the catalog number TPCD-0200-2. Due to popular demand from fans, a reprint was issued through the Square Enix label on January 26, 2011 under the catalog number SQEX-10224/5. Reception of the music was far less positive than for Parasite Eve, with reviewers generally citing Mizuta's work as <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> Shimomura's.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values {{and the quality of}} the original compositions and the performance of the orchestra. They also felt that the later tracks in the album were notably <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} defence-in-depth, according to Luttwak, was an acceptance that the Roman frontier provinces themselves {{would become the}} main combat-zone in operations against barbarian threats, rather than the barbarian lands across the border. Under this strategy, border-forces (limitanei) would not attempt to repel a large incursion. Instead, they would retreat into fortified strongholds and wait for mobile forces (comitatenses) to arrive and intercept the invaders. Border-forces would be substantially <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> under forward defence, but their reduction in numbers (and quality) would be compensated by the establishment of much stronger fortifications to protect themselves.|$|E
5|$|The third French army to see {{action on}} Belgian soil was the 9th. It was <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> both the 7th and the 1st Armies. The 9th Army was {{allocated}} infantry divisions, {{with the exception}} of the 5th Motorised Infantry Division (5e DIM). Its mission was to protect the southern flank of the Allied armies, south of the Sambre river and just north of Sedan. Further south, in France, was the French 2nd Army, protecting the Franco-Belgian border between Sedan and Montmédy. The two weakest French armies were thus protecting the area of the main German thrust.|$|E

The weaker Ippo is {{the first version of}} the character available. He wears sweats and a T-shirt rather than the boxing trunks the other characters wear. This version is based on when Ippo began boxing and was training to fight his rival, Ichiro Miyata. The weaker Takamura has less muscle mass and looks ill. He is based on a fight in the manga when Takamura overdid his weight management.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal {{in this area is}} often <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|Ancona {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Arman Brothers {{shipyard}} in Bordeaux, France on 11 August 1862, the last member of her class to begin construction. She was launched on 17 October 1864 and completed in April 1866. Two months later, in June, Italy declared war on Austria, {{as part of the}} Third Italian War of Independence, which was fought concurrently with the Austro-Prussian War. The Italian fleet commander, Admiral Carlo Pellion di Persano, initially adopted a cautious course of action; he was unwilling to risk battle with the Austrian Navy, {{despite the fact that the}} Austrian fleet was much <b>weaker</b> <b>than</b> his own. Persano claimed he was simply waiting on the ironclad ram , en route from Britain, but his inaction weakened morale in the fleet, with many of his subordinates openly accusing him of cowardice.|$|E
