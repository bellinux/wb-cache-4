Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Some of this content is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.|$|E
5|$|The 25-pounder was <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> {{the open}} {{conditions}} the Army {{experienced in the}} Mediterranean and Middle East theatres but proved difficult to deploy in jungle terrain. While the developed road network in Malaya allowed it to be moved by vehicles during the Malayan Campaign, the rugged terrain and limited transport infrastructure in New Guinea meant that the guns could only be moved away from coastal plains and airfields by manhandling. As a result, Australian infantry often had no artillery support heavier than 3 inch mortars during the New Guinea Campaign in 1942.|$|E

As such, the Amlwch line was <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> preservation as a heritage railway, or see a return of mainline services. The continued role of Llangefni as an administrative and commercial centre led British Rail and Gwynedd County Council to consider restoring passenger services between Llangefni and Bangor in the late 1980s, but the idea was turned down.|$|E
5|$|The {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{and can be}} performed with relatively inexpensive equipment, making it <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> shop jobs and field work. An operator can become reasonably proficient with a modest amount of training and can achieve mastery with experience. Weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though special electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminum, copper, and other metals.|$|E

5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} are very <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% {{of the population}} farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E
5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), the scrolls became <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{interactive}} view-dependent technique for streaming progressively encoded 3 D models over lossy networks. The 3 D model data is represented and encoded with progressive octree particles. TCP/IP protocol assures reliable transmission {{but does not}} <b>well</b> <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> real-time interactive graphics streaming over lossy networks with limited bandwidth. Though being unreliable, UDP provides faster transmission. Thus we adapt a hybrid dynamic transmission scheme which uses TCP only to transmit some minimal information needed for the basic shape structure and which transmits the appearance attributes of visible surface points with UDP. A significant reduction {{in the amount of}} data transmitted to realize a possible interactive client-server scenario is achieved for graphics streaming over a lossy network with almost no noticeable degradation in the visual quality. This is thanks to the view-dependency and loss recovery support of the proposed technique. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the interactive streaming technique and the visual quality achieved. 1...|$|R

On 25 August, the U.S. 2nd Armored Division fought its way into Elbeuf, making contact with British and Canadian armoured divisions. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division advanced into the Forêt de la Londe on the morning of 27 August. The area was strongly held; the 4th and 6th Canadian brigades suffered many casualties over the course of three days as the Germans fought a delaying action in terrain <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> defence. The Germans pulled back on 29 August, withdrawing over the Seine the next day. On the afternoon of 30 August, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division crossed the Seine near Elbeuf and entered Rouen to a jubilant welcome.|$|E
5|$|Relations between steppe nomads and the settled {{people in}} and around Central Asia were often marked by conflict. The nomadic {{lifestyle}} was <b>well</b> <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> warfare, and steppe cavalry became {{some of the most}} militarily potent forces in the world, only limited by nomads' frequent lack of internal unity. Periodically, strong leaders would organise several tribes into one force, creating an almost unstoppable power. These unified groups included the Huns, who invaded Europe, and under Attila, conducted campaigns in both eastern France and northern Italy, over 500miles apart, within two successive campaign seasons. Other unified nomadic forces included the Wu Hu attacks on China, and the Mongol conquest of much of Eurasia.|$|E
40|$|Renewable fuels like {{hydrogen}} and biodiesels can very <b>well</b> <b>suit</b> <b>to</b> diesel engine applications as they address problems of energy scarcity, foreign exchange savings and emission norms. Produc-tion of {{hydrogen and}} biodiesel to industrial scale with low cost techniques can pave way for their efficient use in engine applications. In view of this, an attempt {{has been made}} to operate a mod-ified diesel engine on these high potential renewable fuel combinations. An experimental study was carried out to evaluate the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of diesel engine operated in dual fuel (DF) mode fuelled with esters of honne (EHNO), honge (EHO) oils and hydrogen induction. The study revealed that the brake thermal efficiency increased up to 20 % hydrogen energy ratio (HER) and then it decreased. The emissions such as hydrocarbon (HC), Carbon monoxide (CO) and smoke decreased with HER while oxides of nitrogen (NOx) increased.
