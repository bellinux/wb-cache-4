5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> ran away from home at age 14.|$|E

5|$|Monitor {{likewise}} did {{not survive}} the year. She was ordered to Beaufort, North Carolina, on Christmas Day, {{to take part in}} the blockade there. While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon the water in the hold gained on the pumps, and then put out the fires in her engines. The order was given to abandon ship; most men were rescued by , but 16 went down <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sank in the early hours of December 31, 1862.|$|E

5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the blast makes Rei realize that he was human all along, and that {{everyone else in the}} town were Phiroids. After collecting some supplies, the three of them leave the town and make it to the facility where Rei originally woke up, which still has some electricity. Tipi gives Rei access to an electronic library on a tablet shortly before her battery is no longer able to function. Rei and Shiona stay in the facility for a time until Shiona eventually succumbs to the gunshot wound which had damaged her internal components. Rei puts Shiona and Tipi in cryogenic pods before leaving with the music box in an attempt to find a world where humans and Phiroids can coexist. Sometime later, Shiona wakes up in a facility with her memories wiped, but she is told that there was a music box <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was found. The environment has recovered and human civilization is once again prosperous and highly technological. Shiona is taken back to the town where humans and Phiroids once again coexist. She is reunited with Tipi, who also had her memories wiped. Prompted by the tune playing from the music box, Shiona sings the song which is now known worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Speculations {{of child}} {{pornography}} rings or organ theft were offered, leading officials to also investigate possible links to the crimes of the French serial killer Michel Fourniret. Because Kampusch had carried her passport <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> left (she {{had been on a}} family trip to Hungary a few days before), the police extended the search abroad.

25|$|Among their acquaintances was Fontenelle, the {{perpetual}} {{secretary of the}} French Académie des Sciences. Du Châtelet's father Louis-Nicolas, recognizing her early brilliance, arranged for Fontenelle to visit and talk about astronomy <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was 10 years old. Du Châtelet's mother, Gabrielle-Anne de Froulay, {{was brought up in}} a convent, at the time the predominant educational institution available to French girls and women. While some sources believe her mother did not approve of her intelligent daughter, or of her husband's encouragement of Émilie's intellectual curiosity, there are also other indications that her mother not only approved of Du Châtelet's early education, but actually encouraged her to vigorously question stated fact.|$|E
25|$|Carol covers {{herself in}} walker viscera to {{blend into the}} horde as to {{approach}} the train yard unseen.

She then finds Mary, and gets into a fight <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> refuses to tell her where Rick's group was kept. When Carol gets the upper hand, Mary pleads for her life, insisting they were good people once, but Carol, disgusted with their cannibalism, shoots at her leg and leaves her to be overwhelmed by walkers.|$|E
25|$|Amongst Wheeler's {{most famous}} finds at Stanwick were an Iron Age sword, unusually {{still in its}} well-preserved ash wood scabbard, and the nearby skull of a severed head, showing {{considerable}} damage from wounds inflicted by an axe or a sword. These were found in an excavation of a ditch terminal next {{to the location of}} the main north western gate and Wheeler believed they may have been hanging from the gate structure itself as a trophy or warning to enemies. Wheeler concluded that Stanwick had been the rebel stronghold of Venutius, who had been the husband of the pro-Roman Brigantian queen Cartimandua, after he had split <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had taken his charioteer and armour-bearer Vellocatus as a lover and betrayed the rebel leader Caractacus to the Romans. Wheeler argued that Stanwick was the location where Venutius had rallied his anti-Roman tribesmen and allies for his revolt against the Roman invaders.|$|E

25|$|Friedemann's {{students}} included Johann Nikolaus Forkel, who in 1802 {{published the}} first biography of Johann Sebastian Bach; Friedemann, {{as well as}} his younger brother Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, were major informants for Forkel. Friedemann has in earlier biographies been called a poor custodian of his father's musical manuscripts, many of which he inherited; however, more recent scholars are uncertain how many were lost. It is known that Friedemann sold some of his father's collection to raise cash to pay debts (including a large sale in 1759 to Johann Georg Nacke). Also, his daughter took some of the Sebastian Bach manuscripts <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> moved to America, and these were passed on to her descendants, who inadvertently destroyed many of them. Others were passed on through his only known Berlin pupil, Sarah Itzig Levy, great-aunt of Felix Mendelssohn. Some of his scores were collected by Carl Friedrich Christian Fasch and his pupil Carl Friedrich Zelter, the teacher of Felix Mendelssohn and through them these materials were placed in the library of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, which Fasch founded in 1791 and of which Zelter took charge in 1800.|$|E

500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child.
