5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister Khawaja Nazimuddin's house was {{stopped in front of}} the Dhaka High Court. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including A. K. Fazlul Huq. Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff {{is often}} {{recognized}} {{at the annual}} awards ceremony at the Helen Hayes Youth Theatre in Nyack, ceremonies which are held in early June with awards in numerous categories, modeled after the Tony Award. Their 2002 performance of Children of Eden earned ten nominations and three awards, for overall production, actor in a lead role, and director. The school spent $23,000 on the production to pay for royalties, stipends for teachers acting as choreographers, musical directors and rehearsal accompanists, and for external workers to help students improve the production's lighting, sets and sound. For their 2003 production of Footloose, the school's musical director Kathleen Donovan-Warren rented multicolored stage lighting and hired an electric guitarist as one of three professional musicians who played along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> orchestra. There was a tradition in the musicals for the superintendent to have a cameo in the show, up until around 1999.|$|E

25|$|In response, outraged Zonians began {{flying the}} U.S. flag {{anywhere}} they could. After the first U.S. flag {{to be raised}} at Balboa High School (a public {{high school in the}} Canal Zone) was taken down by school officials, the students walked out of class, raised another flag, and posted guards to prevent its removal. Most Zonian adults sympathized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> demonstrators.|$|E

25|$|Corker {{served as}} mayor of Chattanooga from 2001–05. While in office he {{implemented}} a merit-based bonus system for teachers. The system, established in 2002, awards teachers and principals bonuses for improving student performance at Chattanooga's lowest performing schools. Two years after its implementation, {{a study published in}} The Tennessean showed that the percentage of third graders reading at or above grade level had increased from 53% to 74%. However, a report by the think tank Education Sector suggested that specific teacher training had at least as much to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> improvement.|$|E

Education by a tutor was to be done at the pace of the student.He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student,</b> letting the student speak first. The tutor should also allow for discussions and debates to be had. Through this dialogue, it was meant to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of centers offer research and academic fellowships through which fellows {{can engage in}} research projects, lead study groups into specific topics and share their experiences with industry and government <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> body. Under Dean Elmendorf, the school has tried to focus its engagement across the political spectrum. This has not been without controversy. Recently, the school came under criticism for offering a fellowship to Chelsea Manning on 13 September 2017. It then publicly rescinded the offer on 15 September 2017 after CIA Director Mike Pompeo, canceled his speaking appointment and sent a letter condemning Harvard for awarding the fellowship.|$|E

Nationalist leader Don Pedro Albizu Campos was invited to speak by the student council, however the chancellor of the university, Jaime Rexach Benítez, did not permit Albizu access to the campus. The students consequently went on strike, with Rodriguez-Trias amongst them, but her brother did not approve of this. He threatened to cut off her college expenses and she returned to New York.|$|E

25|$|Irish Setters {{are also}} widely used as therapy dogs {{in schools and}} hospitals.

This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked to sit with children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student {{the ability to read}} without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will lie on the floor <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.|$|E

The Arizona State Sun Devils {{are members of the}} Pac-12 Conference and have won 24 NCAA championships. Along with multiple athletic clubs and recreational facilities, ASU is home to more than 1,100 registered student organizations, reflecting the student body's diversity. To keep pace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> population's growth, the university continuously renovates and expands infrastructure. The demand for new academic halls, athletic facilities, student recreation centers, and residential halls is being addressed with donor contributions and public-private investments.|$|E
25|$|The Orange Bowl {{was also}} {{the site of the}} NCAA's longest college {{football}} home field winning streak. Between 1985 and 1994, the Miami Hurricanes won 58 straight home games at the Bowl, until ended by the Washington Huskies. The stadium's home field advantage used to include a steel structure that fans would set to rumbling by stomping their feet. Concrete reinforcement had silenced the rumble. There was still the advantage of the West End Zone, which had a relatively narrow radius that amplified fan noise. The West End Zone was a factor in the Wide Right curse, in which the Florida State Seminoles lost a series of close games due to missed field goals. This section was so raucous that some football announcers often confused it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> section.|$|E
