5|$|An ageing West Indian team relied {{increasingly}} on Ambrose and Walsh {{to provide}} wickets, while Lara <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{the primary source}} of runs. Angus Fraser played an important role for England, and when his form dipped in the later Tests the side's performance suffered.|$|E
5|$|Arthur, who {{was looking}} to retain the BBBofC Lonsdale Belt, <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a rising star in British boxing. He was a strong {{favourite}} to win the bout against Gomez, who was perceived to have been through too many battles and abused his body too much, and the fight <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a stepping stone on Arthur's way to a future world championship. However, Freddie Roach, Arthur's trainer, was criticised when he remained in the United States to coach another boxer instead of continuing to work with Arthur to prepare for his championship match.|$|E

5|$|Doudna also {{proposes that}} Hyrcanus II <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the Teacher of Righteousness. According to Doudna, Hyrcanus II’s sectarian {{orientation}} is now generally understood {{to have been}} Sadducee; whereas Antigonus was more sympathetic towards the Pharisees.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, Constantinople {{suffered}} a massive fire, which destroyed houses, churches, and completely incinerated the huge library built by Emperor Julian. The fire <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a bad omen {{for the rule}} of Basiliscus.|$|E

5|$|First World {{commentators}} {{had already}} speculated that Brezhnev had {{died when he}} failed to sign a message of congratulations to José Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen by some First World commentators as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his father, who was perceived as having troubles with an overarching unifying theme, Bush embraced larger visions and <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a man of larger ideas and associated huge risks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{the city of}} Bellevue began {{studying}} a possible civic center with a new city hall, courthouses, a jail, a museum and a basketball arena for the Seattle SuperSonics. The civic center plan was scaled back to a single convention center in downtown Bellevue, Meydenbauer Center, and a new downtown library, both of which opened in 1993; the plan for a city hall <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> controversial and unnecessary at the time. In 1990, the city hall area was proposed {{as the site of}} a county jail and courthouse to serve the Eastside. The proposed site, located north of city hall, <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> undesirable because of its existing wetlands and was rejected in favor of a site near Overlake Hospital Medical Center.|$|E
5000|$|Faith as contradicting rationality: In this view, faith <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{those views}} that one holds despite {{evidence}} and reason to the contrary. Accordingly, faith <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> pernicious {{with respect to}} rationality, as it interferes with our ability to think, and inversely rationality <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the enemy of faith by interfering with our beliefs.|$|R
5000|$|In Tamil, {{the word}} vel means spear that <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the weapon of Hindu god Murugan and oor means place. As per Hindu legend, Murugan <b>is</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a tribal hunter who {{appeared}} in a lotus pond with his weapon to attack the enemies.

5|$|Malcolm was {{accompanied}} by Edward, his eldest son by Margaret and probable heir-designate (or tánaiste), and by Edgar. Even {{by the standards of}} the time, the ravaging of Northumbria by the Scots <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> harsh.|$|E
50|$|The crossed square cupola may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{a part of}} some uniform polyhedra. For example, {{the great}} cubicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> six crossed square cupolae {{connected}} at their triangular faces, while the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a blend of six cupolae. Additionally, the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagrammic prism with the octagrams excavated with crossed square cupolae, similarly to how the rhombicuboctahedron may <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an octagonal prism with the octagons augmented with square cupolae. Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron. To this may be added the great rhombihexahedron, as the exclusive or of {{all three of these}} octagrammic prisms which may be used to construct the nonconvex great rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R
40|$|When {{modelling}} a domain, it {{is often}} the case that certain individuals are represented as belonging to multiple categories, generating therefore "tangled" hierarchies: 1. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an amount of matter 2. A hole can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a region of space 3. A building can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a place 4. A biological organ can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an aggregate of molecules 5. An association can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a group of people 6. A physical object can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a temporal process This phenomenon is quite common: the examples above have been taken from existing toplevel ontologies used in practice, and they are responsible, in our opinion, of many situations of tangleness, confusion, and lack of semantic rigour. We advocate in the present paper a design principle aimed to clarify such situations and produce more reusable and well-founded ontologies. It can be stated as follows: Ontological Distinction Principle: Classes corresponding to different ident...|$|R

5|$|On 7 September 1944, {{with the}} war going badly for the Japanese, Prime Minister Koiso promised {{independence}} for Indonesia, but no date was set. For supporters of Sukarno, this announcement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> vindication for his collaboration with the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} Rose Polytechnic <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> {{the first real}} test of the season.

5|$|The ruling <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a {{significant}} {{victory for the}} video game industry.

5|$|A row {{of fifty}} Norway spruce trees lines the main {{driveway}} {{leading to the}} farm. These trees represent the fifty U.S. states, and were given to Eisenhower as birthday presents {{from each of the}} state Republican Party chairmen in 1955. The furthest one from the house was the tree representing Texas, and it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a mark of Eisenhower's recovery {{that he was able to}} walk that far after his heart attack.|$|E
5|$|According to 20th Century Fox accounts, however, by April 1980 {{when the}} film had earned a {{reported}} $100million at the box office, after advertising, distribution fees, penalties and other costs were deducted, it was still recorded as having 'lost' $2.4million. This <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> an example of Hollywood creative accounting and was much criticised. However, by August, Fox had started saying the film made $4 million in profit.|$|E
5|$|After its {{victory in}} the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), the British Empire was deeply in debt. Looking for new sources of revenue, the British Parliament sought, for the first time, to {{directly}} tax the colonies, beginning with the Sugar Act of 1764. The earlier Molasses Act of 1733, a tax on shipments from the West Indies, had produced hardly any revenue because it was widely bypassed by smuggling, which <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a victimless crime.|$|E
