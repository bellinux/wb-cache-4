5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower scape and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be proven that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapeutic {{drugs have}} a hard time {{penetrating}} tumors to kill them at their core because these cells may lack a good blood supply. Researchers have been using anaerobic bacteria, such as Clostridium novyi, to consume the interior of oxygen-poor tumours. These should then die <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with the tumor's oxygenated sides, meaning they would be harmless {{to the rest of the}} body. A major problem has been that bacteria do not consume all parts of the malignant tissue. However, combining the therapy with chemotheraputic treatments can help to solve this problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} YAN needed {{will depend on}} what the winemaker's goals are for fermentation, {{particularly}} whether or not wild fermentation is desired or if the wine will be fully fermented to dryness. The state of the grapes and the conditions of fermentation will influence the amount of nitrogen needed. Fruit that is damaged, moldy or botrytis infected will usually be more depleted of nitrogen (as well as other vitamin resources) <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> from the vineyard than clean, intact grapes. This depletion can be further exacerbated by over clarification of the must and high sugar content. Wines fermented at higher temperatures tend to progress at a faster rate, requiring more nitrogen than longer, cooler fermentation. Also the amount of oxygen exposure will influence the rate of nitrogen uptake by the yeast with wine fermented in complete anaerobic conditions (such as many white wines in stainless steel tanks) requiring less nitrogen than wines fermented in barrels or open top fermentors.|$|E

I've done guest roles on other shows, but rarely have I felt such a warm bond." [...] About working with Kingston, Catherine Tate said, [...] "I'm a huge ER fan. When you hold people in awe, it's almost a disappointment <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> and they're utterly normal. But Alex isn't disappointing at all. She's such a lovely person." [...] David Tennant {{was quoted as}} saying, [...] "Alex is terrific. When she's telling you stories about hanging out with George Clooney, you know she's pretty cool." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most flares, {{like the}} MJU-27A/B flares, {{must be kept}} in an {{airtight}} storage compartment before deployment. These flares, known as pyrophoric flares, are made of special materials that ignite <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with the air. This is a safety and convenience factor, since attempting to ignite a flare inside [...] the fuselage and then deploying it is risky. However pyrotechnic flares (such as the MJU-32) also exist, and offer their own safety benefit; requiring an external ignition method, an accidental leak or puncture in the storage compartment would not result in a catastrophic fire on board the aircraft as with a pyrophoric flare.|$|E
2500|$|Westbrook's {{struggle}} with cocaine addiction {{has been widely}} documented in the British press and media. She has confessed that she first tried the drug {{at the age of}} 14, in a nightclub. After winning her role in EastEnders at the age of 16, Westbrook was a regular on the London club scene, and her cocaine usage escalated. She has commented [...] "I was always in clubs and everyone was doing coke and it was glamorous – except obviously, it wasn't at all. I was just very young, very stupid and very easily led...I think there should be someone at EastEnders to say to young people <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> 'Look, your life is about to change, you're going to be invited to things, and you'll be offered drugs.' Someone who can tell them what sort of people are about, and what sort of papers, and how quickly what you've worked for all those years can be gone." [...] It is estimated that she has spent over £250,000 on drugs, used 5g of cocaine every single day throughout her first pregnancy, and has admitted that during her lowest ebb she attempted suicide several times.|$|E
