5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, <b>Where</b> <b>can</b> we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

The Americans handed Cần over to the junta, and he was executed in 1964.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara cited [...] as an {{instance}} of where the Torah alludes to life after death. The Gemara related that sectarians asked Rabban Gamaliel where Scripture says that God will resurrect the dead. Rabban Gamaliel answered them from the Torah, the Prophets ( [...] , Nevi'im), and the Writings ( [...] , Ketuvim), yet the sectarians did not accept his proofs. From the Torah, Rabban Gamaliel cited [...] "And the Lord said to Moses, ‘Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers and rise up [...]'" [...] But the sectarians replied that perhaps [...] reads, [...] "and the people will rise up." [...] From the Prophets, Rabban Gamaliel cited [...] "Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out its dead." [...] But the sectarians rejoined that perhaps [...] refers to the dead whom Ezekiel resurrected in [...] From the Writings, Rabban Gamaliel cited Song of Songs [...] "And the roof of your mouth, like the best wine of my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips {{of those who are}} asleep to speak." [...] (As the Rabbis interpreted Song of Songs as a dialogue between God and Israel, they understood [...] to refer to the dead, whom God will cause to speak again.) But the sectarians rejoined that perhaps [...] means merely that the lips of the departed will move. For Rabbi Johanan said that if a halachah (legal ruling) is said in any person's name in this world, the person's lips speak in the grave, as [...] says, [...] "causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak." [...] Thus Rabban Gamaliel did not satisfy the sectarians until he quoted [...] "which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them." [...] Rabban Gamaliel noted that God swore to give the land not [...] "to you" [...] (the Israelites whom Moses addressed) but [...] "to them" [...] (the Patriarchs, who had long since died). Others say that Rabban Gamaliel proved it from [...] "But you who did cleave to the Lord your God are alive every one of you this day." [...] And (the superfluous use of [...] "this day" [...] implies that) just as you are all alive today, so shall you all live again in the world to come. Similarly, the Romans asked Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah from <b>where</b> <b>can</b> one prove that God will resurrect the dead and knows the future. Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah replied that both are deduced from [...] "And the Lord said to Moses, ‘Behold you shall sleep with your fathers, and rise up again; and this people shall go a whoring [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] The Romans replied that perhaps [...] means that the Israelites [...] "will rise up, and go a whoring." [...] Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah replied that if so, at least the Romans conceded that [...] indicates that God knows the future.
