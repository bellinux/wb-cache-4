5000|$|The {{relationship}} between Kricfalusi and Nickelodeon deteriorated {{to the point}} where Kricfalusi would communicate with Nickelodeon only through his lawyer. Several of the series's staff and news outlets ascribe the tension to episodes not being delivered in a timely manner. Author Andy Mangels, writing for Wizard magazine, commented that [...] "Kricfalusi's lax treatment of deadlines pissed off not only the networks, but his loyal viewers as well." [...] However, some of the delays were attributed to Nickelodeon's prolonged approval process and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> from scenes and episodes that had been previously approved. Another point of contention was the direction of the series. Nickelodeon later asked the new studio to make it lighter and less frightening. Kricfalusi cites the episode [...] "Man's Best Friend" [...] as the primary reason for his dismissal; the episode features a violent climax where Ren brutally assaults the character George Liquor with an oar aswell as jokes involving fecal matter.|$|E

40|$|After the {{elections}} in 1994, the Republican party cited their newly gained power over the Senate and the House of Representatives as a call by Americans for smaller government, deregulation, and a return of power to the states. Political leaders {{from both sides of}} the aisle responded in kind, albeit with varying degrees of deference to existing federal based power. In step with this federalist mandate, in late February and early March of 1995, President Bill Clinton announced the Regulatory Reinvention Initiative, to reform the federal regulatory system. Fishery management has become a proving ground of this regulatory reform and the call for return of power to the states. In 1996 the Atlantic lobster fishery became the target of this emerging federalism. Lobster fishery management, it is contended, is a prime example of a federal regulatory scheme that is better suited to state management. As a result, in late March 1996, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) an- nounced its intention to withdraw approval of the federal Fishery Management Plan for the American Lobster Fishery (Lobster FMP) and implementing regulations. Conservation and management of the lobster fishery, proposed the NMFS, could be managed by the states through the Atlantic States Marine Fishery Commission (ASMFC). The NMFS called upon the ASMFC to further develop its lobster coastal management plan (CMP) and to develop regulations under the authority of the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act (ACFCMA). NMFS cited the President 2 ̆ 7 s Regulatory Reinvention Initiative as a reason for its <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of the existing Lobster FMP. NMFS also determined that withdrawal of the Lobster FMP would not compromise the identified resource management and conservation objectives for the fishery. NMFS further supported its action by asserting that withdrawal of the Lobster FMP appeared necessary due to increasing concerns regarding whether the FMP was consistent with Magnuson Act national standards. As a final reason for its action, NMFS expressed its intention that federal management of the American lobster fishery be consistent with state lobster management programs. Despite being heralded as a shift to state management, a detailed analysis of the management scheme provided under the ACFCMA shows that while authority for development of the lobster plan lies with the states, via the ASMFC, there remains a significant role for the federal government acting through the Secretary of Commerce. In fact, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>approval</b> of the Lobster FMP and its implementing regulations presents opportunities for state and federal cooperation in management of the lobster fishery. The ACFCMA presents novel management opportunities by reducing constraints on the exercise of state jurisdiction over federal waters, as well as by providing the NMFS with greater authority to affect state activities within state waters. Indeed, it is this 2 ̆ 2 blurring 2 ̆ 2 of jurisdictional boundaries that has provided the opportunity at hand. The ability of ASMFC to utilize the enhanced cooperative and jurisdictional authority of state and federal agencies in the management of the lobster fishery may serve as a model for future management of other fisheries. The ASMFC plan will test the willingness of the federal government to serve merely as a conduit for state management measures without overstepping its apparently enlarged authority within state waters. The states, for their part, must exercise sound judgment in the development of an appropriate lobster management regime. Moreover, the states must prove their ability to reach consensus on an ASMFC plan. In order to achieve the goals of the new regulatory regime, the federal government, acting in large part through the NMFS, must conform its regulations and enforcement actions to the ASMFC plan while not arbitrarily exercising such power in a fashion that violates state sovereignty. If successful, their management approach may serve as a model for future fishery management efforts. The purposes of this Comment are three-fold. Part II of this Comment will explore the legislative enactments that have provided the basis for cooperative jurisdiction in fishery management. Part II. A discusses how state and federal authority as originally codified in the Magnuson Act was sharply delineated, and how that delineation gradually gave way to the cooperative management approach embodied in the ACFCMA. The 1996 Amendments to the Magnuson Act, while not directly implicated in the lobster scenario, further compliment the shift towards cooperative jurisdiction, as detailed in Part II. B. Part II. C will closely examine the ACFCMA, the foundation for future lobster fishery management, from the creation of the ASMFC to the Act 2 ̆ 7 s specific provisions for state and federal cooperation in fishery management. The second purpose of this Comment is to review the history of lobster fishery management, from the roots of the Magnuson Act FMP through the decision to withdraw it. Part III. A will outline the basic approach to fishery management under the Magnuson Act before turning to the particulars of the federal lobster fishery management plan under Part III. B. Part III. C will discuss the ultimate failure of Amendment Five to the Lobster FMP which was in large part the impetus for the decision to withdraw the plan, as detailed in Part III. D. The final purpose of this Comment is to raise questions concerning potential conflicts that may arise in the transition of lobster fishery management to the ASMFC. Part IV considers two specific obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve the desired level of state and federal cooperation in fishery management. The effects of these obstacles will be weighed and likely resolutions will be suggested; but most important will be the identification of issues the resolution of which will determine the future success of the plan...|$|E

40|$|Background and problem: It is pivotal {{to provide}} {{competent}} auditors for {{the trade and}} industry {{as well as to}} supervise and assure the quality of the audit profession. The Swedish Supervisory Board of Public Accountants (SSBPA), a governmental authority, was in 1995 assigned the mission to both provide approved and authorized auditors in Sweden and to supervise these. The board has the authority to issue reminders and warnings or withdraw the licenses of auditors if necessary. However, studies reveal that only withdrawal has a major effect on the auditor. To thoroughly explore the frequency <b>of</b> these <b>withdrawals</b> and the reasons for them would therefore be of considerable interest. Aim: The aim of this master thesis is to examine the SSBPA’s investigation of auditors, to be able to identify what areas within auditing that are critical for the auditor when performing an audit. Furthermore, the aim is also to analyze the disciplinary cases resulting in the SSBPA withdrawing the license of the auditor, in order to describe the types of failures that are reported most frequently as well as what types of failures that solely lead to withdrawal. Method: This study was conducted by reviewing 77 disciplinary cases issued by the SSBPA resulting in <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> authorization or <b>approval</b> during 1995 - 2010. The audit failures found in these cases were sorted into categories representing different areas within the audit process and the professional conduct of the auditor. Thereafter, the empirical result was analyzed based on previous studies and the frame of reference. Results and conclusions: The most frequent type of failure in the 77 disciplinary cases was by far failures regarding Error of judgment or execution when performing the audit. However, the fact that a failure is frequently reported does not mean that it is the most likely cause <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> This study revealed two additional areas as critical, in terms of solely leading to <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> license. These areas consisted of Failure to cooperate with the SSBPA’s investigation etc. and Unprofessional conduct. Future studies: An interesting point of view would be to thoroughly compare disciplinary cases resulting in withdrawals with cases resulting in warnings, {{in order to determine the}} differences in content between these two sanctions. Furthermore, a comparison between sanctions issued by the SSBPA and sanctions issued by similar supervisory authorities abroad may also be of value as it would provide further information regarding supervision and auditing on an international level...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have shown {{an effect of}} nCPAP-therapy in lowering bloodpressure in patients with OSA and hypertension. Various reasons lead to interruption of nCPAP-therapy in everyday conditions. Until today the effects on bloodpressure and heartrate variability <b>of</b> such <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was unclear. In a study on 18 patients with OSA and hypertension, treated over several months to years with nCPAP-therapy, we investigated {{the influence of a}} 7 to 10 days <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy on bloodpressure and heartrate. We investigated data of 12 patients. As a methode of measuring bloodpressure and heartrate variability we used ambulatory- 24 h-bloodpressure-monitoring (ABDM). Effects <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was documented by repeated polysomnography. We focused on comparing the mean bloodpressure in 24 hours before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy and after restarting nCPAP-therapy. We seperately compared bloodpressure during the day and at night. Patients were used as their own controls, so we could compare the results before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy caused an immediate onset of sleeapnoea. Ceasing of therapy produced a significant rise in systolic 24 -h-bloodpressure of 4 mmHg and a significant rise in diastolic 24 -h-pressure of 2 respective 3 mmHg. The rise in bloodpressure was considerered as clinically not relevant. The variability of bloodpressure {{can be used as a}} hint for the close association of OSA and regulation of bloodpressure. Change of heartrate was only significant during the day on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy but frequency was always below 100 /min [...] Therefore the risk for patients through extensive rising in heartrate is considered low. These results led us to the assumption that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy of 7 to 10 days in patients with OSA and arterial hypertension causes a certain rise in bloodpressure which probably is not clinically relevant. This means that the risk of a cardiovascular event caused by a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy is low...|$|R
40|$|Background - The process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} in Critical Care environments has created ethical and moral dilemmas {{in relation to}} {{end of life care}} in the UK and elsewhere. Common within this discourse is the differing demands made on health professionals as they strive to provide care for the dying patient and family members. Despite reports that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment is a source of tension between those nurses and doctors involved in the process, the role of the nurse in facilitating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment has received relatively little attention. Objectives – To illustrate how differing dying trajectories impact on decision-making underpinning <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment processes, and what nurses do to shape <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Design - Qualitative methods of enquiry using clinical vignettes and applying Charmaz’s grounded theory method. Methods and settings - Single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with thirteen critical care nurses from four Intensive Care specialities: Cardiac; General; Neurological and Renal were carried out. Interviews were facilitated by an end-of-life vignette developed with clinical collaborators. Findings – Across critical care areas four key dying trajectories were identified. These trajectories were shaped by contested boundaries associated with delayed or stalled decision-making around how <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should proceed. Nurses provided end of life care (including collaborative and action-oriented skills) to shape the dying trajectory of patients so as to satisfy the wishes of the patient and family, and their own professional aims. Conclusions - Differing views as to when <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should commence and how it should be operationalised appeared to be underpinned by the requirements of the role that health professionals fulfil, with doctors focusing on making <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment decisions, and nurse’s being tasked with operationalising the processes that constitute it. Multidisciplinary teams need a ‘shared’ understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, aims, and motivations when planning and implementing the dying trajectory <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. <br/...|$|R
