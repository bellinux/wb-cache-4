500|$|Karl Bohnak, an Upper Peninsula meteorologist, {{covered the}} sinking and storm {{in a book}} on local weather history. In this book, Joe Warren, a {{deckhand}} on Anderson during the November 10, 1975, storm, said that the storm changed {{the way things were}} done. He stated, [...] "After that, trust me, when a gale came up <b>we</b> <b>dropped</b> the hook [...] <b>We</b> <b>dropped</b> the hook because they found out the big ones could sink." [...] Mark Thompson wrote, [...] "Since the loss of the Fitz, some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as 'heavy weather sailors.'" ...|$|E
500|$|ILM filmed starships using {{motion control}} for timed and {{computer-assisted}} model movement. The ship models required multiple camera passes because {{different parts of}} the ship and its lights were filmed at different exposure levels. The Excelsior required eight passes to supplement the main [...] "beauty pass", the Enterprise six. ILM could have combined passes with multiple exposures, but not without risk; [...] "If anything got out of synch, or somehow <b>we</b> <b>dropped</b> a frame, we would have to reshoot—and then you're stuck. You've ruined two pieces, two elements," [...] Farrar said.|$|E

[...] Agnew later recalled, [...] "After <b>we</b> <b>dropped</b> our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right {{so that we would}} not get caught in the blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it." [...] He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} playing the second half against Wimbledon with ten men after the {{dismissal}} of Luzhny, Arsenal defeated their London rivals by three goals to one. Before the game away to Leeds United on 16 April 2000, both clubs observed a minute's silence to honour the two Leeds fans who were murdered in Istanbul. Wenger and his players then presented bouquets of flowers to their counterparts. Arsenal went ahead in the 21st minute – Henry beat defender Jonathan Woodgate for pace and scored his 20th goal of the season. Further goals by Keown, Kanu and Overmars resulted in a 4–0 win and lifted Arsenal above Leeds into third, with a better goal difference. Arsenal beat Watford and continued their strong finish to {{the season with a}} 1–0 win at Everton to move into second place. Wenger believed Manchester United, who retained their status as champions in April, had benefited from the league being [...] "organised" [...] in their favour: [...] "They had a winter break. They didn't play in the FA Cup. It was all wrong from the start. The break was good for them because at the same time <b>we</b> <b>dropped</b> points and so did the other teams. So when they came back they had the psychological advantage." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} named the group Melvins as an {{influence}} on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group King Crimson. Longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating [...] "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that <b>we</b> <b>dropped.</b> And it's {{almost exactly the same}} figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." [...] He also said, [...] "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been {{an influence on}} them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool." [...] In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are [...] "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols". Other reported influences of the band include Rush, Helmet, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction.|$|E

500|$|Craig's tour started poorly, {{and food}} {{poisoning}} hampered him {{until after the}} Second Test—one particular severe bout forced him to be hospitalised. In his first six first-class matches, Craig made only 104 runs at 17.33. His tour began to improve in late June, when he made consecutive half-centuries against Yorkshire and Gloucestershire before breaking through in a match against Somerset. He was dropped before going on to score 62 and 100 not out—his first century in 38innings in England. He was selected for the Fourth Test at Old Trafford, after Australia had suffered a heavy defeat at Headingley in the Third Test {{at the hands of}} the Surrey spin pairing of Jim Laker and Tony Lock, Australia's first innings defeat in 18years. The Fourth Test was to be known as Laker's Test, in which Laker took a record 19wickets in the match. Laker trapped Craig leg before wicket for eight in the first innings as Australia were bowled out for 84. In the second innings, Craig came out to bat at 1/28 in the second innings on a sticky wicket and combined in a defiant third-wicket partnership of 59 with Colin McDonald. He battled for over four hours in compiling 38 before being dismissed by Laker. Reflecting on the match, Craig said [...] "Jim bowled well, and we batted very badly. We were all pissed off, felt we'd been dudded and <b>we</b> <b>dropped</b> our bundle a bit." [...] His stubborn display saw him retain his position for the Fifth Test at The Oval when he scored two and seven. Craig ended the season with 872 runs at 36.33 from 20 matches, with one century and five fifties, the fifth highest aggregate for the Australians.|$|E

[...] PTV cancelled his contract stating that [...] "We are a national network and we have certain codes of conduct on what can and cannot be said on air.
