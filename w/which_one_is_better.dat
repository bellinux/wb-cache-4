50|$|Partial-order {{planning}} {{is the opposite}} of total-order planning, in which actions are sequenced all at once and for the entirety of the task at hand. The question arises when one has two competing processes, <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>better?</b> Anthony Barret and Daniel Weld have argued in their 1993 book, that partial-order {{planning is}} superior to total-order planning, as it is faster and thus more efficient. They tested this theory using Korf’s taxonomy of subgoal collections, in which they found that partial-order planning performs better because it produces more trivial serializability than total-order planning. Trivial serializability facilitates a planner’s ability to perform quickly when dealing with goals that contain subgoals. Planners perform more slowly when dealing with laboriously serializable or nonserializable subgoals. The determining factor that makes a subgoal trivially or laboriously serializable is the search space of different plans. They found that partial-order planning is more adept at finding the quickest path, and is therefore the more efficient of these two main types of planning.|$|E
50|$|Nozick {{arrives at}} the night-watchman state of {{classical}} liberalism theory by showing that there are non-redistributive reasons for the apparently redistributive procedure of making its clients pay {{for the protection of}} others. He defines what he calls an ultraminimal state, which would not have this seemingly redistributive feature but would be the only one allowed to enforce rights. Proponents of this ultraminimal state don't defend it on the grounds of trying to minimize the total of (weighted) violations of rights (what he calls utilitarianism of rights). That idea would mean, for example, that someone could punish another person he or she knows to be innocent in order to calm down a mob that would otherwise violate even more rights. This is not the philosophy behind the ultraminimal state. Instead, its proponents hold its members' rights are a side-constraint on {{what can be done to}} them. This side-constraint view reflects the underlying Kantian principle that individuals are ends and not merely means, so the rights of one individual cannot be violated to avoid violations of the rights of other people. Which principle should we choose, then? Nozick won't try to prove <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>better.</b> Instead, he gives some reasons to prefer the kantian view and later points to problems with classic utilitarianism.|$|E
