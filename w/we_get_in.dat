To address these concerns, A Risk Assessment Study of potential health risks of recycled water and comparisons to conventional Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Product (PPCP) exposures was conducted by the WateReuse Research Foundation. For each of four scenarios in which people {{come into contact with}} recycled water used for irrigation - children on the playground, golfers, and landscape, and agricultural workers - the findings from the study indicate that it could take anywhere from a few years to millions of years of exposure to nonpotable recycled water to reach the same exposure to PPCPs that <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> a single day through routine activities.|$|E
25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be illustrated}} as an urn model with bias. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that}} the odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking n balls, one by one, {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball at a particular draw is equal to its proportion of the total weight of all balls that lie in the urn at that moment. The number of red balls x1 that <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> this experiment is a random variable with Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution.|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP), an , Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, {{to show how}} the questions we choose to ask about the universe may dictate the answers <b>we</b> <b>get.</b> <b>In</b> this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler's theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade and American record {{producer}} Jude Cole. It was recorded and produced by John Alagía at his home studio in Easton, Maryland. In an interview with MTV, Wade explained his experience working with Alagía, and said, [...] "When we walked into John's house, we didn't know what to expect, and <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> there and the mixing board is in the living room, the B3 [...] is {{in the kitchen and}} the piano is over there.

[...] "You and Me" [...] was first released via digital download on January 28, 2005. It was then solicited to mainstream radio on March 15, 2005. An extended wedding version of the song was released on July 26, 2005.|$|E
500|$|A finger injury {{suffered}} {{during the}} 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs hampered Oates throughout 1994–95 and required {{surgery at the}} season's conclusion. Despite the injury, Oates finished fourth in the NHL with 41 assists in a season disrupted by a work stoppage. The Bruins signed him to a five-year, $10 million contract extension late in that season, but Oates once again became frustrated with his salary relative {{to the rest of}} the league by 1997. [...] With the Bruins struggling on the ice and out of playoff contention late in 1996–97 season, Oates publicly berated team management: [...] "You go on a [...] trip and everyone says it's a big trip. For what? So we can win five games because we're lousy and <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the eighth spot and lose four straight and get embarrassed and then get shelled all summer?

[...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because I feel that the more Islam that <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican. Eastwood further {{explained}} his anti-war stance by saying [...] "I was {{a child growing up}} during World War II. That {{was supposed to be the}} one to end all wars. And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. It needs a better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E

500|$|Srimanthudu {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Srimanthudu a [...] "star-driven film {{with a strong}} plot that's worth a watch". Dundoo further stated, [...] "This isn't Ashutosh Gowariker Swades, where Shah Rukh Khan finds his true calling {{in a much more}} realistic manner. The social consciousness comes coated with commercially viable ingredients and still, makes for an engaging watch". Sify called Srimanthudu a [...] "right mix of Mahesh's emotional and class performance, Shruthi's charisma, fine storyline and all materials that are needed for a good entertainer". The reviewer appreciated Siva for not writing a separate comedy track to distract from the story. Karthik Pasupulate of The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "You could say this movie is Mahesh Babu's Swades (the 2004 SRK film) albeit a little dumbed down. Or a Mirchi (the Prabhas film) rehashed. Yet there can be no denying that Srimanthudu achieves more than any big ticket Tollywood potboiler has in more in that last decade , {{for the simple reason that}} it is a drama made like one." [...] Sethumadhavan N of the Bangalore Mirror rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Make no mistake, Srimanthudu is certainly a big commercial entertainer and has most of the elements needed for the same. But to deliver a total commercial which doesn't have a great plot and yet remaining engaging all the way isn't easy at all. That is where the writing by Siva emerges triumphant." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Though there are a few hiccups, Srimanthudu is a good emotional drama with excellent performance by Mahesh Babu, supported by good content with neat dialogues". Hemanth Kumar C.R. of Outlook India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and stated, [...] "In an industry where weaving a story to suit the image of an A-list star is common, Mahesh Babu's latest, Srimanthudu, takes a different course. The film might lack a big-starrer firepower, but by letting go of such conventions, what <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the end is a sensible film full of heart and humanity." [...] IndiaGlitz rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and called Srimanthudu a [...] "family entertainer with mass appeal, thanks to Mahesh's understated acting" [...] and added, [...] "Koratala Shiva doesn't really unleash a Mirchi-fied Mahesh Babu even in the second half. All throughout, the billionaire Srimanthudu maintains his composure even when he has to turn into a 'hanthakudu'. Things are so understated that the fight-to-finish itself looks half-done." ...|$|E
