30|$|The <b>wireless</b> <b>bridges</b> were {{installed}} throughout {{the building in}} the ceilings and localized in clusters where possible to better facilitate maintenance and troubleshooting concerns (see Figure 4 (b)). In total, 19 <b>wireless</b> <b>bridges</b> are used to provide connectivity for the 37 cameras. Though the bridges have 4 inputs, we only use 2; we do not {{take full advantage of}} the bridges' connectivity capabilities for a reason. We originally planned to optimistically use 3 cameras per bridge, but found 2 cameras (streaming simultaneously with maximum video settings) was the limit each bridge could support without experiencing heavy frame loss. The bridges are configured to communicate with the routers using WPA-PSK encryption.|$|R
50|$|The WGR614L is {{designed}} to be used in home or business environments. It is often used in connection with third-party firmware and solutions, such as SputnikNet and Titan Hotspots. The router can also be used as a <b>wireless</b> client <b>bridge</b> (utilizing OpenWrt firmware) and as a <b>wireless</b> repeater <b>bridge</b> (using DD-WRT firmware).|$|R
50|$|A bridge {{can be used}} {{to connect}} networks, {{typically}} of different types. A <b>wireless</b> Ethernet <b>bridge</b> allows the connection of devices on a wired Ethernet network to a <b>wireless</b> network. The <b>bridge</b> acts as the connection point to the Wireless LAN.|$|R
50|$|Wireless network bridges connect a {{wired network}} to a {{wireless}} network. A bridge differs from an access point: an access point connects wireless devices to a wired network at the data-link layer. Two wireless bridges {{may be used}} to connect two wired networks over a wireless link, useful in situations where a wired connection may be unavailable, such as between two separate homes or for devices which do not have wireless networking capability (but have wired networking capability), such as consumer entertainment devices; alternatively, a <b>wireless</b> <b>bridge</b> can be used to enable a device which supports a wired connection to operate at a wireless networking standard which is faster than supported by the wireless network connectivity feature (external dongle or inbuilt) supported by the device (e.g. enabling Wireless-N speeds (up to the maximum supported speed on the wired Ethernet port on both the bridge and connected devices including the wireless access point) for a device which only supports Wireless-G).A dual-band <b>wireless</b> <b>bridge</b> {{can also be used to}} enable 5 GHz wireless network operation on a device which only supports 2.4 GHz wireless networking functionality and has a wired Ethernet port.|$|E
5000|$|A network {{bridge is}} a {{computer}} networking device that creates a single aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. This function is called network bridging. Bridging is distinct from routing, which allows multiple different networks to communicate independently while remaining separate. In the OSI model, bridging is performed {{in the first two}} layers, below the network layer (layer 3). If one or more segments of the bridged network are wireless, the device is known as a <b>wireless</b> <b>bridge</b> and the function as wireless bridging.|$|E
5000|$|Although network {{cloaking}} may add a small {{sense of}} security, {{it is common}} for people not to realize just {{how easy it is to}} discover hidden networks. Because of the various ways an SSID is broadcast, network cloaking is not considered a security measure. Using encryption, preferably WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) or WPA2, is more secure. Even WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), while weak and vulnerable, provides more security than hiding the SSID. There are many programs that are able to scan for wireless networks, including hidden ones, and display their information such as IP addresses, SSIDs, and encryption types. These programs are capable of [...] "sniffing" [...] out any wireless networks in range by essentially eavesdropping and analyzing network traffic and packets to gather information about those specific networks. The reason these programs can sniff out the hidden networks is because when the SSID is transmitted in the various frames, it is displayed in cleartext (unencrypted format), and therefore able to be read by anyone who has found it. An eavesdropper can passively sniff the wireless traffic on that network undetected (with software like Kismet), and wait for someone to connect, revealing the SSID. Alternatively, there are faster (albeit detectable) methods where a cracker spoofs a [...] "disassociate frame" [...] as if it came from the <b>wireless</b> <b>bridge,</b> and sends it to one of the clients connected; the client immediately re-connects, revealing the SSID. Some examples of these sniffing programs include the following: ...|$|E

50|$|A {{wireless}} {{application service}} provider (WASP) is the generic name for a firm that provides remote services, typically to handheld devices, such as cellphones or PDAs, that connect to wireless data networks. WASPs are a specific category of {{application service provider}}s (ASPs), though the latter term may more often be associated with standard web services. They {{can also be used}} for <b>wireless</b> <b>bridging</b> between different types of network topologies.|$|R

50|$|Wireless {{wide area}} {{networks}} are wireless networks that typically cover large areas, such as between neighbouring towns and cities, or city and suburb. These networks {{can be used}} to connect branch offices of business or as a public Internet access system. The wireless connections between access points are usually point to point microwave links using parabolic dishes on the 2.4 GHz band, rather than omnidirectional antennas used with smaller networks. A typical system contains base station gateways, access points and <b>wireless</b> <b>bridging</b> relays. Other configurations are mesh systems where each access point acts as a relay also. When combined with renewable energy systems such as photovoltaic solar panels or wind systems they can be stand alone systems.|$|R
