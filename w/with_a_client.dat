5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is given}} Michael's client list as a going-away present, {{much to the}} shock and envy of the other salesmen, and after losing one, {{requests}} the help of Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to retain them. Vickers nearly ruins a relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client</b> but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale. Along the way, Vickers reveals {{that he was not}} hired for his business experience, but because he helped prevent the theft of one of Sabre CEO Jo Bennett's dogs. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is antagonistic towards Michael, still bitter over Michael not recommending him for a manager position, despite Michael's attempts to reconcile. He initially expresses disdain for Michael's going-away present, a recommendation letter, but appears touched as he reads further. He also discovers a card challenging him to a paintball match, and the two play behind the building.|$|E

500|$|Another {{interview}} {{features an}} Amsterdam pimp, [...] "Slim", {{who owns a}} business allowing passers-by to view scantily clad girls in a display window; they can have sex with them on a mattress in a back room. He initially says that the display window women are not in any danger while <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client</b> in the back room, but later clarifies that the girls should [...] "keep a hand close to the panic button" [...] located on the wall. When asked by Nolot if these activities are financed by organized crime, Slim hesitates, then says no.|$|E
500|$|The film {{alternates}} between {{color and}} black and white sequences. Black and white usually denotes that the scene involves {{one or more of}} the hustlers engaged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client,</b> and indicates that {{one or more of the}} characters (not necessarily the client) is fantasizing. But the scheme is not always consistent: for example, when Dean has sex with the paralyzed client the scene is in color; and Harry also has an S/M scene that's all in color (although his client never appears on-screen). Equally, Harry's fantasies about [...] "Lovely Girl" [...] (who is apparently dead) are occasionally in color. In their final scene, Harry and Dean are in black and white, but when the client and Ghislaine are shown watching they're in color, raising the question of exactly who is having the fantasy. According to Lewis, the convention grew out of the fact that the initial improvised sequences were shot in black and white; he acknowledges that by the end the distinction had become [...] "very confused." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Miles' first {{relationships}} is with Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes), which develops from a friendship. Miles is left upset over his foster child Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues). His emotional state {{has an effect}} on Kirsty and she kisses him. Hayes told TV Week that as Kirsty's feelings [...] "take over in the moment", Miles is left surprised because he had been harbouring feelings for her too. Hayes also said Miles did not want to scare Kirsty away and they agree to take their relationship slowly. Hayes later said that Miles and Kirsty's relationship worked so well because [...] "they talk about things and they're mature about their relationship." [...] Kirsty decides that she needs to raise money for her husband Kane Phillips' (Sam Atwell) trial. She secretly begins work as an escort behind Miles' back. Hayes' explained Kirsty was [...] "terrified" [...] that Miles would find out and hated lying to him, but [...] "has no choice." [...] When Miles discovers the truth about Kirsty's escorting, he feels [...] "totally betrayed" [...] and ends their relationship. However, when Kirsty nearly sleeps <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client,</b> Miles comes to her aid. At this point Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) tries to kiss Miles, as the two previously shared a connection. However, Miles defends Kirsty when he learns Leah had argued with Kirsty over her deceit. The state of their relationship remained troubled, though Hayes correctly predicted the couple would reunite.|$|E

2500|$|In many situations, mafia bosses {{prefer to}} {{establish}} an indefinite long-term bond <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client,</b> rather than make one-off contracts. The boss can then publicly declare the client to be under his permanent protection (his [...] "friend", in Sicilian parlance). This leaves little public confusion as to who is and isn't protected, so thieves and other predators will be deterred from attacking a protected client and prey only on the unprotected.|$|E

2500|$|These voices {{can emerge}} as {{accommodating}} or opposing dispositions and roles. [...] For example, a therapist’s voice of being pro-life while working <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client</b> contemplating abortion—-the {{role of a}} therapist is thought to always be understanding and supportive, but this role can become conflicted by a therapist’s disposition or set of dispositions. This precisely illustrates Dasein's polyphonic (simultaneously composed of multiple voices) nature. Dasein's voice is constantly engaged in conversations with the voices of others, and these conversations mesh and mash into each other within each individual. The therapist’s voice of being pro-life is actively colliding with the patient’s voice to abort a pregnancy. Additionally, hearing {{the voice of the}} client adds to the ongoing private conversation the therapist has with himself as he continually re-evaluates where he stands on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York, {{went missing}} on July 10, 2009. She {{had been living}} in the Bronx and working as an escort through Craigslist. On the night she went missing, she met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client,</b> {{deposited}} $900 in her bank account, and attempted to call an old boyfriend but did not get through. Beginning one week after her disappearance, and lasting for five weeks, her teenage sister, Amanda, received a series of [...] "vulgar, mocking and insulting" [...] calls from someone who may have been the killer using her sister's cell phone. The caller spoke in a low, calm voice, and asked if Amanda [...] "was a whore like her sister." [...] The person using Melissa's phone also claimed that she was at a [...] "whorehouse in Queens." [...] The calls became increasingly disturbing, and eventually culminated in the caller telling Amanda that Melissa was dead, and {{that he was going to}} [...] "watch her rot." [...] Police were able to trace some of the calls to Madison Square Garden, midtown Manhattan, and Massapequa, but were unable to determine who was making the calls. Melissa's mother also noted that there were [...] "a lot of calls to Manorville" [...] from Melissa's phone around the time of her disappearance.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{creating}} rights for [...] "workers" [...] who generally lack bargaining {{power in the}} market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the [...] "freedom of establishment" [...] in article 49, and [...] "freedom to provide services" [...] in article 56. In Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be [...] "established" [...] means to participate in economic life [...] "on a stable and continuous basis", while providing [...] "services" [...] meant pursuing activity more [...] "on a temporary basis". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, should claim for breach of establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, [...] "justified by imperative requirements in the general interest" [...] and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or [...] "undertakings" [...] such as companies or firms, {{have a right to}} set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both [...] "vertical" [...] and [...] "horizontal" [...] direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise [...] "official authority". But regulation of an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>client</b> was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.|$|E
