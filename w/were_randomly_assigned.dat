5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
25|$|After a {{screening}} phase from April 1994, 275 {{male and female}} patients <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> paroxetine, imipramine or placebo (an inert pill). Of the 275, 93 were given paroxetine, 95 imipramine and 89 placebo. The paroxetine group were given 20mg daily for four weeks, rising to 30mg at week five and 40mg at week six if the clinician thought it appropriate. The last study visit was in May 1997, and the blind was broken in October.|$|E
25|$|Some {{research}} suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed {{to the development of}} cooperation. Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> one of a variety of skin colors, and then one of a variety of trading strategies: be color-blind, favor those of your own color, or favor those of other colors. They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.|$|E
50|$|Randomized, controlled, {{crossover}} {{experiments are}} {{especially important in}} health care. In a randomized clinical trial, the subjects <b>are</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> treatments. When such a trial is a repeated measures design, the subjects <b>are</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to a sequence of treatments. A crossover clinical trial is a repeated-measures design in which each patient <b>is</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to a sequence of treatments, including at least two treatments (of which one may be a standard treatment or a placebo): Thus each patient crosses over from one treatment to another.|$|R

25|$|A {{sample of}} 240 {{undergraduate}} business students was randomly split into forty teams (half {{of the teams}} were 4-person and half 8-person) which <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to either a collocated or distributed setting. The participants were to complete a task that asked them {{to act as a}} board of directors of a winery with an image problem. They were to find and discuss alternatives, and at the end submit their alternative with rationale. Collocated groups worked at a table together, while distributed groups did the same task at separate computers that allowed for electronic, networked communication. The same technology was used by both collocated and distributed groups.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species have}} a sperm {{transplant}} mechanism. Crickets are one such species that can prematurely remove spermatophore after copulation, which terminates sperm transfer. In one study, males <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to females to create half-sib families {{to determine the}} heritability of spermatophore retention time in females. The researchers {{found that there was}} additive genetic variance in the timing of spermatophore removal by females. These results suggest that the timing of the spermatophore removal is determined partly by genotype and is independent of the quality of a female's mate. This shows no difference between the fitness of females who freely remove the spermatophore and the fitness of females that are forced to accept complete ejaculates.|$|E
25|$|Similar to {{a long-running}} program {{in place at}} Winston Churchill High School, an advisor program was {{introduced}} in the fall of 2006. The program consists of an 8-minute session between the first two periods during which students of all grades meet with a teacher to whom they <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> {{at the beginning of the}} year. More personal than that of the counselling department, the program offers the opportunity for students to seek advice from an influential adult. Administrative duties, such as public announcements and the handing out of report cards and newsletters, is done in sessions. Advisors also make mid-semester phone-home reports to parents. Most students do not have their advisor as a classroom instructor. In most circumstances, students will have the same advisor for all four years of high school.|$|E

500|$|A {{hypothetical}} randomly evolved {{genetic code}} further motivates a biochemical or evolutionary model for its origin. If amino acids <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to triplet codons, {{there would be}} 1.5×1084 possible genetic codes. This number is found by calculating the number of ways that [...] 21 items (20 amino acids plus one stop) can be placed in 64 bins, wherein each item is used at least once. However, the distribution of codon assignments in the genetic code is nonrandom. In particular, the genetic code clusters certain amino acid assignments.|$|E
500|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, a {{group of}} identically dressed masked men, each handcuffed to a briefcase, are {{attacked}} in a subway. They are all killed, with one also having his hand cut off, and his briefcase taken. The attacker opens the briefcase and removes the box of diamonds it contains. Investigating the attack, Agent Phil Coulson discovers that the briefcases <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned,</b> so no one knew which contained the diamonds, and that the attacker carried it out with her eyes closed. Civilian recruit and S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee Skye believes that extrasensory perception may be involved, but Coulson and Agent Melinda May doubt that such abilities exist. Using social media, the team discovers that the thief, who has been behind several other similar crimes, is former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Akela Amador. Coulson had trained Amador, and until now had believed her dead.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a common}} notion that sugar leads to hyperactivity, in {{particular}} in children, but studies and meta-studies question or address this issue. Some articles and studies do refer to the increasing evidence supporting the links between refined sugar and hyperactivity. The WHO FAO meta-study suggests that such inconclusive results {{are to be expected}} when some studies do not effectively segregate or control for free sugars as opposed to sugars still in their natural form (entirely unrefined) while others do. One study followed thirty-five 5-to-7-year-old boys who were reported by their mothers to be behaviorally [...] "sugar-sensitive." [...] They <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to experimental and control groups. In the experimental group, mothers were told that their children were fed sugar, and, in the control group, mothers were told that their children received a placebo. In fact, all children received the placebo, but mothers in the sugar expectancy condition rated their children as significantly more hyperactive. This result suggests that the real effect of sugar is that it increases worrying among parents with preconceived notions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{strategy}} that groups students of varied ability, preparedness, or accomplishment {{in a single}} classroom environment. Usually this terminology is applied to groupings of students in a particular grade, especially in elementary school. For example, students in fifth grade would be heterogeneously grouped in math if they <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to classes instead of being grouped by demonstrated subject mastery. [...] Heterogeneous grouping is sometimes claimed {{to provide a more}} effective instructional environment for less prepared students.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Zimbardo {{accepted}} a tenured position as {{professor of psychology}} at Stanford University. With a government grant from the U.S. Office of Naval Research, he conducted the Stanford prison study in which 24 clinically sane individuals <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned</b> to be [...] "prisoners" [...] or [...] "guards" [...] in a mock dungeon located {{in the basement of the}} psychology building at Stanford (three additional college students were selected as alternates, only one of whom participated [...] in the study). The planned two-week study into the psychology of prison life ended after only six days due to emotional trauma being experienced by the participants. The students quickly began acting out their roles, with [...] "guards" [...] becoming sadistic and [...] "prisoners" [...] showing extreme passivity and depression.|$|E
2500|$|Research {{oriented}} scientists, {{as opposed}} to authors, test whether particular practices work better for different subcultures or personality types, rather than just accept received wisdom. [...] For example, the MATCH Study run at many sites around the US by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) tested whether particular types of clients with alcohol dependence would benefit differentially from three different treatment approaches to which they <b>were</b> <b>randomly</b> <b>assigned.</b> The idea was not to test the approaches but the matching of clients to treatments, and though this missed the question of client choice, it did demonstrate a lack of difference between the different approaches regardless of most client characteristics, with the exception that clients with high anger scores did better with the non-confrontational Motivational Enhancement approach which has been demonstrated superior in a meta-analysis of alcohol treatment outcome research and only required four {{as opposed to}} twelve session within Project MATCH.|$|E
