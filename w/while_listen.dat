40|$|The MA {{dissertation}} discusses Year 3 students´ {{perceptions of}} their English language proficiency in using reading while listening method. In the literature review, I defined listening (top-down and bottom-up processing). I defined reading and data processing related to it. I described reading while listening method through various definitions of several authors. I thoroughly presented the findings related to reading while listening method and accurately described {{the ones that were}} in direct relation to the chosen topic. At the end of the theoretical part, I summarized the research findings on the reading while listening method. The empirical part investigates the results of research on the students´ perceptions about their English language proficiency in using reading while listening method. The study involved 92 students of the Year 3 Primary Education students of the Faculty of Education University of Ljubljana. The students used the reading while listening method, and had to read <b>while</b> <b>listen</b> different kinds of reading materials as part of their home assignments and fill in the portfolio which served as a reading log. They were assessed orally and had to take a written examination. They also had to fill in a survey questionnaire about the method. The results show that the majority of students perceived that they had improved their reading fluency and listening comprehension by applying the reading while listening method. When tested in these two language subskills, the majority of them achieved good results (grades 8, 9 and 10). On the other hand, most of the students considered that they had improved their pronunciation and intonation but {{more than half of them}} achieved low results. In all components of the English language competence (reading fluency, listening comprehension, pronunciation and intonation), there was always more than half of the students that believed that they had improved at every single component. The students also believed that they had improved their English language proficiency for many different reasons. Some believed that had been due to the fact they had both listened and read reading materials simultaneously and therefore understood the text better, others believed that they listened and improved the pronunciation and enriched their vocabulary. 13 of them believed that it is possible to improve one`s language proficiency if the method is used regularly (every day). Only a handful of students believed that this method cannot improve English language proficiency as a whole but only its particular subskills...|$|E
