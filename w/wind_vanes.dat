500|$|Wind is {{determined}} using anemometers and <b>wind</b> <b>vanes,</b> or aerovanes, located a standard [...] {{above ground level}} (AGL). Average wind speed is measured using a two-minute average in the United States, and a 10-minute average elsewhere. Wind direction is measured using degrees, with north representing 0 or 360 degrees, with values increasing from 0 clockwise from north. Wind gusts are reported when there is variation of the wind speed of more than [...] between peaks and lulls during the sampling period.|$|E
500|$|The {{demolition}} of this [...] "shrine of early Christendom", and [...] of Anglo-Saxon church architecture and sculpture, was otherwise thorough, {{and it is}} now represented only by the ruins on the site, material incorporated into a replacement parish church at Hillborough, fragments of the cross, and the two stone columns which {{had been part of the}} church's triple arch. The columns and fragments of the cross are on display in Canterbury Cathedral. Two thousand tons of stone from the demolished church were sold and incorporated into the harbour wall at Margate, known as Margate Pier, which was completed in 1815, and more than 40tons of lead was stripped from the church and sold for £900. Trinity House bought what was left of the structure from the parish for £100, to ensure that the towers were preserved as a navigational aid, and built the first groynes, designed to protect the cliff on which the ruins stand. The spires had both been destroyed by storms by 1819, when Trinity House replaced them with similarly shaped, open structures, topped by <b>wind</b> <b>vanes.</b> These structures remained until they were removed some time after 1928. The ruins of the church, and the site of the Roman fort within which it was built, are now in the care of English Heritage, and the sea defences around Reculver are maintained by the Environment Agency.|$|E

60|$|Far away, spiked, jagged and {{indented}} by the <b>wind</b> <b>vanes,</b> the Surrey Hills rose {{blue and}} faint; {{to the north}} and nearer, the sharp contours of Highgate and Muswell Hill were similarly jagged. And all over the countryside, he knew, on every crest and hill, where once the hedges had interlaced, and cottages, churches, inns, and farm houses had nestled among their trees, wind-wheels similar to those he saw and bearing like them vast advertisements, gaunt and distinctive symbols of the new age, cast their whirling shadows and stored incessantly the energy that flowed away incessantly through all the arteries of the city. And underneath these wandered the countless flocks and herds of the British Food Trust, his property, with their lonely guards and keepers.|$|E
60|$|For {{the rest}} the {{luminous}} expanse was undisturbed. So vast was its serenity {{in comparison with}} the areas of disturbance, that presently Graham, looking beyond them, could almost forget the thousands of men lying out of sight in the artificial glare within the quasi-subterranean labyrinth, dead or dying of the overnight wounds, forget the improvised wards with the hosts of surgeons, nurses, and bearers feverishly busy, forget, indeed, all the wonder, consternation and novelty under the electric lights. Down there in the hidden ways of the anthill he knew that the revolution triumphed, that black everywhere carried the day, black favours, black banners, black festoons across the streets. And out here, under the fresh sunlight, beyond the crater of the fight, {{as if nothing had happened}} to the earth, the forest of <b>wind</b> <b>vanes</b> that had grown from one or two while the Council had ruled, roared peacefully upon their incessant duty.|$|E

The Council {{should have had}} them as police of the Ways, and things might have been different. Of course, {{there is nothing to}} fear except rioting and wreckage. You can manage your own wings now, and you can soar away to Capri if there is any smoke or fuss. We have the pull of all the great things; the aeronauts are privileged and rich, the closest trades union in the world, and so are the {{engineers}} of the <b>wind</b> <b>vanes.</b> We have the air, and the mastery of the air is the mastery of the earth. No one of any ability is organising against us. They have no leaders--only the sectional leaders of the secret society we organised before your very opportune awakening. Mere busy bodies and sentimentalists they are and bitterly jealous of each other. None of them is man enough for a central figure. The only trouble will be a disorganised upheaval. To be frank--that may happen. But it won't interrupt your aeronautics. The days when the People could make revolutions are past." ...|$|E

60|$|And in that balcony {{comes the}} last scene in this story. It was a summer sunsetting, and {{the hills of}} Surrey were very blue and clear. Denton leant upon the balcony {{regarding}} them, and Elizabeth sat by his side. Very wide and spacious was the view, for their balcony hung five hundred feet above the ancient level of the ground. The oblongs of the Food Company, broken here and there by the ruins--grotesque little holes and sheds--of the ancient suburbs, and intersected by shining streams of sewage, passed at last into a remote diapering {{at the foot of}} the distant hills. There once had been the squatting-place of the children of Uya. On those further slopes gaunt machines of unknown import worked slackly at the end of their spell, and the hill crest was set with stagnant <b>wind</b> <b>vanes.</b> Along the great south road the Labour Company's field workers in huge wheeled mechanical vehicles, were hurrying back to their meals, their last spell finished. And through the air a dozen little private aëroplanes sailed down towards the city. Familiar scene as it was to the eyes of Denton and Elizabeth, it would have filled the minds of their ancestors with incredulous amazement. Denton's thoughts fluttered towards the future in a vain attempt at what that scene might be in another two hundred years, and, recoiling, turned towards the past.|$|E

5000|$|Modern {{instruments}} used {{to measure}} wind speed and direction are called anemometers and <b>wind</b> <b>vanes,</b> respectively. These types of instruments are used by the wind energy industry, both for wind resource assessment and turbine control. Wind speed is measured with an anemometer.|$|E
50|$|Only few {{manufacturers}} {{have been successful}} with systems that operate an auxiliary rudder directly from the windvane (Non-servo systems: Windpilot Atlantik, Hydrovane); {{the picture of the}} windvane shown uses this principle with the large fabric vane on a vertical axis (the use of <b>wind</b> <b>vanes</b> with a nearly horizontal axis is used predominantly).|$|E
50|$|To {{estimate}} the energy {{production of a}} wind farm, developers must first measure the wind on site. Meteorological towers equipped with anemometers, <b>wind</b> <b>vanes,</b> and sometimes temperature, pressure, and relative humidity sensors are installed. Data from these towers must be recorded {{for at least one}} year to calculate an annually representative wind speed frequency distribution.|$|E
50|$|The common {{instruments}} of measure are anemometer, <b>wind</b> <b>vane,</b> pressure sensor, thermometer, hygrometer, and rain gauge.|$|R

The regular shape stems from the 19th century, defined by the monastery wall, constructed in 1814 - 1820. The corners of the monastery’s perimeter are finished with small towers with <b>wind</b> <b>vanes</b> which now squeak while turning, providing with a special atmosphere to the site.|$|E

50|$|Early weather vanes {{had very}} {{ornamental}} pointers, but modern <b>wind</b> <b>vanes</b> are usually simple arrows that dispense with the directionals because the instrument {{is connected to}} a remote reading station. An early example of this was installed in the Royal Navy's Admiralty building in London - the vane on the roof was mechanically linked to a large dial in the boardroom so senior officers were always aware of the wind direction when they met.|$|E

50|$|After {{considering}} {{a number of}} possibilities to solve this, including a proportional navigation system, they settled on an extremely simple solution. Small <b>wind</b> <b>vanes</b> on {{the nose of the}} missile were used to rotate the camera so it was always pointed {{in the direction of the}} flight path, not the missile body. Now when the operator maneuvered the missile he saw where it was ultimately headed, not where it was pointed at just that instant. This also helped reduce the motion of the image with sharp control inputs.|$|E
50|$|A bell tower, {{no matter}} {{when it was}} built, is meant to divide the east wall at its centre into 2 wings: the {{southern}} wing, and the northern wing.

Either wing is also provided inside with cells of the average dimensions about 9 m × 8 m: there’re 6 cells in the north wing, and 4 wings in the south wings (they were 5 before).|$|E
