25|$|Finding {{historical}} {{sources for}} The Mercenary War {{suffers from the}} same problem as any history of Carthage: Few primary sources of Carthaginian history exist, except as fragments in translation quoted by Roman and Greek historians. The main extant account of the Mercenary War is that of Polybius, a Greek historian writing many years after the events portrayed here. While {{it is likely that}} he based much of his account on now-lost works of prior Greek and Roman historians, it is unlikely that they had an unbiased view of Carthage and its history.

2500|$|Proof. The {{identity}} is an isometry; nothing changes, so distance cannot change. And if one isometry cannot change distance, neither can two (or three, or more) in succession; thus {{the composition of}} two isometries is again an isometry, and the set of isometries is closed under composition. The {{identity is}}ometry is also an identity for composition, and composition is associative; therefore isometries satisfy the axioms for a semigroup. For a group, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> have an inverse for every element. To cancel a reflection, we merely compose it with itself. (Reflections are involutions.) And since every isometry can be expressed as a sequence of reflections, its inverse can be expressed as that sequence reversed. Notice that the cancellation {{of a pair of}} identical reflections reduces the number of reflections by an even number, preserving the parity of the sequence; also notice that the identity has even parity. Therefore all isometries form a group, and even isometries a subgroup. (Odd isometries do not include the identity, so are not a subgroup.) This subgroup is a normal subgroup, because sandwiching an even isometry between two odd ones yields an even isometry. ∎ ...|$|E
