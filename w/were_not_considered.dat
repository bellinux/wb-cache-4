50|$|The UEFA Cup {{replaced}} the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1971-72 season, so the Fairs Cup <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> a UEFA competition, and hence clubs' {{records in the}} Fairs Cup <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> part of their European record.|$|R

5|$|A Viking funeral {{could be}} a {{considerable}} expense, but the barrow and the grave goods <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> to have been wasted. In {{addition to being a}} homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate their position through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{managers}} and engineers declared the mission a complete success. The completion {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> vital, upgraded the Hubble telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years before and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will help Hubble to see deeper into the universe and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang.|$|E

Although earlier travel narratives had mentioned its presence, these <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> trustworthy. Moreover, the subspecies seen and described by the French (named Canis aureus moreotica) was endemic to the region. Bory de Saint-Vincent brought back pelts and a skull.|$|E

5|$|The way the {{conflict}} is described, by counting only two casualties, may point {{that there was a}} duel between the nobles of the two sides. However, {{it is also possible that}} the dead among the common soldiers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> important to mention. Although the outcome of the battle remained unresolved, Attarsiya decided to withdraw his troops from the battlefield. After his retreat from the Anatolian mainland, Madduwatta was again installed as a Hittite vassal in the region.|$|E
5|$|At the time, prison-based films <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> likely {{box office}} successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment {{producer}} Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and {{reaction to the}} script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The Body into the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E
5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E

5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not stood up to the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} a home draw {{in each of}} their first four rounds (Third to Sixth), United were paired against difficult opponents throughout the competition. On their route to the final they defeated five Premier League teams: Middlesbrough, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle United. The only non-Premier League team that United played in the competition was Fulham, {{who at the time}} played in the Second Division, the third tier of English football, but even they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> pushovers, having claimed shock wins over Southampton and Aston Villa in the previous rounds.|$|E

5|$|Early on July8, another brief {{burst in}} {{convection}} {{near the center}} of Blanca occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly dissipated and the winds <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> to be representative of the storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of Blanca dissipated over open waters.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{appointment}} of Harry M. Daugherty as Attorney General received more criticism than any other. Daugherty's Ohio lobbying and back room maneuvers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> to qualify {{him for his}} office. When the scandals broke in 1923 and 1924, Daugherty's many enemies were delighted {{at the prospect of}} connecting him with the dishonesty, and assumed he had taken part in Teapot Dome, though Fall and Daugherty were not friends. In February 1924, the Senate voted to investigate the Justice Department, where Daugherty remained Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu was just starting to become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing or learning about the art. Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|In Algeria, the Muslims <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> French and did {{not share}} the same {{political}} or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly nine million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, {{they were required to}} renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{were further}} damaged by a schism between the Catholic West and Orthodox East {{that led to}} the Byzantine Greeks being labeled as heretics in the West. Throughout the later centuries of the Byzantine Empire and {{particularly}} following the coronation of Charlemagne (reigned as king of the Franks 768–814) in Rome in 800, the Byzantines <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> by Western Europeans as heirs of the Roman Empire, but rather as part of an Eastern kingdom made up of Greek peoples.|$|E
5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>considered</b> free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views {{out of fear of}} reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it had been just as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E
