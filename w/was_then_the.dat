5|$|A new Methodist {{church was}} built in the {{community}} in 1910, which was used until 1988 and is still standing. Two years later, a new two-room school replaced the old one-room school, which in turn was replaced by a modern school in the mid 1900s, all on the same property. In 1939, the wooden trestle part of the railroad bridge across the Willamette caught fire and burned. Boones Ferry was decommissioned after the Boone Bridge opened in 1954 carrying what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Baldock Freeway, and is today Interstate 5.|$|E
5|$|According to his Life of King Alfred, Asser was a monk at St David's in what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> {{kingdom of}} Dyfed, in {{south-west}} Wales. Asser {{makes it clear}} that he was brought up in the area, and was tonsured, trained and ordained there. He also mentions Nobis, a bishop of St David's who died in 873 or 874, as being a kinsman of his.|$|E

5|$|After the Fall of France, Hitler awarded Göring the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross for his {{successful}} leadership. During the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony, Hitler promoted Göring {{to the rank}} of Reichsmarschall des Grossdeutschen Reiches (Reich Marshal of the Greater German Reich), a special rank which made him senior to all field marshals in the military, including the Luftwaffe. As a result of his promotion, he <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> top ranking soldier of all Germany {{until the end of the}} war. Göring had already received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1939 as Commander in Chief of the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{thirteen}} other pilots, Chaffee {{was selected}} {{to be an astronaut}} as part of NASA Astronaut Group 3 in 1963. He served as capsule communicator (CAPCOM) for the Gemini 3 and Gemini 4 missions, and received his first spaceflight assignment in 1966. In 1967, he died in a fire along with fellow astronauts Virgil (Gus) Grissom and Edward H. White II during a pre-launch test for the Apollo 1 mission at what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Cape Kennedy Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, Florida. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor and a second Air Medal.|$|E
5|$|At Illinois, Corbally {{replaced}} David D. Henry, who stated he was {{stepping down}} {{in favor of}} a younger president with fresh ideas. Almost immediately, Corbally sought to raise capital to fund construction and programs at what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> ninth-largest university system in the country, especially focusing on the Chicago campus and the school's veterinary medicine and agriculture programs. Corbally enlisted the help of alumni from these programs to raise money for two new buildings on the Urbana-Champaign campus.|$|E

5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving economic environment. The first city wall, which had become too constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). As the road network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river.|$|E
5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was undersized {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds and at first focused his athletic energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to be a good vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15–3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E
5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin {{was born}} on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city in what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five {{children}} born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, {{the daughter of a}} merchant. Their marriage was characterized by a tension between Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings' artistic inclinations—and Sophie's cool pragmatism. The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware of a broad, societal anti-Semitism early on.|$|E

5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants. Belle Vue {{became a part of}} the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's {{disease and}} the cause of his death have since been a matter of discussion. His death {{certificate}} gave the cause as tuberculosis, and his physician, Jean Cruveilhier, <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> leading French authority on this disease. Other possibilities have been advanced including cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. In 2017, an autopsy was performed on Chopin's preserved heart, which confirmed that a rare case of pericarditis, caused by complications from chronic tuberculosis, was the likely cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus, {{the son of}} Apollonius of Tarsus, {{was born}} at Soli, Cilicia. He was slight in stature, and is reputed to have trained as a long-distance runner. While still young, he lost his {{substantial}} inherited property when it was confiscated to the king's treasury. Chrysippus moved to Athens, where he became the disciple of Cleanthes, who <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> head (scholarch) of the Stoic school. He {{is believed to have}} attended the courses of Arcesilaus and his successor Lacydes, in the Platonic Academy.|$|E

5|$|David Thompson, a British fur trader for the North West Company, {{completed}} numerous {{surveys and}} {{maps of the}} North American frontier. In 1797 he completed the first known map of the Minnesota area, in what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Territory. The Jay Treaty, however, obliged most of the British settlers to withdraw their settlements in 1796, though mixed-race peoples remained.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{survived the}} early 1950s {{only because of}} WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone {{commercial}} VHF station in what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> sixth-largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Wheeling, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets.|$|E
5|$|During Jerry Claiborne's tenure, from 1972 to 1981, {{the team}} {{captured}} three consecutive ACC championships and made seven bowl game appearances, {{the most of}} any Maryland coach to date. In Bobby Ross's five years at Maryland, from 1982 to 1986, he led the team to three consecutive ACC championships and four bowl appearances. In 1984, quarterback Frank Reich led the team to victory from a 31–0 halftime deficit against Miami in what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> greatest comeback in NCAA football history. This period was marked by bitter competition for ACC primacy with 1981 national champions Clemson, and between 1974 and 1988, each team won six conference championships.|$|E

5|$|During the team's brief {{visit to}} Tasmania, Jardine made his highest {{first-class}} score of 214. In the fourth Test, Jardine only scored one {{run in the}} first innings, before he was given out leg before wicket (lbw) despite obviously hitting the ball. In the second innings, coming out to bat with the score 21 for two, Jardine scored 98 in a partnership of 262 with Hammond which <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> highest partnership for the third wicket in all Test matches. The scoring was very slow, and the crowd protested throughout Jardine's innings, even though he scored faster than Hammond. He was out when Wisden believed he looked certain to reach a century. England {{went on to win}} the match by 12 runs.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{fuel stop}} at Nicosia International Airport, the pilots {{were forced to}} fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers {{initially}} had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb in what <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>the</b> Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, circling over Zagreb Airport until the Black September members had been brought there. This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E
