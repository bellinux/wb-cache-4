The proximity to other, more famous travel destinations, like Athens and Chalkis, and the undeveloped archaeological sites have kept the tourist numbers low.|$|E

Proposals for a water aerodrome in Vollsfjorden were stopped because of lack of floats.

[...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of kids are up to him and Kendrick.

500|$|Duane Allman {{created the}} idea of having two lead guitarists, which was {{inspired}} by Curtis Mayfield; [...] " [...] wanted the bass, keyboards, and second guitar to form patterns behind the solo rather than just comping," [...] said Allman. Their style and incorporation of guitar harmonies was very influential on later musicians. [...] "The pair also had a wide range of complementary techniques, often forming intricate, interlocking patterns {{with each other and with}} the bassist, Berry Oakley, setting the stage for dramatic flights of improvised melodies." [...] Dickey Betts' playing was very melody-based; [...] "My style is just a little too smooth and round to play the blues stuff straight, because I’m such a melody guy that even when I’m playing the blues, I go for melody first," [...] he said. His listening of country and string bluegrass growing up influenced this considerably: [...] "I played mandolin, ukulele, and fiddle before I ever touched a guitar, which may be <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the major keys I play come from." [...] He later characterized their style as [...] "question and answer, anticipation and conclusion," [...] which involved allowing each musician's downbeat to arrive in a different spot, while also keeping consideration of the bass guitar lines.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Orr of The Atlantic called Fargo [...] "smart, thrilling, imaginative television, in {{addition}} to being wicked funny", in which Hawley assumes greater narrative dimension and assurance in his vision. Matthew Gilbert from The Boston Globe identified the dialog, acting, cinematography, music, set design and directing as its most satisfying attributes. So too did The Hollywood Reporter Tim Goodman, who believed that said qualities [...] "make a very riveting and entertaining dark comedy spectacle". Neil Genzlinger, writing for The New York Times, said that Fargo marries deadpan humor, violence, and [...] "observational oddity" [...] in a way unmatched by similar dramas. In his review for Variety, Brian Lowry believed that despite the show's brisk pace, Hawley nonetheless adds depth to his story. Dan Jardine of Slant Magazine agreed and thought that the narrative complexity is what distinguishes season two from Fargo freshman season. Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield felt that Fargo painted [...] "a fascinating portrait of America at the crossroads". Alan Sepinwall said in his review for HitFix that the series captures its namesake film's most redeeming qualities while assuming a distinct identity, and The A.V. Club website felt that the series was [...] "the rare cable drama that forgoes attenuated storytelling and moral ambiguity, and instead delivers episode after episode <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> happens, and all of it matters".|$|E

500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the Game Boy Advance {{release in}} 2002, Craig Harris of IGN wrote that Yoshi's Island was both the console's best {{platformer}} {{as well as}} [...] "the best damn platformer ever developed". While acknowledging the game's roots in the Super Mario series, he said the game created enough gameplay ideas to constitute its own franchise. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas wrote that the game's story was also interesting as the origin story for the Mario brothers. Harris felt that the FX2 sprite-changing effects gave the game [...] "life" [...] and that the Game Boy Advance cartridge could handle the effects just as well. He added that Yoshi's morphing abilities and sound effects were designed well. Levi Buchanan of IGN said the game struck the right balance of tutorial by trial and error. IGN's Harris also noted a few Game Boy Advance-specific issues: framerate drop in areas <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> is happening onscreen, camera panning problems due to the screen's lower resolution, and a [...] "poor" [...] implementation of the [...] "dizzy" [...] special effect on the handheld release. Critics wrote that the [...] "coloring book"-style graphics held up well. IGN's Harris felt {{it was the best}} of the Super Mario Advance games. Of the similar version for the Wii U, Watts of Nintendo Life also noticed the framerate issues and problems resulting from the screen's closer crop, which were [...] "not enough to ruin the game, but ... noticeable". Edge felt that game's only disappointment was the linearity of its overworld following the exploratory Super Mario World and that the sequel would [...] "inevitably ... have less impact" [...] in comparison.|$|E
500|$|After Oakley and Weinstein left The Simpsons, {{they created}} Mission Hill in 1997, {{a show about}} a hip, lazy, 24-year-old {{cartoonist}} named Andy French, and sold it to The WB for a fall 1999 debut. They pitched the show in 1998 [...] "as an animated series for young adults with a sophisticated, Simpsons-style sensibility." [...] They aimed to make the show about realistic issues affecting young adults, which were too mature for The Simpsons. The network was impressed and initially ordered 13 episodes; they ordered five more once the first was completed. Oakley explained: [...] "The audience we're going for is one that's sophisticated, that likes high and low humor, that's very savvy in animation. [...] this show is definitely a case <b>where</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people don't get it. It's not setup, setup, setup, punch line. It's observational humor. It's jokes told in a weird way, in the background or with a bizarre sound effect." [...] The show was plagued by [...] "public relations" [...] difficulties, which meant it was [...] "tarnished" [...] from the start. A badly edited two-minute promotional video for the show, sent to advertisers in April 1999 for the annual upfronts, was poorly received. Oakley and Weinstein had been informed that the upfronts did not matter. Similarly, because no episodes were finished in time, journalists {{were not able to}} see anything of the show at the network's schedule presentation in July. Subsequently, as Weinstein commented to the Washington Post, [...] "for seven months, the only impression people had of the show was based on a two-minute tape that looked terrible. Six major publications panned it before they even saw it." [...] The pilot garnered largely negative reviews from publications such as The Deseret News; and earned a positive write-up in Variety. Furthermore, the show was forced to change from its originally planned title of The Downtowners due to its closeness to an MTV show. All of these factors combined to ensure the show received little attention, and the WB ran only a few commercials for it. Weinstein stated: [...] "I don't know exactly why America doesn't know about this show. It's like Teen People came out with its fall preview, and we're not even in it." [...] Mission Hill came {{at a time when the}} TV schedules were already saturated with animated shows; some of the response could be chalked up to its genre.|$|E
