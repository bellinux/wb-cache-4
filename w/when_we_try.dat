25|$|Many {{have said}} that a vacuum does not exist, others that it does exist {{in spite of the}} repugnance of nature and with {{difficulty}}; I know of no one who has said that it exists without difficulty and without a resistance from nature. I argued thus: If there can be found a manifest cause from which the resistance can be derived which is felt if we try to make a vacuum, it seems to me foolish to try to attribute to vacuum those operations which follow evidently from some other cause; and so by making some very easy calculations, I found that the cause assigned by me (that is, the weight of the atmosphere) ought by itself alone to offer a greater resistance than it does <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to produce a vacuum.|$|E

O'Hehir also noted homages to [...] "Roger Corman's B-movie aesthetic and the glossy Hollywood spectacles of Michael Mann". As a character study, Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times examined themes of [...] "loyalty, loneliness {{and the dark}} impulses that rise up even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> our hardest to suppress them". Reuters Nick Vinocur noted a series of comic gore, resulting in [...] "a bizarre concoction...reminiscent of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive...Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and [...] angst-laden love scenes {{that would not be}} out of place in a Scandinavian drama". Christopher Hawthorne, also from the Los Angeles Times, has compared it to the works of Walter Hill, John Carpenter, Nathanael West, J. G. Ballard, and Mike Davis. According to Refn, Drive is dedicated to filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and includes shades of Jodorowsky's existentialism.|$|E

500|$|The initial {{running time}} for [...] "The Front" [...] was [...] "way, way short", and the writers {{had to use}} [...] "every trick in the book" [...] to make the episode reach the minimum length. Even after greatly {{expanding}} the original script and adding an extra-long couch gag during the opening sequence, the episode was still one minute too short; [...] "The Adventures of Ned Flanders" [...] was added to address the problem. The segment, which plays {{at the end of}} the episode, was designed purely as filler and had nothing to do with the other events of the episode. Showrunner Mike Reiss later commented, [...] "As always, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> something bold and new the general reaction is, 'What the hell was that?'" [...] The scene was also an homage to Archie Comics, which sometimes used a similar technique to fill a final page; the font used in the scene's title card is similar to the font used by Archie. The short inspired writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein to produce the season seven episode [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield".|$|E

2500|$|However, {{combining}} these restrictions, so {{that one}} uses only left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums on regularly divided intervals, is dangerous. If a function is known in advance to be Riemann integrable, then this technique will give the correct value of the integral. But under these conditions the indicator function [...] will appear to be integrable on [...] with integral equal to one: Every endpoint of every subinterval will be a rational number, so the function will always be evaluated at rational numbers, and hence it will appear to always equal one. The problem with this definition becomes apparent <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to split the integral into two pieces. The following equation ought to hold: ...|$|E

2500|$|Muawiyah {{was very}} skilled at {{dealing with the}} Romans. Abdullah ibn Zubayr, who could see {{troubles}} ahead {{after the death of}} Muawiyah and was opposed to the appointment of Yazid, later said of Muawiyah: [...] "Truly the son of Hind deployed a dexterity and mental resourcefulness as one will never see after him. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> to impose something on him, an irritated lion with claws unsheathed would not show more audacity than him. He knew when to give into us, to even allow himself to be tricked <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> to do that to him. He was the most artful of men, more crafty than a thief.

2500|$|Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda expounded on the words, [...] "Then the Lord God formed ( [...] , wa-yitzer) man," [...] in [...] Rav Nahman bar Rav Hisda {{taught that}} the word וַיִּיצֶר, wa-yitzer is written with two yuds (...) to show that God created people with two inclinations (yetzerim), one good and one evil. Rav Nahman bar Isaac demurred, arguing that {{according}} to this logic, animals, of which [...] writes , wa-yitzer with a single yud, should have no evil inclination (yetzer hara), but we see that they injure, bite, and kick, plainly evincing an evil inclination. Rather, Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi explained that the two yuds by saying, [...] "Woe is me because of my Creator (yotzri), woe is me because of my evil inclination (yitzri)!" [...] Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi thus indicated that the two yuds indicate the human condition, where God punishes us for giving in to our evil inclination, but our evil inclination tempts us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to resist. Alternatively, Rabbi Jeremiah ben Eleazar explained that the two yuds reflect that God created two countenances in the first man, one man and one woman, back to back, as [...] says, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>try</b> to be definite, {{as to what}} we {{mean when}} we say that this or that is [...] "the Good," [...] we find {{ourselves}} involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and {{was said to be}} a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case — or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to [...] "values" [...] — that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects — lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to [...] "values" [...] lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has [...] "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.|$|E
