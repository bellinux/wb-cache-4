5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E
25|$|If any brother, being {{priest or}} deacon or {{of any other}} {{clerical}} order, shall commit any offense, and this shall come to {{the knowledge of the}} Prior or the Master, the brethren whom the Prior shall select for the court shall judge with righteous judgment and shall impose a penance of seven days or even of forty according to the gravity of the fault, just {{as in the case of}} other brethren who are not in holy orders. For, seeing that we are all of one religion and all, both clergy and laymen, make the same profession, it seems unfitting that there should be any distinction between brethren within the Hospital. Wherefore it is ordered that, as we live under one rule, so also <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> subject to the same judges of the rule.|$|E
500|$|Early in his presidency, Hay and Nicolay {{requested}} {{and received}} permission from Lincoln {{to write his}} biography. By 1872, Hay was [...] "convinced that <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at work on our 'Lincoln.' I don't think the time for publication has come, but the time for preparation is slipping away." [...] Robert Lincoln in 1874 formally agreed to let Hay and Nicolay use his father's papers; by 1875, they were engaged in research. Hay and Nicolay enjoyed exclusive access to Lincoln's papers, which were not opened to other researchers until 1947. They gathered documents written by others, {{as well as many}} of the Civil War books already being published. [...] They at rare times relied on memory, such as Nicolay's recollection of the moment at the 1860 Republican convention when Lincoln was nominated, but for much of the rest relied on research.|$|E

500|$|After the [...] "khaki election" [...] of October 1900, the Conservative Party {{remained}} in power, but instituted a thorough reorganisation of the government. The War Office was now led by St. John Brodrick, who immediately called for extensive reform. In {{the debate on}} the Army Estimates on 8 March 1901, he dismissed a two-corps expeditionary force as insufficient, and suggested that [...] "...besides Home Defence <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready at any moment to send abroad three Army Corps with the proper Cavalry Division ... 120,000 men". He proposed to divide the nation into six geographical corps districts, each of which would contain the appropriate units during peacetime which it would command in war. The First and Second Corps, of regulars, would be based at Aldershot and Salisbury Plain; a Third Corps, mostly regulars, would be based in Ireland. These three would constitute the force for overseas service. The Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Corps would be composed of a mixture of regular and auxiliary forces, with sixty selected [...] "first-line" [...] Volunteer and Militia battalions. The remaining auxiliary forces would be assigned for defensive purposes to whichever corps they were located under. The Yeomanry, meanwhile, would be heavily expanded and reformed as Imperial Yeomanry, the mounted infantry having proved of great use in South Africa. This scheme could of course not be implemented whilst the South African War was in progress, but even in peacetime it was slow to take effect; in March 1903 a report gave the Fifth and Sixth Corps as [...] "not yet formed", large numbers of the component units for other corps were unavailable, not yet organised, or simply quartered in the wrong locations, and perhaps most remarkably, the First Corps had no brigadiers to command itthey were to be assigned on mobilisation.|$|E

2500|$|According to Tu, {{the more}} man can {{penetrate}} his own inner sources, {{the more he}} can transcend himself. By the metaphorical words of Mencius (7a29) is like [...] "digging a well to reach the source of water." [...] It is for this emphasis on transcending the phenomena to reach the true self, which is the divine, that Tu defines Confucian religiosity as the [...] "ultimate self-transformation as a communal act and as a faithful dialogical response to the transcendent" [...] ans says {{that this is the}} Confucian prescription to develop the right nature of humanity. Tu furtherly explains the concept as a prognosis and diagnosis of humanity: [...] "we are not what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> but what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> is inherent in the structure of what we are".|$|E

2500|$|Pointing {{out that}} [...] "The former {{president}} rarely speaks about his book at universities. He says he’s {{been invited to}} more than 100 campuses, but he's only visited five," [...] Claire Keller reported that, during his public appearance at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, on 18 April 2007, [...] Carter stated: [...] "I wrote this book to describe {{the plight of the}} Palestinians and because I'm convinced we desperately need debate about where we are and where <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going, and how to rejuvenate the non-existent peace process in the Middle East" ... Carter says the book's objective is permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors; it’s something the former president says he’s dedicated his entire adult life to.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal Democrats: Leader Nick Clegg {{stated in}} 2009 that his party backs legalisation. On 4 July 2009, {{in an article}} for LabourList, Clegg wrote that [...] "although civil {{partnerships}} have been a step forward, until same sex marriage is permitted {{it is impossible to}} claim gay and straight couples are treated equally." [...] Following this, the party's LGBT rights group LGBT+ Liberal Democrats launched a petition [...] "Marriage Without Borders" [...] calling for all gender restrictions on marriage and civil partnerships to be lifted, and for same-sex relationships to be recognised across Europe and internationally. The petition was run at Manchester Pride and Reading Pride in 2009, and launched online in January 2010 following an interview with Clegg in Attitude magazine in which he reaffirmed his commitment to equal marriage. However, this did not make it into the party's manifesto. In an interview in July 2010 Lib Dem deputy party leader Simon Hughes confirmed that the coalition Government plans to open marriage to same-sex couples, saying, [...] "It would be appropriate in Britain in 2010, 2011, for there to be the ability for civil marriage for straight people and gay people equally... The state ought to give equality. We’re halfway there. I think <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to get there in this parliament".|$|E
2500|$|Critics of DeLillo {{argue that}} his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow. In James Wood's review of Zadie Smith's 2000 novel White Teeth, he {{dismissed}} {{the work of}} authors like Dellilo, Wallace, and Smith as [...] "hysterical realism". Bruce Bawer famously condemned DeLillo's novels insisting they weren't actually novels at all but [...] "tracts, designed to batter us, again and again, with a single idea: that life in America today is boring, benumbing, dehumanized...It's better, DeLillo seems to say in one novel after another, to be a marauding murderous maniac – and therefore a human – than to sit still for America as it is, with its air conditioners, assembly lines, television sets, supermarkets, synthetic fabrics, and credit cards." [...] George Will proclaimed the study of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra as [...] "sandbox existentialism" [...] and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship." [...] DeLillo responded [...] "I don't take it seriously, but being called a 'bad citizen' is a compliment to a novelist, at least to my mind. That's exactly {{what we ought to}} do. <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bad citizens. We ought to, in the sense that we're writing against what power represents, and often what government represents, and what the corporation dictates, and what consumer consciousness has come to mean. In that sense, if we're bad citizens, we're doing our job." [...] In the same interview DeLillo rejected Will's claim that DeLillo blames America for Lee Harvey Oswald, countering that he instead blamed America for George Will. DeLillo also figured prominently in B. R. Myers's critique of recent American literary fiction, A Reader's Manifesto.|$|E
