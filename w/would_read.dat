5|$|After {{arriving}} in Ohio, Hensley {{returned to his}} personal ministry and held services in the area. Because he was illiterate, Bertha <b>would</b> <b>read</b> passages from the Bible during services, after which Hensley would deliver a sermon on a theme drawn from the verses. He also frequently preached {{on the topic of}} faith healing during this period. He remained in Ohio for several years, divorcing Amanda in 1926.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Allen pledged a $10 million {{donation}} {{over four}} years {{for the creation of}} the Allen Discovery Centers at Tufts University and Stanford University.

5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that <b>would</b> <b>read</b> Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} release of Mockingjay, many bookstores held midnight release parties. The {{official}} event in New York City was attended by Collins, and included many activities such as a tarot card reader, a magician, jugglers and face-painters. Prizes such as signed copies of Catching Fire and Hunger Games-themed cups were raffled. Once Collins arrived, she read {{the first chapter of}} the novel, explaining that she <b>would</b> <b>read</b> with an accent since Katniss, the narrator, is from Appalachia. By midnight, copies were being sold with a signature stamp since Collins had a hand injury and was unable to sign.|$|E
5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin first {{appeared}} as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter narrative that would run {{for only a few}} weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she missed an issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone <b>would</b> <b>read</b> Uncle Tom's Cabin in book form, she eventually consented to the request.|$|E

5|$|Chris Lu {{was born}} on June 12, 1966 in New Jersey. In 1974, {{his family moved to}} the Fallsmead {{neighborhood}} of Rockville, Maryland, where he graduated from Thomas S. Wootton High School in 1984. Lu is the son of Eileen and Chien-Yang Lu, both of whom were born in China and lived in Taiwan until the 1950s when they emigrated to the United States to attend college. Lu's grandfather, Wang Ren-Yuan, was the Minister of Justice of Taiwan from 1970 to 1976 and was elected to the first Legislative Yuan in 1948 to represent Tianjin. Lu said he was heavily influenced by his father, who worked as an electrical engineer but loved literature and history; the two <b>would</b> <b>read</b> biographies of politicians and watch the evening news together.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} project, 127 Hours, {{directed}} by Danny Boyle, Franco portrayed real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston. It {{was given a}} limited release starting on November 5, 2010. 127 Hours centered on Ralston trying to free his hand after it became trapped under a boulder in a ravine while canyoneering alone in Utah and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive, eventually amputating his arm. During the five-week, 12-hours-per-day shoot, Franco would only leave the gully set to use the lavatory and <b>would</b> <b>read</b> books such as academic textbooks to keep busy. Franco later called making 127 Hours a {{once in a lifetime}} experience. To date, 127 Hours is one of his most well-reviewed movies and was also a commercial success, earning $60.7million against an $18million budget. His performance earned him universal acclaim from critics. Subsequently, he was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG award, as well as winning an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E
5|$|Meyer and {{his friend}} Denny Martin Flinn wrote the {{screenplay}} by the nascent means of e-mail; Meyer lived in Europe while Flinn was based in Los Angeles. The pair worked out a system where Flinn would write all day and then send the draft to Meyer, who <b>would</b> <b>read</b> and make revisions. The script constantly changed because of demands made {{not only by the}} core cast, but also the supporting players. Flinn was aware that the film would be the last to feature the cast of the original television series, so he wrote an opening that embraced the passage of time. In the opening, each of the crew was to be rounded up out of unhappy retirement for one final mission.|$|E

5|$|Under {{articles}} XXII and XXIII of the Act of Union of 1707, Scottish peers {{were entitled}} to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords. Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments. Upon the summons of a new Parliament, the Sovereign would issue a proclamation summoning Scottish peers to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The elections were held in the Great Gallery, a large room decorated by eighty-nine of Jacob de Wet's portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus Mór to Charles II. The Lord Clerk Register <b>would</b> <b>read</b> out the Peerage Roll as indicates his presence when called. The Roll was then re–read, with each peer responding by publicly announcing his votes and the return {{being sent to the}} clerk of the crown at London. The same procedure was used whenever a vacancy arose.|$|E
5|$|His feet {{position}} were peculiar in {{that his}} front foot was {{parallel to the}} crease and his back foot perpendicular, {{the opposite of the}} conventional posture. This inhibited his follow through and put more stress on his ankles and shins. As a result, his right ankle had to be bound tightly in order to prevent jarring from his awkward delivery. He also followed the recommendation of Bill O'Reilly and tied a towel around his shins to cut off the circulation and to dull the pain. After the knee injury, he altered his action into a more conventional one so that his front foot pointed towards the batsman. This eased the pressure on his body, but his ability to move the ball diminished. Johnston was a keen student of the game, and although he did not see a state match until his debut, and watched only one Test before his debut, he supplemented his knowledge by reading cricket books. During his early first-class career, upon returning from matches, he <b>would</b> <b>read</b> articles by Bradman, Bert Oldfield and Arthur Mailey from a book given to him by his schoolteacher when he was a schoolboy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remote}} Klondike, {{there was great}} demand for news and contact with the world outside. During {{the first months of}} the stampede in 1897, it was said that no news was too old to be read. In the lack of newspapers, some prospectors <b>would</b> <b>read</b> can labels until they knew them by heart. The {{following}} year, two teams fought their way over the passes to reach Dawson City first, complete with printing-presses, with the aim of gaining control of the newspaper market. Gene Kelly, the editor of the Klondike Nugget arrived first, but without his equipment, and it was the team behind the Midnight Sun who produced the first daily newspaper in Dawson. The Dawson Miner followed shortly after, bringing the number of daily newspapers in the town during the gold rush up to three. The Nugget sold for $24 ($680) as an annual subscription, and became well known for championing popular causes associated with miners and for its lucid coverage of scandals. Paper was often hard to find and during the winter of 1898–99, the Nugget had to be printed on butcher's wrapping paper. In the lack of paper, news could be told. In June, 1898, a prospector bought an edition of the Seattle Post-Intellinger at an auction and charged spectators a dollar each to have it read aloud in one of Dawson's halls.|$|E
