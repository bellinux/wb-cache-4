He commented: [...] "I almost laughed out loud when I came across the three-headed dog [...] I instantly knew it was a reference to Cerberus, the threeheaded beast which Ancient Greeks believed guarded the gates to the Underworld." [...] Inspired by this, Colbert continued to search the book for more references and noticed that most characters' names are based on their personality and every magic creature is a reference to mythology and folklore.|$|E
500|$|Rodriguez {{first came}} up with the idea for Planet Terror during the {{production}} of The Faculty: [...] "I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [...] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [...] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'"

500|$|The Sydney Morning Herald's Lenny Ann Low also {{praised the}} cast and their performances, stating [...] "Lush with {{straining}} bosoms, knowing looks and segments bringing Morland's wild dreams and fantasies to life, Northanger Abbey is well cast. Felicity Jones catches Morland's mix of youthful naivety, heart-whole feelings and mindful beliefs perfectly and J.J. Feild, as the dishy but sensible Tilney, grows in appeal as this feature-length drama builds to a climax." [...] Low's colleague, Joyce Morgan later selected Northanger Abbey {{as one of the}} week's best television programmes. However, Ruth Ritchie, writing for the same newspaper, stated that the makers of the adaptation tried [...] "desperately to create an air of mystery about the dastardly deeds at Northanger Abbey," [...] but the audience knew it <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> scary as [...] "a ninja turtle." [...] Ritchie likened the ITV Austen adaptations to a [...] "Posh Country Home and Away." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "Northanger Abbey the novel was as fun as it gets for Austen, and the television film quite lives up to the same standard." ...|$|E
500|$|Production {{began in}} February 2007 in South Africa, where the {{majority}} of filming took place. South Africa was chosen as a primary filming location for economic reasons, costing a third of estimated production in the United Kingdom. Shooting in South Africa lasted 56 days out of 66 days, with the remaining ten taking place in Scotland. Marshall said of South Africa's appeal, [...] "The landscape, the rock formations, I thought it <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> close to Scotland as you're likely to get, outside of Ireland or Wales." [...] In Scotland, secondary filming took place in the city of Glasgow, including Haghill in the city's East End, and at Blackness Castle in West Lothian, the latter chosen when filmmakers were unable to shoot at Doune Castle. The entire shoot, involving thousands of extras, included a series of complex fight scenes and pyrotechnical displays. The director sought to minimise the use of computer-generated elements in Doomsday, preferring to subscribe to [...] "old-school filmmaking". In the course of production, several sequences were dropped due to budgetary concerns, including a scene in which helicopter gunships attacked a medieval castle.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman's profile {{continued}} to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama Jack Goes Boating was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack– a lonely limousine driver looking for love– after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the Daily Mirror remarked that [...] "Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely remember what it <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> I left", while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to Jack Goes Boating, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard's tragic drama The Long Red Road for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of Variety described the production as [...] "heavy handed" [...] and [...] "predictable", but [...] "intriguing and at least partially successful".|$|E

500|$|Within the {{contemporary}} American literary scene Griswold {{became known as}} erratic, dogmatic, pretentious, and vindictive. As historian Perry Miller wrote, [...] "Griswold <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> devious as they came {{in this era of}} deviousness; did not ample documentation prove that he actually existed, we might suppose him... one of the less plausible inventions of Charles Dickens". Later anthologies such as Prose Writers of America and Female Poets of America helped him become known as a literary dictator, whose approval writers sought even while they feared his growing power. Even as they tried to impress him, however, several authors voiced their opinion on Griswold's character. Ann S. Stephens called him two-faced and [...] "constitutionally incapable of speaking the truth". Even his friends knew him as a consummate liar and had a saying: [...] "Is that a Griswold or a fact?" [...] Another friend once called him [...] "one of the most irritable and vindictive men I ever met". Author Cornelius Mathews wrote in 1847 that Griswold fished for writers to exploit, warning [...] "the poor little innocent fishes" [...] to avoid his [...] "Griswold Hook". A review of one of Griswold's anthologies, published anonymously in the Philadelphia Saturday Museum on January 28, 1843, but believed to have been written by Poe, asked: [...] "What will be [...] fate? Forgotten, save only by those whom he has injured and insulted, he will sink into oblivion, without leaving a landmark to tell that he once existed; or if he is spoken of hereafter, he will be quoted as the unfaithful servant who abused his trust." ...|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{honored the}} game in its November 2010 issue, which celebrated the 25th anniversary of the NES. The {{magazine}} listed its box art, which depicts a ninja with a burning city in the background, {{as one of its}} favorite designs in the NES library. The magazine's Editor in Chief Chris Slate was equally impressed by the game's box art. He also reminisced the game's high level of difficulty with its re-spawning enemies and enemy birds that knocked players into pits, saying this game [...] "may have taught me how to curse". He further praised gameplay features such as clinging on walls and using ninpo techniques, and he noted the game's cinematic cutscenes, including the ominous opening sequence that featured two ninjas who launch into the air at each other and clashing their swords in the moonlight. He said that [...] "Ninja Gaiden <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> cool as an 8-bit game could be, especially for ninja-crazed kids of the '80s who, like me, had worn out their VHS copies of Enter the Ninja". In a July2011 issue, Retro Gamer listed the game's opening {{as one of the most}} popular ones at the time. The magazine noted how its usage of cutscenes, animations, and overall presentation put the game above most other action titles at the time. While it lauded the controls and gameplay elements, as with other reviews, it criticized the difficulty, calling it [...] "one of the most challenging games on the console". It noted how defeated enemies re-spawn in certain spots, how enemies are placed on the edges of platforms, and the structure of the final level.|$|E
500|$|Merriam divided his palustris-mexicanus {{group in}} two [...] "series" [...] {{according}} {{to the color of}} the underparts (white or [...] ). Goldman divided his palustris group in two [...] "sections"—a couesi section with O.couesi and six related species, and a palustris section with O.palustris only. He noted that the latter differed from the former in the generally darker, more brownish, longer fur, and larger sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate). As Weksler's 2006 analysis included only O.couesi and the marsh rice rat among species of Oryzomys in the strict sense, he could not test those groups. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred with Goldman's division, listing additional characters, and noted that the palustris group may be more semiaquatically adapted than the members of the couesi group are. In the latter, the fur is usually reddish-brown, as opposed to grayish-brown in the palustris group. Members of the couesi group have smaller sphenopalatine vacuities and a smaller sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{in the side of the}} skull above the molars, and a more highly developed anterolabial cingulum on the third lower molar (a crest at the front of the tooth). The hypothenar pad of the hindfoot, located on the sole far from the fingers, is present in the couesi group, but absent in the palustris group. Interdigital webbing may be more highly developed in the palustris group. Using morphological data, Voss and Weksler found a closer relationship between O.couesi and O.gorgasi to the exclusion of O.palustris, but with low confidence. The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the palustris and couesi groups, but a Costa Rican sample (assigned to O.couesi) <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>as</b> distant from the two groups as they were from each other.|$|E
