2500|$|Castéra and Johnson both drew even numbers, {{which meant}} they {{went off in}} the first group, 30 minutes before the odd numbers. My father drew number 187. When the signal was given for the second group to move off, my father <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the front and was soon on his own. It was raining, and it {{remained}} wet all day. Right down the Avénue de la Grande Armée and the Avénue de Neuilly, over the bridges of the Seine, and on towards the first control at St Germain-en-Laye. As he pedalled hard up the steep hill near the town, he passed a group of stragglers from the first group who were pushing their machines. My father had gained 30 minutes on them in 12 miles! ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{indifferent}} manner vanished {{as soon as}} {{he opened}} his mouth. [...] He <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> work. He turned up the cuffs of his shirt. [...] Next, he loosened his necktie, and soon after it he took it off altogether. [...] All the time, he was gaining upon his audience. [...] He soon had it as by a spell. [...] I never saw men more delighted. [...] He began to bubble out with humor. [...] For plain pungency of humor, it would have been difficult to surpass his speech. [...] The speech ended in a half-hour. [...] The bell that called to the steam cars sounded. [...] Mr. Lincoln instantly stopped. [...] ‘I am engaged to speak at Cambridge tonight, and I must leave.’ [...] The whole audience seemed to rise in protest. [...] ‘Go on! [...] Finish it!’ was heard on every hand. [...] One gentleman arose and pledged to take his horse and carry him across country. [...] But Mr. Lincoln was inexorable.|$|E

2500|$|The University of West Alabama men's tennis team {{began in}} 1974. [...] The women {{followed}} suit {{a decade later}} in 1984. [...] Both programs were dropped in 1997. [...] After an eight-year hiatus, the Tigers were reinstated {{in the fall of}} 2005. The Howard R. Vaughan Tennis Complex was added to the University campus in time for UWA to begin the 2006 season. [...] Rod Hartzog was chosen as the head coach and <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> work recruiting players. [...] After a grueling schedule, both teams had many wins to show for their efforts. [...] The season's highlight came when the Tigers swept Alabama-Huntsville, and the women dispatched Montevallo in fine fashion at the GSC Jamboree. [...] In 2007, as part of Super Tiger Day festivities, the men and women both claimed victories over Transylvania. Spring Break saw the Tigers match up against several nationally ranked opponents. [...] UWA fought hard in each match but could not come up with a win in any of them. [...] The women's final match came at Montevallo where they picked up their only conference win. [...] Their season ended at 5-12 overall, 1-4 in the conference. [...] The UWA men concluded their season at the GSC Tournament to close a 7-11 mark and 1-3 in GSC action.|$|E

60|$|They <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the bows of the softly {{plunging}} vessel. In {{the complete}} obscurity, Birkin found a comparatively sheltered nook, where a great rope was coiled up.

It was very cold, and the darkness was palpable.|$|E

60|$|One thing, however, I had noticed, and it {{impressed}} me deeply {{even at the}} time.

Of course, it was not pleasant to be in a small boat, pitching about on those great waves, but almost anywhere was a better place than a ship on fire. I heard a lady scream once or twice, but I don't think there was much of that sort of thing. However, there might have been more of it than I thought. I was driving away at my own business.|$|E

It didn't matter any more that she had once chased me through the Glen with a codfish; it didn't matter that she had smeared goose-grease all over my dream of romance the night of the lighthouse dance; it didn't matter that she thought she knew more than anybody else and always rubbed it in--I would never dislike Mary Vance again.

60|$|There {{were several}} {{instances}} of this dexterity, but especially those which {{occurred in the}} celebrated case of Murdison and Millar, in 1773. These persons, a sheep-farmer and his shepherd, settled in the vale of Tweed, commenced and carried {{on for some time}} an extensive system of devastation on the flocks of their neighbours. A dog belonging to Millar was so well trained, that he had only to show him during the day the parcel of sheep which he desired to have; and when dismissed at night for the purpose, Yarrow <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> the pasture where the flock had fed, and carried off the quantity shown him. He then drove them before him by the most secret paths to Murdison's farm, where the dishonest master and servant were in readiness to receive the booty. Two things were remarkable. In the first place, that if the dog, when thus dishonestly employed, actually met his master, he observed great caution in recognising him, {{as if he had been}} afraid of bringing him under suspicion; secondly, that he showed a distinct sense that the illegal transactions in which he was engaged were not of a nature to endure daylight. The sheep which he was directed to drive, were often reluctant to leave their own pastures, and sometimes the intervention of rivers or other obstacles made their progress peculiarly difficult. On such occasions, Yarrow continued his efforts to drive his plunder forward, until the day began to dawn, a signal which, he conceived, rendered it necessary for him to desert his spoil, and slink homeward by a circuitous road. It is generally said this accomplished dog was hanged along with his master; but the truth is, he survived him long, in the service of a man in Leithen, yet was said afterwards to have shown little of the wonderful instinct exhibited in the employment of Millar.|$|E
60|$|This {{is a true}} story to. Long {{ago there}} was a girl lived in {{charlotte}} town. I dont know her name so I cant right it and maybe it is just as well for Felicity might think it wasnt romantik like Miss Jemima Parrs. She was awful pretty and a young englishman who had come out to make his fortune {{fell in love with her}} and they were engaged to be married the next spring. His name was Mr. Carlisle. In the winter he started off to hunt cariboo for a spell. Cariboos lived on the island then. There aint any here now. He got to where it is Carlisle now. It wasn't anything then only woods and a few indians. He got awful sick and was sick for ever so long in a indian camp and only an old micmac squaw to wait on him. Back in town they all thought he was dead and his girl felt bad for a little while and then got over it and took up with another beau. The girls say that wasnt romantik but I think it was sensible but if it had been me that died I'd have felt bad if she forgot me so soon. But he hadnt died and when he got back to town he <b>went</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> her house and walked in and there she was standing up to be married to the other fellow. Poor Mr. Carlisle felt awful. He was sick and week and it went to his head. He just turned and run and run till he got back to the old micmac's camp and fell in front of it. But the indians had gone because it was spring and it didnt matter because he really was dead this time and people come looking for him from town and found him and buryed him there and called the place after him. They say the girl was never happy again and that was hard lines on her but maybe she deserved it.|$|E
