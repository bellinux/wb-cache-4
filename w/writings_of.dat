5|$|Goffman's {{early works}} consist of his {{graduate}} <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> 1949–53. His master's thesis was {{a survey of}} audience responses to a radio soap opera, Big Sister.

Other <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> the period include Symbols of Class Status (1951) and On Cooling the Mark Out (1952). His doctoral dissertation, Communication Conduct in an Island Community (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday life rituals affect public projections of self.|$|E

5|$|The {{canonical}} {{texts are}} the <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, `Abdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice, and the authenticated talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá. The <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh are considered as divine revelation, the writings and talks of `Abdu'l-Bahá and the <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Shoghi Effendi as authoritative interpretation, {{and those of}} the Universal House of Justice as authoritative legislation and elucidation. Some measure of divine guidance is assumed for all of these texts. Some of Bahá'u'lláh's most important writings include the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, literally the Most Holy Book, which defines many laws and practices for individuals and society, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, literally the Book of Certitude, which became the foundation of much of Bahá'í belief, the Gems of Divine Mysteries, which includes further doctrinal foundations, and the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys which are mystical treatises.|$|E

5|$|According to Eliot {{the poetic}} {{aspects of the}} poem are {{grounded}} {{in the tradition of}} John Cleveland, Edward Benlowes, William Blake, and William Butler Yeats's early work. Additionally, many of the images are connected to the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. In terms of theology, Eliot is orthodox in his theory and relies primarily on the <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> St Augustine. There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross. In applying these views upon society, Eliot was heavily influenced by the <b>writings</b> <b>of</b> Christopher Dawson and Dawson's reliance on understanding God as the first step to a better society.|$|E

Other Irish settlers came because of its reputation as a Catholic city.|$|E
