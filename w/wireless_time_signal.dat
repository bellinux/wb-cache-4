50|$|This expedition, to {{determine}} 129° east on the ground, created worldwide scientific interest and involved {{the cooperation of}} the Astronomer Royal and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, with <b>wireless</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> sent by the French wireless Service, that were transmitted from the Lyons astronomical observatory (Observatoire de Lyon) at Saint-Genis-Laval, near Lyons, France, between 17 and 24 November 1920. <b>Wireless</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> were also sent from the Adelaide Observatory, transmitted by the Adelaide Radio Station, to enable the beats of the Adelaide sidereal clock {{to be used as a}} control on the rate of the chronometer used for the boundary observation.|$|R
50|$|From {{the chosen}} position, two {{concrete}} pillars were erected {{similar to those}} described above and portable radio masts set up, before the determinations were {{carried out by the}} scientists using the same methods of <b>wireless</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> as were used at Deakin.|$|R
50|$|Fixing the {{position}} of the border of Western Australia on the ground has a rich history. In March 1920 the Western Australian Government Astronomer, H. B. Curlewis gave a talk at the WA Museum {{about the history of the}} determination of longitude, in relation to using what was at that time a new technology, by using <b>wireless</b> <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> to determine {{the position}} of the border between South Australia and Western Australia, as close to the 129th east meridian as possible.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 and 1921 Curlewis was {{involved}} with the Government Astronomer of South Australia, Dodwell, in determinations to fix positions for marking of the West Australian border {{on the ground with}} the South Australian border at Deakin, Western Australia. In 1921 the same group from the Deakin determinations travelled by the State Ship, MV Bambra to Wyndham, where they were guided by M.P. Durack to a point on Rosewood station near Argyle Downs close to the 129th meridian east longitude (129° east). They used the relatively new technology of the day, <b>wireless</b> radio <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> and other methods to fix a position for the Northern Territory border with Western Australia.|$|R

In 1921 the same group from the Deakin determinations travelled by the State Ship, MV Bambra to Wyndham, where they were guided by Michael Durack to a point near Argyle Downs close to the 129th meridian east longitude (129° east). They used <b>wireless</b> radio <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> and other methods to fix a position for the Northern Territory border with Western Australia. These early determinations led to the 1968 agreement for the formation of Surveyor Generals Corner and a fact that not many will know, that the WA border is not as straight as you may think. In fact at the 26th parallel south latitude (26° south) latitude there is an approximately 127 metre [...] "sideways" [...] section of the WA/NT border, which runs east-west.|$|R
50|$|In 1612 Galileo Galilei {{demonstrated}} that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of the}} orbits of the moons of Jupiter one could use their positions as a universal clock and this would make possible the determination of longitude, but the method he devised was impracticable for navigators on ships because of their instability. In 1714 the British government passed the Longitude Act which offered large financial rewards to {{the first person to}} demonstrate a practical method for determining the longitude of a ship at sea. These rewards motivated many to search for a solution.John Harrison, a self-educated English clockmaker, invented the marine chronometer, the key piece in solving the problem of accurately establishing longitude at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long distance sea travel. Though the Board of Longitude rewarded John Harrison for his marine chronometer in 1773, chronometers remained very expensive and the lunar distance method continued to be used for decades. Finally, the combination of the availability of marine chronometers and <b>wireless</b> telegraph <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> {{put an end to the}} use of lunars in the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|By 1850, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of ocean-going navigators worldwide had ceased using the method of lunar distances. Nonetheless, expert navigators continued to learn lunars as late as 1905, though for most this was a textbook exercise since they were a requirement for certain licenses. They also continued in use in land exploration and mapping where chronometers could not be kept secure in harsh conditions. The British Nautical Almanac published lunar distance tables until 1906 and the instructions until 1924. [...] Such tables last appeared in the 1912 USNO Nautical Almanac, though an appendix explaining how to generate single values of lunar distances was published as late as the early 1930s. The presence of lunar distance tables in these publications until the early 20th century does not imply common usage until that time period but was simply a necessity due to a few remaining (soon to be obsolete) licensing requirements. The development of <b>wireless</b> telegraph <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> in the early 20th century, used in combination with marine chronometers, put a final end to the use of lunar distance tables.|$|R
50|$|Margate's Jubilee Clock Tower {{was built}} to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee in 1887, {{although}} not completed until 1889. It had a Time Ball mechanism, mounted on a mast atop the tower, which was raised {{a few minutes before}} 1pm each day and dropped at precisely 1pm, thereby allowing residents, visitors and ships to know the exact time. This was, of course, in the days before <b>wireless</b> transmission of <b>time</b> <b>signals.</b> The <b>Time</b> Ball fell out of use many years ago, but following a suggestion by Arnold Schwartzman OBE RDI, a former Margate resident, Margate Civic Society raised funds to have the Time Ball repaired and brought back into use. This was successful, and a civic ceremony celebrated the restoration on 24 May 2014, Queen Victoria's birthday and the 125th anniversary of the Clock Tower's official opening. The Time Ball now drops at 1pm each day and is {{one of only a handful}} of working time balls in the world.|$|R

50|$|Radio <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> allowed {{accurate}} and rapid distribution of <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> beyond {{the range of}} the telegraph or visual signals. This was of particular value in surveying remote areas, where <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> allowed accurate determination of longitude. In the summer of 1914, a survey party at Quinze Dam in the Ottawa River watershed attempted to receive <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> transmitted from Kingston; however, signals were not resolvable and the <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> from Arlington, Virginia was used instead.|$|R
50|$|When more {{accurate}} <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> were required in navigation, {{a number of}} traditional audible or visible <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> were established so navigators could check their marine chronometers.

50|$|Multi-band 5 (USA) or Multi-band 6 (Japan) - {{perhaps the}} most {{significant}} aspect of the Oceanus line is the ability of all watches to automatically synchronize with the Japanese <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> (JJY), the American <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> (WWVB) from Colorado, and the European <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> from both England (Time from NPL) and Germany (DCF77). The synchronization feature does not work correctly in Arizona, which does not observe daylight saving time. The Japanese Multi-band 6 models add the Chinese <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> in Shangqiu City, China, at 68.5 kHz. Thus, the Oceanus watches will auto-synchronize themselves if one is to visit Europe, North America, Japan, or China (Multi-band 6 models). Not all American Oceanus watches carry the Multi-band 5 technology as it is relatively new.|$|R
50|$|One common {{style of}} {{radio-controlled}} clock uses <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> transmitted by dedicated terrestrial longwave radio transmitters, which emit a time code {{that can be}} demodulated and displayed by the radio controlled clock. The radio controlled clock will contain an accurate time base oscillator to maintain timekeeping if the radio signal is momentarily unavailable. Other radio controlled clocks use the <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> transmitted by dedicated transmitters in the shortwave bands. Systems using dedicated <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> stations can achieve accuracy of a few tens of milliseconds.|$|R
5000|$|The signal {{consists}} {{of a series of}} 300 ms [...] "pips" [...] of an [...] sine wave tone, each one starting at the top of each UTC second, up to ten seconds before the hour, followed by silence, and then a one second-long 800 Hz tone to mark the top of the hour. The CBC <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> is typically delayed by about 300 ms with respect to the CHU <b>time</b> <b>signal,</b> because each CBC radio station receives the actual <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> from Ottawa by satellite.|$|R
50|$|A <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> is a visible, audible, mechanical, or {{electronic}} signal used as {{a reference}} to determine the time of day. Church bells or voices announcing hours of prayer gave way to automatically operated s on public clocks; however, audible signals (even signal guns) have limited range. Busy ports used a visual signal, the dropping of a ball, to allow mariners to check the chronometers used for navigation. The advent of electrical telegraphs allowed widespread and precise distribution of <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> from central observatories. Railways {{were among the first}} customers for <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> which allowed synchronization of their operations over wide geographic areas. Special purpose radio <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> stations transmit a signal that allows automatic synchronization of clocks, and commercial broadcasters still include <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> in their programming. Today, GPS navigation radio signals are used to precisely distribute <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> over much of the world. There are many commercially available radio controlled clocks available to accurately indicate the local time, both for business and residential use. Computers often set their time from an internet atomic clock source. Where this is not available, a locally connected GPS receiver can precisely set the time using a software application. There are several such applications available to download from the internet.|$|R

50|$|Observatories {{had been}} selling exact {{time since the}} 1850s and {{transmitting}} the noon <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> via telegraph lines to customers, usually nearby cities and railroads. The signals were transmitted to sounders as second ticks and pauses that culminated in a noon <b>time</b> <b>signal.</b> The subscriber's clock could then be manually adjusted to exactly noon. For providing this exact time service there was a monthly or yearly charge. Observatories were affiliated with colleges or universities {{with the exception of}} the United States Naval Observatory (USNO), which is affiliated with the United States government. Competition for customers was keen between observatories, but by 1887 the USNO was recognized as the provider of Observatory Standard Time by the General Time Convention that had been convened by the country's railroads. This ended the intense competition for providing exact time. Western Union's time service distributed the <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> via its telegraph lines. Western Union had years of experience in transmitting USNO <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> and ultimately emerged as the provider of nationwide telegraph lines for the noon <b>time</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
