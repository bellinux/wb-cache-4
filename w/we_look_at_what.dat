We have shown that readers and visitors are mostly concerned with loss of pieces of objects, especially if text is also missing. In such cases, degradation becomes unacceptable, objects are considered unfit for use and thus damaged. However, we have also shown that the level of acceptance of degradation depends on the value of the object [1].|$|R
60|$|Partly {{for its own}} sake, {{partly for}} ours, this most {{distinctive}} feature of the Far East, its marked impersonality, is well worthy particular attention; for while it collaterally suggests pregnant thoughts about ourselves, it directly underlies the deeper oddities of a civilization which is the modern eighth wonder of the world. We shall see this as <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> these people are, at what they were, and at what they hope to become; not historically, but psychologically, as one might perceive, were he but wise enough, in an acorn, besides the nut itself, two oaks, that one from which it fell, and that other which from it will rise. These three states, which we may call its potential past, present, and future, may be observed and studied in three special outgrowths of a race's character: in its language, in its every-day thoughts, and in its religion. For {{in the language of}} a people we find embalmed the spirit of its past; in its every-day thoughts, be they of arts or sciences, is wrapped up its present life; in its religion lie enfolded its dreamings of a future. From out each of these three subjects in the Far East impersonality stares us in the face. Upon this quality as a foundation rests the Far Oriental character. It is individually rather than nationally that I propose to scan it now. It is the action of a particle in the wave of world-development I would watch, rather than the propagation of the wave itself. Inferences about the movement of the whole will follow of themselves a knowledge of the motion of its parts.|$|E

Spokesperson Nadine Bloch told the press that: [...] "What there was among the protesters Seattle was alternative tactics. Property destruction is something done to things, not to people.

5000|$|Echoing {{the concept}} of biodiversity, “bibliodiversity” refers {{to the need for}} a variety of {{publications}} to be available to readers within a given environment. Françoise Benhamou, a French specialist of economics of the arts and literature, gave this explanation in her speech at the Assises Internationales de l'Édition Indépendante (International Assembly on Independent Publishing): “In biodiversity, variety refers very simply to the number of species; in the book world, this would be the number of titles. Yet it is clearly insufficient to leave matters there. I will return to this point later. The second factor highlighted by {{the concept of}} biodiversity is balance, the balance between the species. If <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> that means in biodiversity we see the extremely simple idea that if you have several species but some are present in huge numbers while others are very scarce, the ones with many units are likely to eat or prevail over the others. This is {{what is happening in the}} book world where it is a matter for concern that the dominance of blockbusters on supermarket shelves and above all in bookstore displays is pushing out other offerings which are more difficult to promote.” ...|$|E

40|$|Long-lived {{plasma cells}} (LLPCs) that {{maintain}} humoral immunity to previously encountered Ags occupy a compartment {{in the bone}} marrow (BM). The rules and mechanisms by which cells enter (and leave) this compartment are poorly understood. <b>We</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> happens to the LLPC compartment and to plasma cell lifespan in general, in situations in which Ag stimulation and/or inflammation persist. We find that chronic Ag supply causes the generation of short-lived plasma cells in the local lymphoid organ, {{at the expense of}} any LLPC production. Furthermore, we find that inflammation caused by infection (mediated via TNF-α) causes a dramatic mobilization of LLPCs from the BM, with a concomitant reduction in circulating Ab levels against previously immunized Ags. These data are discussed {{in the context of the}} capacity of the BM LLPC compartment and competition for entry to it...|$|R

Finally, <b>we</b> have <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> moderating effect brand love has on the relationship between crisis and the dependent variables. We have answered these research questions by doing an experiment where we have used a made-up brand and a made-up crisis. Our main findings are that a crisis that affects the core values of a brand has a larger effect on purchase intention than a crisis that is related to the performance of a product. Also, brand love was found to dampen the effect a crisis had on purchase intention. nhhma...|$|R

We’ve also found that most users stop using graphical user inter- faces, as their primary user interface, as they get more experience with Git. They usually change their primary user interface to a command- line interface or start using both the graphical user interface and the command-line interface together.

A study done in 2010 <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the local food system of the Willamette Valley and compared the local agriculture with dietary needs for the population to determine if the valley could support itself. The study determined that the Willamette Valley does not meet any of the nutrient needs for a healthy diet given by the USDA for any of the food groups (Giombolini et al, 2010).
