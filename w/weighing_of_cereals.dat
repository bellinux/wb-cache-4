40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{regional}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production, trade and consumption. Significant regional differences were registered with regard to output, structure and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> production, trade and consumption from the standpoint of both continents and countries of the world. The differences may be attributed to numerous natural, social and economic factors. Countries having favorable environmental and climatic conditions, enhanced social, economic, scientific technical and technological standards are leading in both world production and export <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> In addition, thanks to the high standards of living the consumption <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> per capita in these countries is known to be comparatively low in relation to commodities of animal origin. On the other hand, underdeveloped and developing countries having unfavorable climatic conditions are known to produce a smaller part <b>of</b> the world <b>cereals</b> and to absorb a greater part of the world import <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> based commodities. Due to the lower living standard these countries are known to be considerable consumers <b>of</b> <b>cereals</b> per capita whereas the consumption of commodities of animal origin is considerably low...|$|R

40|$|The {{nutritional}} quality <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> foods {{is directly related}} to the nature of nutrient storage in cereal grains. Most cereal nutrients, such as carbohydrates and minerals, are st ructurally bound. Processing alters the structural organization <b>of</b> the <b>cereal</b> grain. Results obtained from many nutritional studies indicate that the structure and physical form <b>of</b> a <b>cereal</b> food greatly influence the availability of its nutrients. Using oats and wheat as examples, this review demonstrates how microscopy contributes to understanding the relationship between cereal structures and the availability <b>of</b> nutrients in <b>cereal</b> foods. Various forms of food microscopy play important roles in revealing structural changes <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> foods that result from processing, cooking and enzymatic reactions. These changes directly affect the digestibility of starch, phytate and dietary fiber in oats and wheat. The present review also examines the effects of undigested fiber and phytate on the absorption of minerals in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. Food Microscopy is a potential tool for studying the mineral binding property <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> bran components...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{antioxidant}} component <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> dietary fibre starting from its chemical structure, bioavailability and biological meaning. The slow and continuous release in the gut of the dietary fibre bound antioxidants could explain many health benefits <b>of</b> <b>cereals.</b> The soluble component <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> antioxidant dietary fibre is the most suitable vehicle to bring phenolic compounds into the lower gut. These compounds cannot be absorbed when are bound to the polysaccharide moiety, becoming available for gut microflora. Moreover, those linked to the soluble dietary fibre can be hydrolyzed by bacterial esterases and absorbed into the bloodstream where they might prevent LDL oxidation. The action of phenolic acids is combined with the prebiotic activity <b>of</b> <b>cereal</b> dietary fibre which likely explains the positive action of whole grain based diet on weight management. Data of in vitro and human studies supporting this view will be illustrated...|$|R
