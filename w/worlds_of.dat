5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} <b>Worlds</b> <b>of</b> Tomorrow, another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 {{that it would be better}} to have Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both <b>Worlds</b> <b>of</b> Tomorrow and Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue <b>Worlds</b> <b>of</b> Tomorrow was merged with If, though it was another year before Galaxy actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, If had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E

5|$|The Magical <b>Worlds</b> <b>of</b> Harry Potter: A Treasury of Myths, Legends, and Fascinating Facts is a {{guide to}} the fictional Harry Potter universe, written by David Colbert. It explores the {{references}} to history, legends, and literature in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Colbert conceived the idea for The Magical <b>Worlds</b> <b>of</b> Harry Potter while quizzing his nephew and nieces about the mythological references in the novels. He later wrote the book while teaching a seminar on self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. The book was published in March 2001, without approval from Rowling, and has since received positive reviews from critics. An updated version of The Magical <b>Worlds</b> <b>of</b> Harry Potter was published in 2004 by Berkley Books.|$|E

2500|$|According to Kant, the {{categorical}} imperative {{is possible}} because whilst {{we can be}} thought of as members of both <b>of</b> these <b>worlds</b> (understanding and appearance), it is the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding that “contains the ground <b>of</b> the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense [...] and so too of its laws.” What this means is that the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding is more fundamental than or ‘grounds’ the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding, also applies to the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense as well, because the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding has priority. To put the point slightly differently: Because the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> sense too. So the moral law binds us even in the <b>world</b> <b>of</b> appearances.|$|R

50|$|Wargaming {{has created}} more than 15 titles, {{the most popular}} being the online action game <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tanks. <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tanks created a new market niche of slow-paced military-history PvP games, which the company {{expanded}} in the following years by releasing the flight MMO <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Warplanes (2013), the cross-platform action game <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tanks Blitz (2014), the turn-based collectible card game <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tanks Generals (2015), and the naval warfare MMO <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Warships (2015).

50|$|Like Torg, the Masterbook system {{utilized}} two complementary {{forms of}} in-game conflict resolution: a unified dice mechanic, {{which was based}} on a roll of two ten-sided dice, and a game-specific deck of cards (the MasterDeck, similar to the Drama Deck in Torg) that influenced random number generation, character actions, and the game's plot. Masterbook was used for several licensed properties, most notably The <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Indiana Jones (1994), The <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Necroscope (1995), The <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Aden (1996), The <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Species (1995), The <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tales from the Crypt (1996), and The <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Tank Girl (1995).

5|$|Driberg made {{no secret}} of his homosexuality, which he practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in the <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets {{is seen as a}} good thing, Athshe is seen as changed for the worse both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired. This trauma accounts for the recurring themes in his films, which explore the <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
50|$|Representing purely {{material}} existence, it {{is known}} as the <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Action, the <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Effects or the <b>World</b> <b>of</b> Making.

5|$|Mitsuda {{returned}} {{as the lead}} composer for 1999s Chrono Cross after composing its predecessor, Chrono Trigger. After being contacted to compose the score by the game's director Masato Kato, Mitsuda decided to center his work around old world cultural influences, including Mediterranean, Fado, Celtic, and percussive African music. To complement the theme of parallel worlds, he gave the songs for the two <b>worlds</b> <b>of</b> the game, Another and Home, respectively dark and bright moods. Mitsuda was happy to accomplish even half of what he envisioned. Once production concluded, Mitsuda played Chrono Cross to record his impressions and observe how the tracks intermingled with scenes.|$|E
5|$|Ninja Gaiden {{has been}} {{renowned for its}} {{elaborate}} story and usage of anime-like cinematic cutscenes.

Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
