30|$|The {{prices of}} camel hides also varied at primary-market level, {{depending}} on the curing methods. Sun-dried hide prices ranged from KES 150 to 300 (US$ 1.9 to 3.8), while <b>wet-salted</b> hide prices ranged from KES 400 to 600 (US$ 5 to 7.6). There were no raw hides as they were cured at the stores. At the tanneries, the prices of sun-dried camel hides ranged from KES 400 to 500 (US$ 5 to 6.3), while the <b>wet-salted</b> hides were sold from KES 700 to 800 (US$ 8.8 to 10). This study also revealed that camel hides were sold to five tanneries in Kenya, including Aziz Din, Mnasi, Zogo, Sagana and Bata leather tanneries (in Limuru town), and to the leather industries of Kenya in Thika town.|$|E

5000|$|As {{opposed to}} dry salting, fish brining or <b>wet-salting</b> is {{performed}} by immersion of fish into brine, or just sprinkling it with salt without draining the moisture. To ensure long-term preservation, the solution has to contain at least 20% of salt, {{a process called}} [...] "heavy salting" [...] in fisheries; heavy-salted fish must be desalted in cold water or milk before consumption. If less salt is used, the fish is suited for immediate consumption, but additional refrigeration is necessary for longer preservation.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{geographic}} {{conditions in}} the Philippines, native fish are preserved to combat rapid spoilage which includes preservation by drying, salting and smoking. In drying, large fishes are usually used to make daing while smaller fishes are used to make cuyo. Salting and <b>wet-salting</b> is a popular practice {{in areas that are}} relatively remote from large markets due to seasonality of fishing season. While smoking fish or the process of making tinapa is done by brining, cooking and smoking that is usually done in places surrounding Manila Bay such as Bataan and Rizal.|$|R
50|$|Preparing hides {{begins by}} curing them with salt. Curing is {{employed}} to prevent putrefaction of the protein substance (collagen) from bacterial growth {{during the time}} lag from procuring the hide to when it is processed. Curing removes water from the hides and skins using a difference in osmotic pressure. The moisture content of hides and skins is greatly reduced, and osmotic pressure increased, {{to the point that}} bacteria are unable to grow. In <b>wet-salting,</b> the hides are heavily salted, then pressed into packs for about 30 days. In brine-curing, the hides are agitated in a saltwater bath for about 16 hours. Curing can also be accomplished by preserving the hides and skins at very low temperatures.|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of salt concentration level and season on chemical composition of <b>wet-salted</b> fermented product (local name; fassiekh) processed from new two fish species (Labeo spp, local name; Debs, Schilbe spp local name Shilbaya) compared with popular fassiekh fish species (Hydrocynus spp, local name: Kass), in reducing the over fishing and use of Alestes and Hydrocynus spp. in fassiekh production in the Sudan. A assorted of 12 Kgs of each of three fassiekh fish species group, consisted of Hydrocynus spp; (25 - 30 cm in total length), Labeo spp (20 - 25 cm in total length) and Schilbe sp. (17 - 22 cm in total length) were collected from Jebel Aulia Dam landing. Fish species were transferred to Khartoum fishing company for processing of fassiekh product. The samples were divided into 3 batches with three replicates. Each batch was treated with different common salt concentration level (20 %, 25 %, 33 % and 0 % as a control). The findings of the study clearly revealed, the chemical composition of fresh salted-fermented product showed no significant differences between Labeo and Hydrocynus spp. while Schilbe sp. recorded significantly higher fat content. The salt concentration level on studied fish species resulted in an increase in crude protein and ash content than fresh fish. The highest salt level (33 %) resulted in significantly lower moisture content, and produced well <b>wet-salted</b> fermented product with reasonably long storage shelf life. The effect of different season's production time on <b>wet-salted</b> fermented product showed no significant differences in final product of wet-slated fermented fish species chemically. But there were differences in the duration of processing time, depending on ambient temperature. The study concluded that, the best fish species for production of fassiekh product was the Labeo sp. in winter time with 25 % slat concentration level treatment. The second and third were Hydrocyun sp. and Shelibe sp. respectively at the same slat concentration level of treatment and season time...|$|E
40|$|Fillets of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were <b>wet-salted</b> in brines of pH 6. 5 and 8. 5 {{containing}} {{different combinations}} of NaCl, KCl, MgCl 2 and CaCl 2, then dry-salted in NaCl. Proximate analyses, functional properties (water holding capacity and protein solubility) and hardness were determined in the dry-salted cod. The compositions of the protein fractions soluble in water and in 0. 86 M sodium chloride were determined by SDS-PAGE. The composition and pH of the brines slightly affected the protein composition of the major extract constituents and the functional properties of the muscle after dry-salting. Brining at alkaline pH produced a larger variety of water-soluble proteins, particularly actin, than at pH 6. 5. Furthermore, the compositions of the protein fractions extracted with 0. 86 M NaCl were very similar for both pHs, irrespective of {{the composition of the}} brine; in this case, myosin heavy chains were absent in both extracts due to aggregation caused by a massive uptake of salt by the muscle.

40|$|Today's {{population}} faces great {{difficulties in}} fish marketing, {{although it is}} very valuable food. The classic supply with fresh fish has little influence on its consumption, which is not remarkable anyhow. Therefore one shulud be reminded on the classic, almost forgotten, ways of fish processing that can substantially increase fish assortment and improve its distribution. After cleaning and cutting the fish (primary procedures in its processing), comes salting, after which the salted fish can become an end-product {{or it can be}} one of many semi-products in the fish production chain. The most common methods of fish salting are dry-salting, dry-wet-salting (Greek-Dalmatian) and <b>wet-salting</b> (pickling). The aim of fish drying is its dehydratation. Our country has the experience of traditional drying, sun-drying and natural drying of fish. Each of these has its own special qualities, depending on the fish species and the drying temperature. Smoked fish gets a very distinctive and spicy aroma and a specific colour. There are two kinds of smoking - cold and warm - based on the smoke derived from burning some special trees or, lately, from smoke preparations. Marinades are old procedures of fish processing in acetic acid and specific spices which can be prepared cold, fried or cooked. Fish-roe of some specific fish species has a special value and is considered a delicacy. The most precious black caviar is derived from the sturgeon roe and some of its related species...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of heavy salted cod (bacalao) {{has changed from}} being a single-step process salting to a multistep procedure. The {{aim of this study}} was to gain a deeper understanding of water retention and yields of heavy salted cod as influenced by salting procedures. The effects of different pre-salting methods (injection and brining, brining only, and pickling) were compared to a single kench salting step. The products were evaluated at different stages of the process: after pre-salting, dry salting, storage and rehydration, with regard to changes in yields, chemical content and salt-induced changes in muscle proteins and microstructure. Injection was significantly different from other methods in increasing weight yields through brining, dry salting and rehydration. Salt concentrations of the brine did not influence the weight yields of dry-salted and rehydrated products. However, salt concentrations > 20 % had negative effects on the colour and commercial quality of the salted products. Addition of phosphates increased weight yield of salted but not of rehydrated products. Effects on quality varied between trials; both negative and positive effects were observed. Strong salting-out effects on proteins were seen due to high salt contents in the salted products regardless of the procedures applied. The effects of salting procedures on yields and quality of heavy salted cod products were related to the pathway of solubilisation, denaturation and aggregation of proteins in the muscle. Myosin was less aggregated when injection was applied during pre-salting. A greater degree of protein aggregation correlated with higher initial salt concentrations and dehydration during the first days of salting, which was obtained with brining, pickling and kench salting. In addition, these methods resulted in stronger enzymatic degradation of proteins, shown as an increase in lower molecular weight subunits. The connective tissue in the muscle was believed to play an important role in water retention of the muscle. Microstructural analysis of the dry-salted fillets showed that the intercellular spaces in injected and brined fillets were increased compared to only brining. However, the cross-sectional area of the fish fibres was similar in both groups. Based on this, the main reason for higher weight yields of injected products after salting and rehydration were believed to result from irreversible effects on the connective tissue in the muscle and better retention of myosin structure, thereby better water-holding. The drawback of the <b>wet-salting</b> methods (brining and injection) was that the yield of nitrogenous compounds was lower for injected and brine-salted fillets. However, the main changes were due to higher losses of non-protein nitrogen, which is more likely to influence the organoleptic properties of the products than the weight yields...|$|R
40|$|Colombia uses a closed-cycle captive {{breeding}} {{program for}} producing Caiman crocodilus (mostly C. c. fuscus) skins for export. Skin size limits {{are used as}} a regulatory measure to exclude illegal wild-caught adults entering legal trade. However, the size limits employed were not well defined by morphological endpoints, {{and the degree of}} shrinkage between raw and processed skins was not well grounded in science. Thus, trimming and cutting of skins to meet market demand makes compliance with the limits problematic. We examined the relationship between C. crocodilus total length (TL) in freshly culled animals and the size of whole skins and skin pieces at different stages of preservation and tanning (raw <b>wet-salted,</b> wet blue, crust, and finished leather) in 276 farm-raised C. crocodilus (423 â 2, 210 mm TL). We present formulae for accurately predicting the TL of Caimans from which whole skins or skin pieces originated. To account for tail tip amputations, we used standardized total length (TLST). The results provide resource agencies in Colombia better tools for establishing meaningful size limits, and provide the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with a better mechanism for assisting Colombia with compliance. This approach may have application to the regulation of other species of reptile in trade, where size limits are part of the regulatory procedures...|$|E
