As part of this effort, the NSNFP developed a standardized canister for interim storage and transportation of SNF. These canisters will be built and sealed to American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III, Division 3 requirements. Packaging SNF usually is a three-step process: canister loading, closure welding, and closure weld verification. After loading SNF into the canisters, the canisters must be seal welded and the welds verified {{using a combination of}} visual, surface eddy current, and ultrasonic inspection or examination techniques. If unacceptable defects in the weld are detected, the defective sections of weld must be removed, re-welded, and re-inspected. Due to the high contamination and/or radiation fields involved with this process, all of these functions must be performed remotely in a hot cell. The prototype apparatus to perform these functions is a floor-mounted carousel that encircles the loaded canister; three stations perform the functions of welding, inspecting, and repairing the seal welds.

40|$|An ongoing {{continuous}} process of automatization {{of the production}} lines is used in industry to reduce production costs. Automatization of quality control {{should be seen as}} part of a cost reduction process, as well as of quality control of the welding. Mostly the time-consuming and expensive checking procedure of the weld joint is carried out off-line by an experienced <b>welding</b> <b>operator.</b> The need for automatic quality control is thus great in order to achieve higher cost efficiency. The present thesis focus on the weld quality of pulsed, short-circuiting and spray Gas Metal Arc welding. The purpose is to design algorithms to detect defects on-line and automatically during a robotic welding pass using the measured weld voltage and current. Experiments with different specimens are performed in order to cause defects in weld joints and introduce symptoms in the measured signals. The defects produced in the weld joint are found to be of two main kinds. In pulsed welding, burn-through occurs. In spray arc and short-circuiting welding, the size of the weld was reduced. The two types of defects and their relation to the measured welding voltage and current are discussed. The environment around the measurements is highly disturbed by electrical noise. Several measurement techniques is used accordingly in order to prevent interference of the measurements. To obtain a reliable detection, features which are sensitive to changes in the weld process must be extracted from the measured signals. Features which are suggested in other works of this field, and features which are obtained through observation of the measured signals from the experiments of the present thesis are investigated. The investigation shows that the mean and variance of the weld voltage and current yield promising results when welding in short-circuiting and spray mode due to the robustness of the extracted features. When welding in pulsed mode, the prediction error from an autoregressive model with extra input is used as a feature. The extracted features are fed into a detection algorithm to further enhance the signal to noise ratio of the resulting test quantity. The filtering of the features is then compared to a threshold. Six statistical detection algorithms for weld quality have been designed and tested on measured data. Two methods have been applied to pulsed GMA welding, one for short-circuiting welding and three for the spray arc welding. The results obtained from the experiments shows {{that it is possible to}} detect changes in the weld quality both automaticall...|$|E

40|$|Manual metal {{arc welding}} can be a {{hazardous}} practice if proper precautions are not taken. The welding procedure uses an open electric arc between an electrode and the metals to be joined. Besides the obvious risks of burns and inflammation of the cornea, which are prevented by using proper personal protective equipment, the operator may also {{be subject to the}} risk of electric shock from the exposed parts of the welding circuit, both the electrode and the workpiece. In addition, the welding current, by straying from the intended path, can cause localized heating of parts, with the risks of triggering fires and/or explosive atmospheres. Because of the high current required by the arc <b>welding</b> equipment, <b>operators</b> are exposed also to strong electromagnetic fields.

40|$|The {{quality of}} welding {{processes}} {{is governed by}} the occurring induced distortions yielding an increase in production costs due to necessary reworking. Especially for more complex specimens, {{it is difficult to}} evaluate the optimal configuration of welding sequences in order to minimize the distortion. Even experienced <b>welding</b> <b>operators</b> can solve this task only by trial and error which is time and cost consuming. In modern engineering the application of welding simulation is already known to be able to analyse the heat effects of welding virtually. However, the welding process is governed by complex physical interactions. Thus, recent weld thermal models are based on many simplifications. The state of the art is to apply numerical methods in order to solve the transient heat conduction equat ion. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} use the real process parameters as input for the mathematical model. The model parameters which allow calculating a temperature field that is in best agreement with the experiments cannot be defined directly but inversely by multiple simulations runs. In case of numerical simulation software based on finite discretization schemes this approach is very time consuming and requires expert users. The weld thermal model contains an initial weakness which has to be adapted by finding an optimal set of model parameters. This process of calibration is often done against few experiments. The range of model validity is limited. An extension can be obtained by performing a calibration against multiple experiments. The focus of the paper is to show a combined mode lling technique which provides an efficient solution of the inverse heat conduction problem mentioned above. On the one hand the inverse problem is solved by application of fast weld thermal models which are closed form solutions of the heat conduction equation. In addition, a global optimization algorithm allows an automated calibration of the weld thermal model. This technique is able to provide a temperature field automatically that fits the experimental one with high accuracy within minutes on ordinary office computers. This fast paradigm permits confirming the application of welding simulation in an industrial environment as automotive industry. On the other hand, the initial model weakness is compensated by calibrating the model against multiple experiments. The unknown relationship between model and process parameters is approximated by a neural network. The validity of the model is increased successively and enables to decrease experimental effort. For a test case, it is shown that this approach yields accurate temperature fields within very short amount of time for unknown process parameters as input data to the model contributing to the requirement to construct a substitute system of the real welding process...|$|R
500|$|The basic {{technique}} for GMAW is quite simple, since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch (head of tip). By contrast, in gas tungsten arc welding, the welder must handle a welding torch {{in one hand}} and a separate filler wire in the other, and in shielded metal arc <b>welding,</b> the <b>operator</b> must frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes. GMAW requires only that the <b>operator</b> guide the <b>welding</b> gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded. [...] Keeping a consistent contact tip-to-work distance (the stick out distance) is important, because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas. Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications. The orientation of the gun is also importantit should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces; that is, at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface. The travel angle, or lead angle, is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel, and it should generally remain approximately vertical. However, the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas usedwith pure inert gases, the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section, while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide.|$|R
