25|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the Abhidharma is Nirvana and hence the Abhidharmikas systematized dharmas into those which are skillful (kusala), purify the mind and lead to liberation, and those which are unskillful and do not. The Abhidharma then has a soteriological purpose, first and foremost and its goal is to support Buddhist practice and meditation. By carefully watching the coming and going of dhammas, {{and being able to}} identify <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>are</b> wholesome and to be cultivated, and <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>are</b> unwholesome and to be abandoned, the Buddhist meditator makes use of the Abhidharma as a schema to liberate his mind and realize that all experiences are impermanent, not-self, unsatisfactory and therefore not to be clung to.|$|E

The Court denounced any efforts to draw this distinction, whether based on the historical record or on historical grounds, as arbitrary and likely to be suffused with the prejudices of an unelected branch of government as to which governmental functions are proper and traditional and <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>are</b> not.|$|E

Muller defined a local structure or adjacency labeling scheme for a graph [...] in a given family [...] of graphs to be an assignment of an -bit identifier to each vertex of , together with an algorithm (that may depend on [...] but is independent of the individual graph [...] ) that takes as input two vertex identifiers and determines {{whether or not they}} are the endpoints of an edge in [...] That is, this type of implicit representation is analogous to an adjacency matrix: it is straightforward to check whether two vertices are adjacent but finding the neighbors of any vertex may involve looping through all vertices and testing <b>which</b> <b>ones</b> <b>are</b> neighbors.|$|E
