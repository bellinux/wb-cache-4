5|$|Marrash {{was famous}} for the salon she held in the home she shared with her husband. She had {{travelled}} to Europe once, and was impressed by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> of life there. As related by Joseph Zeidan:Upon her return in Aleppo, Maryana Marrash turned her house into a gathering place {{for a group of}} celebrated writers who met there on a regular basis to cultivate each other's friendship and discuss literature, music, and political and social issues.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{resigned}} from her {{position at the}} U.S. Department of Transportation in order {{to blow the whistle}} on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as deficiencies in safety practices by the federal government's oversight of the airline industry. She was publicly critical of high-ranking U.S. aviation officials regarding the ValuJet Flight 592 passenger jet crash in the Florida Everglades which resulted in the deaths of all 110 people aboard. Schiavo appeared on ABC's Nightline program the night after the crash and was highly critical of FAA safety inspections methods. After resigning her position as Inspector General Schiavo taught courses at Ohio State University, and in April 1997 she joined the staff of Ohio State University in the position of Enarson Executive-in-Residence.|$|E

6000|$|Her companion's interest, however, {{was all for}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> herself <b>saw.</b> [...] "You mean she'll {{immediately}} speak?" [...] Mrs. Stringham gathered {{that this}} was what Milly meant, but it left still a question. [...] "How will it be against him that you know him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{court said}} that [...] "among the accused, Webb {{presented}} the strongest alibi". The lower courts, however, reasoned that [...] "Webb's alibi cannot stand against Alfaro's positive identification of him." [...] The {{court said that}} Alfaro was not a credible witness and that her [...] "story of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> personally <b>saw</b> must be believable, not inherently contrived".|$|R
5|$|With Esther's {{character}} based loosely {{on her own}} adolescence, Randall {{was inspired}} to write the film's script by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{as a lack of}} role models for teenage girls. In 2002, the script earned her a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme, where she developed the project, and it was later picked up by Tama Films. Randall returned to Australia for casting, and Catanzariti was eventually chosen in the lead role after she attended an audition for minor roles and extras. Production spanned from October to December 2006, with filming taking place in Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney, New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Annie sees Ethan and {{promises}} {{not to tell}} Naomi <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw.</b> They part ways for lunch, and Annie meets Silver (Jessica Stroup); however, Naomi pulls Annie away, explaining that Silver makes insulting YouTube videos about people. Naomi invites Annie to her birthday party, and they decide to go shopping together. Harry and guidance counselor Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) and Mr.Matthews meet with Naomi's parents, who feel that Naomi {{should not have to}} hand in her assignments on time when she is planning her party. Before she leaves, Naomi's mother, Tracy (Christina Moore), reminds Harry that they dated in high school. Naomi receives a text message from her mother, telling her that she must complete the assignment that night. Annie remembers that she completed a similar assignment for her old school, and offers to give Naomi a copy for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Geetha arrests Rambabu and his family, and Veerabhadram uses {{force to}} beat the truth out of them. As Rambabu, Jyothi and Anju are {{severely}} injured, Geetha's husband, Prabhakar, asks her {{to put a stop}} to this. Out of fear, Anu reveals <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> and Varun's friend describes the transgression at the camp. After digging up the compost pit, the police find the carcass of a pig instead of Varun's body, indicating that Rambabu had already moved it. Jyothi's brother, Rajesh, and her father call the media and Anu complains to them about Veerabhadram's ill-treatment of her family. After Veerabhadram manhandles Rambabu and his relatives, he is beaten by the local people who learn about him from the media. Rambabu's goodwill remains intact and all the locals extend their support to him. Veerabhadram is suspended, the remaining staff transferred, and Geetha resigns from her post as IG.|$|E
50|$|In November 2008, McRobbie {{published}} {{her most}} recent book The Aftermath of Feminism: Gender, Culture and Social Change, reflecting on <b>what</b> <b>she</b> earlier <b>saw</b> as an overly optimistic declaration of feminist success. She describes writing the book by constantly “drawing on contemporary empirical research … I was kind of filtering it, re-reading it, or I was drawing from a whole field of 20 years of research”.|$|R

5000|$|Other {{travellers}} {{were perhaps}} less given to hyperbole. Celia Fiennes, for example, {{who made her}} journey between 1684 and 1703, (Through England on a side saddle), was more matter-of fact and more a reporter of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> actually <b>saw</b> - giving us [...] "the last truly unconditioned reflex to Cumberland landscape", according to Nicholson. However, she still talked of [...] "the desart and barren rocky hills" [...] of Westmorland.|$|R
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{covered the}} deaths of the men with a photo essay, including photographs by Cornell Capa and some taken by the five men before their deaths. The ensuing worldwide publicity gave several missionary organizations significant more visibility, especially in the United States and Latin America. Most notable among these was the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), the organization for which both Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint worked. Because of the martyrdom of her brother, Saint considered herself spiritually bonded to the Huaorani, believing that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as his sacrifice for the Huaorani was symbolic of Christ's death for the salvation of humanity. In 1957, Saint and her Huaorani companion Dayuma toured across the United States and appeared on the television show This Is Your Life. The two also appeared in a Billy Graham crusade in New York City, contributing to Saint's increasing popularity among evangelical Christians and generating significant monetary donations for SIL.|$|E
5|$|Zoe {{is found}} not guilty of Sarah's murder, due to the court believing Sarah {{committed}} suicide. After Lydia catches Mike kissing Zoe, she goes to Amy and tells her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw,</b> and tells her she believes Zoe {{is trying to get}} Mike on her side {{to make it look like}} she is innocent. Lydia expresses her doubts with Mike, still trying to blame Zoe for Sarah's death. However, after realising she could try to get Zoe on her side, she pleads with her to forgive her and move into the Barnes family home. An angry Zoe throws her out. Zoe then approaches Lydia and apologises. The pair slowly become friends. However, Zoe is only pretending in order to get a confession. Lydia and Zoe kiss as part of Zoe's plan to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Mike throws Zoe out of the flat.|$|E

60|$|But {{now there}} was some {{cautious}} stir in the house; and Florence found that Mrs Pipchin had been awakened by {{one of those who}} sat up, had risen and had gone down to her father's door. Stealing lower down the stairs, and observing <b>what</b> passed, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her father come out in his morning gown, and start when he was told his wife had not come home. He dispatched a messenger to the stables to inquire whether the coachman was there; and while the man was gone, dressed himself very hurriedly.|$|R

5000|$|Madame Xanadu {{appears in}} the Young Justice episode [...] "Denial" [...] voiced by Cree Summer in an {{affected}} Creole accent. In {{a radical departure from}} her comic book counterpart, Xanadu is portrayed as a New Orleans-based con artist who uses sleight of hand tricks to swindle unsuspecting customers. Despite this, Kent Nelson mentions that she has the [...] "perfect aura for the work". When Abra Kadabra abducts Kent Nelson, Madame Xanadu flees upon seeing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> just <b>saw.</b> The show's creator Greg Weisman has commented that there's [...] "more to her story," [...] implying she may reveal actual powers in a future episode.|$|R
25|$|With {{popularity}} came {{controversy over}} the show's suitability for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as the show's frightening and gory content. John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and was heard {{to say that he}} looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.|$|E
25|$|On a date {{already set}} for a week before she died, Catherine had {{intended}} to formally announce that Paul would be excluded from the succession, and that the crown would go to her eldest grandson, Alexander (whom she greatly favoured, and who subsequently became the emperor Alexander I in 1801). Her harshness towards Paul probably stemmed as much from political distrust as from <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> of his character. Keeping Paul {{in a state of}} semi-captivity in Gatchina and Pavlovsk, she resolved not to allow her son to dispute or to share in her authority during her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln Cathedral {{reportedly}} received £100,000 {{in exchange}} for the right to film there, with filming there occurring between August 15 and 19, 2005, mainly within the cloisters of the cathedral. The cathedral's bell, which strikes the hour, was silent {{for the first time since}} World War II during that time. Although it remained a closed set, protesters led by a 61-year-old woman named Sister Mary Michael demonstrated against the filming. Sister Mary Michael spent 12 hours praying on her knees outside the cathedral in protest against <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as the blasphemous use of a holy place to film a book containing heresy.|$|E
6000|$|With the {{circular}} in her hand, Honora went thoughtfully {{up the stairs}} to her sitting-room. The month was February, the day overcast and muggy, and she stood for a while apparently watching the holes made in the snow by the steady drip from the cap of the garden wall. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> really <b>saw</b> was the face of Mrs. Israel Simpson, a face that had haunted her these many months. For Mrs. Simpson had gradually grown, in Honora's mind, to typify the hardness of heart of Grenoble. With Grenoble obdurate, what would become of the larger ambitions of Hugh Chiltern? ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was dead}} silence now, the moon, pale, inquisitive, brilliant, peeped {{in through the}} window to see <b>what</b> was amiss. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> a number of men recoiling, awestruck, from a small group {{composed}} of a dead man and of the first gentleman in the land self-confessed as a murderer. No one dared to speak, the moment was too solemn, too terrible, for any speech save a half-smothered sigh of horror.|$|R

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1887, Addams read in a {{magazine}} about the new idea of starting a settlement house. She decided to visit the world's first, Toynbee Hall, in London. She and several friends, including Ellen Gates Starr, traveled in Europe from December 1887 through {{the summer of}} 1888. After watching a bullfight in Madrid, fascinated by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as an exotic tradition, Addams condemned this fascination and her inability to feel outraged at {{the suffering of the}} horses and bulls. At first, Addams told no one about her dream to start a settlement house; but, she felt increasingly guilty for not acting on her dream. Believing that sharing her dream might help her to act on it, she told Ellen Gates Starr. Starr loved the idea and agreed to join Addams in starting a settlement house.|$|E
25|$|In September 1967 Mendleson {{went up to}} the University of Essex to read English Literature and American History. In May 1968 {{she went}} to Paris, to join in the student {{political}} rising; <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> had a great effect on her political thinking. In 1969 she dropped out of her university course rather than continue into her final year, but remained living in Wivenhoe around the university for several months. In early 1970 she was living in York Way in the King's Cross area of London, and was a close friend of a group including some university friends who were living a semi-communal life in Stamford Hill; among them was Hilary Creek. Mendleson and Creek were supporting a group which had squatted empty flats in Arbour Square in Stepney. She became a friend of Jim Greenfield after meeting him on leaving a political meeting.|$|E
500|$|Her {{creative}} {{partnership with}} the comparatively unknown Rusko grew {{from a sense of}} frustration at <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track [...] "Tell Me Why", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because [...] "her boyfriend really hates me".|$|E
6000|$|There was a pause. Beatrice, who had sat quite silent, was {{gathering}} up her strength to answer. Elizabeth, watching her from beneath her hand, {{thought that she}} read upon her face irresolution, softening into consent. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> really <b>saw</b> was but doubt as to the fittest and most certain manner of refusal. Like lightning it flashed into Elizabeth's mind that she must strike now, or hold her hand for ever. If once Beatrice spoke that fatal [...] "yes," [...] her revelations might be of no avail. And Beatrice would speak it; {{she was sure she}} would. It was a golden road out of her troubles.|$|R
60|$|They were {{standing}} on the boat-deck, leaning over the rail. Jill caught her breath. For the first time since disaster had come upon her she was conscious of a rising of her spirits. It is impossible to behold the huge buildings which fringe the harbour of New York without a sense of expectancy and excitement. There had remained in Jill's mind from childhood memories a vague picture of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> now <b>saw,</b> but it had been feeble and inadequate. The sight of this towering city seemed somehow to blot out everything that had gone before. The feeling of starting afresh was strong upon her.|$|R
60|$|So that, pale, shut, at last {{distant and}} impersonal, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{no longer the}} child, how his eyes danced, or how he had a queer little soul {{that could not be}} bothered with shaping {{handwriting}} so long as he dashed down <b>what</b> he thought. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> no children, only the task that was to be done. And keeping her eyes there, on the task, and not on the child, she was impersonal enough to punish where she could otherwise only have sympathized, understood, and condoned, to approve where she would have been merely uninterested before. But her interest had no place any more.|$|R
500|$|In December 1994, she {{attended}} {{a conference on}} the Nanking Massacre, held in Cupertino, California, and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> and heard at the conference motivated her to write The Rape of Nanking. [...] As she wrote {{in the introduction to}} the book, while she was at the conference, she was [...] "suddenly in a panic that this terrifying disrespect for death and dying, this reversion in human social evolution, would be reduced to a footnote of history, treated like a harmless glitch in a computer program that might or might not again cause a problem, unless someone forced the world to remember it." ...|$|E
500|$|Laubenstein {{was also}} an outspoken AIDS activist and criticized the American {{government}} for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as a reluctance to combat the AIDS epidemic. She was also critical of the Catholic Church for its treatment of lesbians and gay men. Some of her opinions caused controversy among other gay activists, such as her call to close gay bathhouses to discourage unsafe sexual behaviors and therefore reduce HIV transmission. Playwright Larry Kramer, who befriended Laubenstein after she cared for his partner, who died from AIDS, {{said that she was}} [...] "probably the first doctor to suggest that we [...] stop having sex altogether".|$|E
500|$|Shelley {{specifically}} addressed gender {{politics in}} her {{biography of the}} 16th-century poet Vittoria Colonna, highlighting her literary achievements, her [...] "virtues, talents, and beauty", and her interest in politics. However, Shelley was careful to describe feminine virtues in their historical context throughout the Italian Lives. For example, her analysis of the cavalier servente system in Italy, which allowed married women to take lovers, was rooted in an understanding that many marriages {{at the time were}} made not for love, but for profit. She refused to indict any particular woman for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> as the faults of a larger system.|$|E
6000|$|... "I regret nothing," [...] said Ralph firmly. She leant {{towards him}} {{almost as if}} she could thus see <b>what</b> he <b>saw.</b> <b>She</b> thought how obscure he still was to her, save only that more and more {{constantly}} he appeared to her a fire burning through its smoke, a source of life.|$|R

500|$|A five-year {{investigation}} into {{accounts of the}} chupacabra, a well known cryptid, revealed that the original sighting report of the creature in Puerto Rico by Madeline Tolentino may {{have been inspired by}} the character Sil. This was detailed in paranormal investigator and skeptic Benjamin Radford's book Tracking the Chupacabra. According to Virginia Fugarino of Memorial University of Newfoundland writing for the Journal of Folklore Research, Radford found a link between the original eyewitness report and the design of Sil in her alien form, and hypothesized that [...] ", which [...] did see before her sighting, influenced <b>what</b> <b>she</b> believes <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> of the chupacabra." ...|$|R
