5|$|The writers {{intended}} to play off {{the idea of}} a hidden character being able to hear conversations revealing secrets. An initial idea of Pemberton's was to have a large parcel on a table at the birthday party, but with Maggie—on whose birthday the episode would be set—absent. Other characters would repeatedly ask where Maggie was, until it was revealed that her head was in the parcel. This idea developed into the possibility of a hollow cake hiding a character, a device used in the final episode. For the writers, there is humour in characters spending time talking earnestly to a cake; they noted that the prop cake had features resembling a face. In the editing stage, the production team kept reintroducing the cake in order to remind viewers of its presence. The original script ended with a knife being plunged into a fake cake followed by the revelation, contrary to viewers' expectations, that no one was under it at the time; instead, the writers upped the drama in the story, making it possible that any of the characters injured. For the writers, the original plot was, in a sense, darker, as some characters got away with wrongdoing in a <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not in the final version.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{his later}} books {{were devoted to}} the study of animal {{emotions}} and psychology; The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex in 1871 and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals in 1872. Darwin's work inspired William James's functionalist approach to psychology. Darwin's theories of evolution, adaptation, and natural selection have provided insight into why brains function the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|Media {{are more}} similar than {{different}} – Psychologically speaking, a computer {{is not much}} different from a television and a sophisticated version of a technology is remarkably similar to a simpler version of the technology. As Reeves and Nass (1996) say, “social and natural responses come from people, not from media themselves,” (p.252). In other words, the media does not make people react the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{inability}} to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, is a core deficit in Autism. Children with Autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent any other <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> <b>do</b> {{not know how}} to communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with Autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be verbal or non-verbal. Children with Autism require intensive intervention to learn how to communicate their intent.|$|E
25|$|The Step Up {{campaign}} {{is a program}} that helps students prevent crimes, sexual assault, and excessive drinking by teaching students how to intervene and prevent in a positive <b>way.</b> <b>They</b> <b>do</b> this by explaining the Bystander effect. The U of M also has a TXT-U emergency notification text messaging system that sends out a notification to all faculty, staff, and students in case of emergency. Similarly, there are different resources which {{students are able to}} get help while getting home. 624-WALK, an escort to walk to adjacent campuses and neighborhoods, and Gopher Chauffeur, a van service that offers rides near and on campus. Both of these are free and open to all students, staff, and faculty.|$|E
25|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy has}} been shown as an effective treatment for clinical depression. The American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines (April 2000) indicated that, among psychotherapeutic approaches, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy had the best-documented efficacy for treatment of major depressive disorder. One etiological theory of depression is Aaron T. Beck's cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative schema {{of the world in}} childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.|$|E

25|$|Traffic {{exiting the}} {{roundabout}} comes from one direction, rather than three, simplifying the pedestrian's visual environment. Traffic moves slowly {{enough to allow}} visual engagement with pedestrians, encouraging deference towards them. Other benefits include reduced driver confusion associated with perpendicular junctions and reduced queuing associated with traffic lights. They allow U-turns within the normal flow of traffic, which often are not possible at other forms of junction. Moreover, since vehicles on average spend less time idling at roundabouts than at signalled intersections, using a roundabout potentially leads to less pollution. Also, when entering vehicles only need to give <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> not always perform a full stop. As a result, by keeping {{a part of their}} momentum, the engine will produce less work to regain the initial speed, resulting in lower emissions. Additionally, slow moving traffic in roundabouts makes less noise than traffic that must stop and start, speed up and brake.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the difference between the hot-hand and gambler's fallacy. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome. Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a craps table or spinning the roulette wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue. There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people believe that they have this ability is in line with the illusion of control.|$|E
500|$|Cena then {{appeared}} on Raw {{the night after}} SummerSlam, explaining {{he wanted to be}} [...] "face to face" [...] with a certain WWE wrestler, confirmed to be Roman Reigns. The next week, a match between the two was scheduled for No Mercy. In {{the weeks leading up to}} the match, the two cut various worked shoot promos on each other, going back and forth about what they perceive the other as and why the crowds react the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> At No Mercy, Cena lost to Reigns. Cena would then make a return to SmackDown, after commissioner Shane McMahon named him the final member of Team SmackDown's men 5-on-5 elimination match against Team Raw's men at Survivor Series.|$|E

500|$|Although Big Star's first era {{came to an}} end in 1974, {{the band}} {{acquired}} a cult following in the 1980s when new acts began to acknowledge the early material's significance. R.E.M.'s Peter Buck admitted, [...] "We've sort of flirted with greatness, but we've yet to make a record as good as Revolver or Highway 61 Revisited or Exile on Main Street or Big Star's Third. I don't know what it'll take to push us on to that level, but I think we've got it in us." [...] Chilton, however, told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "I'm constantly surprised that people fall for Big Star the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do...</b> People say Big Star made some of the best rock 'n roll albums ever. [...] And I say they're wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Between May and September 1488, Stephen {{built the}} Voroneţ Monastery {{to commemorate the}} victory at Vaslui; [...] "the {{exterior}} walls – including {{a representation of the}} Last Judgment on the west wall – were painted in 1547 with a background of vivid cerulean blue. This is so vibrant that art historians refer to Voroneţ blue the same <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> Titian red." [...] In 1490, he extended his work by building another monastery of Saint John the Baptist. These monasteries served as cultural centres; today, they are on UNESCO's World Heritage List. Stephen's victory at Vaslui {{is considered one of the}} greatest Moldavian victories over the Ottomans, and as such [...] "played a role in universal history" [...] by securing the [...] "culture and civilization of the Christian West from the onslaught of Islam." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Sting" [...] was {{directed}} by Randall Einhorn and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show. It was the first episode to feature Timothy Olyphant in a guest appearance as Danny Cordray, a rival paper salesman. Olyphant would return for the season's Halloween special, [...] "Costume Contest", and would appear in a deleted scene for Carell's penultimate episode, [...] "Michael's Last Dundies". Olyphant enjoyed his stint on the show, later telling IGN that filming both [...] "The Sting" [...] and his scenes for other episodes was [...] "a blast" [...] and [...] "a kick to do" [...] because The Office is [...] "such a fun show, {{the nature of the}} whole thing.

500|$|Before biology, {{there were}} several terms used {{for the study of}} animals and plants. Natural history {{referred}} to the descriptive aspects of biology, though it also included mineralogy and other non-biological fields; from the Middle Ages through the Renaissance, the unifying framework of natural history was the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being. Natural philosophy and natural theology encompassed the conceptual and metaphysical basis of plant and animal life, dealing with problems of why organisms exist and behave the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> though these subjects also included what is now geology, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. Physiology and (botanical) pharmacology were the province of medicine. Botany, zoology, and (in the case of fossils) geology replaced natural history and natural philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries before biology was widely adopted. To this day, [...] "botany" [...] and [...] "zoology" [...] are widely used, although they have been joined by other sub-disciplines of biology.|$|E
500|$|In July 1996, DuPont {{announced}} that it was ending its sponsorship of the race. According to a brand manager for the company, [...] "Over the past six years, the Tour DuPont has been an excellent vehicle for promoting our products. However, we need to focus more on strategic markets {{in other parts of the}} world, where a sustained annual program versus a two-week event can better leverage the DuPont brand equity for profitable growth". Race organizer Mike Plant explained that [...] "I talked to them a couple of months ago, and they had to make a hard decision. They don't have hundreds of millions of dollars to put into worldwide advertising. They put a ton of money into this event and they built up a valuable franchise, but, like Motorola, corporations change the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> business". Plant reported that polling had showed that public recognition of the event had grown significantly, but also that awareness of who sponsored it had declined.|$|E
500|$|... "Dog of Death" [...] {{was written}} by long-time writer John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The producers decided to create another episode centered on Santa's Little Helper, as they enjoyed the previous ones, particularly season one's [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", in which the Simpson family receives him. Reardon commented {{that one of the}} hardest feats with the episode was to make Santa's Little Helper not express any human expressions, as the staff preferred animals on the show to behave exactly the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in real life. The plot of [...] "Dog of Death" [...] was based on an experience Swartzwelder had with his own dog that also suffered from bloat. However, unlike the events in the episode, Swartzwelder's dog did not receive treatment as the operation was too expensive and the dog was too old. The Gold Coast Bulletins Ryan Ellem commented that the Simpson family's dilemma with the cost of the veterinary procedure is a [...] "very real" [...] dilemma that many families [...] "who normally don't budget for a pooch's bung knee" [...] face.|$|E

500|$|The wing {{shape of}} Pteranodon {{suggests}} {{that it would have}} flown rather like a modern-day albatross. This is {{based on the fact that}} Pteranodon had a high aspect ratio (wingspan to chord length) similar to that of the albatross — 9:1 for Pteranodon, compared to 8:1 for an albatross. Albatrosses spend long stretches of time at sea fishing, and use a flight pattern called [...] "dynamic soaring" [...] which exploits the vertical gradient of wind speed near the ocean surface to travel long distances without flapping, and without the aid of thermals (which do not occur over the open ocean the same <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> over land). While most of a Pteranodon flight would have depended on soaring, like long-winged seabirds, it probably required an occasional active, rapid burst of flapping, and studies of Pteranodon wing loading (the strength of the wings vs. the weight of the body) indicate that they were capable of substantial flapping flight, contrary to some earlier suggestions that they were so big they could only glide.|$|E
500|$|Gilligan {{reasoned}} that, because Mulder and Scully {{would appear}} on a nationally syndicated television series, the episode's main monster could not be shown, only [...] "hinted at". Gilligan and the writing staff applied methods previously used in the 1999 psychological horror film The Blair Witch Project to show as little of the monster as possible while still making the episode scary. Michael Watkins, who directed the episode, had a good rapport with the Los Angeles police department. As such, he secured real Sheriff's deputies as extras. Casting director Rick Milikan later explained that the group needed [...] "actors who could pull off the believability in just normal off-the-cuff conversation of cops on the job." [...] During the crack house scene, real SWAT team members were hired {{to break down the}} doors. Actor Judson Mills later explained that, because there were few cameramen and owing to {{the manner in which the}} episode was filmed, [...] "people just behaved as if we were [...] cops. I had other cops waving and giving their signals or heads-up the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> amongst themselves. It was quite funny".|$|E
500|$|... "If I Needed Someone" [...] was {{the first}} Harrison {{composition}} to become a chart hit, {{as a result of}} the Hollies' cover. Their version peaked at number 20 in Britain, but by their standards at the time, it was one of their least successful singles. Many listeners perceived the song as the Hollies attempting to align themselves with the Beatles. In one of his articles covering the Beatles' concurrent UK tour, Alan Smith of the NME quoted Harrison as saying that the Hollies' version was [...] "rubbish" [...] and that [...] "the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> their records, they sound like session men who've just got together in a studio without ever seeing each other before. Technically good, yes. But that's all." [...] Lennon also criticised their treatment of the song, having long disliked the Hollies' sound. These comments incensed Nash, who responded by saying that he was tired of Lennon's continual insults and would [...] "back any of us boys against the Beatles musically any time". In January 1966, at a press conference following his and Boyd's wedding, Harrison laughed off a reporter's question as to whether he had invited the Hollies to the ceremony, adding that the issue had [...] "just got out of hand".|$|E
