25|$|During the {{apartheid}} years South Africa's security forces were also {{accused of using}} extrajudicial means {{to deal with their}} political opponents. After his release, Nelson Mandela would refer to these acts as proof of a Third Force. This was denied vehemently by the administration of F.W. de Klerk. Later the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, led by Archbishop Desmond Tutu <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> both military and police agencies such as the Civil Cooperation Bureau and C10 based at Vlakplaas were guilty of gross human rights violations. This led the International Criminal Court to declare apartheid a crime against humanity.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Abin the Levite, {{the son of}} Rabbi Judah the Prince, {{taught that}} the Israelites became wealthy from the plague of blood. If an Egyptian and an Israelite were in a house {{where there was a}} barrel full of water, and the Egyptian went to fill a pitcher from the barrel, the Egyptian <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it {{contained}} blood, while the Israelite would drink water from the same barrel. When the Egyptian asked the Israelite to give the Egyptian some water with the Israelite's own hand, it still became blood. Even if the Egyptian said to the Israelite that they should both drink from one vessel, the Israelite would drink water, but the Egyptian would drink blood. It was only when the Egyptian bought water from the Israelite for money that the Egyptian was able to drink water. And this is how the Israelites became rich.|$|E

25|$|In {{its heyday}} of the 1930s through the 1950s, CCNY became known for its {{political}} radicalism. It was said that the old CCNY cafeteria {{in the basement of}} Shepard Hall, particularly in alcove 1, was {{the only place in the}} world where a fair debate between Trotskyists and Stalinists could take place. Being part of a political debate that began in the morning in alcove 1, Irving Howe reported that after some time had passed he would leave his place among the arguing students in order to attend class. When he returned to the cafeteria late in the day, he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the same debate had continued but with an entirely different cast of students. Alumni who were at City College in the mid-20th century said that City College in those days made the famously radicalism three decades later at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s look like a school of conformity.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{maintains}} that {{the core of the}} strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. [...] "I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis," [...] she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, [...] "you <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered your mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence {{is probably one of the}} most powerful spiritual forces." [...] Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.|$|E

500|$|Tureen was {{critical}} of Gellers' strategy because it required suing in state court (which he believed would be biased against any such claim), because it limited the claim to the [...] promised by the 1794 treaty, and because it would leave the tribes under state jurisdiction and ineligible for federal benefits. One theory that Tureen considered in order to overcome Maine's sovereign immunity was to rely on United States v. Lee (1882), which had permitted a land claim by the heirs of Robert E. Lee against the federal government. Tureen also feared that a federal court <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction for an ejectment action due to the well-pleaded complaint rule, although the Supreme Court held otherwise in Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. County of Oneida (1974)decided {{three years after the}} Passamaquoddy complaint was filed. Tureen also worried about the delay-related defenses of laches, adverse possession, and statute of limitations.|$|E
500|$|Introduced as a Lothario-type character, {{according}} to Anderson, Oliver [...] "had {{a reputation for}} being the hospital bike." [...] His first relationship developed when he attracted the attention of ward sisters Chrissie Williams and Daisha Anderson. Daisha showed less interest in him than Chrissie, of whose attentiveness Anderson said, [...] "I think any hot-blooded male <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> attractive". Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis – though Anderson noted, [...] "he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake". This left Chrissie free to pursue Oliver. Before their relationship began, Anderson opined [...] "She's gorgeous, and Oliver would be a fool not to go out with her." [...] He thought that Oliver and Chrissie's [...] "unflappable" [...] natures made them a good fit for one another, though wondered if they were too alike. As an older woman, their relationship was described as a [...] "toyboy storyline" [...] for Chrissie. Hobley admitted to having fun with the storyline due to the real age gap between herself and Anderson. She described Chrissie's feelings for Oliver, stating: [...] "Chrissie is {{having a lot of fun}} with him. But deep down she's really hoping to find true love – she's been quite unlucky so far. She's not getting any younger and she's worried about missing out on kids."

500|$|Commentators {{around the}} world sought to {{interpret}} {{the relationship between the}} Na'vi and humans in the film, mostly agreeing with Maxim Osipov, who wrote in the Hindustan Times and The Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "The 'civilised humans' turn out as primitive, jaded and increasingly greedy, cynical, and brutal—traits only amplified by their machinery—while the 'monkey aliens' emerge as noble, kind, wise, sensitive and humane. We, along with the Avatar hero, are now faced with an uncomfortable yet irresistible choice between the two races and the two worldviews." [...] Osipov wrote that it was inevitable that the audience, like the film's hero, Jake, <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the Na'vi's culture was really the more civilized of the two, exemplifying [...] "the qualities of kindness, gratitude, regard for the elder, self-sacrifice, respect for all life and ultimately humble dependence on a higher intelligence behind nature." [...] Echoing this analysis, psychologist Jeffery Fine in The Miami Herald urged [...] "every man, woman and child" [...] to see the film and wake up to its message by making the right choice between commercial materialism, which is [...] "steamrolling our soul and consciousness", and reconnection with all life as [...] "the only... promise of survival" [...] for humanity. [...] Similarly, an Angolan critic saw the film as a message of hope, writing, [...] "With this union of humans and aliens comes a feeling that something better exists in the universe: the respect for life." [...] Cameron confirmed that [...] "the Na'vi represent the better aspects of human nature, and the human characters in the film demonstrate the more venal aspects of human nature." ...|$|E

2500|$|An audit by the Treasury Department's Inspector General <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> {{the primary}} causes of IndyMac's failure were {{associated}} with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale.

2500|$|So {{that the}} distractions {{of a busy}} life should not {{interfere}} with Head's introspective analysis, {{it was decided that}} the experimentation should take place in Rivers's rooms. Here, as Head states, [...] "for five happy years we worked together on week-ends and holidays in the quiet atmosphere of his rooms at St. John's College." [...] In the normal course of events, Head would travel to Cambridge on Saturday, after spending several hours on the outpatient department of the London Hospital. On these occasions, however, he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he was simply too exhausted to work on the Saturday evening so experimentation would have to be withheld until the Sunday. If, therefore, a long series of tests were to be carried out, Head would come to Cambridge on the Friday, returning to London on Monday morning. At some points, usually during Rivers's vacation period, longer periods could be devoted to the observations. Between the date of the operation and their last sitting on 13 December 1907, 167days were devoted to the investigation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{university}} {{looked at}} many candidates to replace Blake. Many big-time college coaches were {{considered for the}} post. However, Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione decided to hire a 38-year-old defensive coordinator from Florida, Bob Stoops. Stoops quickly began to build his new program with the promise to help the program regain its former position as a perennial college football powerhouse. On his arrival to campus he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> for all his predecessor's failings as a head football coach, John Blake had been an excellent recruiter {{and many of his}} players were potential stars. Despite the obvious talent already on-campus, no quarterback suitable for the [...] "spread" [...] offense was on the team roster. Stoops would remedy this by signing a little-known junior college quarterback, Josh Heupel, to run his offense. In his first year as head coach, the Sooners showed marked improvement; starting the season with three wins over non-conference opponents amassing 132points to their opponents' 31. They lost the next two games, which included a 34-30 loss against Notre Dame at South Bend and finished the season with an overall record of 7–5. After the season, offensive coordinator Mike Leach left OU to take the head coaching position at Texas Tech. This success was {{a breath of fresh air}} for a program that had fallen from perennial powerhouse to league doormat and those surrounding the Sooner football program expected great things from their new head coach. They would not be disappointed.|$|E
