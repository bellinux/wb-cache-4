5|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} England on September 22, the U.S. won 3–0. All three goals were scored within 12 minutes. The U.S. faced Brazil in the {{semifinal}} {{in what would}} become a controversial and game-changing match for the team. Coach Greg Ryan decided to bench starting goalkeeper, Hope Solo, and instead started Brianna Scurry, a veteran goalkeeper <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> in three World Cups and two Olympics, but <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> very few matches since the 2004 Olympics. The U.S. was defeated 4–0 by Brazil. The loss relegated them to a final match against Norway, which they won 4–1, to secure third place standing at the tournament. Lloyd started {{three of the five}} games in which she played at the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Yard {{was invited}} to Washington, D.C. by his friend Stephen Mather, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> working on {{national}} parks as assistant to the Secretary of Interior. Yard and Mather had met while working for the New York Sun and became friends; Yard was the best man at Mather's wedding in 1893.|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> arriving in the 1860s. Many of the early Christian converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E

5|$|Cornhusker Ahman Green, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> most of Nebraska's games {{during the}} regular season, entered the game and ran three {{straight}} plays for 24 yards. On the third play, Green fumbled the ball, which was recovered by a Nebraska player. Frost then completed an 11-yard pass for a first down to the Tech 21-yard line. The Cornhuskers were stopped for losses on two consecutive running plays, but Frost broke free for a 22-yard touchdown run. The score and subsequent extra point gave the Cornhuskers a 4121 lead with 3:26 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The series {{moved to}} the Polo Grounds for game two. Sheldon Jones took the mound for the Giants despite a 6–10 record going into the game, {{allowing}} the Giants to save Sal Maglie for the series' game three or {{the first game of}} the World Series. The Dodgers used Clem Labine, a rookie <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> just six games for the Dodgers in his career, because they lacked pitchers who were ready for the game. The Yankees were among those in attendance as spectators.|$|E

Larkin worked on creating different sound effects for Riven and was chosen to score Uru after composer and Myst co-creator Robyn Miller left Cyan in early 1998. The music for the game was collected as a soundtrack, Uru Music, that was released in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Early on 10 June {{another group}} of thirty-one men arrived at the 9th Parachute Battalion position. These and other stragglers, who had arrived through the night, brought the {{battalion}} strength to around 270 men. At 11:00 the Germans attacked 'A' Company again, {{but this time the}} attack was ill-coordinated and was easily repelled. Shortly afterwards the battalion killed around fifty Germans, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> digging defences {{in full view of the}} British position. Then 'A' Company ambushed a German patrol, causing several casualties. That afternoon a strong force of Germans occupied the Château and used it as a base to start an infantry and self propelled gun assault on the British battalion. With no mortar ammunition left, the British had to use their PIATs and machine-guns to stop the attack.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Pound {{introduced}} {{two other}} poets to the Eiffel Tower group: his former fiancée Hilda Doolittle (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> signing her work H.D.) and {{her future husband}} Richard Aldington. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models, especially Sappho, an interest that Pound shared. The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto-Imagist interest in Japanese poetry, and, in 1912, during a meeting {{with them in the}} British Museum tea room, Pound told H.D. and Aldington that they were Imagistes and even appended the signature H.D. Imagiste to some poems they were discussing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Hokies's defeat, Virginia Tech chose to start a new quarterback and a new {{offensive}} plan. Behind freshman Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies rolled to five straight victories, including a win over No.22 Clemson by 18points. During the winning streak, Sean Glennon, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> at quarterback for the Hokies during the first two games of the season, returned to alternate possessions with Taylor in an unusual two-quarterback system. On October 25, the Hokies had a chance to make up for their early-season loss to LSU when they faced No.2 Boston College on a Thursday night in Blacksburg, Virginia. Though the Hokies dominated for most of the game, Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan managed a late-game comeback to win the game 1410 with 11seconds remaining.|$|E

5|$|Plymouth Argyle manager Neil Warnock picked ten players <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> {{both of the}} club's semi-final matches, with Ronnie Mauge {{keeping his}} place in the team having {{replaced}} Chris Billy for the second leg. The match was to be goalkeeper Steve Cherry's last for the club, having returned for a second stint with the club three months earlier. Darlington manager Jim Platt, who was taking charge of the team for the last time before the return of David Hodgson, made one change to the side that secured progress from the semi-final stage with Tony Carss coming in at the expense of Matt Carmichael. The final would prove to be Man of the Match Matty Appleby's last for Darlington.|$|E
5|$|The English claimed {{sovereignty}} {{based on}} the false claim that Svalbard was discovered by Hugh Willoughby in 1553, that James I had annexed it in 1614 {{and that it was}} the English <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> whaling. The Netherlands stated that whaling could not be the basis for claiming sovereignty. The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark–Norway and England both claiming sovereignty and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming the archipelago a free zone under mare liberum. Although Denmark–Norway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius—a land without a government.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} line was another uncertainty for the 1997 team. Three linemen from the 1996 team {{had been selected}} in the 1997 NFL Draft: center Rod Payne (3rd round, 76th overall), offensive guard Damon Denson (4th round, 97th overall) and defensive tackle William Carr (7th round, 217th overall). As a result, Michigan began the season with only one {{offensive line}}man, offensive tackle Jon Jansen, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> a game. Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season. The offensive line was further weakened when left tackle, Jeff Backus, suffered a ruptured appendix. In spring practice, offensive line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting, searching for talent to fill in on the line. To fill the holes on the offensive line, two defensive linemen, Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to the offensive line.|$|E

5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car, {{and once it}} {{returned}} to the pits Vettel built a lead over Fernando Alonso. A second safety car deployment caused by the collision of Button and teammate Lewis Hamilton closed the time gaps between cars, but Vettel retained the lead. By lap 26, increasingly heavy rain led to the race's suspension, before it was restarted over two hours later. Button was involved in another collision on lap 37, which led to Alonso's retirement and Button falling to last place. Over {{the remainder of the}} race, he moved from twenty-first place to first, passing Webber and Michael Schumacher, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> fourth and eighth respectively, for second place on lap 65, and Vettel on the final lap.|$|E
5|$|Trot Nixon {{extended}} the Red Sox lead to {{two in the}} top of the fourth, hitting a single to right field that scored Mueller, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> the rally with a two-out double to left-center. Johnny Damon then led off the Red Sox's fifth inning with a double to right. Singles by Orlando Cabrera and Ramírez, to right and left respectively, scored Damon to make it 3–0. With two out, Mueller singled along the first base line, enabling Cabrera to score the Red Sox's fourth run. Suppan was replaced by Al Reyes, which meant none of the Cardinals three starting pitchers had finished five innings during the series.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded {{the number of people}} involved in this project compared to Kanon. The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> working with Key since before Kanons release. After {{the completion}} of Air, two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.|$|E

5|$|During the match, UEFA.com {{users were}} able to vote for their man of the match; the public vote went to the scorer of Barcelona's second goal, Lionel Messi. The UEFA Technical Study Group, however, chose the man who {{provided}} the cross for Messi's goal, Xavi, as their man of the match, citing his control of the tempo of the match {{as the reason for}} their decision. Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola took the time to give special praise to Messi, whom he said he moved back into the midfield in order to increase the team's effectiveness when in possession of the ball. Messi had been withdrawn from his usual right-wing role into a more central position, while Samuel Eto'o, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> the match as Barcelona's lone centre-forward, was moved out to the right. Guardiola also lauded the bravery of his entire team, stating that he believed that his team's victory hinged on their hard work and propensity for taking risks in attack, but he admitted that although his side had had the best season {{in the history of the}} club, they were not yet the best Barcelona team.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days before the 2015 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team began its season for new head coach Jim Harbaugh against Utah, Morris was in a quarterback battle with incoming graduate student transfer Jake Rudock, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> the prior two seasons for Iowa. On Monday before the Thursday September 3 game, Harbaugh would not name his starter. Rudock started the game. After the second game, against Oregon State, there was controversy when Wilton Speight took the mopup snaps during the 357 victory instead of Morris. Harbaugh explained that since Speight had already used his redshirt season and Morris had not, {{there was no reason}} for Morris to lose a season unless it was for meaningful snaps, but that Morris is the #2 quarterback. When Rudock was sidelined in the third quarter with the team trailing in the October 31, 2015, Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota, Speight engineered the game-winning drive via his first touchdown pass with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Harbaugh explained that Speight had earned the backup role in practice in the preceding weeks.|$|E
5|$|The French, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> {{construction}} on Fort Carillon in 1755, {{used it as}} a launching point for the successful siege of Fort William Henry in 1757. Despite that and other successes in North America in 1757, the situation did not look good for them in 1758. As early as March, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America, and the Marquis de Vaudreuil, New France's governor, were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops against them, and that they would have relatively little support from King Louis XV of France. The lack of support from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the Atlantic Ocean, which was dominated by Britain's Royal Navy. This situation was further exacerbated by Canada's poor harvest in 1757, which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed.|$|E
