5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its <b>water</b> <b>solubility,</b> {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its <b>water</b> <b>solubility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its <b>water</b> <b>solubility,</b> which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E
5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its <b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmphotericin B (AmB) and {{clofazimine}} are potent drugs {{hindered by}} their low <b>water</b> <b>solubilities</b> and their toxicities. Carriers {{able to increase}} their apparent <b>water</b> <b>solubilities</b> are needed for these drugs and for other molecules with similar properties. Random amphiphilic copolymers derived from poly(dimethylmalic acid) were obtained using different hydrophobization ratios and side group sizes. Apparent <b>water</b> <b>solubilities</b> of pyrene, clofazimine, and AmB were increased up to 10 000, 20 000 and 1000 times, respectively, in aqueous solutions containing these polymers. The presence of sodium chloride in polymer solution increased pyrene solubility but decreased the solubilities of clofazimine and AmB, compared to the salt-free solutions. Synergy between hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions was observed for polar and cationic molecules. Degradation studies showed that the examined polymers were degradable, {{but none of them}} were totally degraded in 28 days.

5|$|Caesium-137, with a {{half-life}} of 30.17years, {{is one of}} the {{two principal}} medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Caesium-137 {{has been used as a}} tracer in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of tritium. Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident and the Chernobyl disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high <b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> of its salts, and is taken up by the body, which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium.|$|E
25|$|The density {{varies from}} 1.182 to 1.566kg/L. Other {{physical}} and chemical properties vary widely across the class. As the degree of chlorination increases, melting point and lipophilicity increase, and vapour pressure and <b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> decrease.|$|E
25|$|Basic {{nitrogen}} in a carbon chain at position 7 makes the compound more hydrophilic and hence more water-soluble.

25|$|Dioxins {{accumulate}} in food chains {{in a fashion}} similar to other chlorinated compounds (bioaccumulation).

25|$|Organic {{pollutants}} {{can also}} be found in groundwater as insecticides and herbicides. As many other synthetic organic compounds, most pesticides have very complex molecular structures. This complexity determines the <b>water</b> <b>solubility,</b> adsorption capacity, and mobility of pesticides in the groundwater system. Thus, some types of pesticides are more mobile than others so they can more easily reach a drinking-water source.|$|E
40|$|<b>Water</b> <b>solubilities</b> and octanol/water {{partition}} coefficients {{are widely used}} to predict partitioning and bioconcentration phenomena for hydrophobic organic pollutants in aqueous systems. This paper {{is the first in}} a two part series describing the application of high performance reverse phase liquid chromatography (HPRPLC) for indirect estimation of these two physicochemical parameters to facilitate environmental fate and transport predictions for organic compounds. In the first part, thermodynamic factors which control partitioning processes, <b>water</b> <b>solubilities,</b> and reverse phase retention behavior are discussed, and models for interlinking these three properties are summarized. The second part presents the results of aqueous solubility and octanol/water partition coefficient predictions for a number of organic contaminants from measurements of their HPRPLC behavior, and compares the modeling capabilities of some of the theoretical partitioning/solubility equations developed in the first paper...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} different thicknesses of ceramic laminate veneers on <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> of light-cured resin cement. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four specimens of light-cured resin cement (8 mm diameter and 1 mm thickness) were divided into four groups according to ceramic thickness interposed during cure: without ceramic laminate veneer; 0. 7 mm, 1. 0 mm and 1. 3 mm. All samples were subject to <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> process. The mean <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> values were compared by One-way ANOVA/Tukey’s test (α = 0. 05). Pearson's correlation was performed to identify correlations between <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> as well between ceramic thickness and <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility.</b> Results: Significant {{differences were found in}} the sorption values (P < 0. 05) and solubility (P < 0. 01) for the tested conditions. <b>Water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> in the cement light-cured under thicker ceramic were statistically higher than control group. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between veneer thickness and <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> of the light-cured resin cement. Conclusion: The variation in the thickness of the ceramic laminate veneer can alter <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> properties of the light-cured resin cement tested...|$|R

25|$|Long term fuel salt storage - If the {{fluoride}} fuel salts {{are stored}} in solid form over many decades, radiation can cause the release of corrosive fluorine gas and uranium hexafluoride. The salts must be defueled and wastes removed before extended shutdowns and stored above 100 degrees Celsius. Fluorides are less suitable for long term storage because some have high <b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> unless vitrified in insoluble borosilicate glass.|$|E
25|$|MTBE gives water an {{unpleasant}} taste {{at very low}} concentrations, and thus can render large quantities of groundwater undrinkable. MTBE is often introduced into water-supply aquifers by leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) at gasoline stations or by gasoline containing MTBE spilled onto the ground. The higher <b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> and persistence of MTBE cause it to travel faster and farther than many other components of gasoline when released into an aquifer.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} {{possible}} drawbacks of SIR technology, such as leaching of the extractant or clogging of a fixed bed by attrition of the particles. These might be remedied by choosing the proper particle-extractant-system. This implies selecting a suitable extractant with low <b>water</b> <b>solubility,</b> which is sufficiently retained inside the pores, and selecting mechanically stable particles as a solid {{support for the}} extractant. Additionally, SIRs can be stabilized by coating them, as shown by D. Muraviev et al. As coating material, A. W. Trochimczuk et al. used polyvinyl alcohol.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes, in part because it has lower <b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> than other B vitamins, because absorption becomes less efficient as doses increase, and because what excess is absorbed is excreted via the kidneys into urine. Even when 400mg of riboflavin per day was given orally to subjects in one study for three months to investigate the efficacy of riboflavin in the prevention of migraine headache, no short-term side effects were reported. Although toxic doses can be administered by injection, any excess at nutritionally relevant doses is excreted in the urine, imparting a bright yellow color when in large quantities.|$|E

30|$|It {{should be}} borne in mind that, for simplicity, the {{experimental}} data generated {{in this study}} involved the deliberate use of single chain constituents. In reality, commercial surfactants are often complex mixtures containing several components {{with a range of}} different <b>water</b> <b>solubilities</b> and hence n-octanol/water partition coefficient values.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> of different adhesives. Adper Easy Bond, Adper Single Bond Plus, Bond Force, Clearfil SE Bond (bonding resin only), and Xeno IV were the materials evaluated. Ten disks of each adhesive were made in Teflon molds and evaporation of any volatile components was allowed. The disks were weighed daily in an analytical balance until a constant mass was obtained (m 1). Disks were then immersed in water for 12 months when their wet weight was recorded (m 2). The disks were again weighed daily until a constant mass was obtained and the final weight recorded (m 3). <b>Water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> (percentages) were calculated using the recorded mass values. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the average <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> among the different adhesives. Mann-Whitney tests with a Bonferroni correction were used to determine the pairwise differences between adhesives in <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility.</b> The level of significance was set at 0. 05. <b>Water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> were significantly different among the groups (p 0. 05) between Adper Single Bond Plus and Bond Force, or between Clearfil SE Bond and Xeno IV in either <b>water</b> sorption or <b>solubility.</b> Xeno IV did not differ from Adper Easy Bond in water sorption (p> 0. 05). <b>Water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> of all-in-one adhesives increased with time, and the rates of increase were composition-dependent. The results suggest that monomers other than HEMA contribute to <b>water</b> sorption and <b>solubility</b> of adhesive systems from different categories...|$|R
25|$|Distinct phases {{may also}} exist {{within a given}} state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be {{differentiated}} based on solubility as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low solubility (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in <b>water.</b> <b>Solubility</b> is {{the maximum amount of}} a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids, i.e., solids can form solid solutions or crystallize into distinct crystal phases. Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form alloys, whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble cannot.|$|E
25|$|Solubility is a {{property}} of interest in many aspects of science, including but not limited to: environmental predictions, biochemistry, pharmacy, drug-design, agrochemical design, and protein ligand binding. Aqueous solubility is of fundamental interest owing to the vital biological and transportation functions played by water. In addition, to this clear scientific interest in <b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> and solvent effects; accurate predictions of solubility are important industrially. The ability to accurately predict a molecules solubility represents potentially large financial savings in many chemical product development processes, such as pharmaceuticals. In the pharmaceutical industry, solubility predictions form part of the early stage lead optimisation process of drug candidates. Solubility remains a concern {{all the way to}} formulation. A number of methods have been applied to such predictions including quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR), quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR) and data mining. These models provide efficient predictions of solubility and represent the current standard. The draw back such models is that they can lack physical insight. A method founded in physical theory, capable of achieving similar levels of accuracy at an sensible cost, would be a powerful tool scientifically and industrially.|$|E
25|$|In {{each of the}} {{examples}} discussed so far the constituents have been miscible in all proportions with each other. For example, any amount of ethanol can be mixed with any amount of water to form a homogeneous solution. There are pairs of solvents for which {{this is not the}} case. For example, if equal volumes of chloroform (<b>water</b> <b>solubility</b> 0.8 g/100 ml at 20°C) and water are shaken together and then left to stand, the liquid will separate into two layers. Analysis of the layers shows that the top layer is mostly water {{with a small amount of}} chloroform dissolved in it, and the bottom layer is mostly chloroform with a small amount of water dissolved in it. If the two layers are heated together, the system of layers will boil at 53.3°C, which is lower than either the boiling point of chloroform (61.2°C) or the boiling point of water (100°C). The vapor will consist of 97.0% chloroform and 3.0% water regardless of how much of each liquid layer is present (provided both layers are indeed present). If the vapor is re-condensed, the layers will reform in the condensate, and will do so in a fixed ratio, which in this case is 4.4% of the volume in the top layer and 95.6% in the bottom layer. Such a system of solvents is known as a heteroazeotrope. The diagram illustrates how the various phases of a heteroazeotrope are related.|$|E
