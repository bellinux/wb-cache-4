500|$|The {{first car}} was the power car, which {{featured}} a distinctive [...] "knife-edge" [...] nose, baggage and mail compartments, and conventional steel-wheeled trucks. Powered by two [...] American LaFrance gasoline engines mated to Westinghouse generators, the lead car weighed [...] in all. The second car was the trailing passenger car, which had 16 rubber-tired <b>wheels</b> as <b>well</b> as <b>seating</b> for 76 passengers in an air-conditioned compartment {{that included a}} segregated [...] "Jim Crow" [...] section. The second car weighed just [...] in total.|$|R
25|$|The crew did {{not notice}} that the left brakes had been dragged during its take off roll and had {{overheated}}. The overheated brakes were retracted by the crew and entered the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> The <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> subsequently closed to secure the <b>wheels.</b> The <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> did not have sufficient cooling, and so {{the temperature of the}} brakes continued to rise, reaching as high as 600 degree Celsius.|$|R
25|$|This {{calculation}} is not {{commonly used}} to get the outer diameter for a regular vehicle. Though, the truck builders and off-road fans use it {{to find out the}} right wheel diameter, that will fit right into the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> For the US vehicles, the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> capacity is measured in inches, so when the outer tire diameter is calculated, it is normally compared with the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> index. This is done in order to prevent tire from rubbing against control arms and fenders.|$|R
50|$|The fender's {{openings}} for the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> {{tend to be}} {{much larger}} than the diameter of the tire, because they do not move with the tire suspension and consequently must be large enough to allow the full range of tire motion on the suspension without touching the interior of the <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> The streamlined 1949 Nash 600 and Ambassador design was first to feature fenders that enclosed the front wheels. More elaborate designs include fender skirts for enclosing the outside edge of the <b>wheel</b> <b>well,</b> and stylized pontoon fenders for exposed fenders.|$|R

25|$|Fender skirts {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire <b>wheel</b> <b>wells.</b> Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. Front fender skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|R
40|$|Prediction of {{airframe}} noise {{radiation from}} the landing gear and <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> of commercial aircraft is examined. Measurements of these components on typical aircraft are presented and potential noise sources identified. Semiempirical expressions for the sound generation by these sources are developed from available experimental data and theoretical analyses. These expressions are employed to estimate the noise {{radiation from the}} landing gear and <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> for a typical aircraft and to rank order the component sources...|$|R

25|$|When {{air flows}} around the <b>wheel</b> <b>wells</b> it gets {{disturbed}} by the rims of the vehicles, and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow smoother around the <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> smooth <b>wheel</b> covers are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are hub caps with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag, however, it may cause the brakes to heat up quicker because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. This is why this modification is more commonly seen with high efficiency vehicles, rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.|$|R

25|$|On June 18, 1998, Propair Flight 420, a Metro II {{flying from}} Dorval International Airport (now Montreal-Trudeau International Airport) to Peterborough Airport in Peterborough, Ontario, {{experienced}} a left <b>wheel</b> <b>well</b> fire when the overheated brake and wheel assembly was retracted into the enclosed <b>wheel</b> <b>well.</b> The heat dissipated to the tire {{and the surrounding}} structures, eventually causing a fire. During the attempted emergency landing at Mirabel Airport, the landing gear was extended on short final and when the aircraft was over the runway, the left wing broke upwards, the fuselage pivoted {{to the left and}} struck the ground. All 11 occupants were fatally injured.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{almost all}} modern cars mount their side mirrors on the doors, {{normally}} at the A-pillar, {{rather than the}} wings (fenders - portion of body above the <b>wheel</b> <b>well),</b> the [...] "wing mirror" [...] term is still frequently used.|$|R
