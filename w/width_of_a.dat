5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and the width of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} the {{co-ordinating}} metric works because {{the length of a}} single brick (215mm) is equal to the total of the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brick (102.5mm) plus a perpend (10mm) plus the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second brick (102.5mm).|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, for machine processing, a roving {{is about}} the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pencil.|$|E
5000|$|An en is a typographic unit, half <b>of</b> the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> em. By definition, it is {{equivalent}} to half of {{the height of the}} font (e.g. in 16 point type it is 8 points). As its name suggests, it is also traditionally the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> uppercase letter [...] "N".|$|R

2500|$|The en dash, n dash, n-rule, or [...] "nut" [...] (...) is {{traditionally}} half the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> em dash.|$|R
25|$|Dinas Powys {{village is}} {{spread across the}} full <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{traditional}} wooded valley, with the Cadoxton River running in the river valley.|$|E
25|$|A former {{cemetery}} and bus depot, Open Road Park is a garden and a playground occupying the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city block.|$|E
25|$|Hoist: The half or {{edge of a}} flag nearest to the flagpole. This term also {{sometimes}} refers to the vertical <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flag.|$|E
50|$|The induced graph <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered graph is {{obtained}} by adding some edges to an ordering graph, {{using the method}} outlined below. The induced <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered graph is the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> its induced graph.|$|R
50|$|Early AMD is {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} presence of medium-sized drusen, about the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> average human hair. Early AMD is usually asymptomatic.|$|R
5000|$|A finger (sometimes fingerbreadth or finger's breadth) is any {{of several}} units of {{measurement}} that are approximately the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adult human finger, including: ...|$|R
25|$|Colonial {{administrator}} Herbert Hope Risley, an exponent of race science, {{used the}} ratio of the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nose to its height to divide Indians into Aryan and Dravidian races, as well as seven castes.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of these parts are usually co-ordinated such that two bricks laid {{side by side}} separated only by the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> perpend have a total width identical {{to the length of}} a single brick laid transversely on top of them.|$|E
25|$|The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{surface is}} the {{distance}} between pairs of parallel tangent planes. Numerous other closed convex surfaces have constant width, for example the Meissner body. The girth of a surface is the circumference of the boundary of its orthogonal projection on to a plane. Each of these properties implies the other.|$|E
50|$|For terms see {{gastropod}} shellThe height <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adult shell <b>of</b> {{this species}} ranges from 45-60 mm. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adult shell ranges from 20-30 mm. (34) mm.|$|R
50|$|The shell has 7.5 whorls. The {{height of}} the shell is 44 mm. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{aperture}} is 8 mm. The height <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aperture is 11 mm.|$|R

25|$|Laser illumination, however, also {{converts}} some N-V− into N-V0 centers. Emission is {{very quick}} (relaxation time ~10 ns). At room temperature, no sharp peaks are observed {{because of the}} thermal broadening. However, cooling the N-V− centers with liquid nitrogen or liquid helium dramatically narrows the lines down to a <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few megahertz.|$|E
25|$|Crack {{climbing}} {{is a type}} of {{rock climbing}} that ascends cracks and uses specialized climbing techniques. Cracks used in climbing vary in size from the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finger to those that fit an entire body. Climbers use techniques such as jamming, laybacking, and stemming. Some climbers use gloves made out of athletic tape to protect their hands.|$|E
25|$|Carving width is {{a concept}} defined {{similarly}} to branch width, except with edges replaced by vertices and vice versa. A carving decomposition is an unrooted binary tree with each leaf representing a vertex in the original graph, and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cut is the number (or total weight in a weighted graph) of edges that are incident to a vertex in both subtrees.|$|E
50|$|IBCs can be {{manufactured}} to a customer's exact requirements {{in terms of}} capacity, dimensions, and material. The length and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> IBC are usually dependent on the pallet dimension standard <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given country.|$|R
5000|$|Transmissivity The rate {{at which}} water is {{transmitted}} through whole thickness and unit <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aquifer under a unit hydraulic gradient. It {{is equal to the}} hydraulic conductivity times the thickness <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aquifer; ...|$|R
50|$|A common way {{to study}} such sources {{is to use}} {{narrow-band}} imaging, but this technique can only survey a very narrow redshift range at a time - set by the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the filter. In addition this method is not as sensitive as direct spectroscopic studies because the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the filter is wider than the typical <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emission line.|$|R
25|$|The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> path-decomposition {{is defined}} {{in the same way}} as for tree-decompositions, as maxi|Xi|−1, and the pathwidth of G is the minimum width of any path-decomposition ofG. The {{subtraction}} of one from the size of Xi in this definition makes little difference in most applications of pathwidth, but is used to make the pathwidth of a path graph be equal to one.|$|E
25|$|As soon as any {{connection}} within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength {{of the highest}} specified frequency (e.g., at 100MHz the wavelength is 3m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3cm) design properties radically change. For example, a specified length and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> PCB trace {{can be used as}} a selective or impedance-matching entity.|$|E
25|$|The {{width of}} an e-separation {{is the number}} of {{vertices}} of G that are incident both to an edge of E1 and to an edge of E2; that is, it {{is the number of}} vertices that are shared by the two subgraphs G1 and G2. The width of the branch-decomposition is the maximum width of any of its e-separations. The branchwidth of G is the minimum <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> branch-decomposition of G.|$|E
50|$|The common plastic poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) absorbs IR {{light in}} the 2.8-25 µm {{wavelength}} band, so CO2 lasers {{have been used in}} recent years for fabricating microfluidic devices from it, with channel <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few hundred micrometers.|$|R
50|$|The female has <b>a</b> {{total length}} <b>of</b> 17.41 mm; <b>a</b> {{cephalothorax}} length <b>of</b> 3.23 mm and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 2.47 mm; <b>a</b> cephalic region length of 1.98 mm and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 1.95 mm; <b>a</b> fovea <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 0.37 mm; <b>an</b> OQ length <b>of</b> 0.39 mm and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 0.77 mm; <b>a</b> labium length <b>of</b> 0.30 mm and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 0.67 mm; and <b>a</b> sternum length <b>of</b> 1.98 mm and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 1.40 mm. Its cephalic region is strongly convex, the fovea is sinuous and straight. Its labium has eight cuspules. The sternal sigilla {{is small and}} oval; the sternum is quite convex, not rebordered. The colour {{is the same as}} in the male.|$|R
50|$|The holotype has <b>a</b> {{carapace}} length <b>of</b> 6.9 mm, <b>a</b> metasomal segment I length <b>of</b> 6.6 mm, <b>a</b> metasomal segment V length <b>of</b> 11.1 mm, <b>a</b> vesicle <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 3.2 mm, <b>a</b> femur length <b>of</b> 7.3 mm, <b>a</b> femur <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 2.3 mm, <b>a</b> tibia length <b>of</b> 8.2 mm, <b>a</b> tibia <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 3.3 mm, <b>a</b> chelae length <b>of</b> 14.2 mm, and <b>a</b> chelae <b>width</b> <b>of</b> 4.0 mm. The movable finger with the sting has <b>a</b> length <b>of</b> 8.2 mm.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{printing}} facilities most efficiently print broadsheet {{sections in}} multiples of eight pages (with four front pages and four back pages). The broadsheet is then {{cut in half}} during the process. Thus the newsprint rolls used are defined by the width necessary to print four front pages. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> newsprint roll is called its web. Thus the new 12-inch-wide front page broadsheet newspapers in the United States use a 48-inch web newsprint roll.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} nakshatras {{reflects}} {{the number of}} days in a sidereal month (modern value: 27.32 days), the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nakshatra traversed by the Moon in about one day. Each nakshatra is further subdivided into four quarters (or padas). These play a role in popular Hindu astrology, where each pada is associated with a syllable, conventionally chosen as the first syllable of the given name of a child born when the Moon was in the corresponding pada.|$|E
25|$|The tracker {{needs to}} record {{particle}} paths accurately yet be lightweight {{so as to}} disturb the particle as little as possible. It does this by taking position measurements so accurate that tracks can be reliably reconstructed using just a few measurement points. Each measurement is accurate to 10µm, {{a fraction of the}} <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human hair. It is also the inner most layer of the detector and so receives the highest volume of particles: the construction materials were therefore carefully chosen to resist radiation.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{properties}} of axial vector mesons a 1 and b 1 as relativistic S-wave states which are predicted in the Ũ(12) -scheme, through the analyses of their radiative and pionic decays. Specifically, partial <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> the strong <b>a</b> 1 (b 1) → ρ(ω) π processes, their D/S-wave amplitude ratios, and radiative transition <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1 (b 1) → πγ processes are calculated by using a simple decay interaction model, and made a comparison with the respective experimental values. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the threshold <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> some symmetric properties which range asymptotically between 1 / √ n and 1 /log n. These properties are built using <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> failure sets arising from reliability theory. This combination of sets is simply called a product. Some general {{results on the}} threshold <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the product <b>of</b> two sets <b>A</b> and B {{in terms of the}} threshold locations and <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> and B are provided...|$|R
