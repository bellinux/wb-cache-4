500|$|Developer Tom Moyer {{wanted to}} redevelop the block since the 1970s. The City Club of Portland held a {{significant}} meeting in 1992 {{about the fate}} of the Central Park Blocks, also called the Commercial Park Blocks. Moyer and the PDC opposed [...] "the downtown parking magnate" [...] Greg Goodman's plans to turn the block into a 550-space 12-story parking structure in 1995, which was to be called the Park Avenue Plaza. Neil Goldschmidt said the parking structure would be [...] "like putting lipstick on a dead corpse" [...] and Bill Naito said that a [...] "12-story garage won't go away. This is a chance to do something special. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> do something special every decade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur {{writes that}} Hume {{believed}} that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> balance our demands for liberty {{with the need}} for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur characterises Hume as a [...] "precautionary conservative", whose actions would have been [...] "determined by prudential concerns about the consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles about what is ideal or even legitimate." [...] Hume supported the liberty of the press, and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained. American historian Douglass Adair has argued that Hume was a major inspiration for James Madison's writings, and the essay [...] "Federalist No. 10" [...] in particular.|$|E

5000|$|In 2008, Salim Al-Awwa, {{secretary}} general of the IUMS opposed Egypt's birth control program, stating: [...] "The state is not God and the state is not the creator. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> limit the number of children." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....there surely is {{some common}} ground when both {{those who believe}} in choice and those who are opposed to {{abortion}} can come together and say, 'We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth, communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity, and providing options for adoption, and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby'. Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform {{for the first time this}} year, and I think that's where we can find some common ground, because nobody's pro-abortion. I think it's always a tragic situation. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> reduce these circumstances." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holmes {{held against}} West Virginia's {{claim that the}} amount of debt should be reduced because the debt paid for {{improvements}} outside the boundaries of West Virginia. Although West Virginia was correct in observing that improvements were outside its boundaries, he wrote, the improvements were financed by state bonds and purchases of stock in corporations making the improvements. Since bond sales and stock purchases were made by the state on behalf of all citizens, all citizens shared in the risk and all citizens shared in the benefit. [...] "...we should be lost in futile detail if <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> unravel in each instance the ultimate scope of the scheme. ... All the expenditures had the ultimate good of the whole state in view. Therefore we adhere to our conclusion that West Virginia's share of the debt must be ascertained in a different way," [...] Holmes concluded. Nor was ascertaining the amount of debt to be left solely to the West Virginia legislature. Holmes pointed out the danger and inequitable nature of such a scheme, and asserted the Court's jurisdiction over the case: ...|$|E

5000|$|Director Wilkinson {{believes}} the vicious {{tone of the}} debate over the oil sands has precluded any meaningful discussion. [...] "There's so much shouting that we don't talk," [...] he says. [...] "...there are human beings involved.

5000|$|Its real {{message is}} not that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> like or respect Jews; only that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>try</b> not <b>to</b> hate them.

6000|$|Here, Mr Franks, who had {{hitherto}} sat in sad silence, brightened up, and said, [...] "Well, well, lads, don't let us {{make things}} worse by disputing.

30|$|However, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> also <b>try</b> <b>to</b> build {{higher levels}} of {{evidence}} in favour of interventional radiology compared with standard methods, competing with other specialists {{working in the field}} [21]. Notably, the innovation of devices and methods is an easier task than building high-level evidence, as “most interventional radiologists lack expertise in the relatively challenging advanced methods used in comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness research” [20]. This challenge implies efforts in education and mentoring, beginning with training during post-graduation schools.|$|R
