500|$|Cindy White of IGN called The Consultant [...] "intriguing" [...] and said, [...] "The snappy {{dialogue}} {{seems to}} {{fit right in}} with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> from a Joss Whedon-ized Avengers movie." [...] Scott Chitwood of ComingSoon.net said, [...] "Considering a third {{of this is a}} rehash of an old bonus scene and the other 2/3 is Coulson sitting and having a chat, this is a pretty big disappointment." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{inspiration}} behind the remix, Hayden Thorpe from Wild Beasts group told The Guardian: [...] "The unlikeness of this match was perhaps what compelled {{us to take}} it on. Gaga in many ways {{is the epitome of}} what we are not. She is the butcher to our butter knife. The essential thrill is always to keep eluding what is expected of us and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> of ourselves." [...] The last of the remix to be released was The Weeknd's take on [...] "Marry the Night" [...] which featured Illangelo, thus earning him a co-producer credit on it.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{opening of the}} BS by Sir Edwin Cornwall, chairman of the London County Council, took place on 10 March 1906. Shortly after the line's opening, the London Evening News columnist [...] "Quex" [...] coined the abbreviated name [...] "Baker-loo", which quickly caught on and began to be used officially from July 1906, appearing on contemporary maps of the tube lines. The nickname was, however, deplored by The Railway Magazine, which complained: [...] "Some latitude is allowable, perhaps, to halfpenny papers, {{in the use of}} nicknames, but for a railway itself to adopt its gutter title, is not <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> from a railway company. English railway officers have more dignity than to act in this manner." ...|$|E

Events are shaping {{themselves}} differently to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>We</b> must make preparations for our safety accordingly, {{and above all}} realise the fact that Gilda will move heaven and earth to thwart us in our plans." ...|$|R

2500|$|In early 2014, it was {{reported}} that Kestrel had fallen months behind on loan payments to the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation due to financing delays. Alan spoke on the matter saying, [...] "We're obviously still very excited about the program. We've made a lot of progress on the design, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to build, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to do with the FAA, but there are other frustrations. Certainly financing the project has been slower than we had hoped and expected." [...] It was also reported that the delay in financing had impacted hiring, causing the company to reduce its staff in Superior. The WEDC and Kestrel agreed upon new terms that would defer the payments until November 2014.|$|E
2500|$|History {{professor}} Ellen Fitzpatrick of the University of New Hampshire said that, [...] "It {{was really}} a sign of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> from our president, that is what a leader does {{in a time of}} crisis and division and tragedy is to reduce, not heighten tensions. And I thought by his example, the way he described the humanity of all of the people involved in this tragic event, that he showed by the way he spoke and what he asked Americans to do. He led by his own example in a very powerful way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The human {{sense of}} the situation, {{according}} to Dreyfus, is based on our goals, our bodies and our culture—all of our unconscious intuitions, attitudes and knowledge about the world. This “context” or [...] "background" [...] (related to Heidegger's Dasein) {{is a form of}} knowledge that is not stored in our brains symbolically, but intuitively in some way. It affects what we notice and what we don't notice, <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> and what possibilities we don't consider: we discriminate between what is essential and inessential. The things that are inessential are relegated to our [...] "fringe consciousness" [...] (borrowing a phrase from William James): the millions of things we're aware of, but we're not really thinking about right now.|$|E
6000|$|... "We heard {{yesterday}} morning from Mr. Merridrew," [...] he commenced. [...] "He made us a remittance which was four hundred pounds short of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected.</b> His explanation {{was that your}} lordship had received that sum from him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{knew what}} he was {{planning}} to do. We worked out his gameplan before the fight, and he did exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected.</b> I over-trained for the fight. That was all. I started training too much, too hard, for too long. He did exactly <b>what</b> <b>we</b> expected." [...] -Royce Gracie ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I have {{to admit}} that its {{conclusions}} were pretty much <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> from the beginning, and if I had not expected to reach these conclusions then, for the ethical reasons that we left out of the report I would not have helped to write it.|$|R

25|$|You and I {{have been}} in many battles, and {{we know there are}} always some mistakes. This time we were right because the enemy did <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> him to do.

500|$|Olympic gold medallist Katherine Grainger {{presented}} Oxford {{with the}} trophy. Winning cox Zorilla said [...] "It was fun, tough {{but that was}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>We</b> had a plan and we stuck to it ruthlessly." [...] His Light Blue counterpart, Fieldman, remarked: [...] "I {{asked a lot of}} the guys and they gave it me every time. [...] Unfortunately it wasn't quite enough.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Royce {{said later}} after the fight with Hughes {{that he wanted}} a rematch and that he wasn't {{surprised}} by Hughes' performance, [...] "No, <b>we</b> knew <b>what</b> {{he was planning to}} do.

6000|$|... "My dear, I {{had come}} into the crypt full of courage and hope, though I knew what dreadful sight should sear my eyes once again. But we little know what may be in store for us, no matter <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect.</b> I went out with a heart like water from that dreadful desolation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{the terms}} offered," [...] the Bishop pointed out, [...] "are {{anything}} like <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect,</b> {{they are better}} than any which the politicians could ever have mooted, even after years more of bloodshed. It is my opinion that Stenson will welcome them, and that the country, generally speaking, will be entirely in favour of their acceptance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't say it at all!" [...] Mrs. Bonnycastle cried. [...] "She {{does nothing}} of the sort; for what do you take her? She sticks to him; that at least is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>EXPECT</b> her to do," [...] she added with less assurance. [...] "As I tell you, the type's new and the case under consideration.

40|$|The {{transmission}} {{characteristics of}} commercial interference filters {{are not quite}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> from the specifications provided by manufacturers.

60|$|Life {{is never}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> it to be. All our voyage from Baltimore {{south to the}} Horn and around the Horn {{has been marked by}} {{violence}} and death. And now that it has culminated in open mutiny there is no more violence, much less death. We keep to ourselves aft, and the mutineers keep to themselves for'ard. There is no more harshness, no more snarling and bellowing of commands; and in this fine weather a general festival obtains.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{quite know}} how we drove this heading with the tools we had, but I can't think of any means of saving it," [...] he said. [...] "There are men with money--Martial, and more of them--in the cities waiting {{to take away from}} us <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to get, and since we have to fight them, it seems to me {{advisable}} to strike where it's possible." [...] He laughed harshly. [...] "There'll be two feet less water in the valley before the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Brookenham knew. [...] "She's {{just the}} sort of person we ARE good for, and the thing for her is to be with us as much as possible--just live with us {{naturally}} and easily, listen to our talk, feel our confidence in her, be kept up, don't you know? by the sense of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> of her splendid type, and so, little by little, let our influence act. What I meant to say just now is that I do perfectly see her taking what you call presents." ...|$|E
40|$|The STARDUST {{mission is}} {{designed}} to collect dust the coma of comet Wild 2 and to collect interstellar dust on {{a second set of}} collectors. We have a reasonable idea of what to expect from the comet dust collection because the research community has been studying interplanetary dust particles for many years. It is less clear <b>what</b> <b>we</b> should <b>expect</b> from the interstellar dust. This presentation discusses <b>what</b> <b>we</b> might <b>expect</b> to find on the STARDUST interstellar dust collector...|$|R
50|$|The {{expected}} {{returns of}} GBM {{are independent of}} the value of the process (stock price), which agrees with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would <b>expect</b> in reality.|$|R
6000|$|Thus we {{proceeded}} {{slowly through}} the forest, stumbling frequently, tumbling occasionally, and staggering oft; but strange to say, without either of us having any very definite idea of where we were going, or <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> to find, or why we went in one direction more than another. In fact, we proceeded on that eminently simple principle which is couched in the well-known and time-honoured phrase, [...] "follow your nose." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{though the}} Christian names which we give our {{children}} here in England, have no especial meaning to them, and {{have nothing to}} do with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> or wish the children to be when they grow up, yet the names of people in most other countries in the world have. The Jewish names which we find in the Bible have almost all of them a meaning. So Simeon, I believe, means 'Obedient'; Jehoshaphat means, 'The Lord will judge'; Daniel, 'God is my judge'; Isaiah means, 'The Salvation of the Lord'; Isaac means, 'She laughs,' as a memorial of Sarah's laughing, when she heard that she was to have a child; Ishmael means, 'The Lord hears,' in remembrance of God's hearing Hagar's cry in the wilderness, when Ishmael was dying of thirst.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thomasin, don't lecture me--I can't have it. It is {{the excess}} above <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> {{that makes the}} force of the blow, and that may not be greater in their case than in mine: they may have {{foreseen}} the worst... I am wrongly made, Thomasin," [...] she added, with a mournful smile. [...] "Some widows can guard against the wounds their children give them by turning their hearts to another husband and beginning life again. But I always was a poor, weak, one-idea'd creature--I had not the compass of heart nor the enterprise for that. Just as forlorn and stupefied as I was when my husband's spirit flew away I have sat ever since--never attempting to mend matters at all. I was comparatively a young woman then, and I might have had another family by this time, and have been comforted by them for the failure of this one son." ...|$|E
60|$|The room is so obscure {{as to be}} invisible, but at {{the back}} of the obscurity are French windows, through which is seen Lob's garden bathed in moon-shine. The Darkness and Light, which this room and garden represent, are very still, but we should feel that it is only the pause in which old enemies regard each other before they come to the grip. The moonshine {{stealing}} about among the flowers, to give them their last instructions, has left a smile upon them, but it is a smile with a menace in it for the dwellers in darkness. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> to see next is the moonshine slowly pushing the windows open, so that it may whisper to a confederate in the house, whose name is Lob. But though we may be sure that this was about to happen it does not happen; a stir among the dwellers in darkness prevents it.|$|E
