25|$|Upset, Brecken tasks Crane {{with the}} job of making a deal with Rais. Upon meeting Rais, Crane is able to confirm that he is indeed Suleiman. He carries {{out a series of}} {{unethical}} tasks for Rais under the assumption that he will be rewarded with two crates of Antizin. Crane is unable to locate the file, and is later betrayed by Rais, who only gives him five vials of Antizin. He later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, and a whole floor is sealed off when an outbreak occurs. In desperate hopes to find Antizin, Crane and Jade pull a raid on a supply storage facility run by Rais, which was formerly a school. They find no Antizin, but rather plastic explosives, which they choose to confiscate to prevent Rais from using them in the future. While doing an errand, Rahim tells Crane that he and Omar (Emmerson Brooks) were planning to bomb an infected nest with the explosives found at the school. Crane is opposed to this plan. After discovering that Rahim went outside the Tower to plant the explosives, he chases after him. Upon catching up to him, he finds that Omar is dead, while Rahim has been wounded. He then executes Rahim's plans, resulting in the killing of the infected in the compound. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> to Rahim he discovers that he was actually bitten and had turned while Crane was gone, forcing Crane to snap Rahim's neck when he attacks Crane. Crane returns to the tower to inform Brecken of the news; Jade overhears them and, visibly upset, takes off.|$|E

In one episode, [...] "Thaddeus and Thor", Phineas says that fun is his only goal in his daily schemes [...] though Ferb adds that they also do it [...] "for the ladies." [...] Phineas also says that he wants his adventures to give him something interesting to say <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> to school, a setting the creators have confirmed they will never put him in.|$|E

6000|$|Yes, he had {{an immense}} time; and never wrote home, but saved it all up to tell <b>when</b> <b>he</b> should <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> Twice, with proper modesty and decency, he {{proposed}} to end his visit, but the Commodore said, [...] "No--wait; leave it to me; I'll tell you when to go." ...|$|R

50|$|Widowed {{a second}} time in 1441 when aged about 44, it was {{proposed}} that Jeanne should marry Jean d'Orléans, Count of Angoulême and of Périgord, a prisoner in England since 1412. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> did <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to France after 33 years' captivity, he married a younger woman who gave him three children.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't {{wait any}} longer," [...] she said, [...] "or {{it will be}} dark before I get home. Harry has {{followed}} that thing up the creek ever so far, {{and there is no}} knowing <b>when</b> <b>he</b> will <b>get</b> <b>back,</b> and it won't do for me to stay here. I'll go home, and leave a note for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] cried Lapham, helplessly submitting. He {{took out}} his watch, and {{saw that he had}} forty minutes to catch the four o'clock train. He hurried back to his office, and put {{together}} some papers preparatory to going, and despatched a note by his boy to Mrs. Lapham saying that he was starting for New York, and did not know just <b>when</b> <b>he</b> should <b>get</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R

60|$|La Fleur {{was in a}} quandary; {{there was}} no one at home but herself; a {{telegram}} is always important; very likely an immediate answer was required; and here was an opportunity to send one. If the message were from his sister, there might be something which she could answer. At any rate, it was an affair that must not be neglected, and Mr. Haverley had gone off with his fishing-rod, and no one knew <b>when</b> <b>he</b> would <b>get</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{imagine it}} will be four o'clock <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back,</b> while by leaving the hunt and heading {{straight}} across country I ought to beat him by some time.

6000|$|... "An'--say!--you oughta seen'm beat it. I bet he's goin' yet.

6000|$|... "That's to my taste, too," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "but {{it will be}} better for us to wait here and see what Maka has to say <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back.</b> Perhaps, if Mr. Rynders doesn't turn up pretty soon, we will all make a trip down there.

50|$|On 9 June 2004, a Palestinian {{goatherd}} {{complained that}} {{a resident of}} Yitzhar had stolen his goats.

A police unit rushed down to arrest the settlers, while members of Yitzhar’s readiness unit {{went down in the}} direction of the assault. The police claimed that the members of the readiness group blocked their way and interfered with their actions, and arrested the four men, accusing them of armed robbery, assault, stealing goats from a Palestinian, and preventing the police from doing their job.|$|R

[...] Bessie had seldom spoken openly with Mary Enderby about her brother; but that was rather from Mary's {{shrinking}} than her own; she knew that everybody understood his case.

50|$|Minnie {{arrived to}} Ferndale in 1994 {{with her mother}} Ellen Crozier (Robyn Malcolm) and {{stepfather}} - Johnny Marinovich (Stelio Yiakmis) and was devastated when the two separated. In 1995, she developed a crush on James Thornton (Chris Dykzeul) but nothing came of it. Minnie met her real father Ryan Birch (Robert Harte) and was shocked when she learned she {{was the product of}} rape. She grew close to Harry Martin (Dean O'Gorman) and soon lost her virginity to her streetkid stepbrother - Fergus Kearney (Paul Ellis). After taking up Shakespeare acting in 1997, Minnie was nearly raped by her teacher and ended up getting him fired. Minnie was disgusted in Johnny <b>when</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> together with Ellen and she briefly dated a Neo Nazi leader in retaliation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he seems}} all right," [...] Hilda answered, carelessly--and her voice {{reassured}} me. [...] "He's a rogue, of course; all guides and interpreters, and dragomans and the like, in out-of-the-way places, always ARE rogues. If they were honest men, they would share the ordinary prejudices of their countrymen, {{and would have}} nothing to do with the hated stranger. But in this case our friend, Ram Das, has no end to gain by getting us into mischief. If he had, he wouldn't scruple for a second to cut our throats; but then, there are too many of us. He will probably try to cheat us by making preposterous charges <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> us <b>back</b> to Toloo; but that's Lady Meadowcroft's business. I don't doubt Sir Ivor will be more than a match for him there. I'll back one shrewd Yorkshireman against any three Tibetan half-castes, any day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get in, sir," [...] said Pedgift, {{opening the}} door; [...] "I've found the man. He remembers the lady; and, {{though he has}} {{forgotten}} {{the name of the}} street, he believes he can find the place he drove her to <b>when</b> <b>he</b> once <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> into the neighborhood. I am charmed to inform you, Mr. Armadale, that we are in luck's way so far. I asked the waterman to show me the regular men on the stand; {{and it turns out that}} one of the regular men drove Mrs. Mandeville. The waterman vouches for him; he's quite an anomaly--a respectable cabman; drives his own horse, and has never been in any trouble. These are the sort of men, sir, who sustain one's belief in human nature. I've had a look at our friend, and I agree with the waterman; I think we can depend on him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's like enough," [...] Pearson replied, [...] "that they'll {{give the}} job up altogether. They've {{got plenty of}} plunder and scalps at the settlements, and their attacking us here in such force {{looks as if the}} hull of 'em were on their way back to their villages. If they could have tuk our scalps easy they would have done it; but War Eagle aint likely to risk losing a lot of men when he aint sartin of winning, after all. He has done good work as it is, and has quite enough to boast about <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back.</b> If he were to lose a heap of his braves here it would spoil the success of his expedition.

6000|$|... 'Yes. And {{tell him}} to come to the east passage door. It is that door next to the {{entrance}} to the stable-yard. There is a little yew-tree outside it. On second thoughts you, dear, must not come back. Wait at Corvsgate in the little inn parlour till Sol comes to you again. You will probably then have to go home to London alone; but do not mind it. The worst part for you will be in going from the station to the Crescent; but nobody will molest you in a four-wheel cab: you have done it before. However, he will tell you if this is necessary <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back.</b> I can best fight my battles alone.

The musician gets half-way there before he realizes his instrument is missing and takes a month to track it down. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> the guitar <b>back,</b> <b>he</b> is scolded by a stranger for being neglectful and self-centered.

50|$|A young girl, Megan, comes {{bursting}} {{out of her}} bedroom, running {{downstairs to}} her parents, who are watching television. She claims there is a man in her room, so her father, Jeff, playfully carries her back upstairs. They enter her room {{and it turns out}} it is a pile of clothes in a chair that frightened her. Jeff tucks her back into bed and he tries to comfort her by telling her a story his dad told him about keeping away monsters. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>gets</b> her <b>back</b> to sleep, he turns off the light. Once the light is off, the room appears to have changed to a jungle setting, helicopters blazing in and out and gunfire in the distance. Jeff stands in shock, but quickly turns on the light. The jungle setting disappears and Megan never roused, but after he turns the light off again, it doesn't return. Later on, Megan tries the secret from keeping away monsters, but a man's hand reaches out and pulls off the cover, scaring her.|$|R
5000|$|Latta {{is the son}} {{of former}} Otago prop John Latta, however after {{finishing}} off his schooling at Wellington College he started his senior rugby career in New Zealand's capital city.
