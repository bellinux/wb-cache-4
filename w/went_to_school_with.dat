Upon his recovery he joined Stalybridge Celtic of the Cheshire County League, and playing as a right-back he won the club's Player of the Year award. This won him a chance in the Football League, and he turned down Crystal Palace to instead sign with Third Division club Plymouth Argyle in February 1974. He was told by manager Tony Waiters that he would never be anything more than a fringe player in the professional game, who then allowed him to leave Home Park on a free transfer. He returned to Manchester and signed with Hyde United for the 1974–75 Cheshire County League season.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Barbara Curry, {{who was a}} {{criminal}} lawyer for ten years, revealed that she developed the script's concept after running past a house which she described as her [...] "dream house".

500|$|The same year, Salinger began {{submitting}} {{short stories}} to The New Yorker. Seven of Salinger's stories were {{rejected by the}} magazine that year, including [...] "Lunch for Three", [...] "Monologue for a Watery Highball", and [...] "I <b>Went</b> <b>to</b> <b>School</b> <b>with</b> Adolf Hitler". In December 1941, however, the publication accepted [...] "Slight Rebellion off Madison", a Manhattan-set story about a disaffected teenager named Holden Caulfield with [...] "pre-war jitters". When Japan carried out the attack on Pearl Harbor that month, the story was rendered [...] "unpublishable"; it did {{not appear in the}} magazine until 1946. In the spring of 1942, several months after the United States entered World War II, Salinger was drafted into the army, wherein he saw combat with the 12th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. He was present at Utah Beach on D-Day, in the Battle of the Bulge, and the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>with.</b> The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Doris (1932–2006), a homemaker, and Keith McCormack, an oil company {{financial}} analyst who died from cancer in 2008. [...] He is the oldest of three siblings. McCormack has Scottish ancestry. McCormack states while he was growing up, he was shy and did not play sports. McCormack attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute High School in Scarborough, Ontario. There, he enrolled in theatre and performed in high school productions of Godspell and Pippin, and decided {{to pursue a career}} in acting. McCormack recalls after performing in Godspell, his feelings towards becoming an actor solidified. [...] "...I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the beginning of my life as an actor. It changed me in that the concept of any other options disappeared. From that moment there was no question. I knew exactly what I was going to do. I'm lucky that way." [...] He admits that he never felt cool growing up. [...] "I was a bit of an outsider, but I discovered theatre very early on, which got me through." [...] He then transferred to Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, where he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> David Furnish. He graduated in 1982.|$|E

500|$|Rockwell's final {{work was}} the result of four restarts and {{consumed}} two months. [...] According to Scholes, the subject resembles a Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart character in a Frank Capra film. Each version depicted the blue-collar man in casual attire standing up at a town meeting, but each was from a different angle. Earlier versions were troubled by the distraction of multiple subjects and the improper placement and perspective of the subject for the message to be clear. [...] An Arlington, Vermont Rockwell neighbor, Carl Hess, stood as the model for the shy, brave young workman, and another neighbor, Jim Martin, who appeared in each painting in the series, is in the scene. Rockwell's assistant, Gene Pelham, suggested Hess, who had a gas station in town and whose children <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> the Rockwell children. According to Pelham, Hess [...] "had a noble head". Others in the work were Hess' father Henry (left ear only), Jim Martin (lower right corner), Harry Brown (right [...] top of head and eye only), Robert Benedict, Sr. and Rose Hoyt to the left. Rockwell's own eye is also visible along the left edge. Hess was married at the time and Henry Hess was a German immigrant. Pelham was the owner of the suede jacket. Hess posed for Rockwell eight different times for this work and all other models posed for Rockwell individually.|$|E
500|$|The band's early tour {{vehicle was}} a [...] "tiny V6 that was running on three cylinders, {{and it was}} not getting enough air, so it would drive really slowly," [...] {{recalled}} Wentz. [...] "We had to turn on the hot air to reach the speed limit, so we had the heat on all the time in 120 degree weather. It was so hot it melted the plastic molding around the windows. When it rained, we'd get all wet." [...] John Janick of Fueled by Ramen had heard an early version of a song online and cold-called the band members at their apartment, first reaching Stump and later talking to Wentz for an hour. Rob Stevenson from Island Records eventually offered the band a [...] "first-ever incubator sort of deal," [...] in which they gave the band money to sign with Fueled by Ramen for the group's one-off debut, knowing they could [...] "upstream" [...] the band to radio on the sophomore record. Fueled by Ramen, at the time the smallest of independent labels clamoring to sign the band, would effectively release the group's debut album and help build the band's ever-expanding fanbase before the group moved to Island. The band again partnered with O'Keefe at Smart Studios, bringing together the three songs from the demo and recording an additional seven songs in nine days. The band, according to Stump, didn't [...] "sleep anywhere that we could shower [...] There was a girl that Andy's girlfriend at the time <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> who let us sleep on her floor, but we'd be there for maybe four hours at a time. It was crazy." [...] As the band progressed and the members' roles became more defined, Wentz took lyrics extremely seriously in contrast to Stump, who had been the group's primary lyricist up to that point. Arguments during the recording sessions led to what [...] "most reductively boils down to Wentz writing the lyrics and Stump writing the melodies." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2009, Moore, {{along with}} several other Battlestar Galactica alumni, made a cameo {{appearance}} in the [...] episode [...] "A Space Oddity." [...] The episode was directed by Michael Nankin (who directed a number of Galactica episodes), written by Bradley Thompson and David Weddle (who both started their TV writing careers on Deep Space Nine, and worked as writer/producers on Galactica) and based on a story by Naren Shankar (who <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> Moore and started his writing career on Star Trek: The Next Generation). In the episode, Moore has one line of dialogue as he portrays an irate audience member at a science fiction convention, yelling at the (fictional) producer of a dark-and-gritty remake of a beloved cult series. Several of his Battlestar Galactica colleagues including Grace Park and Rekha Sharma appear in non-speaking cameos, while Kate Vernon is a major guest star in the episode.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} about Milton's time at St. Paul's, because the school's records were lost in a fire during the late 17th century. The actual date of Milton's start at the school is uncertain, further than estimate {{in the range from}} 1615 to 1622. According to accounts by Edward Phillips, Milton's nephew, and by Christopher Milton, Milton started at the school during his earliest years. However, Phillips states that Milton <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> his brother, which ambiguous phrasing pushes the date to 1622. Milton, in his Defensio Secunda, claims that he began his deeper studies at the age of 12, which places the date after 1620. While at the school, Milton befriended Charles Diodati, and the two kept up a regular correspondence of letters and poetry. It is certain that the friendship was established Diodati before Diodati left to study at Oxford in early 1623.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{landing at}} Quebec City on 1 August 1870, the Bells {{transferred}} to another steamer to Montreal, and then took the Grand Trunk Railway to Paris, Ontario, residing at the parsonage of the Reverend Thomas Philip Henderson. Henderson was a [...] Baptist minister and close family friend who likely <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> <b>with</b> Melville in Scotland, and who had previously invited the Bell family to immigrate to Canada. After a brief stay {{of only a few}} days with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a homestead of 5 hectares (13 acres) at Tutelo Heights (in the present day called Tutela Heights, named for the First Nations band that had previously settled the area), on the outskirts of Brantford, Ontario, for CA$2,600 (approximately CA$ in current dollars), with $2,100 being paid immediately. They were likely assisted in their search by the advance efforts of Reverend Henderson, who was also employed as a school board inspector. At the time of the Bell family's departure from the UK, Alexander Graham's health was threateningly poor, with [...] "a chest condition... giving cause for concern" [...] and his tall, broad-framed body being reduced to 59kg (130lb), leaving his face gaunt.|$|E
