25|$|Alexander {{often had}} to divide his forces and command was given {{to a variety of}} senior {{officers}} on different occasions. For example, a few weeks before this mission of Hephaestion's, Craterus had been sent with a large force to subdue the last two remaining Bactrian rebels. It seems that Hephaestion was chosen when the objectives were far from clear-cut, and Alexander needed a commander on whom he could rely to do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done himself without needing instructions.|$|E
25|$|After being waived by the Lakers, Calderón {{was set to}} {{join the}} Golden State Warriors. However, after Kevin Durant {{suffered}} a possible season-ending knee injury, the Warriors felt they needed a forward instead of a point guard to fill Durant's role. The Warriors still honored their agreement with Calderón, signing him on March 1, 2017 before waiving him later that day. While he was only with the team for two hours, the Warriors agreed to pay Calderón <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> earned if {{he was on the}} team {{for the rest of the}} season; that being $415,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{case against}} Chapman rests {{mainly on the}} point that he {{undoubtedly}} was a violent man with a misogynistic streak. He was known to beat his common-law-wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife, Lucy Klosowska, down on their bed and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. He reportedly later told her that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out the spot where he would have buried her and reciting <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said to their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, more {{classical}} performers were gradually {{moving away}} from the performance style and instrumentation that were established in the romantic era: they started to perform Bach's music on period instruments of the baroque era, studied and practised playing techniques and tempi as established in his time, and reduced the size of instrumental ensembles and choirs to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> employed. The BACH motif, used by the composer in his own compositions, was used in dozens of tributes to the composer from the 19th century to the 21st. In the 21st century, the complete extant output of the composer became available on-line, with several websites exclusively dedicated to him.|$|E

We have seen so much softness in him; it was great to play that tough side." [...] He described the scene in which he was strapped to an operating table with Mulder as [...] "totally uncomfortable". He joked that [...] "the only upside of that was that the author [...] was lying right beside me, feeling equally uncomfortable.

500|$|Littell said {{he wanted}} to focus on the {{thinking}} of an executioner and of origins of state murder, showing how we can take decisions that lead, or not, to a genocide. Littell claims he set out creating the character Max Aue by imagining <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done and how he would have behaved if he had been born into Nazi Germany. One childhood event that kept Littell interested in the question of being a killer was the Vietnam War. According to him, his childhood terror was that he would be drafted, sent to Vietnam [...] "and made to kill women and children who hadn't done anything to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheney {{has said}} {{his time at}} the Pentagon was the most {{rewarding}} period of his public service career, calling it [...] "the one that stands out." [...] In 2014, Cheney recounted that when he met with President George H. W. Bush to accept the offer, he passed a painting in the private residence entitled The Peacemakers, which depicted President Lincoln, General Grant, and William Tecumseh Sherman. [...] "My great-grandfather had served under William Tecumseh Sherman throughout the war," [...] Cheney said, [...] "and {{it occurred to me}} as I was in the room as I walked in to talk to the President about becoming Secretary of Defense, I wondered <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> thought that his great-grandson would someday be in the White House with the President talking about taking over the reins of the U.S. military." ...|$|E
500|$|Dungeon Keeper 2 was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows by Electronic Arts in late June 1999. Goldsworthy believed Peter Molyneux, {{producer of the}} original game, would be pleased with the sequel. Indeed, Molyneux stated that he [...] "liked what they did with it", but also {{said that it was}} not precisely <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done and that his focus would have been [...] "expanding that sense of creating the greatest dungeon". A PlayStation version was in development, but cancelled. The first patch, which added levels, fixed bugs, and tweaked gameplay, {{was released}} in August. Ideas such as the merging of the underworld and overworld were planned for Dungeon Keeper 3, but Electronic Arts began focusing on other franchises such as Harry Potter. In August 2000, Bullfrog announced that the development of Dungeon Keeper 3 had been cancelled. Dungeon Keeper 2 is available on gog.com and Origin.|$|E

500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what would have happened to their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E
500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that if he said nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, Mark Tooley, then {{director}} of the Institute on Religion and Democracy's (IRD) United Methodist committee, wrote an opinion piece about Jesus for President in the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard. Tooley is heavily critical {{of the book and}} of Claiborne, writing, [...] "On so many different levels, Claiborne lacks moral and spiritual perspective." [...] Tooley argues that Jesus for President is selective in its quotations from Church Fathers and instead relies heavily on the teachings of heterodox theologians, naming specifically Walter Brueggemann, John Dominic Crossan, and Walter Wink, people that Tooley writes would not [...] "inspire confidence in orthodox Christians." [...] While praising Claiborne's story of nonviolence in response to personally being trapped with a friend in an alley by criminals who hit them with sticks, Tooley criticizes Claiborne for not explaining <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done in the case of encountering a pregnant woman who was being similarly treated. Christopher Hitchens, an Anglo-American critic of religion, wrote an article in British tabloid newspaper the Sunday Express in response to Tooley's review. He calls Jesus for President [...] "a terrible-sounding book" [...] and Claiborne [...] "a terrible-sounding person." [...] Hitchens argues that Claiborne and Tooley are attempting to justify their own views by ascribing them to Jesus, with Claiborne arguing that a Jesus would have supported liberation theology and Tooley arguing that Jesus would have supported neoconservatism.|$|E

2500|$|The limited {{schedule}} for Live It Up meant that DeWyze {{had to write}} his songs while on tour, which he found to be an overwhelming task. He has said {{this was one of}} the reasons for why the album did not live up to expectations and has also explained that there was pressure in trying to work with a large number of people, all of whom had their own ideas. He described the situation as [...] "one of those too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen kind of things". Although DeWyze felt that he and RCA were not thinking the same thing regarding his musical style, he still had high hopes about recording a second album with them and trying to take it in a different direction, but in September 2011, he was dismissed by the label. He said that this was disheartening and not <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> expected, but that the decision was [...] "fairly mutual" [...] and followed a series of talks between him and RCA.|$|E
