40|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen {{increased}} theoretical and empirical interest in multidimensional measures of welfare. This paper develops a two-parameter class of <b>welfare</b> <b>indices</b> that is sensitive to two distinct forms of inter-personal inequality in the multidimensional framework. The first form of inequality pertains {{to the spread of}} each dimensional achievement across the population, as would be reflected in the multidimensional version of the usual Lorenz criterion. The second one regards association or correlation across dimensions, reflecting the key observation that inter-dimensional association may alter evaluation of individual as well as overall inequality. Most existing multi-dimensional <b>welfare</b> <b>indices</b> are, however, either completely insensitive to inter-personal inequality or are only sensitive to the first. The class of indices developed in this paper is sensitive to both forms of multidimensional inequality. An axiomatic characterization of the class is provided, and it is shown that other multidimensional indices, such as the ones developed by Bourguignon (1999) and Foster, Lopez-Calva, and Székely (2005), are sub-classes of this new broader class.

40|$|Most {{poverty and}} {{inequality}} analysis rely on household-based surveys, such as {{income and expenditure}} surveys. Since multistage stratified sampling is used for these surveys, and coverage errors and non-response are generally part of surveys, {{it is essential that}} the data be weighted in order to obtain improved accuracy of the estimates of the measures. The first part of this paper considers the use of weighting, especially calibration/integrated weighting, in order to improve the estimation of welfare measures such as the Headcount index, Gini coefficient and Theil's index in complex surveys. The second part considers whether the bootstrap resampling technique provides reliable estimation results for poverty and inequality measures, especially for the construction of confidence intervals. Application of the bootstrap in complex sampling designs is discussed and used to estimate the bias and MSE of estimators of the <b>welfare</b> <b>indices</b> under consideration, over the different weighting techniques. Four confidence intervals for the <b>welfare</b> <b>indices</b> that are discussed under complex sampling, are the standard (asymptotic) interval, percentile interval, bootstrap-i interval and BCa interval. The latter confidence interval has not been applied previously in complex sampling. Results are given that assess the different weighting techniques as well as the performance of the bootstrap under complex sampling.

In principle, this approach offers the advantage of data sets not needing to be elaborately collected and of their presumably having been checked for errors during their initial use.

Third, I will calculate the National Performance Gaps (NPG) s for the child <b>welfare</b> <b>index</b> (WINOCENT) and the variables comprising it, by regressing them against per capita income using the ordinary least squares method. In the fourth and last stage, regression analysis will be used to examine the relationships between the dependent variable, i. e. the WINOCENT and its constituent elements, and the independent variables, i. e. the structural and policy variables. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we perform the first econometric attempt to {{estimate}} the trade-off between equity and efficiency of tax systems counting for the tax evasion option in a developing country such as Albania. Using the Albanian Living Srandard Measurement Survey (2005, 2008) we estimate a micro-econometric model of labour supply and incorporate the option of participation in regular and irregular labour markets. Swapping the tax rules of 2005 with 2008, {{we find that the}} flat tax has not contributed in the reduction of labour informality but rather the increases in regular wages have {{played an important role in}} convincing the individuals to move to regular market. Furthermore, we find that controls and audits are more efficient than fines in inducing people to switch from the informal to formal labour market. A similar effect is achieved also when “honest” individuals are endowed with a universal benefit. In distributional terms, calculations of Gini inequality index and Sen’s <b>welfare</b> <b>index</b> demonstrate that the only scenario that would improve <b>welfare</b> <b>index</b> is a progressive tax rule as before 2007.
