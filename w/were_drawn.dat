5|$|After the {{different}} {{components of a}} scene were finished, the team at Bones created its layout art; this included things such as determining the camera position throughout the scene and how movements would be done.

Voice acting, music, sound effects, sound leveling and remixing was then done, and added to the cutscene.|$|E
