5|$|A 2004-05 EPA {{study of}} the river rated the water quality 6 out of 100. The study also {{discovered}} that dissolved oxygen levels in the <b>water</b> <b>were</b> low because there were few organisms, poor sediment, and little plant life in the river. Although storm water from residential neighborhoods added dissolved oxygen, it also brought ammonia from fertilizer. The Army Corps of Engineers found that the channeling prevented aquatic life from sustaining itself; few fish naturally spawn in the river because of the cement casing and flume at its mouth.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, Erie started {{building}} a waterworks on Presque Isle to provide fresh {{water for the}} city. Water from Lake Erie was pumped into two reservoirs on the peninsula, where particulates in the <b>water</b> <b>were</b> allowed to settle, removing them from the lake water. After treatment, the water flowed into the waterlines of the city. In 1917 a pumphouse powered by a steam boiler and engine was built: this pumped the water from one basin into the other, then across Presque Isle Bay to Erie. This system of supplying drinking water for Erie operated until 1949. The pumphouse is now used for zebra mussel control and as a concession stand for bicycle and quadracycle-rentals within the state park.|$|E
5|$|Men were lowered by bucket {{down the}} airshafts to dig by candlelight. They were paid £1.50 per week to shovel 20 tons (20.32 tonnes) {{of rock and}} earth per 12–hour shift, seven days a week. Conditions were {{constantly}} wet, with foul air and gunpowder fumes and the danger of roof–collapse. The tunnel cuts through hard sandstone, shale and clay, and there are seven major faults in the rock near the centre point. The work was dangerous because the rock at the Horsforth end was difficult to blast, and there was frequent flooding and subsidence. About 1,563,480,000 gallons (7,107,580,080 litres) of <b>water</b> <b>were</b> pumped out of the workings between 1845 and 1849. Metal sheets had {{to be used to}} divert water inside the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|The Alsos Mission {{set out on}} 20 April and rendezvoused {{with the}} 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion at Freudenstadt. The intact bridge over the Neckar River at Horb was crossed and Haigerloch was {{occupied}} without opposition on 22 April. The main body of Task Force A arrived on 23 April. In a laboratory in a cellar they found a German experimental nuclear reactor shaped like a cylinder and made of graphite blocks, but the uranium and heavy <b>water</b> <b>were</b> missing. The scientists immediately began dismantling it. Pash left Hambro in charge, while he led troops of Task Force A to Bisingen, {{and then on to}} Hechingen, where 25 scientists were captured, including von Weizsäcker, von Laue, Karl Wirtz, Horst Korsching and Erich Bagge. At Tailfingen they took Otto Hahn and nine members of his staff into custody. At Haigerloch, a sealed drum of documents was retrieved from a cesspool, and three drums of heavy water and 1.5 tons of uranium ingots were found buried in a field. The uranium and heavy <b>water</b> <b>were</b> loaded onto trucks. The apertures in the cellar were blown up with minor explosions to prevent their capture by the French.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} that struck the Azorean islands was a magnitude 7.2 on the Richter scale.

The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change was caused by the use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans).|$|E
50|$|One puzzling {{consequence}} of Kripke semantics is that identities involving rigid designators <b>are</b> necessary. If <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O, then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. Since the terms 'water' and 'H2O' {{pick out the}} same object in every possible world, there is no possible world in which 'water' picks out something different from 'H2O'. Therefore, <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O. It is possible, of course, that we are mistaken about the chemical composition of water, {{but that does not}} affect the necessity of identities. What is not being claimed <b>is</b> that <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O, but conditionally, if <b>water</b> <b>is</b> H2O (though we may not know this, it does not change the fact if it <b>is</b> true), then <b>water</b> <b>is</b> necessarily H2O.|$|R

5|$|The {{properties}} of heavy water {{had been discovered}} in 1932 by Harold Urey. In 1933, Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun, the head of Norsk Hydro Rjukan, created a plan for industrial production of heavy water in Norway.

Tronstad was paid by Norsk Hydro as a consultant. Already in 1934, Norsk Hydro had opened a plant near the power station at Vemork. This was the world's first plant for industrial mass production of heavy water. Both French and German scientists expressed interest in the project.|$|E

The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent 23flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of Ulithi and Fais. About 76,000litres (20,000gallons) of <b>water</b> <b>were</b> sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies.

Rough waves capsized 10boats and closed several beaches, and one person drowned due to the surf. Further inland, two people drowned when a river overflowed its banks, and near Caracas a man died after strong winds toppled a wall. The combination of rainfall and winds destroyed 21houses and blew off the roof of several others, affecting 1,376people, of whom 80 were left homeless.

Attempts to round the Cape over the next two days were unsuccessful, and Endeavour was repeatedly driven back by wind, rain and contrary tides. Cook noted that the seas off the Cape were large enough to regularly submerge the bow of the ship as she rode down from the crests of waves. At last, on 16 January the wind eased and the ship was able to pass the Cape and anchor in the Bay of Good Success on the Pacific coast. The crew were sent to collect wood and water, while Banks and his team gathered hundreds of plant specimens from along the icy shore.
