5|$|Street & Smith, one of {{the longest}} {{established}} and most respected publishers, shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, partially {{as a result of the}} success of paperbacks. Standard continued with Startling and Thrilling, but the end came only a few years later. In 1954, Fredric Wertham published Seduction of the Innocent, a book in which he asserted that comics were inciting children to violence. A subsequent Senate subcommittee hearing led to a backlash against comics, and the publishers dropped titles in response. The financial impact spread to pulp magazines, since often a publisher would publish both. A 1955 strike by American News Corporation, the main distributor in the U.S., meant that magazines remained in warehouses and never made it to the newsstands; the unsold copies represented a significant financial blow and contributed to publishers' decisions to cancel magazines. Startling was {{one of the}} casualties. The schedule had already returned from monthly to bimonthly in 1953, and it became a quarterly in early 1954. Thrilling Wonder published its last issue in early 1955, and was then merged with Startling, as <b>was</b> <b>Fantastic</b> Story Magazine, another companion publication, but the combined magazine lasted only three more issues. Mines left the magazine at the end of 1954; he was succeeded for two issues by Theron Raines, who was followed by Herbert D. Kastle for the last two. The final issue was dated Fall 1955.|$|E
25|$|Fisher {{made her}} film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive {{character}} Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975). Lee Grant and Jack Warden {{play the role}} of her parents in the film. Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn also star in the film. In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford. At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars <b>was</b> <b>fantastic,</b> but did not expect many people to agree with her. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was paired with fellow resident Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) who shared a deceptive personality with him. This created many stories for both characters as they plotted against their neighbours. Dennis stated [...] "the Paul and Izzy relationship <b>was</b> <b>fantastic,</b> {{it was very}} popular. Izzy was an interesting character because she was very emotional and insecure. That's what drove her evil ways. She {{had a bit of}} a soulmate in Paul."

Finn later revealed that the elephant used for the episode, named [...] "Bubbles", <b>was</b> <b>fantastic</b> to work with. There was initially concern from the producers that the elephant would not run towards the truck for the episode's teaser. Instead, however, the elephant thoroughly enjoyed the truck and the producers had difficulty getting the creature away from it.|$|E

[...] He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966.

The band's frontman J Mascis explained, [...] "We recorded it for a compilation album, but when we finished it we {{liked it so much}} we didn't want to give it to them." [...] Smith said, [...] "J Mascis sent me a cassette, and it was so passionate.

Jones was again linked with {{high-profile}} clubs on 21 December 2007, including Chelsea and Liverpool, but Sunderland manager Roy Keane {{insisted that he}} would be going nowhere. Jones scored his fifth goal at the Stadium of Light, with a header from the near post off a corner kick, in Sunderland's 3–1 win over Bolton Wanderers on 29 December.Chelsea captain John Terry praised Jones, saying: [...] "Jones <b>was</b> <b>fantastic</b> and I have played against him twice now.

500|$|The {{song was}} memorialized in the April 2000 Saturday Night Live comedy sketch [...] "More Cowbell".

Will Ferrell wrote the sketch and played Gene Frenkle, an overweight cowbell player. [...] "Legendary" [...] producer Bruce Dickinson, played by Christopher Walken, asked Frenkle to [...] "really explore the studio space" [...] and up the ante on his cowbell playing. The rest of the band are visibly annoyed by Frenkle, but Dickinson tells everyone, [...] "I got a fever, and the only prescription--is more cowbell!" [...] Buck Dharma thought the sketch <b>was</b> <b>fantastic</b> and said he never gets tired of it.

She started her year well by finishing second at the Swedish Rally behind teammate and home favourite Blomqvist. Mouton later stated that [...] "finishing second <b>was</b> <b>fantastic.</b> When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From {{one side to the other}} side.

Under his leadership, Temple Sinai began holding monthly fine arts performances {{as part of the}} Friday night service, in place of the usual sermon. In December 1970, the Temple's fine arts committee commissioned an original dance work from Anna Halprin and her multi-racial dance troupe. For the next two months Broude met weekly with Halprin, educating her regarding the Friday night prayers. The completed work, titled Kadosh, included a candlelight vigil, and dancers tearing their clothes and shouting questions at Broude that reframed the classic question about God and The Holocaust in terms of the Vietnam War: [...] "How can there be a God if He allows all the suffering of the Vietnam War to continue?" [...] The performance engendered passionate responses from the congregation; according to Broude [...] "I don't know if anyone was neutral.

500|$|Colbeck {{started the}} new season in League Two as a substitute, but won {{a place in the}} side, and scored his first senior goal against Lincoln City more than three years after his debut. However, after a mistake cost defeat to Milton Keynes Dons, he was told he could join another club on loan. On 24 October 2007, Colbeck went on a month-long loan to Darlington {{to take the place of}} injured Julian Joachim. Colbeck scored in both his second and third games before the loan was {{extended}} for a second month. The loan deal was cut short when he returned to Bradford City in December 2007 after he had made six appearances for Darlington, but Darlington manager Dave Penney was disappointed to see Colbeck leave saying, [...] "Joe <b>was</b> <b>fantastic</b> for us.

For the main event, James said that [...] "this didn't feel like a ladder match. Dallas simply {{did not take the}} risks needed to show that he really wanted to retain his title". However, he was not disappointed because he did not [...] "expect too much from a Bo Dallas match". James felt that it was a problem to close the show with Dallas-Neville because [...] "the show could only go down" [...] from Cesaro-Zayn. Lastly, James had some technical issues viewing the live stream of the event, where the video paused during the Cesaro-Zayn match, and the feed cut out during Rusev's appearance, but returned before the main event match started.|$|E

[...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl believed that [...] "Back from Vacation" [...] was [...] "one of the two or three best of the season", opining that [...] "simplicity" [...] was the key to the series' success. Dahl continued, [...] "Each episode's premise can be entirely mundane and inconsequential. It will still mine laughs from the situation at hand. We also had some nice development in the Jim-Pam-Karen triangle, with Pam giving Jim relationship advice, then bawling her eyes out afterwards. Maybe the best scene in the episode saw Dwight comfort her." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A.|$|E
500|$|As he was {{developing}} the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching {{experience at the}} Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, and sponges. It came {{to him that the}} series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: [...] "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that <b>was</b> <b>fantastic</b> but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one." [...] In 1994, Hillenburg began to further develop some characters from The Intertidal Zone, including Bob the Sponge.|$|E
500|$|The episode has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times remarked, [...] "Great acting, a decent twist {{and the truth}} {{behind one of the}} most enigmatic characters in television history. Why can’t more Fringe episodes be like this? Why can’t more television be like Fringe?'". Hanson also lauded Jared Harris' performance, calling him [...] "a fantastic villain. Arrogant and superior, with hints of insecurity. Jones’ speech about all living creatures needing incentive might have been goofy coming from any other actor, but from Harris, it is creepy beyond belief. So glad Fringe found a way to bring David Robert Jones back." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler rated it 9.0/10 for being a [...] "fast-paced story" [...] that was [...] "the best episode of the season so far". He continued [...] "Olivia's great escape from Jones and Bad Nina <b>was</b> <b>fantastic</b> television and some clever writing." [...] Isler did find some of the Observer revelations [...] "a bit of a let-down" [...] however, as he felt he had already been made aware of them; this was not enough to make him critical of the episode.|$|E
