3000|$|The {{second phase}} of {{fieldwork}} was conducted in 2011 by an anthropologist and included eight interviews centred on the contemporary scientific publications on moths, reindeer and mountain birches (e.g. Klemola et al. 2003, Klemola 2009, Tømmervik et al. 2009, Ammunét 2011). The results put forward in these publications were presented in popular form to the herders, who were asked key questions such as: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if outbreaks of both autumnal and winter moth become more common as the climate gets warmer? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{about the impact of}} global warming and reindeer on the growth of birch trees? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of reindeer herding? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of the mountain birch forests in your area?

6000|$|They were in shirt sleeves; smoking, chewing, {{spitting}} incessantly; lowering {{their voices}} {{for a moment}} so {{that she did not}} hear what they said and afterward giggling hoarsely; using over and over the canonical phrases: [...] "Three to dole," [...] "I raise you a finif," [...] "Come on now, ante up; <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is, a pink tea?" [...] The cigar-smoke was acrid and pervasive. The firmness with which the men mouthed their cigars made the lower part of their faces expressionless, heavy, unappealing. They were like politicians cynically dividing appointments.|$|E

[...] And then, {{after the}} wont of very stupid people, M. de Galgenstein {{went on to explain}} to the Abbe his own pun. [...] "Well, but to proceed," [...] cries he.

See, then, {{you have}} in this work well-founded knowledge, simple and right aims, {{thorough}} mastery of handicraft, splendid invention in arrangement, unerring common sense in treatment,--merits, these, I think, exemplary enough to justify our tormenting you a little with Greek art. But it has one merit more than these, the greatest of all. It always means something worth saying. Not merely worth saying for that time only, but for all time. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> helmet of lion's hide is always given to Hercules for? You can't suppose it means only that he once killed a lion, and always carried its skin afterwards {{to show that he}} had, as Indian sportsmen sent home stuffed rugs, with claws at the corners, and a lump in the middle which one tumbles over every time one stirs the fire. What was this Nemean Lion, whose spoils were evermore to cover Hercules from the cold? Not merely a large specimen of Felis Leo, ranging the fields of Nemea, be sure of that. This Nemean cub was one of a bad litter. Born of Typhon and Echidna,--of the whirlwind and the snake,--Cerberus his brother, the Hydra of Lerna his sister,--it must have been difficult to get his hide off him. He had to be found in darkness, too, and dealt upon without weapons, by grip at the throat-- arrows and club of no avail against him. What does all that mean? ...|$|E

Although the 92nd had significant casualties, Daugherty recounts how the military did not send replacement troops to keep their numbers up. As units within his division were cut down through attrition, they were forced to continue on without reinforcements. Daugherty recalls asking another soldier why the officers couldn’t just call up replacements, and he replied: [...] "Look, bud, they don’t train colored soldiers to fight…they train them to load ships, and you don’t expect them to put white boys in a Negro outfit, do you? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> is, a democracy or something?" ...|$|E
