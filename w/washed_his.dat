During the day of Yom Kippur, the High Priest would immerse himself five times and wash his hands and feet ten times. Except for this first immersion, he would do each on holy ground in the Parwah cell. They spread a linen sheet between him and the people. If the High Priest was either old or delicate, they warmed the water for him. He undressed, immersed himself, came up, and dried off. They brought him the golden garments; he put them on and <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> hands and feet.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the hardships}} and privations, Halberstam was {{a beacon of}} {{strength}} and hope for his fellow prisoners. When one died in the infirmary—hardly a noteworthy occurrence in those days—the Rebbe stood up and eulogized him for having been a great Torah scholar in Hungary. He refused to eat non-kosher food or food cooked in the non-kosher kitchen, subsisting only on bread and water during his nine months in Muldorf. Moreover, he would not eat the bread until he had ritually <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> hands, and would often wait for days to find some water for this purpose. One prisoner watched him stand beside the cement mixer {{for hours at a}} time, collecting the drops of water that dripped from the tank.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad's father, Abdullah, died {{almost six}} months before he was born. According to tradition, soon after his birth Muhammad was sent {{to live with a}} Bedouin family in the desert, as the desert life was {{considered}} healthier for infants. Because he was fatherless, wetnurses refused to take him, fearing {{that it would not be}} profitable to take care of an orphan. However, he was accepted by Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, a wetnurse who had found no child to take care of. Muhammad stayed with his foster-mother, Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb, and her husband until he was two or three years old. One day, according to his wetnurse Halima, Muhammad was visited by two men, who opened up his chest and <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> heart. Troubled, Halima and her husband returned Muhammad to his mother.|$|E
25|$|Garner faced several {{life-threatening}} childhood illnesses, {{which left}} him bed ridden {{for much of}} the time. He went to a local village school, where he found that, despite being praised for his intelligence, he was punished for speaking in his native Cheshire dialect; for instance, when he was six his primary school teacher <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> mouth out with soapy water. Garner then won a place at Manchester Grammar School, where he received his secondary education; entry was means-tested, resulting in his school fees being waived. Rather than focusing his interest on creative writing, it was here that he excelled at sprinting. He used to go jogging along the highway, and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician Alan Turing, who shared his fascination with the Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Garner was then conscripted into national service, serving for a time with the Royal Artillery while posted to Woolwich in Southeast London.|$|E

25|$|A {{couple years}} before dying {{he was often}} heard {{remarking}} that he had grown old and this {{to some of his}} devotees was him dropping hints about his final days being imminently close. On the morning of 28 May 1968, as a part of his daily routine, he <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> face, tied his turban and smeared his forehead with a saffron mark (called tilak in Hinduism). All throughout the day, many people had come to visit him. Later-on in the noon, some sadhus (wandering monks) too had come to visit him. He used to give alms to these visiting sadhus (some of whom he would call as mere jugglers in ochre robes) who, on their journey to Amarnath shrine, would stop-over at his place. On this day too, he gave these sadhus whatever money he had in his cloth purse. He is then said to have gone into a state of meditative trance (called samadhi in Hinduism) till about 5:30pm when he asked for some water and was helped to drink a tumbler full of sweet water. He died at about 5:45pm and his recorded last words were Om Namah Shivaya (the mantra of Lord Shiva). On his death, Swami Nand Lal, is said to have remarked that Kashmir was being rocked by an earthquake. He is also said to have predicted Bhagwan Gopinath's death a week in advance.|$|E

In the Apostolic Constitutions, VIII, 11, the hands of the celebrants are washed just before the dismissal of the catechumens.|$|R

500|$|A third {{account was}} made by a private named John Shaw who was in Washington's regiment, but not present at the affair. [...] His account, based on {{detailed}} accounts from others who were present, was made in a sworn statement on August 21; the details on Tanacharison's role in the affair are confirmed in a newspaper account printed on June 27. [...] In his account, the French were surrounded while some still slept. [...] Alerted by a noise, one of the Frenchmen [...] "fired a Gun upon which Col. Washington gave the Word for all his Men to fire. [...] Several of them being killed, the rest betook themselves to flight, but our Indians haveing gone round the French ... they fled back to the English and delivered up their Arms ... Some Time after the Indians came up the Half King took his Tomahawk and split the Head of the French Captain haveing first {{asked if he was}} an Englishman and haveing been told he was a French Man. [...] He then took his Brains and <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> Hands with them and then scalped him. [...] All this ... has heard and never heard it contradicted but knows nothing of it from his own Knowledge". [...] Shaw's narrative is substantially correct on a number of other details, including the size and composition of both forces. [...] Shaw also claimed to have seen and counted the dead, numbering 13or 14.|$|E
500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex with her was consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E
2500|$|They {{brought him}} to the Parwah cell, spread a sheet of linen between him and the people, he <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> hands and feet, and undressed. (Rabbi Meir said that he undressed first and then <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> hands and feet.) Then he went down and {{immersed}} himself for the second time, came up and dried himself. They brought him white garments (as required by [...] ). He put them on and <b>washed</b> <b>his</b> hands and feet. Rabbi Meir taught that in the morning, he wore Pelusium linen worth 12 minas, and in the afternoon he wore Indian linen worth 800 zuz. But the sages said that in the morning, he wore garments worth 18 minas, and in the afternoon he wore garments worth 12 minas. The community paid for these sums, and the High Priest could spend more from his own funds if he wanted to.|$|E
