40|$|Salinity causes {{oxidative}} stress in plants by enhancing production of reactive oxygen species, so that an efficient antioxidant system, of which ascorbic acid (AsA) {{is a key}} component, is an essential requirement of tolerance. However, antioxidant responses of plants to salinity vary considerably among species. Limonium stocksii is a sub-tropical halophyte found in the coastal marshes from Gujarat (India) to Karachi (Pakistan) but little information exists on its salt resistance. In order to investigate the role of AsA in tolerance, 2 -month-old plants were treated with 0 (control), 300 (moderate) and 600 (high) mM NaCl for 30 days with or without exogenous application of AsA (20 mM) or distilled <b>water.</b> <b>Shoot</b> growth of unsprayed plants at moderate salinity {{was similar to that}} of controls while at high salinity growth was inhibited substantially. Sap osmolality, AsA concentrations and activities of AsA-dependant antioxidant enzymes increased with increasing salinity. Water spray resulted in some improvement in growth, indicating that the growth promotion by exogenous treatments could partly be attributed to water. However, exogenous application of AsA on plants grown under saline conditions improved growth and AsA dependent antioxidant enzymes more than the water control treatment. Our data show that AsA-dependent antioxidant enzymes {{play an important role in}} salinity tolerance of L. stocksii.

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment with}} two amounts of Zn (0 and 1. 5 mg Zn kg as ZnSO 4 fertilizer), five salinity levels and three replications was conducted. Five irrigation water with salinity levels of 0, 60, 120 and 180 mM NaCl, and 120 mM NaNO 3 were applied. These salts levels were typical of {{those found in}} irrigation waters in wheat fields of central Iran. Wheat was seeded in pots and after 45 days, shoot was harvested. Trace metal concentrations were determined in the shoot by AAS. After plant harvest, soil solution was extracted form the soil. Electrical conductivity, pH, and concentration of anions and cations were determined. Activities of metal species in solution were predicted using the computer program MINTEQA 2. Salinizing with NaCl resulted in higher concentrations of Cd in the saturation extract. By increasing of NaCl levels in irrigation <b>water,</b> <b>shoot</b> dry matter decreased, especially in no ZnSO 4 treatment. Application of Zn-fertilizer had {{a positive effect on}} salt-tolerance of plant and increased dry matter of shoot. Treating the soil with NaCl altered the distribution of Cd species (Cd, CdCl, etc.) in the soil solution and increased total concentration of Cd T. Shoot Cd concentrations were positively related to total Cd T concentration and waterextractable Cl. By application of Zn fertilizer, shoot Cd concentrations decreased significantly. AsCl is known to mobilize soil Cd, elevated Cd concentrations in the wheat appear to be largely a result of the use of saline irrigation waters and high application of P-fertilizers.

Although {{yield and}} total biomass {{produced}} by annual legumes remain major objectives for breeders, environment-friendly, resource use efficient including symbiotic performance, resilient {{production in the}} context of climate change, adaptation to sustainable cropping systems (reducing leaching and glasshouse gas emissions), adaptation to diverse uses (seeds for feeds foods, non-food, forage or green manures), and finally new ecological services such as pollinator protection, imply the development of innovative genotypes, definition of new ideotypes and acceptance of their commercialisation. Taken as a whole, this means more complex and integrated objectives for breeders. Several illustrations will be given of breeding such complex traits for different annual legume species. Genetic diversity for root development and for ability to establish efficient symbioses with rhizobia and mycorrhiza can contribute to better resource management (N, P, <b>water).</b> <b>Shoot</b> architectures and phenologies can contribute to yield and biotic protection (weeds, disease, parasitic insects). Long winter cycles or short cycles, tolerance to biotic or abiotic stresses, are key features for the introduction of annual legumes in low input cropping systems. Adaptation to intercropping requires adapted genotypes. Improved health and nutritional value for humans are key objectives for developing new markets. Modifying product composition often requires the development of specific varieties and sometimes the need to break negative genetic correlations with yield.

40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} of dissolved oxygen (DO), organic and inorganic carbon (DOC, DIC), nitrogen (DON, DIN), and phosphorus (DOP, DIP) flux across the sediment–water interface was assessed in fish farm impacted and pristine seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) meadows in the Aegean Sea (Greece). DIC consumption decreased by 52 % and DO production decreased by 60 % in the light, suggesting reduced photosynthetic {{performance of the}} plant community under the fish cages probably due to organic matter loading. In light there was 4 and 15 times higher release of dissolved inorganic and organic matter, respectively, compared to dark incubations under the cages, indicating that fish farming impact is more intense during daytime. DO was taken up, while DIC was released in the dark in both stations, representing a direct measure of mineralization. Dissolved inorganic matter flux (as the sum of DIN and DIP fluxes) {{was positively related to}} DIC flux, rendering mineralization as the main driver of nutrient flux under the cages. On average, the impacted meadow released DIN and DIP both in light and dark, while efflux of dissolved organic matter (as the sum of DOC, DON, and DOP fluxes) increased by 132 % in the light and by 21 % in the dark, implying that the degrading seagrass meadow is a source of dissolved matter to the surrounding <b>water.</b> <b>Shoot</b> density and leaf production were negatively correlated with both diel DIN and DIP fluxes, showing that meadow regression is accompanied by DIN and DIP release from the sediment. Hence, nutrient efflux can adequately illustrate meadow deterioration and, therefore, can be used as indicator of P. oceanica community health.

40|$|Greenhouse {{studies were}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of three calcareous soils on the foliar growth and elemental composition of a vinifera variety, three common roostocks, and the variety grafted to the three roostocks. Soils, <b>water,</b> <b>shoot</b> growth, tissue analyses, and cation uptake were evaluated in grapevines on which grape variety rootstocks and grafted materials were established on Mohall, Sonoita, and Casa Grande soil series in PVC columns collected from three agricultural areas in Arizona. Grapevines have a root system that explores the subsoil as well the surface of the soil; however, in calcareous soils with high pH and high lime content, some micronutrient are relatively insoluble, also calcium tends to be precipitated forming calcium carbonate and becomes water insoluble; therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the roostock effect in the nutritional uptake. Good compatibility was observed between rootstocks and scions, also all grafted vines grew very well and no chlorosis or foliar elemental deficiencies were obserbed during the experiments. In this study, roostocks showed bigger shoot growth in grapevines than the rest of the treatments. Grafted grapevines contained higher foliar potassium than the rest of the treatments. Also all material evaluated had calcium and iron deficiencies with content less than 1. 2 percent and 70 mg kg- 1, respectively, and no one had more than 0. 5 percent of sodium content, foliar grape content reported by California that can be a problem. Cabernet savignon had the highest magnesium content in the three soils. Cation balance was used to measure the cation uptake for the evaluated materials; consequently, grafted plants had higher cation uptake than nongrafted plants. In this evaluation, Cabernet savignon grafted to 41 B had the highest cation content in comparision with every treatment; therefore, it was the highest in potassium, calcium, magnesium, and iron content. No one treatment had a deficient level of manganese; although, the studied soils were basic with high pH. In relationship with copper uptake, Dogridge had the highest copper uptake in the three evaluated soils...|$|E

40|$|Premise of the Study: Plant water status during {{flowering}} {{is important}} for plant reproduction, but the physiology of floral water use is not well understood. We investigated plant water status in relation to leaf and floral physiology in naturally occurring individuals of a semiarid shrub, Salvia mellifera E. Greene. Methods: We measured stomatal (g s) and corolla (g c) conductance to water vapor, transpiration from leaves (E leaf) and corollas (E corolla), leaf-specific hydraulic conductance (K H), bulk <b>shoot</b> <b>water</b> potential (Ψ <b>shoot),</b> and <b>shoot</b> <b>water</b> content on irrigated and control plants to analyze whether water was limiting to leaf and floral water use. Key Results: Experimental irrigation caused a 203 % increase in soil moisture content, a 20 % increase in predawn Ψ shoot, a 29 % increase in midday Ψ shoot, and a 92 % increase in K H. Floral and leaf gas exchange did not respond significantly to water addition, indicating that rates were at seasonal maxima and not limited by water availability. Total daily water use by corollas was ~ 20 % of total <b>shoot</b> <b>water</b> use. There {{were no significant differences}} in total daily <b>shoot</b> <b>water</b> use with <b>water</b> addition. Mean <b>shoot</b> <b>water</b> content (5. 07 g) was close to mean daily <b>shoot</b> <b>water</b> use (6. 71 g), indicating that the equivalent of total <b>shoot</b> <b>water</b> content turned over every 0. 76 d. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that although irrigation improved whole-plant hydraulic conductance, gas exchange was not limited by water availability. Additionally, the high water use of flowers in this species might limit future flowering and reproductive success during dry years. © 2011 Botanical Society of America...|$|R
