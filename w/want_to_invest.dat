The Burmese delegation formally acknowledged Mongol suzerainty of their kingdom, and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country. (Indeed, the tribute was no longer nominal.) In exchange, the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops. For the emperor, the Burma campaign was the only bright spot; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly. He did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> more troops pacify {{the rest of the}} kingdom. He preferred a vassal ruler. The Burmese embassy arrived back at Hlegya in May 1287, and reported the terms to the king.|$|E

25|$|Since R. revolutionalis queens mate singly, {{there is}} a high level of {{relatedness}} within the colony, and the workers are more likely to favor the sons produced by workers rather than sons produced by the queen because the workers are more closely related to each other's sons.

500|$|In an {{analysis}} of the acquisition, the Los Angeles Times noted that if [...] "Yesterday" [...] were to earn $100,000 a year in royalties, the Lennon estate and McCartney would divide 50% of the income; $25,000 each. The publisher, Jackson, would receive the other 50%; $50,000. It was mentioned that [...] "Yesterday" [...] probably earns more than $100,000 a year. The publisher would also control the use of the song in films, commercials and stage productions. Jackson went on to use the Beatles' songs in numerous commercials, feeling that it would enable a new generation of fans to enjoy the music. McCartney, who had himself used the Buddy Holly song catalogue in commercials, felt saddened. Privately, Jackson was reported to have expressed exasperation at McCartney's attitude; he felt that the musician should have paid for the songs he had written. At the time, McCartney was one of the richest entertainers in the world, with a net worth of $560million and a royalty income of $41million. Jackson stated, [...] "If he didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> $47.5million in his own songs, then he shouldn't come crying to me now." ...|$|E
500|$|The debt {{taken on}} by the Glazers to finance the {{takeover}} was split between the club and the family; between £265million and £275million was secured against Manchester United's assets, putting the club into debt {{for the first time}} since James Gibson saved them in 1931. This loan was provided by three New York hedge funds: Citadel, Och-Ziff Capital Management and Perry Capital. The total amount was £660million, on which interest payments came to £62million a year. The club stated, [...] "The value of Manchester United has increased in the last year, which is why lenders <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in the club... This move represents good housekeeping and it ensures that Sir Alex Ferguson will be provided with sufficient funds to compete in the transfer market." [...] The Manchester United Supporters Trust responded, [...] "'The amount of money needed to be repaid overall is huge... The interest payment is one thing but what about the actual £660million? It is difficult to see how these sums can be reached without significant increases in ticket prices, which, as we always suspected, means the fans will effectively be paying for someone to borrow money to own their club." [...] Under the terms of the Glazers' refinancing, as they were unable to repay bondholders by 16 August 2010, the overall interest rate on the loans rose from 14.25% to 16.25%, resulting in annual payments of around £38million.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{residential}} segregation split communities {{between the}} black inner city and white suburbs. This phenomenon {{is due to}} white flight where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There {{are more than just}} geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally, the {{developers}} {{had intended to}} do a straight adaptation of the film. However, they quickly concluded that doing so presented two inherent problems; the original screenplay was so good, they felt it couldn't be replicated in a gaming environment, and because Montana dies at the end, they felt players would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in developing a character that they knew was doomed from the beginning. As such, they decided the game would tell an original story, set after the film. Jason Bone, combat designer on the game, explained [...] "We didn't want to rehash the movie because we feel that {{to make a good}} game, {{there needs to be a}} compelling storyline with good characters that drive you through it. There have been a lot of games that have been made based on movies, and when they follow the exact storyline of the movie, you lose a little bit of interest if you know where things are going. We felt that a fresh start would allow us to have the freedom to do new and interesting things to keep the player motivated and engaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|His next {{appointment}} was Third Sea Lord, the naval officer with overall responsibility for provision of ships and equipment. He {{presided over the}} development of torpedo boat destroyers armed with quick-firing small-calibre guns (called destroyers at Fisher's suggestion). A suggestion for the boats {{was brought to the}} Admiralty in 1892 by Alfred Yarrow of shipbuilders Thornycroft and Yarrow, who reported that he had obtained plans of new torpedo boats being built by the French, and he could build a faster boat to defend against them. Torpedo boats had become a major threat, as they were cheap but potentially able to sink the largest battleships, and France had built large numbers of them. The first destroyers were considered a success and more were ordered, but Fisher immediately ran into trouble by insisting that all shipbuilders, not just Yarrow's, should be invited to build boats to Yarrow's design. A similar (though opposite) difficulty with vested interests arose over the introduction of water tube boilers into navy ships, which held out the promise of improved fuel efficiency and greater speed. The first examples were used by Thornycroft and Yarrow in 1892, and then were trialled in the gunboat [...] However, an attempt to specify similar boilers for new cruisers in 1894 led to questions in the House of Commons, and opposition from shipbuilders who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> in the new technology. The matter continued for several years after Fisher moved on to a new posting, with a parliamentary enquiry rejecting the new boilers. Eventually the new design was adopted, but only after another eighteen ships had been built using the older design, with consequent poorer performance than necessary.|$|E
