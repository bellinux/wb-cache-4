5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> hear this, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E
5|$|Suriname-born Milton Kam, who {{had shot}} 10 feature films {{and more than}} 50 short films, {{was chosen as the}} {{director}} of photography. Since Domalpalli's experience was limited to short video films with a different aspect ratio, he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> look through the Super 16mm lens the day they commenced the shoot. However, Kam helped him to stay composed during the production.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> {{learn of}} the high {{attrition}} rate due to well-trained German snipers. It was common for British regiments to lose five men a day to snipers; he learned that one battalion lost eighteen in a single day. The German snipers could not be located, leaving them free to continue shooting from their place of concealment. He was also dismayed by the poor quality of marksmanship amongst the British troops.|$|E

5|$|Rotblat {{continued}} to have strong reservations {{about the use of}} science to develop such a devastating weapon. In 1985 he related that at a private dinner at the Chadwicks' house at Los Alamos in March 1944, he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> hear the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., say words to the effect that the real purpose in making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Historians, notably Barton Bernstein, have cast doubt on this story.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} in Saigon on 13 March President Thiệu was briefed on the {{military}} situation by Trưởng and the new III Corps commander, Lieutenant General Nguyễn Văn Toàn. Thiệu then laid out his plan for national consolidation. As Trưởng understood it, {{he was free to}} redeploy his forces to hold the Da Nang area. Trưởng <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> discover, however, that the Airborne Division was to be removed to III Corps (unknown to Trưởng at the time, the Marine Division was also already slated for redeployment with both units then forming a new national reserve).|$|E
5|$|In 1977, American {{director}} George Lucas had released Star Wars, {{a wildly}} successful science fiction film influenced by Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, among other works. Lucas, {{like many other}} New Hollywood directors, revered Kurosawa and considered him a role model, and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> discover that the Japanese filmmaker was unable to secure financing for any new work. The two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kurosawa considered most financially viable: Kagemusha, the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan. Lucas, enthralled by the screenplay and Kurosawa's illustrations, leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kurosawa just ten years earlier to produce Kagemusha, then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Coppola as co-producer.|$|E

5|$|In September 1883 he went as a boarder to Field House Preparatory School in Rottingdean on {{the south}} coast of England, forty miles from Wotton. He was {{generally}} happy there, although he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> encounter {{for the first time}} social snobbery and political conservatism which were rife among his fellow pupils. From there he moved on to the public school Charterhouse in January 1887. His academic and sporting achievements there were satisfactory, and the school encouraged his musical development. In 1888 he organised a concert in the school hall, which included a performance of his G major Piano Trio (now lost) with the composer as violinist.|$|E
5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> find itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E
5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was {{appointed}} as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> see the use of forced labour and population displacement {{carried out by the}} Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E

5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|Part I {{opens in}} 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum-bound {{book with a}} woodcut of a dragon in the center {{associated}} with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study carrel {{when he was a}} graduate student in the 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched Țepeș, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive.|$|E

5|$|Diane {{remained}} {{in love with}} Victor, and stole his frozen sperm to artificially inseminate herself. Unbeknownst to her, Ashley had also stolen Victor’s sperm to inseminate herself. Diane gave birth to Christian Victor Newman, but <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> discover the sperm she’d stolen was that of Jack. Ashley had received Victor’s actual sperm sample and gives birth to Abby Carlton, whom she decides to pass off as Brad’s child. Victor and Nikki later reunite, and in 2002, Maxwell Hollister (Sam Behrens) attempts to destroy Victor, using his estranged wife, revealed to be Lorie Brooks, in his plot. Originally, Max attempted to lead a hostile takeover of Julia Newman Martin's design firm, which Victor prevented. Now, Max used Lorie to keep Victor and Nikki apart, but Lorie could not follow through, and a ruined Max ends up leaving town. Months after, Victor and Nikki remarry {{in front of all}} of their loved ones. Ashley reveals that Abby is in fact Victor’s daughter as she was diagnosed with cancer, and he welcomes her with open arms. After rescuing Nikki from a carjacker, Victor is diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy. Victor and Nikki's marriage slowly strained as he was caught up in taking Jabot Cosmetics away from Jack, dealing with NVP Retreats, and Nikki's campaign for State Senator, which resulted in an affair with her campaign manager David Chow. Victor and Nikki eventually divorce after six years in 2008. Soon after, Hope dies and Victor’s estranged son, now known as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), comes to Genoa City and works at Newman Enterprises.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the turning}} points in Zev Aelony’s life {{occurred}} around {{the age of}} 18, when his family was invited to a Minneapolis picnic because of his father’s work with the refugees.
