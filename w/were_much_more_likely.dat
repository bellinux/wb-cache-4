25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, {{it was found that}} personal contact with individuals within a neighborhood is {{the most effective way to}} increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes that personal contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E
25|$|Japanese POWs were interrogated {{multiple}} times during their captivity. Most Japanese soldiers were interrogated by intelligence {{officers of the}} battalion or regiment which had captured them for information {{which could be used}} by these units. Following this they were rapidly moved to rear areas where they were interrogated by successive echelons of the Allied military. They were also questioned once they reached a POW camp in Australia, New Zealand, India or the United States. These interrogations were painful and stressful for the POWs. Similarly, Japanese sailors rescued from sunken ships by the US Navy were questioned at the Navy's interrogation centres in Brisbane, Honolulu and Noumea. Allied interrogators found that Japanese soldiers <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to provide useful intelligence than Imperial Japanese Navy personnel, possibly due to differences in the indoctrination provided to members of the services. Force was not used in interrogations at any level, though on one occasion headquarters personnel of the US 40th Infantry Division debated, but ultimately decided against, administering sodium penthanol to a senior non-commissioned officer.|$|E
25|$|Bedouin girls face {{additional}} {{obstacles to}} their education. Among {{the biggest problems}} {{is the nature of}} the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning that boys and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact that boys and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind this incredibly high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl’s father did not agree with her education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of coeducation. Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters.|$|E

25|$|Crudely {{described}} {{the purpose of}} the operation is to break the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve the connection between the patient’s thoughts and his emotions. It is to relieve mental tension, to take the sting out of experience and thus to favour improvement or to hasten recovery from mental disorder. Risks were listed as death due to cerebral haemorrhage or infection; epilepsy; and personality changes. A text book of the day went into more detail about personality changes, suggesting that they always occurred to greater or lesser extent and left the patient with diminished judgement, childish behaviour, carelessness, loss of ambition, and generally living at a lower level than previously. There was also the possibility of intellectual deterioration. Overall in the Board of Control survey six per cent of patients had died (half of them directly {{as a result of the}} operation); 36 per cent had left hospital and 58 per cent remained in hospital (often described as quieter or easier to nurse). Patients who were depressed and had not been ill for long <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have left hospital than those who had a schizophrenic illness and had been in hospital longer.|$|E
25|$|A wave of Polish {{immigrants}} {{came to the}} United States following World War II. They {{differed from}} the first wave in {{that they did not}} want to, and often could not, return to Poland. They assimilated rather quickly, learned English and moved into the American middle class with less of the discrimination faced by the first wave. This group of immigrants also had a strong Polish identity; Poland created a strong national and cultural identity during the 1920s and 1930s when it gained independence, and immigrants carried much of this cultural influx to the United States. Poles in the second wave <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to seek white-collar and professional positions, took pride in expressing Poland's cultural and historical successes, and did not submit to the low status American Poles had taken in previous generations. The background of these immigrants varied widely. Historically, 5 or 6 million Poles lived in territories annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II. Many were aristocrats, students, university graduates, and middle-class citizens who were systematically categorized by the Soviet police; Polish military officers were killed in Katyn, the civilians were deported to remote territories in Central Asia or Nazi concentration camps. During the War, Poles attempted to seek refuge in the United States, and some were allowed in. Following the War, many Poles escaped Soviet oppression by fleeing to sympathetic Western nations such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.|$|E

2500|$|The term hostile {{attribution}} bias first {{emerged in}} 1980 when researchers began noticing that some children, particularly aggressive and/or rejected children, tended to interpret social situations differently {{compared to other}} children. [...] For example, Nasby and colleagues presented photographs of people {{to a group of}} aggressive adolescent boys (aged 10–16) and observed that a subgroup of these youth exhibited a consistent tendency to attribute hostile intent to the photographs, even when the cues were ambiguous or benign. Similarly, Dodge and colleagues conducted a study on a sample of school-aged children between 3rd–5th grade and found that children who were rejected <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than other children to exhibit hostile attributions of intent to ambiguous social situations (e.g., when a behavior could have been either accidental or intentional). Furthermore, Dodge and colleagues found that children with high hostile attribution bias then went on to exhibit the most aggressive behaviors later on.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{showed a}} more {{profound}} interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival.

They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play. [...] Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports, there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing. [...] New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to enter these sports than the old established ones. [...] The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing. Many modern Olympic sports trace their roots back to Britain.|$|E
2500|$|The IRA {{claimed a}} total {{strength}} of 70,000, {{but only about}} 3,000 were actively engaged in fighting against the Crown. The IRA distrusted those Irishmen who had fought in the British Army during the First World War as potential informers, {{but there were a}} number of exceptions such as Emmet Dalton, Tom Barry and Martin Doyle. The IRA divided its members into three classes, namely [...] "unreliable", [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "active". The [...] "unreliable" [...] members were those who were nominally IRA members, but did not do very much for the struggle, [...] "reliable" [...] members played a supporting role in the war while occasionally fighting and the [...] "active" [...] men those who were engaged in full-time fighting. Of the IRA brigades only about one to two thirds were considered to be [...] "reliable" [...] while those considered [...] "active" [...] were even smaller. A disproportionate number of the [...] "active" [...] IRA men were teachers; medical students; shoe-makers and boot-makers; those engaged in building trades like painters, carpenters, bricklayers, etc.; draper's assistants; and creamery workers. The Canadian historian Peter Hart wrote [...] "...the guerrillas were disproportionately skilled, trained and urban". Farmers and fishermen tended to be underrepresented in the IRA. Those Irishmen engaged in white-collar trades or working as skilled labourers <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be involved in cultural nationalist groups like the Gaelic League than farmers or fishermen, and thus to have a stronger sense of Irish nationalism. Furthermore, the authority of the Crown tended to be stronger in towns and cities than in the countryside and as such those engaged in Irish nationalist activities in urban areas <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to come into conflict with the Crown, thus leading to a greater chance of radicalisation. Finally, the British tactic of blowing up the homes of IRA members had the effect of discouraging many farmers from joining the struggle as the destruction of the family farm could easily reduce a farmer and his family to destitution. Of the [...] "active" [...] IRA members, three-quarters were in their late teens or early 20s and only 5% of the [...] "active" [...] men were in the age range of 40 or older. The [...] "active" [...] members were overwhelmingly single men with only 4% being married or engaged in a relationship. The life of an [...] "active" [...] IRA man with its stress of living on the run and constantly being in hiding tended to attract single men who could adjust to this lifestyle far more easily than a man in a relationship. Furthermore, the IRA preferred to recruit single men as it was found that singles could devote themselves more wholeheartedly to the struggle.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{a gender}} gap in {{perceptions}} to the case. According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll of 1,010 respondents, {{about two-thirds of}} Americans (64 percent) believed Casey Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] or [...] "probably" [...] murdered her daughter; however, women <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were {{more than twice as}} likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men. On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him. Two men who drove overnight from West Virginia held signs that said, [...] "We love and support you Casey Anthony," [...] and [...] "Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. The jury has spoken. P.S. Our legal system still works!" [...] The gender gap has partly been explained by [...] "the maternal instinct". The idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood. For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s trial of Alice Crimmins, who was accused of murdering her two small children.|$|E
2500|$|These did {{not happen}} often, but they were very {{dangerous}} when they did, and generally resulted in severe casualties among the crew and passengers and {{the complete loss of}} the boat. [...] Steamboat boiler explosions had been a common problem on the Mississippi River system well before the steamboats began serious operations in the Pacific Northwest in the 1850s. [...] By 1852, the problem had gotten so bad that Congress enacted a law setting out detailed standards for inspection of steamboats and licensing of officers. [...] Considerable work was done in the 1840s and 1850s to understand what caused boiler explosions, and these came down to many causes, including general wear and tear, inadequate or poorly designed equipment, overworked boilers that were too small for the engines, general lack of engineering skill among boiler operators, and excessive demands for performance from the vessel's captain or management. [...] People noticed early on that most of boiler explosions occurred just as steamboats were leaving (or sometimes arriving at) a landing. [...] This was true in two-thirds of the boiler explosions up to 1852. [...] Steam pressure was supposed to be reduced during a landing, but this would {{make it more difficult to}} get off to a fast start, so too [...] often pressure was kept up even though the engines weren't running to relieve the pressure by use of the steam generated by the boiler. [...] Under these circumstances, boiler explosions <b>were</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely.</b>|$|E
