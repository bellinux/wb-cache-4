500|$|After {{talking with}} Australian cricketer Shane Warne, Bolt {{suggested}} {{that if he were}} able to get time off he would be interested in playing in the cricket Big Bash League. Melbourne Stars chief executive Clint Cooper said there were free spots on his team should be available. Bolt stated that he enjoyed the Twenty20 version of the game, admiring the aggressive and constant nature of the batting. On his own ability, he said [...] "I don't know how good I am. I <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get a lot of practice in." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{also wrote}} in his {{autobiography}} that [...] "When I finished the Oral teachings of Manjushri , I {{had to leave the}} ranks of the Gelug. Today , having completed the Oral teachings of the Knowledge-holders, I <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from the Nyingma ranks as well!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wubi {{keyboard}} {{assumes a}} QWERTY-like layout, so users of keyboards implementing a nationalized or alternative layout (such as Dvorak or the French AZERTY) <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do some remapping {{to make the}} system sane. [...] Wubi does not position its components arbitrarily: there are far too many of them, and it is only with the introduction of a logical methodology that the system becomes easy to learn.|$|E

6000|$|... "Partly, {{though it}} refers to other matters. This Mr. Prince, whom you Americans call Aladdin, {{was a friend of}} Dr. West; they were {{associated}} in business, and he <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> access <b>to</b> his papers. The rest we must leave to you." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{for ever}} or forever: Traditional British English usage makes a {{distinction}} between for ever, meaning for eternity (or {{a very long time}} into the future), as in [...] "If you are waiting for income tax to be abolished you <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for ever"; and forever, meaning continually, always, as in [...] "They are forever arguing". In British usage today, however, forever prevails in the [...] "for eternity" [...] sense as well, in spite of several style guides maintaining the distinction. American writers usually use forever regardless of which sense they intend (although forever in the sense of [...] "continually" [...] is comparatively rare in American English, having been displaced by always).|$|E

60|$|Difficulties that lurk in an {{involved}} syntax {{the pupil}} may usually {{be expected to}} solve by study. But such a peculiar construction as that in Sonnet X 9 <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be explained to him.|$|E
60|$|Twenty {{years later}} in life, I <b>had</b> reason <b>to</b> {{remember}} this remark, {{as well as to}} reflect on the character of the man who had uttered it. I, or my successors, <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> occasion <b>to</b> advert to matters connected with this feeling, in the later passages of this record.|$|R
50|$|Each table may {{represent}} an implementation of either a logical object or a relationship joining {{one or more}} instances {{of one or more}} logical objects. Relationships between tables may then be stored as links connecting child tables with parents. Since complex logical relationships are themselves tables they <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> links <b>to</b> more than one parent.|$|R
40|$|The {{greatest}} {{difficulty in}} obtaining higher potentials in tubes {{is due to}} autoelectronic emission from the electrode surfaces. A study of emission from unconditioned metals is described leading to the result that either loose fine particles in a tube, or else the targets of emission <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> more <b>to</b> do with the quantity of emission than will the kind and "conditioning" of the cathode itself...|$|R

40|$|With {{less than}} a month to go to the European Parliament (EP) elections, {{campaign}}ing has barely begun in the Netherlands. Whether the campaign will address concrete EU policies or the future of the European Union remains to be seen, but this author argues that the outcomes <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> less <b>to</b> with the parties’ stance on Europe than with the unpopularity of the incumbent parties and the ‘second order’ character of EP elections...|$|R
50|$|Another model uses a specialized, local {{facility}} where the care receiver may {{stay for a}} few days or a few weeks. The advantage of this model is that the specialized facility <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> better access <b>to</b> emergency facilities and professional assistance if needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Milray, {{with his}} gentle smile, [...] "I think that's safe ground for you. Mrs. Lander <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> time enough <b>to</b> change her will {{as well as}} her mind several times yet before she dies. The half-sister's {{children}} may get their rights yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So that, seriously, dearest Tess," [...] he continued, [...] "since you <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{leave at}} Christmas, {{it is in}} every way {{desirable}} and convenient that I should carry you off then as my property. Besides, if you were not the most uncalculating girl {{in the world you}} would know that we could not go on like this for ever." ...|$|E

The trains may be ingeniously contrived not to connect so as {{to force him to}} take some longer route politically favoured by one of the intervening states. He will be lucky if he gets to Warsaw in four days.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a pity," [...] Peter said; [...] "and {{since you}} mention it I don't mind frankly telling you--throwing myself on your mercy, as it were--that that's why I make such a point of a rare {{occasion}} like to-night. I've a weakness for the drama that, as you perhaps know, I've never concealed, and this impression <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> last me in some barren spot for many, many years." ...|$|E

As a concise explanation of the poet's life-work it must <b>have</b> great value <b>to</b> his readers and admirers. After the critics 'have ciphered and ciphered out long,' they <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> nothing better <b>to</b> say." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} attempts {{over the past}} 200 years {{to account for the}} diversion of the Fourth Crusade to Constantinople and its sack of the city in 1204. While nineteenth-century scholars dreamed up far-fetched conspiracy theories, their successors often put the whole thing down to a series of unforeseen accidents. The debate now seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> reached a stage where historians set the episode in a much wider context and consider a multitude of factors, though the element of chance <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> always <b>have</b> <b>to</b> feature...|$|R

6000|$|They {{watched their}} warder attentively when he next {{came into the}} cell, {{but this time he}} had no message for them. [...] "We must not be impatient," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "our friends have a good many {{arrangements}} to make, for they will have to provide for our getting away when we are once out; besides, they <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bribe other warders, {{and that kind of thing}} can't be done in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{appears that}} other men beside myself believe Niven {{actually}} did find gold up there, as two attempts to steal his diary seem to prove," [...] he reflected. [...] "Whoever {{goes up to}} look for it <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with Monsieur Victor Rideau as well as the Leopards; and a little delay in setting about the search may throw him off the scent. The first necessity is a reliable partner, and I can think of nobody better than Hyslop." ...|$|E

I had floated the Clermont in the face of opposition; people believed in me; I could have raised what money I required for any new undertaking. Now a good deal of my money and all of my prestige is gone; people have very little confidence in a man who has shown himself a failure. What's more, I may be a cripple. My leg <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be broken again." ...|$|E
40|$|Neopisosoma angustifrons (Benedict, 1901) and N. curacaoense (Schmitt, 1924) are described; {{for both}} species an {{extension}} of range is reported. N. neglectum spec. nov. from Colombia and the Lesser Antilles and N. orientale spec. nov. from Trinidad are described. The status of Neopisosoma as a distinct genus <b>probably</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be reconsidered...|$|R
60|$|The {{subject of}} {{instinct}} {{might have been}} worked into the previous chapters; but I have {{thought that it would}} be more convenient to treat the subject separately, especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hive-bee making its cells <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> occurred <b>to</b> many readers, as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory. I must premise, that I <b>have</b> nothing <b>to</b> do with the origin of the primary mental powers, any more than I have with that of life itself. We are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within the same class.|$|R

6000|$|Winston leaned, {{as it were}} wearily, {{against the}} wheel of the mower. [...] "I wonder if you could {{understand}} what my life has been. The crushing poverty that rendered every effort useless from the beginning, the wounds that come from using imperfect tools, and the numb hopelessness that follows repeated failure. They are tolerably hard to bear alone, but it is more difficult {{to make the best of}} them when the poorly-fed body is as worn out as the mind.

60|$|Judging by Pilate and St. Nicholas, {{there exists}} no rule for the {{construction}} of hermits; they seem made out of all kinds of material. But Pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was alive, whereas St. Nicholas <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go on climbing down sooty chimneys, Christmas eve, forever, and conferring kindness on other people's children, to make up for deserting his own. His bones are kept in a church in a village (Sachseln) which we visited, and are naturally held in great reverence. His portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region, but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness. During his hermit life, according to legend, he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month, but {{all the rest of the}} month he fasted.|$|E

And for this, {{as well as}} {{for many}} other reasons, the {{principal}} subjects of education, after history, ought to be natural science and mathematics; but with respect to these studies, your schools will require to be divided into three groups: one for children who <b>will</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live in cities, one for those who will live in the country, and one for those who will live at sea; the schools for these last, of course, being always placed on the coast. And for children whose life is to be in cities, the subjects of study should be, as far as their disposition will allow of it, mathematics and the arts; for children who are to live in the country, natural history of birds, insects, and plants, together with agriculture taught practically; and for children who are to be seamen, physical geography, astronomy, and the natural history of sea-fish and sea-birds.|$|E

They relocate, with help, to an Allied-discovered, unknown planet which they call Prism. They have four children and live a relatively quiet life, though they know that someday they <b>will</b> most <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> return <b>to</b> their warring civilizations.
