500|$|As it {{had done}} during the Olympics, Royal Mail honoured Britain's Paralympic gold medallists by {{painting}} a post box gold in each of their home towns (along with an additional post box outside the National Spinal Injuries Centre in Stoke Mandeville, in honour of {{its role in the}} Games' history), and featured them on commemorative stamps released throughout the Games. Royal Mail originally planned only to release a series of six stamps with group portraits of Britain's medallists; however, the decision was met with backlash from critics, who argued that the organization was discriminating against Paralympians by not granting them the same individual recognition as their Olympian counterparts. Olympic shadow minister Tessa Jowell was also critical of Royal Mail's plan, saying that the stamps were a symbolic aspect of Britain's celebration of the Olympics and that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if this important symbol was not offered to our Paralympian heroes as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{declared the}} gameplay was {{an improvement over}} the original. John Davison of GamePro wrote [...] "BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic." [...] VanOrd praised Mass Effect 2 for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked. He noted that the shooting is [...] "more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter". Similarly, GameSpys Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original Mass Effect [...] "walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] Mass Effect 2 has become a much more focused shooter experience". Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it. Despite the praise, some publications like GameCritics and RPGamer expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it [...] "stripped-down" [...] and with a [...] "dumbed-down feeling". Some reviewers also criticized the slow planet scanning. Game Revolution {{felt it was a}} [...] "chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole [...] "does more than enough {{to live up to its}} predecessor". Italian journalist Jaime d'Alessandro of la Repubblica defined Mass Effect 2 as [...] "dazzling" [...] and [...] "a great sci-fi fresco that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to miss." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame.</b> When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Buechner's {{decision}} {{to enter the}} seminary had come as a great surprise to those who knew him. Even George Buttrick, whose words had so inspired Buechner, observed that, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to lose a good novelist for a mediocre preacher." [...] Nevertheless, Buechner's ministry and writing have ever since served to enhance each other's message.|$|E
2500|$|The Dann shootings also {{fueled the}} debate about {{criteria}} for committing mentally ill people to mental health facilities against their will. Some favored the involuntary commitment {{of a person who}} is determined to be mentally ill and incapable of making informed decisions about treatment; civil libertarians like Benjamin Wolf (staff counsel for the ACLU of Illinois) opposed the idea saying, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if we cut back on the civil liberties of literally millions of mentally ill people because of the occasional bizarre incident." ...|$|E

2500|$|Car and Driver on the L-82 in December 1972, “…when {{it comes}} to making a choice, the L82 is the engine we prefer. Duntov and the other Corvette {{engineers}} gravitate toward the big blocks because they like the torque. And granted, the 454s will squirt through traffic with just a feather touch on the gas pedal. But, to us at least, the small block engine contributes to a fine sense of balance in the Corvette that is rare in any GT car, so rare that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> to exchange it for a few lb.-ft. of torque.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The album itself {{received}} generally positive reviews by the UK critics, Keith Cameron of the NME {{gave the}} record {{seven out of}} ten in his review. Cameron compared Suede to The Smiths; he wrote, [...] "'Suede' faces the same problems [...] and similarly fails to deliver on a few, admittedly trifling, levels". However, he concluded, [...] "This is the solid, quality, ring-of-confidence debut [...] dreamed the band would produce". Stuart Maconie of Q gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. In his review he drew comparisons to Bowie, Morrissey and Marr. In conclusion he said [...] "Bowie and the Smiths are obvious points of reference. From each, Suede have taken an alien sexual charisma, a peculiarly claustrophobic Englishness and brazenly good tunes. Moreover, rarely has a record from the indie sector come with such a burning sense of its own significance." [...] In Select, Steve Lamacq noted [...] "a feeling {{in the air that}} they haven't fully let themselves go yet", concluding: [...] "As debuts go this isn't exactly Suede in flames: but what a smouldering attempt." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent wrote that [...] "it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>shame</b> if the eagerness to get the backlash underway stopped their excellent album getting the respect it deserves." ...|$|E
