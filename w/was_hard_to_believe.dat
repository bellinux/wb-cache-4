500|$|Enola Gay stayed {{over the}} target area {{for two minutes}} and was ten miles away when the bomb detonated. Only Tibbets, Parsons, and Ferebee knew {{of the nature of}} the weapon; the others on the bomber were only told to expect a {{blinding}} flash and given black goggles. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> what we saw", Tibbets told reporters, while Parsons said [...] "the whole thing was tremendous and awe-inspiring ... the men aboard with me gasped 'My God'". He and Tibbets compared the shockwave to [...] "a close burst of ack-ack fire".|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green {{watched the}} episode for TrekNation in August 2007, and {{described}} {{it as one of}} her favourite episodes from the first season. She thought it laid the groundwork for later episodes in The Next Generation, , and [...] regarding the Klingon culture. However, she felt that the drama seemed artificial and that the writers forced a situation where Worf had to kill one of the Klingons as if [...] "justifying the brutality as necessary for the good of Starfleet". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] also thought that the drama with Worf deciding whether or not to join the Klingons was problematic. He thought it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the crew seemed to know Worf as little as they did {{at this point in the}} series, but praised it for being the starting point for all future Klingon-based stories in the franchise. He gave it a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|The game's only {{points were}} {{scored on a}} field goal in the second quarter. [...] After Michigan drove to the Vanderbilt seven-yard line, the Wolverines lost yardage on first and second down. [...] On third down, Jack Blott was called into the backfield from his normal {{position}} at center. [...] Blott kicked a field goal from the 15-yard line. [...] A wire service account of the game noted, [...] "Both played crafty football, the fumbling that tended to mar the game being more than offset by swift, dashing interception of passes while {{the work of the}} linesmen on both sides was at top form." [...] The Michigan Alumnus summarized the game thus: [...] "Never surely was a game more lacking in spectacular features and thrills. For {{a good part of the}} time it gave one the same sort of feeling which was so common during the Great War, when a gain of a few yards was a matter for rejoicing, and it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that even the most dashing attack could accomplish any lasting results." ...|$|E

500|$|Washington Post {{journalist}} Erik Wemple {{criticized the}} story's graphic {{details of the}} alleged crime and said that it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> due to the [...] "diabolical" [...] description. A number of commentators accused the magazine of setting rape victims [...] "back decades", while The Washington Post described the Rolling Stone story as a [...] "catastrophe for journalism". Natasha Vargas-Cooper, a columnist at The Intercept, said that Erdely's decision not to interview the accused fraternity members showed [...] "a horrendous, hidden bias ... the premise {{that none of these}} guys would tell the truth if asked", while a staff editorial in The Wall Street Journal charged that [...] "Ms. Erdely did not construct a story based on facts, but went looking for facts to fit her theory." [...] Lauren Kling of the Poynter Institute criticized Rolling Stone for [...] "blaming [...] source" [...] instead of taking ownership of their own errors. Anna Merlan, a writer for Jezebel, who had earlier called Reason columnist Robby Soave an [...] "idiot" [...] for expressing skepticism of the Rolling Stone story, declared: [...] "I was dead fucking wrong, and for that I sincerely apologize." [...] Merlan had also labeled journalist Richard Bradley's doubts about the article a [...] "giant ball of shit".|$|E
2500|$|... 48 {{artefacts}} {{of silver}} tableware were found, {{with a total}} weight of around [...] The items were found in what {{appears to have been}} a storage pit, at a depth of about [...] below the modern ground level. They had been carefully placed within a large pottery bowl, which had been placed in the ground and covered over with dirt, accounting for their mostly very good state of preservation. The find came as a complete surprise to the archaeologists, who were used to finding small non-precious objects but had not expected to make a major discovery. According to VrkiÄ‡, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it is silver, because they always find some small things, and when we find something half a meter long ... it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it was silver and it was ancient." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{newspaper}} in Indiana also praised Beban's performance:"George Beban, {{who has the}} difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece of character work that is truly marvelous. [...] This artist has developed mimicry to its highest form of expression. [...] His mobile countenance mirrored every emotion so perfectly, each varying mood was portrayed so truly, that it <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that this man was}} naught but a pantomimist. [...] The upward glance when the heart was bitten again by the fangs of emotion, the hysterical joy of the Latin nature when in high spirits, all these phrases were delineated by this artist in a way that moved and thrilled." ...|$|E

[...] The game featured few penalties, no injuries, and few substitutions. [...] Michigan made only three substitutions, and Vanderbilt not a one. Michigan completed 5 out of 16 passes for 90 yards. Vanderbilt completed just 1 of 5 for a 9-yard gain. A diagram of the game says this one pass was from Kuhn to Bomar.|$|E
2500|$|A {{newspaper}} in Fort Wayne, Indiana praised the film for its [...] "rare quality of charm and a warmth of appeal {{that is truly}} unique" [...] and concluded: [...] "Here is a story beautiful and exquisite in theme ...

[...] Another review in the same paper also commended the [...] "simple beauty of the story itself" [...] and also praised Beban's performance:"George Beban, who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece of character work that is truly marvelous.

2500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Castaneda's benefactor, a self-professed Yaqui, {{would fail}} to employ these native {{expressions}} throughout the apprenticeship.

60|$|Trenchard {{needed no}} further convincing; he looked {{accordingly}} dismayed.

60|$|Aynesworth had no {{alternative}} but to obey. Wingrave handed a chair to Lady Ruth. He was looking at her steadfastly. There were no signs of any sort of emotion in his face.
