This is despite the fact that its planning phase preceded the <b>World</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Dams,</b> which was formed in 1997 and presented its report in 2000.

25|$|Lower {{positive}} impacts {{are found}} in the tropical regions, as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of methane. This is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment, and forming methane, a greenhouse gas. According to the <b>World</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Dams</b> report, where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity (less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area) and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant.|$|E
40|$|The role {{of global}} {{networks}} is increasingly important in influencing state’s decision on grand project. Tactics and strategies are employed across borders {{to build up}} cases and arguments to influence state’s decision. Global actors such as the non-governmental organizations particularly environmentalist groups adopt strategies that bypass their state and search out for international allies to bring pressure on their state from outside. Sahabat Alam Sekitar (SAM) and other international allies {{who are members of}} <b>World</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Dam</b> (WCD) rally campaigns for the severe environmental and social structure effect <b>on</b> the Bakun <b>dam</b> project. Global networks presented their findings <b>on</b> eight large <b>dams</b> that have put pressure on the Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) and the Malaysian government to reconsider the big-dam project. Here the discussions on tactics and strategies by global networks are vital because a similar analysis can be applied in examining the impact of global networks on state’s decision. However, actions from global networks have to be consistent and continuous to convince state actors. Local networks have to find ways to redefine issues concerning environments and people who are affected as a way to maintain endorsement from international networks. If supports are not consistent and continuous, the impact of collective efforts from global networks is rather subtle or perhaps forgettable...|$|R

The story to be told here {{is that of the}} social impacts of the Senegal River Development Organisation (OMVS) {{programme}} that led to the construction of Manantali (and its sister dam Diama), and of the irrigation schemes it inspired. It is told in order to review the social impacts of Manantali and recognize the key equity issues they raise, in the hope of learning from the way those issues were handled in the case of this one African dam, something of how they might be resolved throughout Africa today.

25|$|Although many {{carbon offset}} {{projects}} tout their environmental co-benefits, some {{are accused of}} having negative secondary effects. Point Carbon has reported on an inconsistent approach with regard to some hydro-electric projects as carbon offsets; some countries in the EU are not allowing large projects into the EU ETS, because of their environmental impacts, {{even though they have}} been individually approved by the UNFCCC and <b>World</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Dams.</b> It is difficult to assess the exact results of carbon offsets given {{the fact that they are}} a relatively new form of carbon reduction, and it is possible that some carbon offset purchases are made in an attempt to increase positive business public relations rather than to help solve the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

2500|$|The Berg River Dam is a [...] high dam on the Berg River in South Africa. It is the {{centerpiece}} of the Berg Water Project (BWP) which is designed to capture the winter rainfall and store it for supply to Cape Town during the dry summer months. The project in turn forms {{an important part of the}} Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS), an intricate system of dams and bulk water infrastructure that provides water to more than 3 million people. At the inauguration of the dam in 2009, then President of South Africa Kgalema Motlanthe called the project [...] "a good example of how public infrastructure projects can be used to contribute meaningfully to poverty eradication and to foster social empowerment of the people." [...] The Berg River Dam was the first dam in South Africa to be designed and constructed, and is due to be operated, in accordance with the guidelines of the <b>World</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>on</b> <b>Dams.</b> It has been completed on time and within budget. The Berg River basin and the adjacent metropolitan area of Cape Town are of particular importance to the Western Cape region because, although the basin generates only about 3% of the country's water resources, it is home to about 8% of South Africa's population, and produces about 12% of GDP.|$|E
