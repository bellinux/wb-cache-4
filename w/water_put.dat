500|$|Along with ironclad ships, the new {{technologies}} of naval mines, which were known as torpedoes after the torpedo eel, and submarine warfare were introduced during the war by the Confederacy. During the Battle of Mobile Bay, mines were used to protect the harbor and sank the Union monitor [...] After Tecumseh sank, Admiral David G. Farragut famously said, [...] "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!". The forerunner of the modern submarine, , attacked [...] using a spar torpedo. The Union ship was barely damaged and the resulting geyser of <b>water</b> <b>put</b> out the fires in the submarine's boiler, rendering the submarine immobile. Another submarine, , was designed to dive and surface but ultimately did not work well and sank on five occasions during trials. In action against [...] the submarine successfully sank its target but was lost by the same explosion.|$|E

Aaron was then to lay {{his hands on the}} head of the live goat, confess over it the Israelites' sins, putting them on the head of the goat, and then through a {{designated}} man send it off to the wilderness to carry their sins to an inaccessible region. Then Aaron was to go into the Tabernacle, take off his linen vestments, bathe in <b>water,</b> <b>put</b> on his vestments, and then offer the burnt offerings.|$|E
2500|$|Bayajidda {{left his}} wife and child in Garun Gabas and {{continued}} on to the village of Gaya near Kano - which others believe to be Gaya in modern Niger -, where he had the local blacksmiths make him a knife. He then came to the town of Daura (located in modern day Katsina State), where he entered a house and asked an old woman for water. She informed him that a serpent named Sarki (sarki is the Hausa word for king) guarded the well and that the people were only allowed to draw water once a week. Bayajidda set out for the well and killed the serpent with the sword and beheaded it with the knife the blacksmiths had made for him, after which he drank the <b>water,</b> <b>put</b> the head in a bag, and returned to the old woman's house. (The well where this is said to have happened is nowadays a tourist attraction.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Variations on Serrell's {{plan would}} be floated over the years. [...] A pseudonymous [...] "Terra Firma" [...] brought up filling in the East River again in the Evening Post and Scientific American in 1904, and Thomas Alva Edison took it up in 1906. [...] Then Thomas Kennard Thompson, a bridge and railway engineer, {{proposed}} in 1913 {{to fill in the}} river from Hell Gate to the tip of Manhattan and, as Serrell had suggested, make a new canalized East River, only this time from Flushing Bay to Jamaica Bay. He would also expand Brooklyn into the Upper Harbor, put up a dam from Brooklyn to Staten Island, and make extensive landfill in the Lower Bay. [...] At around the same time, in the 1920s, Dr. John A. Harriss, New York City's chief traffic engineer, who had developed the first traffic signals in the city, also had plans for the river. [...] Harriss wanted to dam the East River at Hell Gate and the Williamsburg Bridge, then remove the <b>water,</b> <b>put</b> a roof over it on stilts, and build boulevards and pedestrian lanes on the roof along with [...] "majestic structures", with transportation services below. [...] The East River's course would, once again, be shifted to run through Queens, and this time Brooklyn as well, to channel it to the Harbor.|$|E

A mink ran, hopping and halting, along the shore at my feet, dodging in and out among roots and rocks. Cheokhes always runs that way. He knows how glistening black his coat is, how shining a mark he makes for owl and hawk against the sandy shore; and so he never runs more than five feet without dodging out of sight; and he always prefers the roots and rocks that are blackest to travel on.|$|E
