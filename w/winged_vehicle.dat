2500|$|Developed by the Advanced Projects Group, a June 1958 {{report by}} Avro's Engineering Department {{described}} a Space Threshold Vehicle intended to [...] "get a man into {{the threshold of}} space and recover him, flying back through the corridor", [...] where winged flight was possible between maximum altitude that could sustain lift from a <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle</b> and maximum tolerable structural temperature. [...] This {{was estimated to be}} an altitude of between 150,000 and 200,000 feet. The STV would be single-stage-to-orbit aircraft, similar to Lockheed's X-30 and the UK's HOTOL proposals of the 1980s, with capability for in-flight refueling, and an expected speed of 6,000mph (Mach 8.5+). Avro's computer capacities provided capability in developing theories and methods similar to modern 3-dimensional modeling of fluid dynamics. Avro envisioned a delta-shaped vehicle with downward winglets (similar to the TSR-2's), varying engine nacelle positions, titanium skin, and first flight of a research vehicle in 1962. [...] It should be noted that many engineers involved in this and similar Avro designs were later heavily involved in NASA Projects Mercury Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E
50|$|In April 2008, UP Aerospace {{was hired}} by the large US {{aerospace}} company Lockheed Martin to provide launch services at Spaceport America for a test rocket program. Lockheed Martin stated that they are trying to create a lower-cost-to-orbit cargo service, using a <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle</b> launched atop a land-based rocket. UP Aerospace and the New Mexico location were chosen to aid in testing prototype systems. UP Aerospace was chosen, particularly, because of their experience launching rockets at Spaceport America.|$|E
50|$|A {{wingless}} {{launch vehicle}} has lower aerodynamic forces affecting the vehicle, and attitude control can be active perhaps with some fins to aid stability. For a <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{the centre of}} lift moves during the atmospheric flight {{as well as the}} centre of mass; and the vehicle spends longer in the atmosphere as well. Historically, the X-33 and HOTOL spaceplanes were rear engined and had relatively heavy engines. This puts a heavy mass {{at the rear of the}} aircraft with wings that had to hold up the vehicle. As the wet mass reduces, the centre of mass tends to move rearward behind the centre of lift, which tends to be around the centre of the wings. This can cause severe instability that is usually solved by extra fins which add weight and decrease performance.|$|E
50|$|Engle is {{the only}} human being to have flown two {{different}} types of <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles</b> in space, the X-15 and the Space Shuttle. He {{is the only}} astronaut to have manually flown the Shuttle through reentry and landing.|$|R
40|$|Landing {{characteristics}} were investigated using dynamic models. The landing speeds for several let-down systems are simulated. Demonstrations include: (1) the vertical landing of parachute-supported capsules on water; (2) reduction of landing acceleration by shaping the impact surface for water entry; (3) problems created by horizontal velocity due to wind; (4) {{the use of}} energy absorbers (yielding metal legs or torus bags) for land or water landings; (5) problems associated with horizontal land landings; (6) {{the use of a}} paraglider to aid in vehicle direction control; (7) a curved undersurface to serve as a skid-rocker to convert sinking-speed energy into angular energy; (8) horizontal-type landing obtained with <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles</b> on a hard runway; (9) the dangers of high-speed water landings; and (10) the positive effects of parachute support for landing <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R
50|$|LACE was {{studied to}} some extent in the USA during the late 1950s and early 1960s, and by late 1960 Marquardt had a testbed system running. However, as NASA moved to {{ballistic}} capsules during Project Mercury, funding for research into <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles</b> slowly disappeared, and LACE work along with it.|$|R
50|$|On a side note, Dick Brooks {{would be}} the final driver to make a {{competitive}} run with a <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Following the 1970 season, special, limited production 'aero' cars such as the Dodge Daytona and Plymouth Superbird, {{as well as the}} Ford Torino Talladega and Mercury Spoiler II, were restricted to a 305 ci engine. Brooks' Mario Rossi team was the only team to run a winged car in the race, and although they had a 7th-place run in the race, elected to run a conventional big-block powered car the rest of the season, thus ending the 'aero warrior' era in NASCAR. Rear wings would not appear again in NASCAR until 2008 with the 'Car of Tomorrow', but due to unpopularity with fans and teams alike, the wings eventually were replaced with rear spoilers again {{in the middle of the}} 2010 NASCAR season.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, the British {{started a}} space program based around the Blue Streak missile, which was, at some point, {{to include a}} manned vehicle. Armstrong-Whitworth were {{contracted}} to develop the re-entry vehicle, and unlike the U.S. space program they decided to stick with a <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle</b> instead of a ballistic capsule. Between 1957 and 1959, they contracted Nonweiler to develop his concepts further. This work produced a pyramid-shaped design with a flat underside and short wings. Heat was conducted through the wings to the upper cool surfaces, where it was dumped into the turbulent air {{on the top of}} the wing. In 1960, work on the Blue Streak was canceled as the missile was seen as being obsolete before it could have entered service. Work then moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), where it continued as a research program into high-speed (Mach 4 to 7) civilian airliners.|$|E
5000|$|The CEV {{re-entry}} module would weigh about 12 tons [...] - [...] {{almost twice}} {{the mass of}} the Apollo Command Module [...] - [...] and, like Apollo, would be attached to a service module for life support and propulsion. The CEV will be an Apollo-like capsule, with a Viking-type heat shield, not a lifting body or <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle</b> like the current Shuttle. It would land on land rather than water, similar to the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, though it would be capable of a water recovery if an emergency splashdown were needed. Possible landing areas that have been identified include Edwards Air Force Base, California, Carson Flats (Carson Sink), Nevada, and the area around Moses Lake, Washington state. Landing on the west coast would allow the majority of the reentry path to be flown over the Pacific Ocean rather than populated areas. The CEV would have an ablative (Apollo-like) heat shield that would be discarded after each use, and the CEV itself could be reused about 10 times.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the start}} of Mars {{exploration}} with spacecraft, the density of Mars' atmosphere {{was believed to be}} higher than was later measured to be, leading engineers to believe that the difficulty of winged flight would be much easier than it actually is.

50|$|With {{most of the}} NASA centers backing one of the <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles,</b> {{and being}} {{dramatically}} different from any of them, SERV found no supporters within the bureaucracy and was never seriously considered for STS.

5000|$|We {{were flying}} on a <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{that would do}} reentry {{different}} than we had ever done before. So all of those were firsts. Test pilots truly love firsts. — Crippen's Shuttle experiences. After the MOL program was cancelled, Crippen became a NASA astronaut in September 1969. He served on the astronaut support crew for the Skylab 2, Skylab 3, and Skylab 4 missions, and for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission. He was the Pilot of the first orbital test flight of the Space Shuttle program (STS-1, April 12 - 14, 1981) and was the Commander of three additional Shuttle flights: STS-7, June 18 - 24, 1983; STS-41-C, April 6 - 13, 1984; and STS-41-G, October 6 - 13, 1984. In addition to participating in the first Shuttle flight, he also presided over the first five-person crew (STS-7, which included Sally Ride, the first American woman in space), the first satellite repair operation (STS-41-C, which repaired the Solar Maximum Mission satellite), and the first seven-person crew (STS-41-G). He was named Commander of the STS-62-A mission which would have launched from the new SLC-6 facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. That mission was cancelled after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster and SLC-6 was closed when the Air Force went back to launching satellites on the Titan III and Titan IV rockets.|$|E

50|$|The {{suborbital}} X-15 and {{a companion}} training aero-spacecraft, the NF-104 AST, both intended {{to travel to}} an altitude that rendered their aerodynamic control surfaces unusable, established a convention for locations for thrusters on <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles</b> not intended to dock in space; that is, those that only have attitude control thrusters.

The search for answers to many of the riddles of high-Mach flight had to be postponed until the arrival three years later of the most advanced of all the experimental rocket aircraft, the North American X-15.|$|R
50|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that designing separate orbiter and boosters, or a single vehicle that could do both, would compromise performance, safety, and possible cost savings. Compromising maximum performance to reduce cargo cost, however, is the point of the triamese approach. Stacking two or three <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles</b> can also be challenging. Optimistically, the lower mass ratios would translate to lower overall R&D costs, even if there were two different stage designs. While many aerospace designs have successfully been modified far beyond the original designer's intentions (Boeing's 747 is perhaps the best example) the slow and painful birth of the F-35 family demonstrates that it is not always a guarantee of such flexibility.|$|R

50|$|The {{use of a}} <b>winged</b> launch <b>vehicle</b> allows using lift {{rather than}} thrust to {{overcome}} gravity, which greatly reduces gravity losses.

40|$|The {{supersonic}} {{speeds of}} X-series aircraft and wind tunnel {{data in the}} early 1950 s demonstrated that hypersonic flight was an achievable goal. A blunt-nosed vehicle was found to form a bow shock that deflected much of the heating an aircraft would otherwise experience at high speeds. It was felt that critical aspects of hypersonic flight, e. g., aerodynamic performance and heating, controllability, etc., could not be fully explored in wind tunnels. The X- 15 project was initiated by NASA in 1954 to produce a vehicle capable of Mach 7 flight to altitudes that would permit short evaluations of human performance in microgravity. Design tradeoffs examined in the program are discussed, with emphasis on lifting bodies and <b>winged</b> <b>vehicles</b> with high L/D ratios. Political pressures created by the public triumph of the Sputnik in 1958 removed much of the impetus for development of a manned spaceplane, and long-term goals that {{eventually led to the}} Shuttle were delayed by a short-term program oriented toward ballistic manned capsules...|$|R

MATLABTM code was written to simulate a typical <b>winged</b> <b>vehicle</b> entry trajectory. The code was extended to simulate ejection trajectories for a ballistic capsule on a minute-by-minute basis throughout the original entry profile. The ejection trajectories, representing instantaneous change in vehicle aerodynamic properties, were studied for theoretical survivability and were analyzed to determine the optimum design characteristics for an escape vehicle.

Most maneuvers utilize a combined plane change and orbital transfer to the new orbit. This costs {{more in terms of}} energy and fuel than an in-plane change of orbits. The amount of DV and fuel required for such an energyintensive inclination change exceeds the benefit of performing the maneuver. However, this paper demonstrates that a <b>winged</b> re-entry <b>vehicle,</b> based on the currently proposed X- 37, has the necessary thrust to change planes and then perform an in-plane transfer to achieve a new orbit.

During the TAEM, the vehicle is brought to the correct interface position with the landing phase, on the extension of the centerline of the runway with the correct amount of energy and the correct heading. The most characteristic feature of the TAEM phase is the so-called Heading Alignment Cylinder (HAC). The vehicle performs a turn around the HAC to align with the runway. During actual re-entry flights, flight conditions at the beginning of the terminal area will not always be nominal and several variations in entry position, energy, heading angle and flight-path angle can occur.
