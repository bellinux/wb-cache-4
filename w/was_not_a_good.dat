5|$|Goldfaden left Romania in 1896; soon Juvilier's was {{the only}} active Yiddish theater troupe in the country, and foreign troupes had almost entirely ceased coming to the country. Although Lateiner, Horowitz, and Shumer kept writing, and {{occasionally}} managed {{to put on a}} play, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time for Yiddish theater – or any theater – in Romania, and would only become worse as the economy continued to decline.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, Douglas opened {{campaign}} headquarters in Los Angeles and San Francisco, which {{was seen as}} a signal that she was serious about contesting Downey's seat and would not withdraw from the race. Downey challenged Douglas to a series of debates; Douglas, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> debater, declined. The two candidates traded charges via press and radio, with Downey describing Douglas's views as extremist.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of World War I, B3, B4, and B5 were at Dover and were deployed on a line between Calais and the Goodwin Sands to protect {{the passage of the}} British Expeditionary Force to France. Each submarine would sail from Dover before dawn to be secured at the buoy marking their billet at dawn, the idea being that {{they would be able to}} slip from the buoy when they spotted an enemy ship and manoeuvre to attack. That this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> tactic was proved when B3 narrowly avoided a torpedo from a German U-boat on the morning of 2 October. Nonetheless the scheme was successful and the BEF crossed to France without loss.|$|E

Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{was traded}} to the Denver Broncos in February 1965, but the Bills {{continued}} to win, ending with a 10–3–1 record and winning the AFL championship {{for the second year in}} a row. In the 1965 AFL championship game against the Chargers, when offensive linemen Billy Shaw and Dave Behrman were injured, Saban inserted veteran Ernie Warlick opposite rookie Paul Costa in a double tight end formation, which helped the Bills win the game, 23–0. Saban was named coach of the year for the second time in a row, silencing critics who had said he was indecisive, did not use his players properly and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> play-caller.|$|E

5|$|Grace was {{seventh in}} the overall {{national}} batting averages and third among those batsmen who completed 10 innings. The two above him were John Selby (31.26) and Edward Lyttelton (29.96). In terms of runs scored, Grace {{was one of only}} two players to complete 1,000. The other was George Ulyett who made 1,270 at an average of 27.02. Due to generally damp conditions, 1878 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> season for batsmen with only 14 centuries being scored; only one player, A. J. Webbe, scored two.|$|E

The matched finished 2–2 after extra time and as so was decided in a penalty shoot-out; the first in Stockport's history. Stockport went on to lose 3–0 on penalties. The introduction of automatic promotion and relegation between the Football League and the Conference <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sign for Stockport, and in 1986–87 they had just six points from 13 games and faced a real prospect of non-League football, exemplified by being eliminated from the FA Cup by Caernarfon Town. Colin Murphy was brought in for his second spell as manager. Stockport gained 45 points from their final 31 games and survived, although Murphy left shortly {{after the end of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the field}} seasons of 1924 and 1925, Wheeler ran {{excavations}} of the Roman fort of Y Gaer near Brecon, a project aided {{by his wife}} and two archaeological students, Nowell Myres and Christopher Hawkes. During this project, he was visited by the prominent Egyptologist Sir Flinders Petrie and his wife Hilda Petrie; Wheeler greatly admired Petrie's emphasis on strong archaeological methodologies. Wheeler published the results of his excavation in The Roman Fort Near Brecon. He then began excavations at Isca Augusta, a Roman site in Caerleon, where he focused on revealing the Roman amphitheatre. Intent on attracting press attention to both raise public awareness of archaeology and attract new sources of funding, he contacted the press and organised a sponsorship of the excavation by the middle-market newspaper the Daily Mail. In doing so, he emphasised the folkloric and legendary associations that the site had with King Arthur. In 1925, Oxford University Press published Wheeler's first book for a general audience, Prehistoric and Roman Wales; he later expressed the opinion that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> book.|$|E

5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, rolling his eyes and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He {{thought of himself as}} an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E
5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E

5|$|Both Gray and Torrey {{were elected}} to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 1841. Gray never {{returned}} to teach a course at Michigan. In 1833 Dr.Joshua Fisher, a resident of Beverly, Massachusetts, and a Harvard University alumnus, bequeathed $20,000 to Harvard to endow a chair in natural history. The university allowed the proceeds to accumulate until it could fund a full year's salary for a professor. Because of this and a few problems in finding a suitable professor, this chair was not filled until it was formally offered to Gray on March26, 1842. The offer was $1,000/year salary, teaching duties limited to only botany, and being superintendent of Harvard's botanic garden. While the salary was low, the teaching limitation, rare for the time, allowed him {{plenty of time to}} do research and work in the botanic garden. After an exchange of letters, Gray accepted this appointment as Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard. The formal appointment was made April30, 1842. Gray arrived at Harvard on July22, 1842, and began his duties in September. He did not have to teach in the fall of 1842, but began in spring 1843, the first classes he had taught in nine years. Early in his years at Harvard, Gray had to borrow money from his father. Soon he was able to repay his father and help his family because he supplemented his income by giving lectures outside of Harvard, including at the Lowell Institute. Gray was considered a weak lecturer, but because of his expert knowledge, he was highly regarded by his peers. His skills were better suited to teaching advanced rather than introductory classes. He also gained renown for his textbooks and high quality illustrations. Gray moved into {{what became known as the}} Asa Gray House in the Botanic Garden in the summer of 1844. It had been built in 1810 for William Dandridge Peck and later occupied by Thomas Nuttall. As the demands of teaching, collecting, selling specimens, taking care of the herbarium, and writing books increased and he himself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> illustrator, Gray found it necessary to hire a botanical illustratorIsaac Sprague, who illustrated much of Gray's works for decades to come.|$|E
