40|$|Background and Problem: A {{consequence}} of the many accounting scandals was that congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in July 2002. This in order to restore {{public confidence in the}} stock market and increase confidence in the integrity of the entire system of public ownership and accountability in the U. S. The legislation establishes new and enhanced standards for all U. S. public company boards and management, and for the accounting profession. One of the Sections in the Act (Section 404) is Management assessment of internal controls. I found it of great interest to investigate what consequences American companies have identified after implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Purpose: <b>With</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> <b>my</b> purpose is to explain and analyze the consequences Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has had on American companies. By looking at earlier research on the subject and questioning people who {{have a great deal of}} experience and knowledge in the relevant area, this is to be accomplished. Delimitations: My focus is mainly on section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act- Management Assessment of Internal Controls. In addition, the legislation only affects companies that you can find on American exchanges and their subsidiaries, so this thesis will focus on a few of these companies in the U. S. Methodology: This thesis is based on scientific books and articles as well as survey’s that was send to people who have a lot of knowledge and experience on the subject. This thesis follows a hermeneutic approach and is both descriptive and explanatory. In addition, the qualitative method is most appropriate for this thesis. Analysis and Conclusion: Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has caused both positive and negative consequences. The costs of implementing Section 404 became so much higher than were initially predicted and various other problems have also been identified. But most important, nearly all people think that SOX has succeeded to reach its goal; to restore investor confidence and transparency in financial reporting. Suggestions for further research: My focus in this thesis has been from an American company’s perspective. Thus, it would be very interesting to investigate how auditors, on the other hand, have been affected by the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2006. The {{development}} of my thesis project started {{with an interest}} in the anatomical wax models of Museo della Specola in Florence, Italy, and a desire to recreate their specific qualities according to my own sensitivities and conceptions. The wax models of la Specola are products of late 18 th century Italian collecting culture, and exist as markers of many aspects of the Enlightenment. As I searched through various historical descriptions and theoretical analyses of these wax models, I found that I was most interested in them as sculptures, and as evidence of a relentless investigation into the human body. In my physical, emotional and aesthetic response to the waxes, I am convinced of their relevance and visual power today. What were the material and formal qualities of the waxes of La Specola which caused me to linger among them, and return again and again to their displays? As I read more about the history of wax effigy, I gained vocabulary to articulate some of their power. In order to understand the motivation for my artwork, it is necessary to consider the verisimilar capabilities of wax, and its role in Freud's concept of the 'uncanny'. Even a moderate investigation of such ideas reveals interesting connections between the medium of wax and our (western) conceptions of the body. The work was developed through three areas of understanding, which I will discuss throughout the body of this paper: 1) historical and theoretical research, 2) my art practice, and 3) the conceptual structure of analogy. A modest investigation into the history of medical imagery (particularly in polychrome wax), and the theoretical writings surrounding wax models such as those in the collection of La Specola, helped me to better understand my initial, intuitive attraction to these subjects and images. For example, the philosophies of Descartes figure prominently into the history of dissection and the study of anatomy. In concert <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>research,</b> <b>my</b> art practice was a methodology of practical experimentation into the forms and materials best suited to the conceptual and psychological {{development of}} the work. As the work took material form, I adopted the organization of an analogy-informed by the book" Visual Analogy: Consciousness and the Art of Connecting," by Barbara Maria Stafford [...] which is simply the way I am identifying my strategy of communication. Articulating the structure of analogy, is likening visual art to poetry, and admitting my reliance on metaphors and similes. Cartography and anatomy come from the same scientific paradigm of valuing the minute and detailed recording of the visible world: the equation of vision with knowledge. What happens when the act of anatomizing (reducing and dividing material, to arrive at a specific system) merges with the act of mapping (in this case a road map) ? My work took the form of an 'artistic dissection' process, which answers this question. The 'artistic dissection' required a "body," which I made from paper and beeswax embossed with a pattern designed according to a collage of road maps. When the "body" was fully formed, I proceeded to carve it up with an exacto-knife. While developing my description of process, I struggled with what to call this "body. " After much deliberation, the "body" has been termed "waxed paper" or some such variation until midway through the description. At a pivotal step in the process the "wax paper" becomes a "waxy skin. " Then only when the "body" is submitted to the process of 'artistic dissection,' does it acquire its final name, wax "carcass. " In my consideration of anatomy and mapping, I am interested in the tension (the overlap and the disparity), between what can be seen and known, and what is felt and known. Is the map absolute? The result of my process of 'artistic' dissection was a map of the body according to its invisible cities, a map of my body in a sense, as if those places contain the meanings of my many parts...|$|E

40|$|My {{career as}} a dental hygien-ist–scientist began in 1980 asking {{questions}} in un–funded pilot stud-ies. In 1986, I began collaborating with established researchers on an epidemiology study of the oral and general health effects of smokeless tobacco among professional base-ball players. After a while, they generously allowed me to conduct a qualitative pilot study of my own among some of their smokeless to-bacco users to learn about reasons for use and experiences with trying to quit. Based on this work, in 1990, I successfully submitted an applica-tion for a large–scale community– based smokeless tobacco cessation intervention that involved dentists and dental hygienists in its deliv-ery. <b>With</b> <b>this</b> funding, <b>my</b> <b>research</b> career was launched and <b>my</b> subse-quent <b>research</b> has built on this ini-tial work.

40|$|While these {{approaches}} {{have been quite}} successful in terms of performance, one of their major drawbacks is their lack of easy interpretability. It is my firm belief that machine learning approaches are a key towards solving some of the complex problems in text analysis and IR for the following reasons: (i) ML techniques are theoretically well grounded, making them easily interpretable, (ii) the theoretical framework of ML techniques acts as a guidance for future researchers to build extensions to existing models and (iii) the theoretical foundation also makes the models generalizable and portable across different tasks and domains. In line <b>with</b> <b>this</b> philosophy, <b>my</b> <b>research</b> has thus far been geared towards advancing the state-of-the-art technology in the above mentioned areas using theoretically well motivated, machine learning based approaches. While staying {{within the confines of}} this broad objective, I consciously made an effort not to limit myself to any particular school of thought and retained the flexibility to build models in diverse frameworks such as discriminative and generative, supervised and unsupervised approaches. In the initial phase of <b>my</b> <b>research</b> as {{a graduate student at the}} Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval, UMass, I was inspired by the elegant and simple Language Modeling (LM) framework for IR.

40|$|The {{completion}} of this dissertation {{was like a}} long mountain climb. The summit was always clear and in sight. There were however so many beautiful scenes on the journey to the top needing some time to observe and enjoy. In reaching the summit and looking back each vantage point is visible and astonishing in richness and beauty. It {{is not only the}} scenes and the changes in the landscape that can be admired, but also companions along the road. Some could share the joys and others the hardships and trying times, but ultimately each one made the experience so much more fulfilling. In this journey the fullness and wholeness of life contributed to the final step. As on most mountain tops, there is, however, often another higher, bigger summit just behind the one reached.

40|$|Masculinity, {{masculine}} work {{places and}} masculine grooming are all changing. Men {{of the twenty-first}} century are experiencing a deconstruction of traditional hegemonic masculinity (Connell, 1995), as the deindustrialisation of traditional male work places erode the need for men to present a work ethic based upon physical strength. 1 <b>With</b> <b>this</b> erosion of traditional work places, there are changes afoot relocating men, their masculinity and their exterior appearance away from the embedded practices of traditional hegemonic masculinity towards a new ‘performance of appearance’ within contemporary interactive service employment roles. These changes are not merely occurring from free will, but are mediated by marketing trends and the promotion of the masculine body as an objectified resource, through which men can remain visible and successful in contemporary work places. This movement, however, requires a means to facilitate the changes, with the masculine habitus posed as being the vehicle for actualisation. This thesis draws upon my lived and worked experiences as a Registered Nurse within the appearance medicine sector. I explore contemporary masculine beautification, and the potential paradoxical situation of {{the emergence of a new}} masculinity associated with a ‘performance of appearance’ within contemporary work places, but achieved through an adherence to practices associated with traditional hegemonic masculinity. Using a web content analysis approach, I explore masculine appearance medicine websites, the services they offer to men and the marketing trends implemented to engage men <b>with</b> <b>this</b> practice. <b>My</b> <b>research</b> produces findings that are both multi-faceted and interrelated. The key outcomes suggest that changes are occurring within the construct of masculinity and that men need to both become aware of, and engage with, their habitus as a facilitator for change. The findings also present the contradictory practice of masculine appearance medicine treatments being marketed through the constraints and comforts of traditional hegemonic practices. My findings suggest that although the construct of masculinity is porous, and a shift in practices is occurring, with a ‘performance of appearance’ emerging as a feature of a new work place masculinity, men still require the comforts provided by traditional hegemonic practices in order to facilitate this change...|$|R
40|$|Introduction For {{patients}} {{with a variety of}} end stage lung diseases, lung transplantation has become an effective therapy. Chronic allograft rejection occurs in over 50 % of patients 5 years post transplantation however. Although alloimmune-mediated injury directed against endothelial and epithelial structures were traditionally thought to be the major culprit, non-alloimmunologic inflammation after bile acid aspiration has been implicated in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung injury, after transplantation. Hypothesis Reflux with aspiration of bile acid is present in the lower airways of people with cystic fibrosis associated lung injury before and after transplantation. Bile acid challenge would cause cytoxicity and release of inflammatory mediators from patient derived primary epithelial cells (PBECs), before and after transplantation. Methods PBECs from lung transplantation patients, explanted CF patient cultures and a goblet cell line were used to perform proof of concept experiments. In these experiments the effect of individual primary and secondary bile acids, porcine pepsin, different patient derived gastric juices (whole or filtered and dialysed) samples and an artificial bile acid mixture were evaluated. Cell death, Interleukin 8 (IL- 8), Interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stumulating Factor (GMCSF) production were measured by Titer blue and multiplex ELISA. Results Epithelial cells can be cultured successfully from the bronchial brushings of lung transplant recipient, CF patient explanted lungs and a Goblet cell line. In work connected <b>with</b> <b>this</b> study <b>my</b> <b>research</b> group has demonstrated that the lungs of people with advanced CF lung disease removed at the time of transplantation contained significant levels of bile acids higher than expected based on normal serum levels. I therefore tested the effects of bile acids on PBECs from lung transplant and CF patients. Challengesof ≥ 10 mol/l was associated with significant cell death. Potentially physiological challenges with 1, 5 and 10 mol/l bile acids led to a significant release of pro-neutrophilic cytokines from lung transplant PBECs and CF PBECs. The goblet cell line HT- 29 MTX was resistant to bile acids. Conclusion Aspiration of bile acids in CF lungs before and after transplantation may cause cell damage and inflammation. This injury may benefit from medical and surgical treatments for reflux, which may benefit the lung allograft generally. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

My interest is to analyse how these organisations perceive domestic violence. This will be done by analysing the socio-cultural context and the discourses on domestic violence that are prevalent in the organisations working <b>with</b> <b>this</b> issue. <b>My</b> <b>research</b> questions are: Which discourses {{can be found in the}} definitions of domestic violence of the organisations? What are the similarities and the differences in the approaches? Which cooperation problems can occur due to the different approaches to domestic violence? Method: To start with, a literature review on the field was done. Later, interviews were conducted with the organisations of interest. Critical Discourse Analysis combined with a feministic perspective was the main tool used for the analysis. Main results: The discourses on domestic violence prevalent in the organisations working on domestic violence in Turkey were largely derived from an !international discourse" on domestic violence. This means that their discourse was in line with international standards and adapted to the Turkish context. However, the organisations were found to be rather elitist and progressive in their views and ways of working whereas the view of most of the population of Turkey, including the politicians, are rather traditional in their way of thinking and acting. The differences in approaches to domestic violence between the organisations seemed to be rather small. The only issue where a different approach could be found was that regarding the involvement of men in the organisations and in the activities of the organisations. Furthermore, there seemed to be a lack of communication and cooperation among the organisations thereby hindering their ability to network, form public opinion and collaborate on projects...|$|R

I learnt to be responsible, independent in my work, I opened up to people, and more importantly I learnt to listen to others. I developed a motivation and an enthusiasm for this specific area of process control. Its challenging aspect resides in its nature: it is adaptable to every process. It requires one to understand the process and then to adapt his knowledge to improve it. Therefore, it has definitely a big potential for the future in the industries. I would like to express my gratitude to the following people/organisations for their contribution towards <b>this</b> <b>research.</b> <b>My</b> supervisor M.
