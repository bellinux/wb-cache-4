40|$|Paper {{earmarked}} for provisional 'Special Edition ' of World Development. Almost everyone is exercised about the pervasive problem {{of corruption in}} much of the world, but while most people, including other social scientists, emphasize values and ethics in this context, economists usually take a different approach, emphasizing the need for appropriate incentives and punishments instead. 1 Of course, different people also mean different things by corruption. Most of the time economists use the notion of corruption as the 'use of public office for private gains ' and by and large in this paper I am going to keep to that meaning of the term. Obviously this is not the only kind of corruption; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> recent corporate scandals in the U. S. and Europe, they were often cases of abuse of private office for private gains, but the public sector was involved {{in the sense that it}} had been lax in the regulations that were supposed to restrain the activities of private actors.

40|$|I {{am going}} to speak tonight about the {{intersection}} of environmental justice and concepts of social wealth. I want to start by having you consider what you usually visualize <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> environment – likely what {{comes to mind is}} a picture of a beautiful place, pristine and protected. What comes to mind for me a place in Huntington Park, an inner ring suburb in Southern California, called la Montaña, or the mountain. This isn't a natural feature – rather, it is a pile of concrete rubble that was placed next to a neighborhood after the Northridge quake of 1994 when freeways in the area collapsed. The neighborhood residents struggled for about eight years to try to get that mountain cleaned up because it was causing respiratory and other problems. Eventually, their organizing efforts led to a change in the city council and forced a state agency to clean up their neighborhood. In my view, there is as much beauty in that group of people at La Montaña and their struggle for social justice as there is in the kind of pristine landscape that comes to mind when we generally think about the environment. We need to keep this in mind as we think through the relationship between environmental justice and social wealth; we nee...|$|E
