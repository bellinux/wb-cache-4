500|$|While Leng {{considers}} that, lyrically and musically, [...] "Something" [...] reflects [...] "doubt and {{striving to}} attain an uncertain goal", author Ian Inglis writes of the confident statements that Harrison makes throughout regarding his feelings for Boyd. Referring to {{lines in the}} song's verses, Inglis writes: [...] "there is a clear and mutual confidence in the reciprocal nature of their love; he muses that [...] 'attracts me like no other lover' and 'all I {{have to do is}} think of her,' but he is equally aware that she feels the same, that 'somewhere in her smile, she knows.'" [...] Similarly, when Harrison sings in the middle eight that [...] "You're asking me <b>will</b> <b>my</b> love grow / I don't know, I don't know", Inglis interprets the words as [...] "not an indication of uncertainty, but a wry reflection that his love is already so complete that it may simply be impossible for it to become any greater". Richie Unterberger of AllMusic describes [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "an unabashedly straightforward and sentimental love song" [...] written at a time [...] "when most of the Beatles' songs were dealing with non-romantic topics or presenting cryptic and allusive lyrics even when they were writing about love".|$|E
500|$|Moore {{described}} the recording process as challenging {{because she was}} provided with little visual aid, explaining, [...] "All I had to work off were a few sketches ... {{but it was also}} fun because it allows you to go into the depths of your imagination." [...] She also revealed that creating Rapunzel's voice was simply a process of [...] "let go". Moore was often required to re-record a single line a total of four times before the directors finally heard a version with which they were satisfied. After watching the completed film for the first time, Moore was disappointed with her own performance because she felt that her voice sounded [...] "shrill". According to composer Alan Menken, Moore's musical background made her [...] "a delight to work with". Moore found the practice of performing in character challenging in comparison to recording her own original music, explaining, [...] "I can't just be like Mandy and sing something the way that I want to necessarily, because you know, you sort of have to stick to certain guidelines." [...] She found recording [...] "When <b>Will</b> <b>My</b> Life Begin" [...] particularly difficult due to the speed at which she had to say certain words, and cites both Menken and discovering Rapunzel herself as a character with guiding her through the process.|$|E
500|$|The Earl {{had always}} {{attempted}} to promote on merit rather than patronage {{and had become}} increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. At his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the King. The King asked if the navy were a better institution now {{than it had been}} on St Vincent's entrance into it. St Vincent replied that it was not. He stated: [...] "Sire I have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the Navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the Navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of Members of Parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old Officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on." [...] He continued on [...] "I would rather promote the son of an old deserving Officer than of any noble in the land." [...] In a letter dated 18 October 1806 to Viscount Howick, then the First Lord. [...] "If you <b>will,</b> <b>my</b> good Lord, bring a bill into Parliament to disqualify any Officer under the rank of Rear-Admiral to sit in the House of Commons, the Navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he has done, in the presence of Flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than I possess to command your fleets." [...] Presumably St Vincent was referring to a particular member of Parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow <b>will</b> <b>my</b> character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} {{series of the}} British game show Cluedo, Baker was cast as Professor Plum, a [...] "man {{with a degree in}} suspicion". He was also cast in the 2004 series Strange, as a blind priest who possessed {{knowledge}} of the Devil. Previously, he had appeared as a guest on the quiz show Have I Got News For You and was subsequently described by presenter Angus Deayton as the funniest guest in the series' history. A particular highlight was when Baker gave an anecdotal account of how, while entering a recording studio in Wales, he was accosted {{by a member of the}} public who told Baker: [...] "I will never forgive you, nor <b>will</b> <b>my</b> wife, for what you did to our grammar schools." [...] Baker responded with: [...] "What are you talking about, you daft bugger?" [...] to which the stranger replied: [...] "I'm so sorry. For a moment I thought you were Shirley Williams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Music in {{the film}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Bill Graham from Collider.com praised them for their variations to the tempo and tone, memorable lyrics, and [...] "blending old with new," [...] However, he also stated that [...] "the film’s constant mixture of tones can feel a bit off-putting for some." [...] Roth Cornet from ScreenRant was positive towards them, saying that [...] "Alan Menken’s music is as catchy, uplifting and effecting as one would expect." [...] Scott of The New York Times positively reviewed the music, saying that it [...] "takes you back to a charmed world of swoony longing and sprightly mischief," [...] with a slick and efficient atmosphere and grace notes of self-conscious classicism. Corliss from Time was also positive to the songs, noting that though [...] "don't sound on first hearing like top-drawer Menken," [...] the songs still [...] "smoothly fill their functions." [...] He described the opener, [...] "When <b>Will</b> <b>My</b> Life Begin?," [...] as the [...] "heroine's 'I wanna' song," [...] a Disney tradition that stretches back to Snow White's [...] "Some Day My Prince Will Come." [...] "I See the Light" [...] was described as [...] "a generically tuneful love ballad, which {{is sure to be}} nominated for a Best Song Oscar." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{doctrine}} of the two seeds (the seed of the woman versus the seed of the serpent) explains the conflict of natures found within everyone. Good and evil cannot derive from one source; evil cannot come from God and is never simply the misapplication of things intended for good. This mixing of seeds first began when the sons of Seth took wives from the daughters of wicked men. So, even Abraham had both seeds within him. It is which seed comes to the top in a person which will determine his or her fate {{at the end of}} time with the judgment of the 'second death'. Hence the Lord loved Jacob and hated Esau before they had done either good or evil. Yet Esau gained great blessings along the way even if he will ultimately be cursed by the bad seed within. This form of inheritance means, generally, [...] "it is a great privilege to be a child of a good parent." [...] Or, as Tomkinson memorably puts it; bastard begets bastard. This is a parallel to the way there is generally a physical resemblance between child and parent and it explains Rebecca's anguish, [...] "if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth ... what good <b>will</b> <b>my</b> life do me?" [...] Yet the rule is not rigid and, ultimately, its workings are a mystery of God's will.|$|E
