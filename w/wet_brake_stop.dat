5000|$|Disc <b>brakes</b> offer better <b>stopping</b> {{performance}} {{as compared to}} drum brakes. They provide better resistance to [...] "brake fade" [...] caused by the overheating of brake components, and are also able to recover quickly from immersion (<b>wet</b> <b>brakes</b> are less effective). Unlike a drum brake, the disc brake has no self-servo effect—the braking force is always proportional to the pressure applied on the braking pedal lever. However many disc brake systems have servo assistance ("Brake Booster") to lessen the driver's pedal effort.|$|R

5000|$|Power off <b>brakes</b> <b>stop</b> or hold a load when {{electrical}} power is either accidentally lost or intentionally disconnected. In the past, {{some companies have}} referred to these as [...] "fail safe" [...] brakes. These brakes are typically used on or near an electric motor. Typical applications include robotics, holding brakes for Z axis ball screws and servo motor brakes. Brakes are available in multiple voltages and can have either standard backlash or zero backlash hubs. Multiple disks {{can also be used}} to increase brake torque, without increasing brake diameter. There are 2 main types of holding brakes. The first is spring applied brakes. The second is permanent magnet brakes.|$|R

Also, at the same time, with his right hand, he caught up the loose twine-end of a small bobbin. These various acts with both hands were performed simultaneously and swiftly. Then there would come a flash of his hands as he looped the weaver's knot and released the bobbin. There was nothing difficult about weaver's knots. He once boasted he could tie them in his sleep. And for that matter, he sometimes did, toiling centuries long in a single night at tying an endless succession of weaver's knots.|$|R
50|$|The Golconda Express {{passenger}} {{service from}} Guntur to Secunderabad {{was scheduled to}} stop at Warangal station in mid-morning, but the driver failed to halt the train.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{reported}} that the micro wavy surface formed by machining combined with laser heat treatment have higher static coefficient of friction compared with the surface finished by polishing or cutting. Therefore, this study was carried out to clarify the surface formation mechanism {{in order to control}} micro wavy height and the influence of lubricant viscosity on static frictional force. In practical use, high viscosity lubricant is used in <b>wet</b> <b>brake</b> to prevent oil leakage. At cutting after laser heat treatment, when the higher thrust force was, the higher micro wavy height was obtained. Thus, decreasing cutting speed or increasing feed rate, the obtained micro wavy height became higher. The static coefficient of friction of surface finished by polishing was decreasing with lubricant viscosity. This tendency was also seen at micro wavy surface. However, the static coefficient of friction of micro wavy surface was constantly higher than polished surface regardless of lubricant viscosity. © 2011 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R

50|$|Another {{difference}} between semi-trucks and cars {{is the way}} the clutch is set up. On an automobile, the clutch pedal is depressed full stroke to the floor for every gear shift, to ensure the gearbox is disengaged from the engine. On a semi-truck with constant mesh transmission (non synchronized), such as by the Eaton Roadranger series, not only is double clutching required, but a clutch brake is required as well. The clutch <b>brake</b> <b>stops</b> the rotation of the gears, and allows the truck to be put into gear without grinding when stationary. The clutch is pressed to the floor only to allow smooth engagement of low gears when starting from a full stop; when the truck is moving, the clutch pedal is pressed only far enough to break torque for gear changes.|$|R
