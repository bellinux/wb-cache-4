5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> might be described in terms of human physiology, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E

These prefixes were invented by the IUPAC, deriving them from the pre-existing names for several compounds that it was intended to preserve in the new system: [...] (via [...] <b>which</b> is <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> from the Greek word for wine), [...] (from [...] coined by Justus von Liebig in 1834), [...] (from [...] <b>which</b> is <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> from [...] and the Greek word for fat), and [...] (from [...] <b>which</b> is <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> from [...] <b>which</b> is <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> from the Latin word for butter).|$|R
