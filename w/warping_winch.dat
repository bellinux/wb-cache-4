50|$|Vickers mounted two Mk IX W guns on {{slightly}} different railway mountings, Mk I, from September 1915. They are both {{identified by the}} open-frame appearance, recoil buffers above the barrel and the bogies with frames between the wheels similar to locomotive bogies. One mounting has a distinctive diamond-shape from the side and has a <b>warping</b> <b>winch</b> on the front; the other's carriage has a more squared-off profile with no <b>warping</b> <b>winch</b> at the front. The weapons on the Mk I mountings were originally reserve guns for HMS Cornwallis.|$|E
25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} use outriggers, or booms, to tow the trawl. These outriggers {{are usually}} fastened to, {{or at the}} foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. <b>Warp</b> <b>winches</b> with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.|$|R
50|$|Beresford is {{credited}} with recommending the use of Grimsby trawlers for minesweeping operations following visits he made to various East Coast ports in 1907. Grimsby, with its impressive docklands and trawler fleet was seen as ideal, with Beresford arguing that the fishing fleet would be inactive during times of war as fishing grounds became war zones. It was also thought that trawlermen would be more skilled than naval ratings {{with regards to the}} handling of the sizeable <b>warps</b> and <b>winches</b> that would be required for minesweeping as they were already accustomed to using them with the working of the trawl. In World War I the boats provided the craft, the trawler fleet the crew, and the port a base for the Royal Naval Patrol Service.|$|R
5000|$|Mooring under a cliff to a buoy or by anchor, {{the ship}} would receive cargo down an apron chute or, later a wire chute. It usually took {{two days to}} load. All these ports were full of rocks both hidden and exposed. There were undertows and cross-rip {{currents}} and continual changing sandbars. The dog-hole operators obtained franchises to build and manage the chutes. When a ship entered a port, it moored to a buoy (often a log anchored to the bottom) and would be <b>warped</b> or <b>winched</b> into position for loading. A shipâ€™s boat, crewed by three seamen and the second mate, carried the eight inch mooring lines to the buoy. The gravity chutes were troughs allowing cargo to be sent down a cliff to a ship. Besides bagged goods, the chutes were used to load other cargo, such as live hogs.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Naval Patrol Service has {{its origins}} in the Great War when the threat of mine warfare was first {{realized}} by the British Admiralty. The pre-war Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, is credited with recommending the use of Grimsby trawlers for minesweeping operations following visits he made to various East Coast Ports in 1907. Grimsby, with its impressive docklands and trawler fleet was seen as ideal, with the Commander-in-Chief arguing that the fishing fleet would be inactive {{in times of war}} as fishing grounds became war zones. It was also thought that trawlermen would be more skilled than naval ratings with regards to the handling of the sizeable <b>warps</b> and <b>winches</b> that would be required for mine sweeping as they were already accustomed to using them with the working of the trawl. The Admiralty Minesweeping Division remained active throughout the remainder of World War I {{until the end of the}} war when the trawlers were returned to their owners to resume fishing operations and the division was disbanded.|$|R
