5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, what are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It {{would be hard to}} have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while {{he did not have the}} technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

The house is ancient and curious, though modernised by vile improvements of a modern roof and windows. The inhabited part has over the principal door the letters S.I.H.V.I.H. The first three indicate probably Sir John Hume, but what are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the rest? I will look at them more heedfully one day. There is a large room {{said to have been}} built for the reception of Queen Mary; if so, it has been much modernised. The date on the door is 1576, which would [not] bear out the tradition. The last two letters probably signify Lady Hume's name, but what are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of the V? Dr. Hume thinks it means Uxor, but why should that word be in Latin and the rest in Scotch? ...|$|E

We all know that men do this kind of thing, and women too, for the matter of that, under the influence of passion--and are often very sorry for it afterwards. But she didn't do this; she took you on your weak side, which she understood thoroughly--probably because it was her own weak side--and out-Heroded Herod, or, rather, out-mysticised the mystic, finishing up with some spiritual marriage, which, if it is anything at all, is impious.

60|$|We hear a {{good deal}} of jolly widows; and the slanderous raillery of the world tells much of {{conjugal}} disturbances as a cure for which women will look forward to a state of widowhood with not unwilling eyes. The raillery of the world is very slanderous. In our daily jests we attribute to each other vices of which neither we, nor our neighbours, nor our friends, nor even our enemies are ever guilty. It is our favourite parlance to talk of the family troubles of Mrs Green on our right, and to tell how Mrs Young on our left is strongly suspected of having raised her hand to her lord and master. What right have <b>we</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> these charges? What have we seen in our own personal walks through life to make us believe that women are devils?

6000|$|... [2] There is {{one little}} sketch certain [...] "English gentlemen" [...] of this class, which, though adopted in Currie's Narrative, {{and since then}} {{repeated}} in most others, we have all along felt an invincible disposition to regard as imaginary: [...] "On a rock that projected into the stream they saw a man employed in angling, of a singular appearance. He had a cap made of fox-skin on his head, a loose great-coat fixed round him by a belt, from which depended an enormous Highland broad-sword. It was Burns." [...] Now, we rather think, it was not Burns. For, {{to say nothing of}} the fox-skin cap, loose and quite Hibernian watch-coat with the belt, what are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of this [...] "enormous Highland broad-sword" [...] depending from him? More especially, as there is no word of parish constables on the outlook to see whether, as Dennis phrases it, he had an eye to his own midriff, or that of the public! Burns, of all men, had the least tendency to seek for distinction, either in his own eyes, or those of others, by such poor mummeries.|$|E
