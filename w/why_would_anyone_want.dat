40|$|B EFORE having driven {{many miles}} over the {{highways}} of east Texas, {{one is sure}} to pass the body of an odd looking animal, lying {{on the side of}} the highway. This victim of the speeding car is an armadillo, a quaint and reportedly archaic animal, but a newcomer to the United States, and one which is very likely someday to become one of the most common types of mammalian wild-life in the South. Some time ago one of the daily feature columns in a local Houston newspaper carried two articles on the armadillo. One of these was a scathing treatise on the evils of the little beast in the destruction of garden plants and in the damage to valuable shrubs. The other was an answer to the quely of some New England school boys who were seeking an armadiIlo, This column ended with a remark on this order: "'And <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> an armadillo?

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{want to address}} more {{directly}} and extensively than previous studies why Bob Dylan chose his stage name. There are three contexts which allow us to arrive at an answer: the first, {{for which there is}} a good deal of evidence; the second, more speculative; and the third, evaluative. The article puts forward the proposition that Bob Dylan’s choice of surname was motivated by the pervasive mythology and enviable cultural capital of Dylan Thomas in the years after his death in 1953. The first question to be addressed is <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> to adopt the name Dylan in the late 1950 s. Second, attention focuses on Robert Zimmerman in particular and asks why he, given the broader context of the Welshman’s cultural capital, decided to take Dylan Thomas’s Christian name as his surname. The third context is that of poetry and the influence Thomas had upon Bob Dylan’s work. I suggest that Robert Zimmerman’s choice was not because he was influenced by the poetry itself...|$|E

As a consultant in professional communication, I have been using TEX for all documents I have produced for my clients and for myself during the last ten years or so. Though it has turned out to be most successful, this approach is seen by most as a mere idiosyncrasy.

2500|$|Quinn’s {{argument}} against the obscenity charges was based upon claims that the prurient material in Ulysses was actually a deterrent rather than a pernicious influence. He made further arguments that one needed {{to be acquainted with}} the city of Dublin to truly understand the work and that the sporadic punctuation, and the perceived incomprehensibility of the novel, was due to Joyce’s poor eyesight. At one point in the trial Quinn confessed that [...] "I myself do not understand Ulysses—I think Joyce has carried his method too far,” whereupon one of the presiding judges replied, “Yes, {{it sounds to me like}} the ravings of a disordered mind—I can’t see <b>why</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>would</b> <b>want</b> to publish it".|$|R
40|$|<b>Why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> lower quality {{drinking}} water? The Safe Drinking Water Act allows an "affordability, variance technology, small system variance exemption" to {{the drinking}} water standards based on a supply side argument. It assumes small drinking water systems have significant diseconomies of scale in meeting the maximum contaminant levels. We can test this assumption by examining the cost of compliance technologies by system size developed by the Environmental Protection Agency to meet the mcl for arsenic. The data show that the least costly arsenic reduction technology to meet the current mcl of 10 parts per billion (ppb) is modify coagulation/filtration. This technology is also six to seven times more expensive to implement for very small systems (50 people or less) than for the small and medium size systems. At least for very small drinking water systems the arsenic case supports the assumption of diseconomies of small scale production. On the demand side, Albert Hirschman provides a theory {{that allows us to}} look at the tradeoff between the prices and the varieties of quality, e. g., mcl, for two types of consumers for a given quantity of drinking water. We describe the EPA affordability criterion. Then we analyze it in terms of changes in consumer surplus and economic rent from welfare theory. Finally we suggest an alternative criterion that we believe is more consistent with economic theory. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|E

40|$|In his Introduction to {{the history}} of science (1927 – 1948), George Sarton (1884 – 1956) {{reflected}} on his research habits and tools of trade over a long life as a bibliographer and historian. He made special mention of his books and as- sociated notes. This apparatus, as he called it, seemed “insignificant compared with the library, yet from my own point of view, it is the central thing, and the library but a gigantic annex to it”. 2 He was sure every scholar would appreciate this. My aim in this chapter is to examine Sarton’s claim in the light of some recent work in cognitive psychology and philosophy of mind, before discuss- ing early modern European ideas about the relationships between memory, note-taking, and external repositories of information and knowledge. In this way, I confront the obvious question about the notion of a ‘forgetting machine’ – namely, given the well-known weakness and fragility of natural memory, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>want</b> one of these? By looking at the role of notebooks we can think about practices that allow one to forget and later retrieve, or recollect, what has been forgotten – either by consulting a stable record, such as a book or document, or by recollection from natural memory triggered by an external prompt, such as an image or note.
