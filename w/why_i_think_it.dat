500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> works as the title." ...|$|E

6000|$|It may be here inquired by the reader, {{with much}} {{appearance}} of reason, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> necessary to devote a separate {{portion of the}} work to the showing of what is truthful in art. [...] "Cannot we," [...] say the public, [...] "see what nature is with our own eyes, and find out for ourselves what is like her?"

6000|$|First, {{you seem}} to make the {{distinction}} between dramatic and [...] novelistic art coincide with the distinction between romantic and [...] 18th century. This strikes me as doubtful, as at least to require [...] qualification. To my mind Hugo is far more dramatic in spirit than [...] Fielding, though his method involves (as you show exceedingly well) [...] a use of scenery and background which would hardly be admissible in [...] drama. I am not able--I fairly confess--to define the dramatic [...] element in Hugo or to say <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> absent from Fielding and [...] Richardson. Yet surely Hugo's own dramas are a sufficient proof that [...] a drama may be romantic {{as well as a}} novel: though, of course, the [...] pressure of the great moral forces, etc., must be indicated by [...] different means. The question is rather a curious one and too wide [...] to discuss in a letter. I merely suggest what {{seems to me to be}} an [...] obvious criticism on your argument.|$|E

6000|$|... "After {{things had}} gone on in this way for some time, a countryman, a laborer, who was hired to do farm-work upon the place, one evening {{observed}} that the little orphan Vanhome was more faint and pale even than usual, for he was always delicate, {{and that is one}} reason <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> possible that his death, of which I am now going to tell you, was but the result of his own weak constitution, and nothing else. The laborer slept that night at the farmhouse. Just before the time at which they usually retired to bed, this person, feeling sleepy with his day's toil, left the kitchen hearth and wended his way to rest. In going to his place of repose he had to pass a chamber--the very chamber where you, sir, are to sleep to-night--and there he heard the voice of the orphan child uttering half-suppress'd exclamations as if in pitiful entreaty. Upon stopping, he heard also the tones of the elder Vanhome, but they were harsh and bitter. The sound of blows followed. As each one fell it was accompanied by a groan or shriek, and so they continued for some time. Shock'd and indignant, the countryman would have burst open the door and interfered to prevent this brutal proceeding, but he bethought him that he might get himself into trouble, and perhaps find that he could do no good after all, and so he passed on to his room.|$|E
60|$|Sir John Joram {{began by}} holding, {{extended}} {{in his fingers}} towards the jury, the envelope which had undoubtedly been addressed by Caldigate to 'Mrs. Caldigate, Ahalala, Nobble,' and in which a certain letter had been stated to have been sent by him to her. 'The words written on that envelope,' said he, 'are to my mind the strongest evidence I have ever met of the folly to which a man may be reduced by the softness of feminine intercourse. I acknowledge, {{on the part of}} my client, that he wrote these words. I acknowledge that if a man could make a woman his wife by so describing her on a morsel of paper, this man would have made this woman his wife. I acknowledge so much, though I do not acknowledge, though I deny, that any letter was ever sent to this woman in the envelope which I hold in my hand. His own story is that he wrote those words at a moment of soft and foolish confidence, when they two together were talking of a future marriage,--a marriage which no doubt was contemplated, and which probably had been promised. Then he wrote the address, showing the woman the name which would be hers should they ever be married;--and she has craftily kept the document. That is his story. That is my story. Now I must show you <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> also should be your story. The woman,--I must describe her in this way lest I should do her an injustice by calling her Mrs. Smith, or do my client an injustice by calling her Mrs. Caldigate,--has told you that this envelope, with an enclosure which she produced, reached her at Nobble through the post from Sydney. To that statement I call upon you to give no credit. A letter so sent would, as you have been informed, bear two postmarks, those of Sydney and of Nobble. This envelope bears one only. But that is not all. I shall call before you two gentlemen experienced in affairs of the post-office, and they {{will tell you that the}} postmarks on this envelope, both that of the town, Sydney, and that by which the postage stamp is obliterated, are cleaner, finer, and better perceived than they would have been had it passed in ordinary course through the post-office. Letters in the post-office are hurried quickly through the operation of stamping, so that one passing over the other while the stamping ink is still moist, will to some extent blot and blur that with which it has come in contact. He will produce some dozens taken at random, and will show that with them all such has been the case. This blotting, this smudging, is very slight, but it exists; it is always there. He will tell you that this envelope has been stamped as one and alone,--by itself,--with peculiar care;--and I shall ask you to believe that the impression has been procured by fraud in the Sydney post-office. If that be so; if in such a case as this fraud be once discovered, then I say that the whole case will fall to the ground, and that I shall be justified in telling you that no word that you have heard from these four witnesses is worthy of belief.|$|E
