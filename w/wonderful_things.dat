Beholding these exceedingly <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> and this worship offered to Duryodhana by heavenly beings, the Pandavas headed by Lord Krishna became ashamed. Hearing the words of Devas and Siddhas that Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Duryodhana, and others were cheated to death, the Pandavas became afflicted with grief and wept in sorrow.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Nina {{returned}} to win Jack back, after becoming an actress in the Indian film industry and realising {{that she was}} alone. Goodrem told TV Week, [...] "she's been doing <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> in Bollywood and has been with her dad. But she was missing the love of life back in Australia, so she came back." [...] Nina's arrival coincided with Jack's decision to get his life back together following a car crash due to his partying. Jack was [...] "shocked" [...] and [...] "overwhelmed" [...] to see Nina. Goodrem explained that Nina reminded him of what he once had and that he still had feelings for her. She said that she believed Jack and Nina were soul mates and added: [...] "They {{have had a very}} rocky relationship, but I think they're even now." [...] As Jack and Nina talked things through, they [...] "fall back into each other's arms". Jack chose to leave Erinsborough to be with Nina.|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} pour in for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these <b>wonderful</b> <b>things,</b> which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Chuck Dixon’s Black Canary/Oracle: Birds of Prey (1996) {{led to the}} comic series Birds of Prey {{starring}} the two title characters. During Chuck Dixon's crossover series Nightwing: Hunt for Oracle, Barbara Gordon and Dinah Lance meet in person and establish a long-term friendship. They form {{the nucleus of the}} Birds of Prey organization. While Oracle serves as the basic head of operations, Black Canary becomes her full-time employee and field agent. In 2000, the first Batgirl monthly comic was launched with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Oracle appears as a supporting character throughout the series, acting as a mentor to the new Batgirl, alongside Batman. Gail Simone took over as writer of Birds of Prey with issue #56. In an interview, Simone explained her fondness for Barbara Gordon, stating: [...] "Kim Yale and John Ostrander picked up the character and made her into a brilliant master computer operator {{and one of the most}} fascinating characters in comics. From there, Chuck Dixon did <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> with her in his Birds of Prey run ... She’s fantastic because even just sitting in a chair in a dark room by herself, she’s tremendously compelling. The DCU without her would be a much less interesting place." [...] Simone integrates the Huntress into the comic, making her a central character in the series as Oracle's secondary field agent. In 2003, comic book authors Scott Beatty and Chuck Dixon revised Barbara Gordon’s origin with the miniseries [...] Gordon is a highly gifted child having graduated from high school early, but initially desires to join law enforcement as opposed to vigilantism in the previous origin myths.|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} it {{difficult}} to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. [...] Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. [...] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. [...] Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. [...] Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. [...] An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. [...] No formal audition was held in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro [...] "Jack" [...] Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar. [...] The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. [...] Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer. [...] The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in South Pacific. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. [...] Rodgers later wrote, [...] "what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. [...] This demonstrates one of the most <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> about theatre audiences. [...] People want to believe what they see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect. [...] Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza as a Frenchman , Yul Brynner as Siamese and they are prepared to meet you nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bishop lectured {{in higher}} {{education}} {{for a number of}} years starting in the 1970s when her inheritance began to run out. For a short time she taught at the University of Washington, before teaching at Harvard University for seven years. She often spent her summers in her summer house in the island community of North Haven, Maine. She taught at New York University, before finishing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She commented, [...] "I don’t think I believe in writing courses at all, It’s true, children sometimes write <b>wonderful</b> <b>things,</b> paint wonderful pictures, but I think they should be discouraged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roth {{left home}} in 1953, {{and began to}} {{collaborate}} with Marcel Wyss and Eugen Gomringer on the magazine Spirale, of which nine issues would be published (1953–64). Most of his work at this time was in the prevailing Concrete art idiom, exemplified by Max Bill. He {{took part in a}} number of local exhibitions, as well as writing poetry, making his first organic sculptures and experimenting with Op art. In 1954 he met the artist Daniel Spoerri whose friendship was to be recalled as [...] "one of the most <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> I ever experienced." [...] Spoerri would later set up Editions MAT, a publishing house for editioned books and sculptures, which would print some of Roth's early works.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Paul Wild {{took over}} from E.G. 'Taffy' Bowen {{as chief of}} CSIRO's Division of Radiophysics. For someone who joined a {{particular}} research team {{so that he could}} [...] "do his own thing", it may be surprising that he agreed to be appointed to this role. He explained his motivation: Well all my life, scientific life, people have given me lots of resources and lots of opportunities and I think it's a matter of duty; when the finger is pointed to you it's your duty to pay back some of those <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> that have been given.

2500|$|After the Iraq invasion, U.S. {{troops were}} {{criticized for not}} {{protecting}} the historical artifacts and treasures located at the National Museum of Iraq. When asked at the time why U.S. troops did not actively seek to stop the lawlessness, Rumsfeld replied, [...] "Stuff happens... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They're also free {{to live their lives}} and do <b>wonderful</b> <b>things.</b> And that's what's going to happen here." [...] He further commented that, [...] "The images you are seeing on television you are seeing over, and over, and over, and it's the same picture of some person walking out of some building with a vase, and you see it 20 times, and you think, [...] "My goodness, were there that many vases?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou [...] "(it) {{was really}} {{like a kind of}} little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of those <b>wonderful</b> <b>things</b> that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and I will get back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Shuyu Zhouzilu {{then adds}} the {{following}} to the story. The Minister of War, Xiang Zhong, (in office 1474–1477) {{had sent a}} clerk to retrieve the documents, but could not find them after several days of searching. Liu Daxia eventually confessed and justified his actions to Xiang Zhong by stating that [...] "the expeditions of Sanbao to the Western Ocean wasted tens of myriads of money and grain, and moreover the people who met their deaths [...] may be counted by the myriads. Although he returned with <b>wonderful</b> <b>things,</b> what benefit was it to the state? This was merely an action of bad government of which ministers should severely disapprove.
