25|$|The Rev.

Father Donor, of Shanagolden. This gentleman acted similarly towards the Gaelic League of Foynes, which proposed to hold its Feis on a Sunday, and to appease him the Feis was held on a week day, with the result that numbers of people were deprived from attending it. Although the Sunday fixture was abandoned to please him, neither Father Donor nor any of his curates attended the Feis.|$|E

500|$|In 1954 the AEC was {{considering}} rescinding Oppenheimer's security clearance on suspicion {{that he was}} a Communist. Smyth was still the only scientist on the commission. Despite his personal dislike of Oppenheimer and pressure from the commission's new chairman, Lewis Strauss, Smyth was the sole commissioner to vote against stripping Oppenheimer's clearance on June 29, 1954. Smyth resigned from the AEC on September 30 of that year out of frustration with Strauss. Eulogizing Oppenheimer in 1967, Smyth said of Oppenheimer's treatment, [...] "Such a wrong can never be righted; such a blot on our history never erased.... <b>We</b> <b>regret</b> that his great work for his country was repaid so shabbily".|$|E

[...] Loren Thompson, an analyst for the Lexington Institute, stated [...] "I do not believe that the story of VH-71 is over...

500|$|As {{early as}} 1845, Lowell had {{predicted}} {{the debate over}} slavery would lead to war and, as the Civil War {{broke out in the}} 1860s, Lowell used his role at the Review to praise Abraham Lincoln and his attempts to maintain the Union. Lowell lost three nephews during the war, including Charles Russell Lowell Jr., who became a Brigadier General and fell at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Lowell himself was generally a pacifist. Even so, he wrote, [...] "If the destruction of slavery is to be a consequence of the war, shall <b>we</b> <b>regret</b> it? If it be needful to the successful prosecution of the war, shall anyone oppose it?" [...] His interest in the Civil War inspired him to write a second series of The Biglow Papers, including one specifically dedicated to the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation called [...] "Sunthin' in the Pastoral Line" [...] in 1862.|$|E

500|$|The Indian {{television}} {{premiere of}} The Dirty Picture {{was set to}} be telecast on Sony Entertainment Television on 22 April 2012 at 12 noon and 8pm IST. The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court allowed the TV channel {{to go ahead with}} the scheduled telecast after the Central Board of Film Certification had cleared the film with 56 cuts, 36 of which were done by the producers, while other cuts were suggested by the Certification Board. It had to go through these cuts as the telecast of an adult-rated film during prime time in India is a violation of the Cable TV Network Rules, 1994 and the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. Following this process, Sony Entertainment Television promoted the scheduled telecast. However, on the scheduled day, the film was not telecast, with the channel putting up a message stating, [...] "For unavoidable reasons <b>we</b> <b>regret</b> to inform that The Dirty Picture will not be telecast today. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted." [...] The Information and Broadcast Ministry informed the TV channel that it can air the film only after prime time: post 11pm.|$|E
