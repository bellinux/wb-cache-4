25|$|Overfishing {{occurs when}} more fish are caught than the {{population}} can replace through natural reproduction. Gathering as many fish as possible {{may seem like}} a profitable practice, but overfishing has serious consequences. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans, but also the social and economic well-being of the coastal communities <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> fish for their way of life.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{implication}} {{that many of}} these impacts will be detrimental—especially for the three-quarters of the world's poor <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> agriculture systems. The report does, however, note that owing to the great diversity of coastal environments; regional and local differences in projected relative sea level and climate changes; and differences in the resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems, sectors, and countries, the impacts will be highly variable in time and space.|$|E

25|$|By August 1918 the US State Department had {{tightened}} wartime {{control at}} the border by limiting passport-carrying Mexican laborers to two entries per day and restricting nonworkers to one crossing per week. A Nogales newspaper reported that the new rules had “greatly curtailed traffic from the Mexican side of the international border, and there is universal weeping among retail merchants of Nogales, Arizona, who see ‘panicky’ times ahead, for those <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> citizens {{of the other side}} of the international line, to swell their daily receipts.” Although businesses in Nogales, Arizona, protested, the persons most affected were working-class nogalenses who depended on wages from their jobs in the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate as}} to what degree mustangs and cattle compete for forage is multifaceted. One group of opponents, {{primarily}} cattle and sheep ranchers and those <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the livestock industry, argue essentially that feral horses degrade rangeland and compete with private livestock for public land forage. The environmentalist community is split over {{the position of the}} mustang within the North American ecosystem. This debate centers on the potential classification of mustangs as either an introduced species such as cattle, or as a reintroduced native species due to the prehistoric presence of horses in North America, albeit with a gap of thousands of years between their extinction and reintroduction from European stock.|$|E
25|$|On January 9, 1994, the Green Line {{closed for}} the largest transit {{rehabilitation}} project in the city's history. The Green Line reopened on May 12, 1996, {{with much of the}} renewal work completed and {{with the exception of a}} few stations. Six stations were closed indefinitely following the rehabilitation project, which angered many commuters <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> the Green Line. In September 1997, after political pressure brought on by community leaders, the Jackson Park branch was shortened again from University to Cottage Grove after previous attempts by the City, CTA and other agencies to extend the route eastward to Dorchester, immediately west of the Illinois Central Railroad. This had seemed logical to the Dorchester Terminal, due to the fact that the Metra Electric District and South Shore Line both share a station along the IC ROW, at 63rd Street.|$|E

500|$|The {{main problem}} with {{implementing}} such a radical tax would be finding acceptance. [...] Although {{such a system}} might find acceptance within some nations, particularly those (1) {{with a history of}} neutrality, (2) without an active military (such as Costa Rica), or (3) with lower levels of military spending (such as Japan, which currently spends 1% of its GDP on defense), it would be unpopular among many consumers of arms. Nations in this latter category range from the United States, which spends 4% of its GDP on defense, to dictatorships <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> arms to keep themselves in power. Other likely opponents would be nations engaged in ongoing military conflicts, or others in a state of heightened military alert, such as Israel. Arms producers would also oppose it, because it would increase their costs and possibly reduce their consumer base.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of his term as leader of the Moderate Youth League, Reinfeldt supported the government of Prime Minister Bildt, but he gradually changed his views and became more critical of the party leadership. In 1993 he wrote the book [...] "Det sovande folket" [...] (The Sleeping Nation), in which he criticized the Swedish welfare state and argued for the introduction of a neoliberalist society. The book argues that the welfare state is a stillborn construction, as it systematically puts people in benefit dependency. It states that the people of Sweden can be divided into [...] "fools" [...] and [...] "sleepy-brains", out of which the former stands for those who work, and the latter for the slackened people <b>who</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> funds from the welfare state. A recurrent message in the book is that [...] "Swedes are mentally handicapped and indoctrinated to believe that politicians can create and ensure welfare".|$|E
