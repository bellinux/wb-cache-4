So it’s pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film."

500|$|Stunt {{coordinator}} Tanner Gill {{explained that}} the hotel in which the climactic fighting takes place was designed specifically with the fights in mind, saying [...] "The basic environment of the fight had to be constructed to be “stunt friendly.” The space was tailored. Each corner was rounded; surfaces were measured for height and size, then padded." [...] Elaborating on this, fight choreographer Matt Mullins stated, [...] "The main fight starts in a hallway, and then we move into a penthouse. Okay, we have a hallway and a penthouse—what can we do with that? Are we going to crash into some walls? Are we {{going to go into}} a kitchen? We see what we would get in terms of props, we take into consideration what the actors can do, move-wise—in our case, Ming-Na is exceptionally talented, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of different martial arts movement with her." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010 Sinclair told The Guardian {{newspaper}} {{that he was}} working on a new prototype electric vehicle, called the X-1, to be launched within a year.

2500|$|Thornography was {{released}} in October 2006. According to Dani Filth, the title [...] "represents mankind's obsession with sin and self... an addiction to self-punishment or something equally poisonous... a mania." [...] On {{the subject of the}} album's musical direction, Filth told Revolver magazine, [...] "I'm not saying it's 'experimental', but we're definitely testing the limits of what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do...</b> <b>A</b> lot of the songs are really rhythmical—thrashy, almost—but they're all also really catchy." [...] Metal Hammer |date=22 May 2006 |website=Metal Hammer |accessdate=2 September 2012}} A flurry of pre-release controversy saw Samuel Araya's original cover artwork scrapped and replaced in May 2006, although numerous CD booklets had already been printed with the original image. Thornography received a similar reception to Nymphetamine, garnering generally positive reviews, but raising a few eyebrows with the inclusion of a cover of Heaven 17's [...] "Temptation" [...] (featuring guest vocals from Dirty Harry), which {{was released}} as a digital single and accompanying video shortly before the album. Thornography entered the Billboard chart at No.66, having sold nearly 13,000 copies.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} mapping spaces between {{manifolds}} {{which can be}} viewed as Hilbert spaces by only considering maps of suitable Sobolev class. For example <b>we</b> <b>can</b> consider the space LM of all H1 maps from the unit circle S1 into a manifold M. This can be topologized via the compact open topology as a subspace of the space of all continuous mappings from the circle to M, i.e. the free loop space of M. The Sobolev kind mapping space LM described above is homotopy equivalent to the free loop space. This makes it suited to the study of algebraic topology of the free loop space, especially in the field of string topology. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>an</b> analogous Sobolev construction for the loop space, making it a codimension d Hilbert submanifold of LM, where d is the dimension of M.|$|R

6000|$|And {{though the}} New Republicans, in the {{existing}} lack of real guiding knowledge, will not dare to intervene in specific cases, there is another method of influencing parentage that men of good intent may well bear in mind. To attack a specific type is one thing, to attack a specific quality is another. It may be impossible to set aside selected persons from the population and say to them, [...] "You are cowardly, weak, silly, mischievous people, and if we tolerate you in this world it is on condition {{that you do not}} found families." [...] But it may be quite possible to bear in mind that the law and social arrangements may foster and protect the cowardly and the mean, may guard stupidity against the competition of enterprise, and may secure honour, power and authority {{in the hands of the}} silly and the base; and, by the guiding principle we have set before ourselves, to seek every conceivable alteration of such laws and such social arrangements is no more than the New Republican's duty. It may be impossible to select and intermarry the selected best of our race, but at any rate <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> thousand things to equalize the chances and make good and desirable qualities lead swiftly and clearly to ease and honourable increase.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> {{thing for}} the first time but once; it is but once for all that we can have a {{pleasure}} in its freshness. This is a law not on the whole, I think, to be regretted, for we sometimes learn to know things better by not enjoying them too much. It is certain, however, at the same time, that a visitor who has worked off the immediate ferment for this inexhaustibly interesting country has by no means entirely drained the cup. After thinking of Italy as historical and artistic it will do him no great harm to think of her for a while as panting both for a future and for a balance at the bank; aspirations supposedly much at variance with the Byronic, the Ruskinian, the artistic, poetic, aesthetic manner of considering our eternally attaching peninsula. He may grant--I don't say it is absolutely necessary--that its actual aspects and economics are ugly, prosaic, provokingly out of relation to the diary and the album; it is nevertheless true that, at the point things have come to, modern Italy in a manner imposes herself. I hadn't been many hours in the country before that truth assailed me; and I may add that, the first irritation past, I found myself able to accept it. For, if we think, nothing is more easy to understand than an honest ire {{on the part of the}} young Italy of to-day at being looked at by all the world as a kind of soluble pigment. Young Italy, preoccupied with its economical and political future, must be heartily tired of being admired for its eyelashes and its pose. In one of Thackeray's novels occurs a mention of a young artist who sent to the Royal Academy a picture representing [...] "A Contadino dancing with a Trasteverina at the door of a Locanda, to the music of a Pifferaro." [...] It is in this attitude and with these conventional accessories that the world has hitherto seen fit to represent young Italy, and one doesn't wonder that if the youth has any spirit he should at last begin to resent our insufferable aesthetic patronage. He has established a line of tram-cars in Rome, from the Porta del Popolo to the Ponte Molle, and it is on one of these democratic vehicles that I seem to see him taking his triumphant course down the vista of the future. I won't pretend to rejoice with him any more than I really do; I won't pretend, as the sentimental tourists say about it all, as if it were the setting of an intaglio or the border of a Roman scarf, to [...] "like" [...] it. Like it or not, as we may, it is evidently destined to be; I see a new Italy in the future which in many important respects will equal, if not surpass, the most enterprising sections of our native land. Perhaps by that time Chicago and San Francisco will have acquired a pose, and their sons and daughters will dance at the doors of locande.|$|E
