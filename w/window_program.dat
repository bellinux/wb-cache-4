50|$|In X, {{the server}} {{runs on the}} user's computer, while the clients may run on remote machines. This {{terminology}} reverses the common notion of client-server systems, where the client normally runs on the user's local computer and the server runs on the remote computer. This reversal often confuses new X users. The X Window terminology takes the perspective that the X <b>Window</b> <b>program</b> is at the centre of all activity, i.e. the X <b>Window</b> <b>program</b> accepts and responds to requests from applications, and from the user's mouse and keyboard input. Therefore, applications (on remote computers) are viewed as clients of the X Window server program.|$|E
50|$|The stability, success, and {{increasing}} {{demand for the}} Open <b>Window</b> <b>program</b> emphasized the {{need to build a}} permanent home. In 1998, the school purchased 6.7 acres on Cougar Mountain between Bellevue, Newcastle, and Issaquah in the Lakemont neighborhood and began to work with the Miller Hull Partnership to design a new campus. The property was purchased from Ted and Ann Leber, who had farmed the land for five decades, and the school decided to retain the original farmhouse and use it for administrative offices. The school's library learning commons is named in honor of the Leber's. Due to neighborhood opposition, campus construction was delayed several years; however, in September 2004, Open Window moved to its new campus and enrollment immediately expanded 52%, from 163 to 248 students, pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.|$|E
50|$|In 1910, William Willet {{was invited}} {{to compete for the}} design and {{installation}} of the Great Sanctuary Window in the Cadet Chapel at the United States Military Academy at West Point. Ten other designers, including Nicola D'Ascenzo and Tiffany Studios joined Willet in this international competition. In 1911, the studio was granted the commission of the Sanctuary window, a memorial to the graduates of the Military Academy. The project for the design and fabrication of the Nave and North windows was awarded to the Willet Studio. The master plan for the nave windows, which were sponsored by individual classes in the hopes that every class would eventually be represented, was devised by Bertram Goodhue, William Willet, Colonel C.W. Larned and Chaplain Edward S. Travers. The <b>window</b> <b>program</b> depicts familiar stories of the Old and New Testament, as well as stories of saints from the early church. The north window, also designed and fabricated by the studio, is a memorial to the alumni who died in World War I.|$|E

5000|$|Due to {{the large}} {{nationalist}} movement during World War I, many youth organizations were developed or expanded, including the Boy Scouts of America. During World War I, Woodrow Wilson placed a great importance on the Boy Scouts of America, asking them to encourage war support and educate the public sources {{about the importance of}} the war. They helped distribute the war pamphlets, helped sell war bonds and helped to drive nationalism and support for the war. Additionally, they were involved in many acts that helped the national government, such as locating black walnut to use in war materials and peach pits for gas masks. The Boy Scouts were involved in five Liberty Bond drives in which they helped sell Liberty Bonds to benefit the American Government. [...] During the first campaign, they raised a total of $23,000,000 and in the second drive they collected $.

40|$|ABSTRACT: New window {{technologies}} are reducing heat transfer through the glazed areas of windows. Low-emissivity (low-E) coatings reduce {{radiative heat transfer}} and low-conductivity gas fills (which replace the air between glazing layers) reduce conductive heat transfer. Given these advantages in insulating glass technol-ogy. researchers and manufacturers {{are now beginning to}} focus their attention on re-ducing heat transfer through window edges. Old edge designs are now under scru-tiny and new designs are being proposed. This paper explores window material and design parameters which influence heat transfer using two-dimensional heat-transfer modeling with an advanced finite-element computer code (ANSYS). A comprehensive set of correlations, based on ANSYS parametncs, is then developed. These correlations are compared, whenever possible, to experimental results and will be incorporated into future versions of the <b>WINDOW</b> <b>program</b> Glazing edge designs analyzed include both double-glazed and triple-glazed options with aluminum, steel, wood, fibergls, butyl, and insulated spacers. Single and double seal design are also analyzed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{approach}} to the application of bandwidth-oriented signal timing has been proposed based on a group partition method for coordinated arterials. Firstly, the approach is an improved and detailed bandwidth optimization method, including detail steps to calculate upper/lower influences and relative offset for intersections, with different conditions. A <b>window</b> <b>program</b> BOTSD (Bandwidth Optimization and Time-Space Diagram) was developed to obtain optimal progression bandwidth and draw time-space diagram for an arterial. Secondly, a group partition method of coordinated arterials to get optimal bandwidth has been developed. In the case study, after calculating valid and optimal bandwidth for every possible subgroup, arterial progression bandwidth for every combination of possible subgroups can be obtained using the improved bandwidth optimization and group partition method. The results of intersection control delay and progression bandwidth for every combination of possible subgroups show that bandwidth-based solutions generally outperform delay-based solutions. Meanwhile, the signal timing plan from improved bandwidth optimization and group partition method {{is much better than}} the result from Synchro 6. 0 optimization function and Messer's method...|$|E

However, LED junction temperature will influence the luminous efficiency, spectral color, life cycle, and stability. This study utilizes thermal performance experiments with the illumination-analysis method and <b>window</b> <b>program</b> (vapour chamber thermal module, VCTM V 1. 0) to investigate and analyze the high-power LED (Hi-LED) lighting thermal module, {{in order to achieve}} the best solution of the fin parameters under the natural convection. The computing core of the VCTM program employs the theoretical thermal resistance analytical approach with iterative convergence stated in this study to obtain a numerical solution. Results showed that the best geometry of thermal module is 4. 4 [*]mm fin thickness, 9. 4 [*]mm fin pitch, and 37 [*]mm fin height with the LED junction temperature of 58. 8 °C. And the experimental thermal resistances are in good agreement with the theoretical thermal resistances; calculating error between measured data and simulation results is no more than ± 7 %.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the effects of multi-mode simulation learning on critical thinking disposition, on the problem solving process and on clinical competence of nursing students. Methods: A non-equivalent control group with pre-posttest was designed. The participants in this study were 65 students who were enrolled in an emergency and critical nursing course at N university. The treatment group consisted of 33 juniors in 2010 and the control group 32 juniors in 2011. Collected data were analyzed using chi-square, independent t-test, and ANCOVA with the SPSS/WIN 18. 0 for <b>Window</b> <b>Program.</b> Results: There were significant increases in problem solving process and clinical competence in the treatment group who participated in the multi-mode simulation learning compared to the control group who did not (t=- 2. 39, p=. 020; F= 12. 76, p=. 001). However, there were no significant differences in critical thinking disposition between the treatment and control group (t= 0. 40, p=. 692). Conclusion: Multi-mode simulation is an effective teaching and learning method to enhance the problem solving process and clinical competence of nursing students. Further exploration is needed to develop and utilize multi-mode simulation for diverse scenarios, depending on emergency nursing educational goals and environ-ments and to develop a universal method to measure outcomes...|$|E
