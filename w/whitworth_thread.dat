Next, the importance of the throttling apparatus and the accuracy of the slides (rectangularity and straightness) has been pointed out in order to obtain the results of higher precision.

50|$|Maudslay's work, {{as well as}} the {{contributions}} of other engineers, accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization; some companies' in-house standards spread a bit within their industries.

5000|$|Sir Joseph Whitworth, 1st Baronet (21 December 1803 - 22 January 1887) was an English engineer, entrepreneur, {{inventor}} and philanthropist. In 1841, he {{devised the}} British Standard Whitworth system, which created an accepted standard for screw <b>threads.</b> <b>Whitworth</b> also created the Whitworth rifle, {{often called the}} [...] "sharpshooter" [...] because of its accuracy and {{considered one of the}} earliest examples of a sniper rifle.|$|R
50|$|In early 1871, Xantho {{was sold}} to the 'metal merchant' Robert Stewart of Glasgow, who {{replaced}} the paddle engines with a second-hand Crimean War-era two-cylinder, non-condensing trunk engine built (or assembled) in 1861 by John Penn. Stewart also lengthened the vessel's stern and fitted a propeller and a new boiler. The Crimean War-type gunboat engine and those built to the same design in the ensuing years were the first high-pressure, high-revolution, mass-produced engines made for use at sea. The type also used <b>Whitworth's</b> Standard <b>Thread</b> throughout, allowing for interchangeability of parts. The refurbished, schooner-rigged Xantho was offered for sale in October 1871 and was purchased by Charles Edward Broadhurst, a Manchester-born entrepreneur involved in colonial ventures in northwest Australia.|$|R
50|$|The {{same year}} (1828), Clement began making fluted {{screw-cutting}} tap and dies and urged {{the adoption of}} a standard system of screw threads where every machine screw of a particular length should have a set number of threads of a predetermined pitch and determined the number of threads for each length. Joseph Whitworth, at that time one of Clement's journeymen afterwards {{played a major role in}} such standardisation, the <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> becoming a standard for machine screws.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> was the world's first {{national}} screw thread standard, devised and specified by Joseph Whitworth in 1841. Until then, the only standardization was what little {{had been done}} by individual people and companies, with some companies' in-house standards spreading a bit within their industries. Whitworth's new standard specified a 55° thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327p and a radius of 0.137329p, where p is the pitch. The thread pitch increases with diameter in steps specified on a chart.|$|E
50|$|The {{first person}} to create a {{standard}} (in about 1841) was the English engineer Sir Joseph Whitworth. Whitworth screw sizes are still used, both for repairing old machinery and where a coarser thread than the metric fastener thread is required. Whitworth became British Standard Whitworth, abbreviated to BSW (BS 84:1956) and the British Standard Fine (BSF) thread was introduced in 1908 because the <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> was too coarse for some applications. The thread angle was 55°, and the depth and pitch varied with {{the diameter of the}} thread (i.e., the bigger the bolt, the coarser the thread). Spanners for Whitworth bolts are marked with the size of the bolt, not the distance across the flats of the screw head.|$|E
50|$|By 1808, annual {{production}} from the 45 machines had reached 130,000 blocks {{and some of}} the equipment was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century. Mass production techniques were also used to rather limited extent to make clocks and watches, and to make small arms, though parts were usually non-interchangeable. Though produced on a very small scale, Crimean War gunboat engines designed and assembled by John Penn of Greenwich are recorded as the first instance of the application of mass production techniques (though not necessarily the assembly-line method) to marine engineering. In filling an Admiralty order for 90 sets to his high-pressure and high-revolution horizontal trunk engine design, Penn produced them all in 90 days. He also used <b>Whitworth</b> Standard <b>threads</b> throughout. Prerequisites for the wide use of mass production were interchangeable parts, machine tools and power, especially in the form of electricity.|$|R
5000|$|En {{route from}} the Persian Gulf to Rotterdam, Netherlands, via a {{scheduled}} stop at Lyme Bay, Great Britain, the ship encountered stormy weather with gale conditions and high seas {{while in the}} English Channel. At around 09:45, a heavy wave slammed into the ship's rudder and {{it was found that}} she was no longer responding to the helm. This was due to the shearing of <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> studs in the Hastie four ram steering gear, built under licence in Spain, causing a loss of hydraulic fluid. Attempts to repair the damage and regain control of the ship were made but proved unsuccessful. While the message [...] "no longer manoeuvrable" [...] and asking other vessels to stand by was transmitted at 10:20, no call for tug assistance was issued until 11:20.|$|E
5000|$|Development of the Thury thread {{began in}} 1876, when the Horological Section of Geneva Society of Arts {{appointed}} {{a committee to}} look into the requirements for a uniform thread standard for use in Horological arts in Switzerland. Professor Thury began his studies by collecting and measuring samples of screws made by nine independent screw and screw tackle manufacturers in Switzerland. The Thury thread form was developed in 1878, thirty-seven years after the British Standard <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> form was designed in England and fourteen years after the United States Standard thread was presented in the United States. However, unlike these two predecessors, the Thury thread was designed for small-diameter screws which were then produced with screw plates. This production technique mandated that the Thury thread form have rounded crests and roots. Thread forms with rounded or [...] "radiused" [...] crests and roots like the Thury and <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> generate smaller stress risers than those forms like the American National or ISO metric which have truncated roots and crests; in modern engineering this is particularly important factor when tapping holes in acrylic plastic, where a larger stress riser can lead to an earlier onset of crack formation. The Thury thread is unusual in having a comparatively small 47.5° thread flank angle, which was chosen to make fabrication easier and to achieve greater holding capacity than screws with larger flank angles. Screws in the Thury thread system are given nominal sizes, with the base size [...] "0" [...] being six millimeters in diameter and having a thread pitch of one millimeter. Sizes are proportional, so a size [...] "1" [...] is ten percent smaller in diameter that a size [...] "0", while a size -1 is ten percent larger than a size [...] "0". The Thury thread was {{believed to be the first}} thread form to solve the problem of creating a single system of screw dimensions applicable to all sizes. The relationship between the pitch P of a Thury screw and its diameter D is expressed by the equation D=6P5/6. Another variable Thury standardized is the thread depth, which had until then been variable when cutting threads in different materials. The proliferation of the Thury standard was hindered when in 1882, the British Science Association produced a committee report on the consideration of a standard screw gauge, where they declined to accept the Thury thread but instead chose to use the <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> standard previously designed by committee member Joseph Whitworth, in part because the Whitworth form was historically successful and because the committee did not believe England was prepared to use a metric thread as its standard. However, the committee recognized the validity of many of the design aspects of the Thury thread, and a mere two years later published their specifications for the British Association (BA) thread. The BA committee made only slight modifications to the rounding radii of Thury thread and gave specifications rounded to the nearest mil.|$|E
5000|$|The {{form of a}} <b>Whitworth</b> <b>thread</b> {{is based}} on a {{fundamental}} triangle with an angle of 55° at each peak and valley. The sides are at a flank angle of &Theta; = 27.5° to the perpendicular to the axis. (Note that the figure on the right is misleading as it shows 22.5° instead of 27.5°.) Thus, if the thread pitch is p, the height of the fundamental triangle is H = p/(2&thinsp;tan&thinsp;&Theta;) = 0.96049106&thinsp;p. However, the top and bottom [...] of each of these triangles is cut off, so the actual depth of thread (the difference between major and minor diameters) is [...] of that value, or h = p/(3&thinsp;tan&thinsp;&Theta;) = 0.64032738&thinsp;p. The peaks are further reduced by rounding them with a 2×(90°−&Theta;) = 180°−55° = 125° circular arc. This arc has a height of e = H&thinsp;sin&thinsp;&Theta;/6 = 0.073917569&thinsp;p (leaving a straight flank depth of h−2e = 0.49249224&thinsp;p) and a radius of r = e/(1−sin&thinsp;&Theta;) = 0.13732908&thinsp;p.|$|E
