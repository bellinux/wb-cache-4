5|$|Additionally, KKR {{was one of}} the few {{firms that}} was able to {{complete}} large leveraged buyout transactions in the years immediately following the collapse of the Internet bubble, including Shoppers Drug Mart and Bell Canada Yellow Pages. KKR was able to realize its investment in Shoppers Drug Mart through a 2002 IPO and subsequent public stock offerings. The directories business <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> public in 2004 as Yellow Pages Income Fund, a Canadian income trust.|$|E
5|$|After a touch-line {{argument}} with then-club captain Gareth Owen, Gannon gave a forthright interview explaining that disciplinary action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken,</b> and Owen would be stripped of the captaincy. Owen, who was later {{released by the}} club, did not play another game for County. Meanwhile, Gannon was left threatening police action over a strong challenge that left Stockport striker Matty McNeil unconscious and in hospital.|$|E

The station's coal storage area would have stored a minimum 45 days worth of coal supply.

Unsold PFA and furnace bottom ash <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to a landfill site by road.|$|E
5|$|Crawford's statue was {{designed}} in the early 1850s. It was originally to be crowned with a pileus, the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, a Southerner who would later serve as President of the Confederate States of America, was concerned that the pileus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as an abolitionist symbol. He ordered that it be changed to a helmet.|$|E
5|$|NSB soon bought all {{the shares}} of the company, and also made an {{agreement}} that operations on the Arendal Line <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> over by Timetoget. However, the new company tried to take a short-cut in giving engineers only a six-week training program, {{instead of the usual}} 18 months. This made NSB want to discontinue operations. They bought {{out the rest of the}} shareholders, and liquidated the company. Timetoget never ran anything but trials on the Bratsberg Line.|$|E

5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were not {{prepared}} for playing cricket in Asia, as they {{were not aware of}} the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He recommended that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it entails. The ICC announced that no further action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E
5|$|The new ACC commander, General Corley, {{referred}} {{the matter}} to USAF Lieutenant General Norman Seip, commander of the 12th Air Force, as a court-martial convening authority to determine if additional charges or actions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> against any of the personnel involved in the incident. Seip later closed the investigation without recommending criminal charges against anyone involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the peace {{agreement}} were {{that no one would}} be enslaved, no harm would be done to the temples, nothing <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> as booty and that safe passage was given to Thomas, Harbees, and every citizen of Damascus who was not willing to live under Muslim rule. The peace agreement also stated that the peace would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Football League, the Premier League {{was set up}} with {{a two-man}} board: Rick Parry, the chief executive, and Sir John Quinton who was {{appointed}} as the league's chairman in December 1991.

5|$|While ducks are {{naturally}} aquatic, swimming {{can be dangerous}} to young ducklings, and it can also restrict a duck's growth. Thus, although duckers would ensure the ducklings always had a trough or sink to paddle in, the ducklings would be kept away from bodies of water while they were growing. The exception was shortly before slaughter, when the ducklings <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> for one swim in a pond, as it helped them to feather properly.|$|E
5|$|Çakır was scrutinised by the British {{media in}} 2013 {{when he sent}} off Manchester United's Nani in a Champions League quarter-final and the English team went on to lose to Real Madrid.

5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> Since {{only a small part of}} the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to the forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to {{the headquarters of the}} division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} went to penalties, Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United, and opted for his side {{to go first}} in the shoot-out, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> at the end housing the Manchester United fans. Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way. Ballack was next up, {{shooting}} powerfully past Van der Sar. Carrick buried his spot-kick, as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game, having come on for Makélélé {{at the end of}} extra time. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1984 the New Order {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the draft, around 40% of {{the players}} {{selected}} in it were born from countries outside the United States. It would remain the highest influx of international players selected in the modern NBA draft era until the 2016 NBA draft, where almost half of the selected players were born in countries outside the US. In addition, four of the players selected in the draft were Russians, which not only marked the highest number of players born in that region to be taken in one draft, but also was the highest representation of a country in one draft until 2016 when five Frenchmen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> in the draft.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the various}} charters, the {{provision}} of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored. The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system. Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.|$|E
