5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work <b>with,</b> <b>because</b> as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E
5|$|We were {{supposed}} to be with her in the studio for a couple of days. She kindly invited us to stay a little longer. We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, coming out of her head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work <b>with</b> <b>because</b> she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing. I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

25|$|Despite Leonard's {{reasonable}} {{nature and}} friendly personality, he occasionally demonstrates a mean streak. These include deliberately triggering Sheldon's obsessive compulsive problems, mocking Howard and Raj whenever they slip up, and making sniping comments when Penny's commitment issues flare up. In addition, {{he is often}} shown to be quite jealous, often feeling insecure and defensive whenever Penny interacts with another guy, and on one occasion trying to frighten off a British college student she was doing a project <b>with,</b> <b>because</b> Penny commented positively on his accent.|$|E
25|$|On 27 October 2011, it was {{announced}} that Flea's side-project with Damon Albarn and afrobeat legend, Tony Allen would be called Rocket Juice & the Moon. According to Albarn, on where the band's name came from, someone in Lagos did the sleeve design and that's the name he gave it, which he said he is fine <b>with,</b> <b>because</b> trying to find a name for another band is always tricky. The band made their live debut on 29 October 2011, in London and their debut album was released in 2012.|$|E

25|$|On February 28, 1935, Gerard Berchet, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Carothers, produced a half-ounce of polymer from hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid, creating polyamide 6-6, the substance that would {{come to be known as}} Nylon. It was difficult to work <b>with</b> <b>because</b> of its high melting point, but Bolton chose this polyamide as the one to develop commercially. He selected Dr. George Graves to work with Carothers on the project. Eventually Graves supplanted Carothers as the leader of the polyamide project. In addition, dozens of chemists and engineers worked on refining polyamide 6-6 into a viable commercial product.|$|E

Nicholson {{described an}} incident where Drew Hankinson was completely naked in the ring {{for a long period}} of time and gave naked stink faces to Ryder and Melissa Coates while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed to do this (with the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up <b>with</b> <b>because</b> they wanted to skip the session.|$|E
25|$|According to Chapter 44 of the Brahmananda Purana, Brahma and Shiva once {{got into}} a heated quarrel. So violent was Shiva's rage {{as a result of}} this quarrel, that the devas fled from his {{presence}} in fear. His consort, Parvati, complained that Shiva was now impossible to live with. Realising the disharmony his anger had caused, he decided to deposit this anger into Anasuya, the wife of sage Atri. From this portion of Shiva deposited into Anasuya, a child was born, who was named 'Durvasa' (lit. one who is difficult to live <b>with).</b> <b>Because</b> he was born of Shiva's anger, he had an irascible nature.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{dangerous}} goods are often indicated by diamond-shaped signage on the item (see NFPA 704), its container, or {{the building where}} it is stored. The color of each diamond indicates its hazard, e.g., flammable is indicated <b>with</b> red, <b>because</b> fire and heat are generally of red color, and explosive is indicated <b>with</b> orange, <b>because</b> mixing red (flammable) with yellow (oxidizing agent) creates orange. A nonflammable or nontoxic gas is indicated <b>with</b> green, <b>because</b> all compressed air vessels are this color in France after World War II, and France was where the diamond system of hazmat identification originated.|$|R

25|$|Miller stated at a {{town hall}} meeting that he {{believed}} East Germany was an example of a nation taking effective measures to control the flow of people across a border. Miller believes illegal immigration is a “critically important” issue to deal <b>with</b> <b>because</b> of its economic effects on health care, education and employment. Miller wants to secure the border to stop more immigrants from entering America illegally and protect the country from possible terrorist threats. Miller does not believe the millions of immigrants already here illegally should be granted amnesty. Miller supports efforts by states such as Arizona to enforce immigration laws when the federal government will not, and he believes illegal immigrants should be deported when they come into contact with law enforcement officials.|$|E
25|$|Cassiodorus devoted much of {{his life}} to {{supporting}} education within the Christian community at large. When his proposed theological university in Rome was denied, he was forced to re-examine his entire approach to how material was learned and interpreted. His Variae show that, like Augustine of Hippo, Cassiodorus viewed reading as a transformative act for the reader. It is with this in mind that he designed and mandated the course of studies at the Vivarium, which demanded an intense regimen of reading and meditation. By assigning a specific order of texts to be read, Cassiodorus hoped to create the discipline necessary within the reader to become a successful monk. The first work in this succession of texts would be the Psalms, which the untrained reader would need to begin <b>with</b> <b>because</b> of its appeal to emotion and temporal goods. By examining the rate at which copies of his Psalmic commentaries were issued, it is fair to assess that as the first work in his series, Cassiodorus's educational agenda had been implemented to some degree of success.|$|E
25|$|The {{school in}} Karlsruhe {{was founded by}} the Grand Duke of Baden whom Gude had good {{relations}} <b>with.</b> <b>Because</b> of this fact Gude received better pay than at the Düsseldorf Academy, had spacious and rent-free accommodations and was given generous periods of leave which allowed him to travel in the summer to perform studies for future paintings. Gude served {{as the director of}} Karlsruhe from 1866–1868 and again from 1869–1870, where he introduced several of his own educational principles designed to develop pupil's individual talent. But Gude's reign as director at Karlsruhe was not without resistance to his methods, and it is this opposition that he cites as his reason for visiting the Berlin Academy of Art that as early as 1874 in search of better conditions. Because of Gude's visits to Berlin, his relation with the Grand Duke became strained as the Grand Duke felt that the concessions he had made to Gude were so great that Gude should be grateful and not look for a professorships elsewhere. Gude remained at Karlsruhe for six more years after his first visits to the Berlin Academy of Art, but in 1880 he decided to retire from the Karlsruhe school to take up a position in Berlin.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt <b>with</b> <b>because</b> it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal <b>with</b> <b>because</b> they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E

Pope explained the appeal of working with the Cure by saying, [...] "the Cure is the ultimate band for a filmmaker to work <b>with</b> <b>because</b> Robert Smith really understands the camera. His songs are so cinematic. I mean on one level there's this stupidity and humour, right, but beneath that there are all [...] psychological obsessions and claustrophobia." ...|$|E

500|$|Ellie Gibson of Eurogamer {{said that}} the {{characters}} were easy to sympathize <b>with</b> <b>because</b> they were so realistic. Edge claimed the characters [...] "sizzle with zip and pith", and praised the believable interactions between them. Ars Technica called the characters [...] "oddly human" [...] when discussing their realism. Ars Technica's Ben Kuchera also gave the voice acting high marks, claiming it set a new bar for video game voice acting. Johnny Minkley of Eurogamer claimed simply that players will care {{about the fate of}} all the characters in the series.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, on her {{way back}} from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been {{attracted}} to Pilobolus growing up: [...] "I was taller than most girls my age, and I thought that was a company I could be <b>with</b> <b>because</b> the women were always lifting the men." [...] There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects.|$|E
