40|$|Index {{began as}} an online open {{submission}} project, attracting IRO 2500 international submissions. Criteria being, ‘submissions must have already been used to communicate, or be communicative in their own right’. All submissions {{have been removed from}} their original context, breaking the messages or ideas for which they were created. For example, some of the drawings and photographs might have been made or shot to brief or assignment, for a magazine or newspaper. Index stripped them of this original context, bias and message. Using Index as a container, exhibition space and story telling device, the pages that follow have been edited to create pairs or combinations of images that can be read as new narratives. The book is an experimental exchange of internationally created, out-of-context, repurposed text and image. Index was acquired by The Museum of Modern Art NY Special Collection April 4 th 2014.
