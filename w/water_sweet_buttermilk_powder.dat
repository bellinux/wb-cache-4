40|$|Dental caries is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} disease caused by colonisation of tooth surfaces by cariogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus salivarius. Reducing initial adherence of such bacteria to teeth may delay onset of caries. Many foods, such as milk, can inhibit microbial adherence. In this investigation, the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on adherence of S. sobrinus and S. salivarius to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel, was examined. Untreated (UT) acid whey protein concentrate (AWPC) 80 inhibited streptococcal adherence to phosphate-buffered saline-coated HA (PBS-HA) and saliva-coated HA (S-HA) by > 80 % at ⩾ 31. 25 μg mL− 1. UT <b>sweet</b> WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> and cream powder also significantly reduced adherence (P < 0. 05). Enzyme-treatment of all dairy powders reduced their anti-adhesion activity. However, ET sweet WPC 80 significantly inhibited growth of these streptococci (P < 0. 05) at ⩾ 0. 6 mg mL− 1. Therefore, dairy powders may reduce progression of dental caries by their anti-adhesion and/or antibacterial activity...|$|R
40|$|Dental caries is {{a common}} {{bacterial}} infection, but the progression of this disease can be delayed by preventing initial attachment of cariogenic bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to tooth surfaces. This study firstly compares the effect of untreated (UT) and enzyme-treated (ET) dairy powders on the adherence of S. mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. A fluorescence-based method was used to quantify adherence of S. mutans to HA both in the presence (S-HA) and absence (PBS-HA) of saliva. Secondly, binding of proteins present in the test materials to HA was quantified using bicinchonic acid assays and SDS-PAGE. In addition, the effect of UT and ET dairy powders on growth of S. mutans was examined using an optical-density based assay. UT acid whey protein concentrate (WPC) 80, <b>sweet</b> WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> (BMP) and cream powder (CP) significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited adhesion of S. mutans at ≥ 31. 25 μg mL− 1 in the presence and absence of saliva. ET dairy powders were less effective inhibitors of adhesion, but ET sweet WPC 80 significantly (P < 0. 05) inhibited growth of S. mutans at ≥ 0. 6 mg mL− 1. Therefore, due to their adherence- and growth-inhibitory properties, dairy powders may be beneficial {{in the treatment of}} dental caries...|$|R

40|$|Almost 16 % of milk {{produced}} in European Union is being converted to butter. Buttermilk, {{is a low}} cost by-product from butter manufacture and available in large quantities but has been considered invaluable for many years. When cream is churned to butter the stable oil in water emulsion is destabilized and milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) is disrupted which is released in buttermilk. Thus, {{over the last two}} decades it has gained considerable attention due to its specific composition (proteins and polar lipids) attributed towards the MFGM. In account to this composition of <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder,</b> it finds application in food industry as a natural stabilizing and emulsifying agent. It also finds application as a source of total solids and is commercially being added upto 10 % in many food products. However, it has limitation in such applications due to the presence of cholesterol (approx. 80 mg/ 100 g). Cholesterol is also an integral part of MFGM and is released into buttermilk with MFGM. The most suitable techniques to remove cholesterol from <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> are using β-cyclodextrin and cholesterol oxidase enzyme.

40|$|The climates of {{many areas}} in Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Africa make it {{difficult}} to support a dairy industry based on fresh milk. In these areas the shelf life of fresh, undried milk products is short. Concentrated and dry milk products have increased storage stability because of a lower water activity and are therefore desirable in regions with such climatic conditions. Concentrated milk products are obtained from milk by the application of one or a combination of water removal techniques. Drying of these products can reduce the water content to below 3 %. The reduction in water content of milk will increase shelf life and reduce transportation costs. This is particularly important for manufacturers that export products to distant markets. These products may be recombined (water and a combination of ingredients added) or reconstituted (just water added) and then packed and sold by a food retailer, or sold directly to the consumer as a dry or concentrated product, e. g. whole milk powder (WMP) or canned evaporated milk. The range of concentrated and spray-dried dairy powders commercially produced today is wide and includes ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treated concentrated milks, in-can sterilised milks, skim milk powder, WMP, formulated infant food powders, high protein powders and high fat <b>powders,</b> whey <b>powders,</b> <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powders,</b> cream powders, casein and caseinates.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the inhibitory effect of various dairy powders and milk constituents on the adhesion of a clinical isolate of Streptococcus mutans to hydroxylapatite (HA), an analogue of tooth enamel. Adhesion of a microorganism to a cell surface such as epithelial cells or tooth enamel is considered to be the first step in pathogenesis. Inhibiting this process may have therapeutic effects in vivo. The adherence assays were performed by incubating S. mutans with HA in the presence of each test material for 45 min, followed by centrifugal separation of the HA. Unbound bacteria were then quantified using a fluorescent dye. Sweet and Acid WPC 80, <b>buttermilk</b> <b>powder</b> and cream powder were found to very effectively inhibit adherence of S. mutans to phosphate-buffered saline coated HA (PBS-HA). Sodium caseinate and the casein fractions a-,b- and j-casein were also found to show high levels of anti-adhesive activity. A selection of test materials were assessed using saliva-coated HA (S-HA), and similar trends were observed. The results suggest commercial dairy powders, and certain milk proteins, can inhibit adhesion of S. mutans to HA and may have potential to control dental caries...|$|R
