Ng {{disapproved of}} the tools for {{creating}} trees, and therefore hand-modeled the 23 kinds of trees that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> within the game 4,600 times. A custom shader was also employed to produce more stylized and simplified foliage. The in-game fire lookout towers were built in accordance with government specifications, utilizing standard lumber size, after Ng's first attempt was unsatisfactory.|$|E

5|$|There's no {{question}} in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in harm's way.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} {{collectible}} {{items that are}} flown on shuttle missions, such as mission patches, flags, and other personal items for the crew, were an official Harlem Globetrotters basketball and a basketball that Edwin Hubble used in 1909 when he played for the University of Chicago. After being returned to Earth, the Harlem Globetrotters basketball <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and Hubble's ball would {{be returned to the}} University of Chicago. Michael Massimino flew a 1964 reprint of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius from the library of his alma mater, MIT.|$|E

5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|In March 1549, {{the city}} of Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and Paul Fagius to leave. Cranmer {{immediately}} invited the men to come to England and promised that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in English universities. When they arrived on 25 April, Cranmer was especially delighted to meet Bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence. He needed these scholarly men to train {{a new generation of}} preachers as well as assist in the reform of liturgy and doctrine. Others who accepted his invitations include the Polish reformer, Jan Łaski, but Cranmer was unable to convince Osiander and Melanchthon to come to England.|$|E

5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was {{ensure that the}} files <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in the CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption—is {{not subject to the}} FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within. The move prevents the public from accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E
5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they might}} be sent to work on road or other {{projects}} away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted {{at the end of}} a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.|$|E

50|$|In the {{conflict}} of laws, lex loci actus is the law of thelace where the act occurred {{that gave rise to}} the legal claim. This is often confused with lex loci delicti commissi which is where the tort is committed. While typically they both point to the same location, in the case of product liability, for example, the lex loci actus <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the <b>place</b> of manufacturing, while the lex loci delicti commissi <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the <b>place</b> of injury.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the money}} was duly raised and the bronze cast of the statue was finally {{completed}} in 1856, a lengthy dispute delayed its installation for several years. The original idea had been to erect the statue as a memorial to the Great Exhibition. This prompted opposition, as did proposals to place it outside Charles Barry's newly completed Palace of Westminster. Various other locations to display the statue were initially considered before agreement was reached that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in Old Palace Yard, Marochetti's preferred location. It was installed in October 1860, {{though it was not}} until March 1867 that it was finally completed with the addition of bronze bas-reliefs {{on either side of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1941, Adolf Hitler and Wilhelm Keitel, {{with a large}} entourage, {{arrived to}} view Bismarck and Tirpitz in Gotenhafen. The men were given an {{extensive}} tour of the ships, after which Hitler met with Lütjens to discuss the upcoming mission. On 16 May, Lütjens reported that Bismarck and Prinz Eugen were fully prepared for Operation Rheinübung; he was therefore ordered {{to proceed with the}} mission on the evening of 19 May. As part of the operational plans, a group of eighteen supply ships would be positioned to support Bismarck and Prinz Eugen. Four U-boats <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> along the convoy routes between Halifax and Britain to scout for the raiders.|$|E
5|$|When writing material, {{the band}} would write the music first before {{incorporating}} lyrics. King or Hanneman used a 24-track and drum machine to show band members the riff that they created, {{and to get}} their opinion. Either King, Hanneman or Lombardo would mention if any alterations could be made. The band played the riff to get the basic song structure, and figured out where the lyrics and solos <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed.</b> Hanneman, King and Araya tended to have different lyrical influences. Hanneman's lyrics dealt with Nazis, religion, warfare and similar topics; King's lyrics are generally anti-religious; Araya's lyrics usually dealt with topics {{that could be considered}} less controversial than Hanneman's and King's, such as serial killers and warfare.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{chose the}} {{relatively}} well-rested commands of D. H. Hill, Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder {{to lead the}} Confederate offensive, as they had barely participated in the fighting of the day before. Meanwhile, James Longstreet's First Corps and A. P. Hill's Light Division, who had fought {{the majority of the}} previous day's hostilities, would be held in reserve. According to Lee's plan, the Army of Northern Virginia would form a semi-circle enveloping Malvern Hill. D. H. Hill's five brigades <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> along the northern face of the hill, forming the center of the Confederate line, and the commands of Stonewall Jackson and John Magruder would take the left and right flanks, respectively. Whiting's forces would position themselves on the Poindexter farm, with the outfits of Brig. Gen. Charles Sidney Winder and Richard Ewell nearby. The infantry of these three detachments would provide reinforcement for the Confederate line if necessary. Maj. Gen. Theophilus Holmes would take up a position on the extreme Confederate right flank.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nemo {{is placed}} in a fish tank {{in the office of}} a dentist. He meets {{aquarium}} fish called the Tank Gang, led by Gill, a moorish idol. The fish learn that Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who previously killed a fish by constantly shaking its bag. Gill then reveals his plan to escape, jamming the tank's filter with a pebble. The fish <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> in plastic bags so that the dentist can clean the tank, and then they would roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter, but fails, almost getting himself killed in the process. Near the harbor, a pelican, Nigel, flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's adventure. Inspired by his father's determination, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. Unlike the first attempt, he is able to successfully render the filter useless, but to the tank gang's dismay, the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before they can escape.|$|E
