50|$|Boritzer gained {{national}} {{critical acclaim}} after <b>What</b> <b>is</b> God? {{was published in}} 1989 although the book has caused controversy from religious fundamentalists for its universalist views. The other current books in the <b>What</b> <b>is?</b> series include <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Love?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Death?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Beautiful?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Funny?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Right?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Peace?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Money?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> Dreaming?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Friend?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> True?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Family?, <b>What</b> <b>is</b> a Feeling? The series is now also translated into 15 languages. Boritzer {{was first published in}} 1963 at the age of 13 when he wrote an essay in his English class at Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, New York on the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His essay was included in a special anthology by New York City public school children compiled and published by the New York City Department of Education.|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} of {{the early years of}} the legacy. This bequest was {{administered}} by the Corporation of London in around 1460 and a small college was founded next to Guildhall Chapel, also using the library facilities in the chapel. Despite the fact that this continued for over 70 years, the earliest certain evidence of the existence of Carpenter's Children can only be traced back to 1536, and thus it isn't clear who these boys <b>were,</b> <b>what</b> they were taught and where they lived. In 1547, under the Chantries Act the Guildhall Chapel and Library were forfeited. The funding for the four boys was also discontinued. The Corporation of London remained in control of Carpenter's estate and accounts from the next 300 years show that the money continued to be spent on children's benefits such as providing new coats to every child or providing them with access to education.|$|E
5|$|Single-purpose {{characters}} {{needed a}} distinctive personality trait to quickly establish {{them with the}} player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they <b>were,</b> <b>what</b> they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct {{from that of the}} other eight clans; Mitsoda said {{it was one of the}} simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Fort Eben-Emael was {{a battle}} between Belgian and German forces that took place between 10 May and 11 May 1940, and {{was part of the}} Battle of Belgium and Fall Gelb, the German {{invasion}} of the Low Countries and France. An assault force of German paratroopers, Fallschirmjäger, was tasked with assaulting and capturing Fort Eben-Emael, a Belgian fortress whose strategic position and strong artillery emplacements dominated several important bridges over the Albert Canal. The easterly roads led into the Belgian heartland {{and the rest of the}} Low Countries. These roads <b>were</b> <b>what</b> the German forces intended to use to advance into Belgium. As some of the German airborne forces assaulted the fortress and disabled the garrison and the artillery pieces inside it, others simultaneously captured three bridges over the Canal. Having disabled the fortress, the airborne troops were then ordered to protect the bridges against Belgian counter-attacks until they linked up with ground forces from the German 18th Army.|$|E

In addition, they also possessed five pairs of oval-shaped areas covered with microscopic projections on the ceiling of the second branchial chambers within the mesosoma, immediately below the gill tracts. These areas are known as Kiemenplatten (or gill-tracts, though the former term is preferred). They are unique to eurypterids.|$|E

25|$|LaHarpe {{was born}} in 1754 in Rolle, Switzerland in the canton of Vaud. At the time Switzerland was a confederacy of mainly self-governing cantons held {{together}} by a loose military alliance, with little in terms of actual union and no central government. Some of the cantons <b>were</b> <b>what</b> {{was referred to as}} subject lands since they were governed by other cantons: Vaud, for example, had been under the control of Bern since the 16th century. LaHarpe studied at the University of Tübingen in 1774, graduating with a doctorate of Laws degree. Leaving Switzerland, LaHarpe travelled to Russia, where he became a tutor for the children of the Russian Emperor Paul I, including the future Alexander I with whom LaHarpe remained in contact well into his reign.|$|E
25|$|The most {{striking}} and thorough reform {{imposed by the}} General Velasco's government was to eliminate all large private landholdings, converting most of them into cooperatives owned by prior workers on the estates. The reform was intended to destroy the basis of power of Peru's traditional elite and to foster a more cooperative society {{as an alternative to}} capitalism. Such socialpolitical purposes apparently dominated questions of agricultural production or any planned changes in patterns of land use. It was as if the questions of ownership <b>were</b> <b>what</b> mattered, not the consequences for output or rural incomes. In fact, the government soon created a system of price controls and monopoly food buying by state firms designed to hold down prices to urban consumers, no matter what the cost to rural producers.|$|E

From there, since mid September, Kapaun and the division were constantly on the move northward. On October 9, the division crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea and advanced within 50 miles of the Chinese border. His main complaint was lack of sleep for several weeks at a time. He constantly ministered to the dead and dying while performing baptisms, hearing confessions, offering Holy Communion and celebrating Mass from an improvised altar {{set up on the}} front end of a jeep. He constantly would lose his Mass kit, jeep, and trailer to enemy fire.
