5|$|Cockatoos are diurnal {{and require}} {{daylight}} {{to find their}} food. They are not early risers, instead <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> sun has warmed their roosting sites before feeding. All species are generally highly social and roost, forage and travel in colourful and noisy flocks. These vary in size depending on availability of food; in times of plenty, flocks are small and number a hundred birds or less, while in droughts or other times of adversity, they may swell up to contain thousands or even {{tens of thousands of}} birds; one record from the Kimberley noted a flock of 32,000 little corellas. Species that inhabit open country form larger flocks than those of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{submitted}} {{a proposal to}} his commander, Walter Grabmann, commanding 3. Jagd-Division (3rd Fighter Division), that a intruder operation {{be allowed to take}} place. Schnaufer proposed <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> enemy had crossed beyond the lines over the North Sea before attacking them. Grabmann was enthusiastic, and suggested the operation go further and attack the enemy bombers while they were attempting to land in eastern England. Schnaufer also became aware of Schmid's desire for an intruder operation at this time and personally urged him to approach the High Command once more.|$|E
5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. <b>Waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted Henry. <b>Waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> {{rebellion}} against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King {{but was unable to}} persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E
5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking his ship. Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting his ship and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits). Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.|$|E
5|$|Finally in December, Matilda {{responded by}} {{escaping}} from the castle; the popular {{version of this}} has the Empress <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Castle Mill Stream was frozen over and then dressed in white as camouflage in the snow, being lowered down the walls {{with three or four}} knights, before escaping through Stephen's lines in the night as the king's sentries tried to raise the alarm. The chronicler William of Malmesbury, however, suggests Matilda did not descend the walls, but instead escaped from one of the gates. Matilda safely reached Abingdon-on-Thames and Oxford Castle surrendered to Stephen the next day. Robert had died in the final weeks of the siege and the castle was granted to William de Chesney {{for the remainder of the}} war. At the end of the war the constableship of Oxford Castle was granted to Roger de Bussy before being reclaimed by Henry D'Oyly, Robert D'Oyly the younger's son, in 1154.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> last minute to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected {{to the satisfaction of}} the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days in jail or 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E

They managed to surprise and capture a company of the 36th Illinois, but many were freed when Sigel's withdrawing men unexpectedly bumped into them. Sigel managed to fight his way through Gates' men, helped by a blunder by confederate Brig. Gen. James M. McIntosh.|$|E

25|$|The 8th Division was an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} Australian Army, formed during World War II {{as part of the}} all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force. The 8th Division was raised from volunteers for overseas service from July 1940 onwards. Consisting of three infantry brigades, the intention had been to deploy the division to the Middle East to join the other Australian divisions, but as war with Japan loomed in 1941, the division was divided into four separate forces, which were deployed {{in different parts of the}} Asia-Pacific region. All of these formations were destroyed as fighting forces by the end of February 1942 during the fighting for Singapore, and in Rabaul, Ambon, and Timor. Most members of the division became prisoners of war, <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> war ended in late 1945 to be liberated. One in three died in captivity.|$|E

After their commander, Oberstleutnant Beck was cut down, 706 officers and men of the Jordis battalion laid down their weapons. Two squadrons of the Kienmayer Hussar Regiment # 8 suffered 10 killed, 50 wounded, and 23 captured. The Badeners reported losing only three killed and 10 wounded, though {{a large number of}} their horses were killed. There was a clash between General of Division Claude Carra Saint-Cyr's vanguard and General-Major Frederick Bianchi, Duke of Casalanza on 2 May at Räffelding, three kilometers southeast of Eferding. The Baden Dragoons lost 14 casualties, while Austrian losses were unreported.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt {{extensively}} used {{executive orders}} {{on a number}} of occasions to protect forest and wildlife lands during his tenure as President. By the end of his second term in office, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish 150 million acres of reserved forestry land. Roosevelt was unapologetic about his extensive use of executive orders to protect the environment, despite the perception in Congress that he was encroaching on too many lands. Eventually, Senator Charles Fulton (R-OH) attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land. Before signing that bill into law, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish an additional 21 forest reserves, <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> last minute to sign the bill into law. In total, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish 121 forest reserves in 31 states. Prior to Roosevelt, only one president had issued over 200 executive orders, Grover Cleveland (253). The first 25 presidents issued a total of 1,262 executive orders. Roosevelt issued 1,081.|$|E
