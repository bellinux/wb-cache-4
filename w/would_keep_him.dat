5|$|Christopher McQuarrie, {{who went}} uncredited {{for his work}} on X-Men, was hired to write the {{screenplay}} for the second Wolverine film in August 2009. Darren Aronofsky was chosen to direct the film, though bowed out, stating the project <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out of the country for too long. James Mangold was later chosen to direct the film. Mark Bomback was then hired to rewrite McQuarrie's script. Principal photography began in August 2012 in Sydney, Australia, and ended in November. The film was released on July 26, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Healey I {{advised to}} go to his brother at Bolton, and get some money, and keep out of sight entirely, until {{something}} further was known. His best way would be to avoid Manchester, and go over Kersal moor and Agecroft bridge; and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished to see me, I <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> company as far as Agecroft.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013–14 season, Juventus managed an Italian-record of 102 points, {{including}} a Serie A record of 33 victories; Juventus {{finished with the}} best defence of the league, yet again. Buffon managed 89 saves and 18 clean sheets in 33 appearances during the Serie A season, and conceded 19 goals. Juventus were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, although they later managed to reach the semi-finals of the Europa League, losing to Benfica. Buffon was chosen {{as part of the}} 2013–14 Europa League Team of the Season for his performances throughout the tournament. On 1 July 2014, Buffon signed a contract extension that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> at the club until 2017.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers {{made his}} first {{appearance}} of 2010–11 in the opening match, a 2–1 home defeat to Kidderminster Harriers on 14 August 2010, {{in which he was}} substituted in the 65th minute. He suffered a knee injury in a 3–0 home victory over Altrincham on 28 August 2010 and it was believed this <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out of the team for a month. Carruthers made his return as an 81st-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory away to Kidderminster in the FA Cup fourth qualifying round on 23 October 2010. His first start since August 2010 came in a 3–0 home victory over League Two club Rotherham United in an FA Cup first round replay on 17 November. He scored his first goal of the season in the 87th minute of a 2–1 defeat away to Darlington on 23 April 2011.

5|$|Cena {{defeated}} Rollins to win {{the title}} {{for the fifth time}} at Night of Champions, a record in the WWE ownership era of the title. Cena then retained his title against Rollins the following night on Raw and then in a steel cage match at WWE Live from Madison Square Garden. At Hell in a Cell, Cena lost the title to the returning Alberto Del Rio in an open challenge. After a hiatus, Cena returned on the December 28 episode of Raw, defeating Del Rio by disqualification in a rematch for the title. On the December 31 episode of SmackDown Cena aided Kalisto at ringside to victory against Del Rio. On January 7, 2016, Cena underwent surgery on a shoulder injury, which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out of action for an undisclosed amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Following his return, Anderson {{scored a}} season-high 23 points against Fordham on January 19, 2005. He {{represented}} UMass for the 100th time on January 22 vs. Saint Joseph's, as he recorded 16 points, 7 rebounds, and 7 assists. On February 12, he scored 4 points {{to become the}} 20th-best scorer in school history. However, he suffered from back injuries that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> from playing in five games and the Atlantic 10 Tournament. After his senior year, Anderson was averaging 10.2 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.9 steals, and 2.4 three-pointers. He finished his collegiate career with the second-most threes, the third-most steals, the fifth-highest three-point field goal percentage, the seventh-most assists, and the 19th most points in school history. In 2010, Ricky Harris passed Anderson for the second-most three-pointers in Minutemen history, with 276.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} year, {{one-third of the}} reigning Mexican National Trios Champions was unable to further help defend the title. This year, CMLL resolved the situation differently, but still managed to organize in a tournament. The champions, Mascara Dorada, Stuka Jr., and Metro, successfully defended their championship on November 15, 2010, in Arena Puebla. Dorada suffered an ankle injury {{during the course of}} the match. Citing both the injury (which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out a month) and, more so, the demands of his other three championships, Mascara Dorada vacated his share of the titles three days later. CMLL broke with the precedent of forcing the entire team to vacate the titles and instead declared a web poll would determine a replacement for Mascara Dorada. Voting was held for over two weeks on CMLL.com.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} {{convention}} gathered in April 1880, Randall was confident of victory, but soon {{found that the}} Wallace faction outnumbered his. Wallace's majority scrambled the party's organization in Philadelphia and, although some Randall supporters received seats, the majority owed allegiance to the senator. Despite the defeat, Randall pressed on for Tilden, both in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. As rumors circulated that Tilden's health <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> from running again, Randall remained a loyal Tilden man up to the national convention that June. After the first ballot, the New York delegation released a letter from Tilden in which he withdrew from consideration. Randall hoped for the ex-Tilden delegates to rally to him. Many did so, and Randall surged to second place on the second ballot, but the momentum had shifted to another candidate, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock. Nearly all of the delegates shifted to Hancock, and he was nominated.|$|E
5|$|Because he owed few favors to the state's {{established}} politicians, many of Brown's top appointees were businesspeople. Keeping {{a campaign}} promise {{to appoint a}} woman and an African-American to his cabinet, Brown named William E. McAnulty Jr., and Jacqueline Swigart to his cabinet. McAnulty resigned his post {{as secretary of the}} state's Department of Justice within one month, saying the position <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> from spending enough time with his family. Brown re-appointed McAnulty to his former position as a judge with the Jefferson County District Court and replaced him with another African-American, George W. Wilson. He also appointed Viola Davis Brown as Executive Director of the Office of Public Health Nursing – in 1980, she was the first African-American nurse to lead a state office of public health nursing in the U.S. His most controversial appointment was Frank Metts, his secretary of transportation. Metts broke with political tradition in Kentucky, announcing that contracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bids and performance rather than political patronage. Despite cutting personnel from the department, Metts doubled the miles of road that were resurfaced.|$|E
5|$|Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was {{an extreme}} aristocrat. Caesar {{submitted}} {{the laws that}} he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated {{the election of the}} former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had testified against him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.|$|E

5|$|Carrick {{made his}} West Ham {{breakthrough}} in the 2000–01 season, playing 41 games in all competitions, which included 33 games in the league. His only goal of the season came in a 1–1 home draw against Aston Villa on 9 December 2000. Carrick was awarded a new, improved contract for his progress that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> at Upton Park until 2005. On 20 April 2001, he was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year alongside teammate Joe Cole. The award was eventually won by Liverpool's midfielder Steven Gerrard on 29 April. For the second successive season Carrick was voted as West Ham's Young Player of the Year. The 2001–02 season saw Carrick make 32 appearances for the Hammers. Carrick scored twice during this season, his first was West Ham's only goal in a 7–1 loss at Blackburn Rovers on 14 October. He scored the first goal in a 2–1 victory over rivals Chelsea ten days later. Towards {{the end of the}} season, Carrick suffered a recurrence of a groin injury that ruled him out of the 2002 FIFA World Cup for the England squad.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on during}} the 2010–11 season, Evra was {{hampered}} by constant inquiries about {{what happened at the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup from the French Football Federation (FFF), the French media, as well as the French government. Evra's contract with Manchester United was also {{up at the end of}} the 2011–12 season, which led to the player being linked with a move to Real Madrid. Evra's hearing with the FFF in Paris, which he attended, was held the day after the team's opening 3–0 league win over Newcastle United. Evra played over 85 minutes in the match. On 20 November, Evra scored his second Premier League goal in a 2–0 win at home against Wigan Athletic. On 21 February 2011, after weeks of negotiations, Evra signed a contract extension with Manchester United that <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> with the club until at least the end of the 2013–14 season. Two days after signing his contract extension, Evra participated in United's 0–0 draw with Marseille in the first leg of the team's first knockout round tie in the Champions League. The match, played at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, was Evra's first match played in France since the 2010 World Cup debacle. As a consequence, he was subjected to a barrage of jeers and boos every time he touched the ball.|$|E
5|$|He left Vale Park on a free {{transfer}} in June 1993 and {{turned down a}} move to Cyprus outfit AC Omonia to return to former club Hartlepool United. Injury meant he did not play {{for the man who}} signed him, Viv Busby, and instead he made his second debut for the club under John MacPhail. Houchen went on to score eight goals in 37 games as Hartlepool were relegated into the bottom tier of the Football League in 1993–94, finishing a massive 17 points behind Blackpool, who were one point above the relegation zone. MacPhail was quickly sacked and replaced by David McCreery; MacPhail blamed the fact that the club was sometimes unable to pay the player's wages as a reason for poor results on the field. Houchen was a coach at the club, but quickly fell out with temporary 'advisory coach' Sandy Clark. Houchen scored a hat-trick against Bury, though was later sent off in the match for allegedly swearing at referee Kevin Lynch; {{at the time of the}} incident Houchen was receiving treatment for knee ligament damage which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out of action for six weeks. McCreery resigned on 20 April 1995, and chairman Harold Hornsey appointed Houchen as his replacement; he became the 23rd manager at the club in 38 years. He appointed his former boss Billy Horner as youth team coach and also employed Brian Honour and Mick Tait. His first game in charge was a 4–0 home win over Hereford United, and a 3–0 defeat at Preston North End and a final day 3–2 victory over Mansfield Town ensured Hartlepool an 18th-place finish. As a player, he was the club's top scorer with 14 goals in 39 appearances in 1994–95, and was voted Player of the Year by the club's supporters.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} season ended Head coach Rich Kotite was fired. There was rumors that the Eagles new owner, Jeffrey Lurie <b>would</b> not <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> on as coach.

5|$|Torres made a scoring {{start to}} the 2008–09 Premier League season with a 25-yard shot into the bottom {{right-hand}} corner away at Sunderland, which was the only goal in a 1–0 win on 16 August 2008. He suffered a hamstring tear in a 0–0 draw against Aston Villa, which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> out {{for two to three}} weeks. Torres made his return in a 2–1 victory against Marseille in the Champions League and went on to score two goals in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 27 September 2008 to give Liverpool a 2–0 win. He followed this up with another two goals the following weekend against Manchester City in a 3–2 win away at the City of Manchester Stadium as Liverpool came back from a two-goal deficit. The first of these was the thousandth Liverpool goal to be scored in the Premier League. Torres picked up a hamstring injury during a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier, meaning he was likely to miss three games for Liverpool. On 22 October 2008, Liverpool played Torres' former club Atlético in the Champions League at the Vicente Calderón Stadium, but his injury meant he missed out on the game. Atlético president Enrique Cerezo had given him a VIP invitation to watch the game, but he declined this to continue his rehabilitation from injury in Merseyside. He was named in the FIFPro World XI team for the 2007–08 season on 27 October 2008.|$|E
25|$|On September 28, 2009, Orlando {{extended}} the contract of head coach Stan Van Gundy by exercising his {{option for the}} 2010–11 season. They did the same for General Manager Otis Smith, which <b>would</b> <b>keep</b> <b>him</b> in that position through the 2011–12 season.|$|E
