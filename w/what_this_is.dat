According to the gardaí, at one point during the interview, Lyons burst out crying and said that he had killed the two women. Lyons claimed that he was suffering withdrawal symptoms at the time and that he made the admission so that he could get more drugs.

The gardaí say that he was told that he was not under arrest and that he could leave at any time. As a result of his confession, Dean Lyons was arrested on suspicion of murdering the two women at 13:46 on 26 July 1997.|$|E

[...] Bakshi responded, [...] "You could pick a still out of Lady and the Tramp and get the same impression. Fritz the Cat wasn't pornography. It was social commentary. This all smacks of burning books and the Third Reich. It smacks of McCarthyism. I'm {{not going to get into}} who sniffs <b>what.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> lunacy!" [...] On CBS's order, Klein removed the sequence from the master broadcast footage. Wildmon claimed that the edits were [...] "a de facto admission that, indeed, Mighty Mouse was snorting cocaine".

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things has anything to do with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E
500|$|Wrapped in Red {{was first}} {{released}} internationally on October 25, 2013 by RCA Records through Sony Music Entertainment. It then received a North American release on October 29, 2013 by RCA {{as part of}} its holiday promotional campaign with the soundtracks to the feature films Black Nativity and The Best Man Holiday, with Wrapped in Red being promulgated as the one that will transcend formats and become a new holiday classic. In an interview with Billboard, RCA marketing executive Aaron Borns remarked that the album was their main release of the holidays, quoting: [...] "The angle on this album is that, like all great Christmas records, it's about amazing vocal performances. That's <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> intended to be - an album launched this year but timeless and genre-defying." [...] In preparation for its release in the United States, RCA shipped a half-million units on Amazon.com and Target, which exclusively released a deluxe edition. A red LP pressing of Wrapped in Red by United Record Pressing followed the CD release on November 25, 2013, marking the first time an album by Clarkson was released on a vinyl record. A deluxe LP and CD edition was also released on the Sony Music store, which included a scarf, a holiday ornament and a snow globe, all of which were decorated in red as inspired from the album. An international promotion campaign was also planned for Clarkson, but was later halted due to her pregnancy. On October 21, 2014, Wrapped in Red was reissued by RCA with a special edition CD+DVD release exclusive to Walmart stores in the United States. A green LP pressing of the album would also be issued with a limited 500-copy release on December 9, 2014.|$|E

500|$|Goddard {{compared}} the romance between Lily and Cane to Lady Chatterley's Lover since both characters grew and {{learned from the}} relationship. Cane developed an attraction to Heather Stevens (portrayed by Vail Bloom) while with Lily; Goddard noted it would [...] "come down to what Cane needs" [...] when choosing between the two women. The storylines written for the lovers included a controversy with the characters' age gap, a miscarriage, and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Within the love rectangle story, Chloe tricks Cane into thinking they conceived a child together. To make the storyline work, the writers scripted Cane as less intelligent, a strategy they used previously during his storyline with Amber. To keep the character from looking bad, Goddard said he made acting choices to justify Cane's actions. Despite the lessening of the character's intelligence, Goddard said he liked the story because of the originality of the plot. Love triangles and questioned paternity happen regularly in soap operas, but he felt that former head writer Maria Arena Bell managed to make those conventions fresh and new. Khalil stated that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline, also saying she loved the actors involved in it. Khalil said she thought it [...] "was a possibility" [...] for Lily and Cane to have a happy ending, and that Lily [...] "can see the hope, and they can adapt and love {{each other in a}} more mature and honest way". Cane married Lily in 2009, and the following year, Global BC called Lily the love of Cane's life. In 2011, Lily divorced Cane after he continued to lie to her about his faked death. However, she eventually discovered Cane was trying to protect her, and they were remarried. Goddard commented that their relationship [...] "had come full circle" [...] and [...] "was being done well". Of Cane and Lily's second wedding, Goddard stated that Cane and Lily have [...] "certainly had a lot of ups and downs", but he thought through all of that their fans [...] "stayed true and they have expressed their desire for what they want to see". Goddard also thought their wedding of [...] "this caliber" [...] would make their fans [...] "very, very happy and that is <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> about".|$|E
