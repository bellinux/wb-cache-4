5|$|That night Morgan's men camped at Frakes' Mill {{just north}} of Mauckport. They found the area deserted, as all the civilians had fled their homes. In the house where Morgan stayed, the table was set with supper which {{he and his men}} ate before resting for the night. Morgan's men tapped the {{telegraph}} lines again and began sending false reports that they <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> New Albany. The disinformation dissuaded New Albany's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing. The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward. As they passed up a county road, a shot was fired killing a soldier. The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come, killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son.|$|E
5|$|Din's attendant, Impa, tells Link {{that they}} <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Hyrule; she instructs {{him to see}} the Maku Tree in Horon Village, the capital of Holodrum. Link finds a sword in a cave and makes his way to the tree. The Maku Tree tells Link he will need the eight Essences of Nature and gives him the Gnarled Key, which unlocks the dungeon holding the first Essence. Link {{retrieves}} the eight Essences, hidden in eight dungeons throughout Holodrum and Subrosia, and brings them to the Maku Tree. The Maku Tree uses them to create a Huge Maku Seed, a sacred seed that cleanses evil, which allows Link to enter Onox's castle. Link enters the castle, defeats Onox, and rescues Din, who tells him that he is now a true hero and must face a new trial soon. Twinrova, watching the scene remotely, states that the Flame of Destruction has been powered by the havoc Onox has wrought.|$|E
5|$|The vessel, the 800-ton Portuguese carrack Santa Cruz, was {{pursued by}} three of Cumberland's ships. A storm arrived {{and forced the}} English away from the lee shore, but Santa Cruz was beached {{on the coast of}} Corvo. The {{following}} morning, once the storm had passed, the Portuguese who had disembarked set up entrenchments nearby, taking off the cargo and burning the vessel. Burrough immediately dispatched 100 soldiers who waded ashore and easily dispersed those who guarded the shore; after some resistance the site was captured, and the Portuguese fled. The cargo burnt inside the ship although some was salvaged by the English. Prisoners were taken, including the ship's purser and two foreign gunners. Under threat of torture they confessed that within fifteen days, three other carracks would arrive at the island. The fleet of five carracks had departed from Goa and <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Lisbon and consisted of the Santa Cruz, Buen Jesus admiral, Madre de Deus, San Bernardo, and San Christophoro. Madre de Deus was the largest of the fleet, a thirty-two gun vessel of 1,600 tons {{and was one of the}} Portuguese crown's greatest and one of the largest sailing ships ever built.|$|E

5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street whether or not they <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians {{as a result of his}} evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E
25|$|After having {{swept the}} Wave, the Drillers <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> St. Louis {{to face the}} Ambush {{in the second round}} for another best-of-three series. In game one, April 12, 1997, the Drillers had the heavily favoured Ambush on the ropes, but with 1:51 {{remaining}} in the game, Joe Reiniger hammered home a three-point goal and handing a heartbreaking 19–18 loss to the Drillers.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November 2008, {{another group}} of militants {{attacked}} two convoys at the Khyber Pass capturing 13 trucks which <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Afghanistan.

The second was intended for NATO troops {{and one of the}} captured trucks was carrying with it two U.S. military Humvees, which were also seized.|$|E

25|$|The British {{already knew}} that the German fleet had sailed at midday. More {{information}} arrived at 20:15, when an intercepted wireless message gave {{the information that they}} <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Yarmouth. At 15:50, the British fleet had been placed on two hours readiness and at 19:05 were ordered to sail south from Scapa Flow. Around midnight, the Harwich Force (Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt) of three light cruisers and 18destroyers was ordered to move north.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} morning the West Indians followed-on and were quickly 57/4. Bertie Harragin and Harold Austin then added 90 in 65 minutes. Harragin's innings of 57 lasted 75 minutes. The {{tourists}} <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> an innings defeat but a ninth wicket stand of 48 in 30 minutes between Lebrun Constantine and Tommie Burton {{enabled them to}} set a target of 47. In the match 5 of the West Indian batsmen were run out. The match ended a day early.|$|E
25|$|Several {{residents}} had seen Fannin march from Goliad and sent messengers to Bexar to inform Santa Anna that Fannin and 300men <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Alamo. Santa Anna ordered Colonel Juan Almonte and 800dragoons to intercept the Texian relief force. Unaware of Fannin's attempted relief mission, Travis sent James Bonham to Goliad to persuade him. Bonham {{was asked to}} tie a white handkerchief around his hat when he returned so that the Texians would know to open the gates for him.|$|E

25|$|In mid-October, the Royal Lao Army's 12th Brigade and 13th Brigades were helilifted into Operation Tulah (Operation October). The six battalions {{were moved}} from Vang Vieng onto the Plain of Jars. They were landed at two {{helicopter}} landing zones 13 kilometers {{southwest of the}} Communist-held forward fighter base at Muang Soui. One Royalist column moved toward Xieng Dat. A second column slowly patrolled back westwards along Route 7; they <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the Royalist-held intersection of Routes 7 and 13 at Sala Phou Khoun. Operation Tulah ended on 25 October, after the Royalist regulars were unable to dislodge the Pathet Lao Hmong Communists from Xieng Dat.|$|E
25|$|Curiously, around half of {{the protein}} {{products}} of transferred genes aren't even targeted back to the chloroplast. Many became exaptations, taking on new functions like participating in cell division, protein routing, and even disease resistance. A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes, though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion. Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway though {{it should be noted}} that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host's cell membrane, and therefore topologically outside of the cell, because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol, you have to cross the cell membrane, just like if you <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> the extracellular space. In those cases, chloroplast-targeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway.|$|E
25|$|Upon the squadron's {{arrival in}} Brisbane, its {{aircraft}} {{had not yet}} arrived. The ground crews were pressed into service as ground crews for the 19th Bombardment Group's B-17F Flying Fortresses. Since the 3d Bomb Group had no aircraft available and since additional training was necessary, it did not begin operations immediately. On 6 March, the Squadron moved to Charters Towers, where an airfield and a camp were hurriedly built (Breddan Airfield) while the air crews trained with their A-24 dive bombers. On 31 March, the air echelon flew north to Port Moresby, New Guinea and the 8th was again at war. On 1 April 1942 the 3d Bomb Group flew their first combat mission of World War II. Six A-24's <b>were</b> <b>headed</b> <b>for</b> Japanese Lae Airfield in Eastern New Guinea. Lae was socked in by weather so they diverted to Salamaua and attacked Japanese forces occupying the town. They dropped 5 bombs in their first combat mission since November 1918.|$|E
