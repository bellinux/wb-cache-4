2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{sentencing}} inside the courtroom, news channel Tv2 recorded Kristiansen reaction {{while he had}} a {{grin on his face}} while chewing chewing-gum. They later aired the video-tape during the evening news, after Kristiansens lawyer told the media that Kristiansen had been [...] "absolutely devastated" [...] by the verdict. In a 2008 interview, Kristiansen explained his reaction, saying that he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> the mere [...] "absurdity of the situation", he also accused the media of using the clip to portray him as a [...] "cold-blooded monster without emotions". This incident sparked a long legal conflict between Tv2 and the court, due to a law, banning recording of defendants inside court-rooms. Tv2 was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century, {{witnesses}} have {{claimed to have}} seen the ghost of Dolley Madison rocking in {{a chair in the}} space where the porch {{on the west side of}} the house used to <b>be,</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> passersby.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{mean the}} spirit now {{standing}} behind you led me here. She says {{her name is}} Margaret Bartol. She said: 'Comfort my dear husband. Restore his faith.' She <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> me. She wants me to go on." ...|$|R

6000|$|Rollo {{perceived}} that Mr. George <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> his very unromantic mode of describing a tournament. [...] "Is not {{that what they}} used to do at the tournaments?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do wish," [...] {{he said to}} Ralph, who <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> his rueful face, [...] "that {{you could}} for today take my place, and let me pass as lieutenant." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was staring}} {{straight}} at his mother's lips at the moment, {{and yet he}} was unable to detect any visible part in the production of the voice. She explained the whisper. [...] "Altair <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> you. She says she will be with us to-night." ...|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> a <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> this, for all {{the boys}} knew what it meant.|$|R
6000|$|Mirah had <b>been</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> the swiftly-made image, and {{she smiled}} still, but {{with a touch of}} {{something}} else than amusement, as she said--"Thank you. But you have never done anything I did not like. I hardly think he could, belonging to you," [...] she added, looking at Mrs. Meyrick.|$|R
60|$|He turned quickly around. She <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> {{him most}} alluringly. Unconsciously {{he found himself}} smiling back again. A {{wonderful}} light-heartedness seemed to have come to him {{during the last few}} hours.|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> me," [...] said Mr. Kidd, in {{a tender}} voice. [...] "'Bob,' he ses, 'go and tell my pore missis that I'm alive,' he ses; 'break it to 'er gentle.'" ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} Polly's welcome was uttered, she had got Fan {{on the little}} sofa beside her, and <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> her in such an {{infectious}} manner, that Fan could n't help smiling back.|$|E
6000|$|... "All and everything! did I say all and everything? Really, my Lord, you scan my {{expressions}} so critically! but I {{see your}} Lordship <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> my boyish nonsense! and really I feel that I have already wasted {{too much of}} your Lordship's valuable time, and displayed too much of my own ignorance." ...|$|R
50|$|Following his performance, Keith meets up with Sophie. They load {{their things}} {{in the car and}} <b>are</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> each other in happiness.

60|$|His {{heart began}} to beat with sudden, feverish throbs. His eyes searched her face hungrily. She seemed in earnest. Her lips had lost even their usual, faintly contemptuous curl. If anything, she <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Westgate, {{more and}} more exhilarated by her scheme, <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> her again. [...] "If I could only believe it was safe!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "When you begin to pity him, I, on my side, am afraid." ...|$|E
60|$|Blanca knew {{quite well}} that he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> this {{distinction}} between ladies and other women, and understood that he was smiling, not so much at her, but at himself, for secretly agreeing with the distinction she had made.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of Floyd Stovall posing by a fireplace. In {{the image}} Stovall <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> the camera {{with one hand}} {{on the back of a}} chair while his other hand holds a cigarette.

60|$|The first {{practical}} {{proposal was}} Mrs. Lee's. They thought of reversing the present position, {{and taking a}} small house where their present hosts might become their lodgers. Moreover, Miss Mohun clenched the affair about Theodore, and overcame Alexis's scruples, while Lady Merrifield, having once or twice looked in, and <b>been</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> and thanked by Kalliope, undertook to prepare her for his farewell.|$|R
60|$|Next {{day about}} noon, when both wind and heat were high, Lucy was awakened from a doze. Creech was {{standing}} near her. When {{he turned his}} long gaze away from the canyon he <b>was</b> <b>smiling.</b> It <b>was</b> a <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> once triumphant and sad.|$|R
6000|$|This greeting, drawled with an inimitable vocal caress {{in every}} syllable, close in her ear, caused Edna {{to give a}} startled little jump. A smooth-faced, moon-faced young man <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> her good-naturedly. His [...] "make-up" [...] was plainly that of the stock tramp of the stage, though the {{inevitable}} whiskers were lacking.|$|E
60|$|The ladies {{had left}} {{the room and the}} port was circulating. Mr. Scogan filled his glass, passed on the decanter, and, leaning back in his chair, looked about him for a moment in silence. The {{conversation}} rippled idly round him, but he disregarded it; he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> some private joke. Gombauld noticed his smile.|$|E
60|$|Alice Deringham turned aside with a just {{perceptible}} {{gesture of}} impatience, which Seaforth noticed and fancied he understood, {{though it was}} not apparent to the others, and while she rode on with him, Alton appeared thoughtful as he did something to his bridle. When he had finished it he saw that his companion <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|E
5000|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{was also}} filmed. The jury re-enters the courtroom. When Kramer claims {{that a woman}} on the jury <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> them, Jerry tells him that she's <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> them because they might go to prison. When it comes to the verdict, the forewoman of the jury states that the jury finds Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer not guilty of criminal indifference which disappoints the testifiers and leaves Judge Vandelay speechless. This ending can be found as an Easter egg on the [...] "Seinfeld" [...] season 9 DVD set.|$|R
60|$|Merytra, who <b>was</b> vain, <b>smiled</b> <b>at</b> this artful flattery, although, in truth, it {{was well}} deserved, for {{at an age when}} many Egyptians are old, she {{remained}} fresh and fair.|$|R

60|$|He {{closed the}} door behind them, and, while Mr. Vyner stood gazing moodily at the mound on the table which {{appeared}} to have been hastily covered up with a rather soiled towel, placed a couple of easy chairs by the fire. Mr. Vyner, with his eyes still on the table, took his seat slowly, and then transferring his regards to Captain Trimblett, asked him in a stern vein what he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> Joan for.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad {{to second}} that," [...] he announced. [...] "We were easy with the opium gang when they began. It was {{pleasant}} {{to get a}} roll of bills now and then for just leaving a team handy and saying nothing if we found a case in the stable; but we didn't see where that led." [...] He stopped and turned to Mr. Barclay, who <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> him. [...] "What'd you say, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless him, no," [...] said Victoria, poking {{her finger}} into a dimple--for he <b>was</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> her. [...] "What if he does?" [...] and {{forthwith}} she seized {{him in her}} arms and bore him to the porch, amidst the laughter of those who beheld her, and sat him down on her knee in front of the lemonade bowl, the tired mother beside her. [...] "Will a little lemonade hurt him? Just a very, very little, you know?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder if}} there ever will be a {{portrait}} of Henrietta Armine. Come now, my dear Glastonbury,' he continued, {{with an air of}} remarkable excitement, 'let us have a wager upon it. What are the odds? Will there ever be a portrait of Henrietta Armine? I am quite fantastic to-day. You <b>are</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> me. Now do you know, if I had a wish certain to be gratified, it should be to add a portrait of Henrietta Armine to our gallery?' ...|$|R

When Kramer {{claims that}} {{a woman on the}} jury <b>is</b> <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> them, Jerry tells him that she's <b>smiling</b> <b>at</b> them because they might go to prison. Everyone rises when Judge Vandelay enters the courtroom. When it comes to the verdict, the forewoman of the jury (Myra Turley) states that the jury finds Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer guilty of {{criminal}} indifference. Mr. and Mrs. Ross and the testifiers are pleased with the verdict, Estelle faints, and Newman has a brief choking moment from laughing while eating food. Judge Vandelay breaks up the commotion by threatening to clear the courtroom if they didn't stop.|$|R
