5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
2500|$|Kenny Perry, {{another player}} who found success at a late age is {{good friends with}} Singh, who calls him [...] "Biggie". Of Singh, Perry said [...] "Vijay has always been good to me. <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> lot. He {{wants to know how}} my family is doing. I think the world of him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little stiffly--they were evidently {{surprised}} by my sudden apparition, dusty, fatigued, and white faced; but Nettie did not remain {{to keep the}} conversation going.|$|R
6000|$|Jolly frowned. [...] "Of course, {{my first}} year <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> good bit about that sort of thing. But {{in the second year}} one gives it up; I don't know why--it's awfully interesting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a cruel mother!" [...] I said, and {{she laughed}} merrily, and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little longer, and then seeing her about to go, I said, [...] "you must be just seven years old." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1999 Swedish film , Floberg {{played the}} role of Claes, one of two {{fishermen}} who rescues Polish Irena, played by Izabella Scorupco, from the water. The two fishermen later gets in trouble, as it turns out that Irena is being chased by members of the russian mafia. This was the fifth time Floberg played in a film directed by Erik Gustavson, who praised him: [...] " [...] is my Robert De Niro. Our fifth film together. It has always gone well". Floberg, on the other hand, dryly commented: [...] "Yes, I got a phone call [...] this time too". In an interview with Verdens Gang, he elaborated on his relationship with Gustavson: [...] "We have a really good understanding. <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> lot in codes, and save a lot of time. Besides, I really like the way Erik works". Floberg also expressed his satisfaction with playing a [...] "good guy" [...] for once, humorously acknowledging that he is probably considered Norway's [...] "number one movie-psycho". Co-star Scorupco, on the other hand, characterized Floberg as charming, and [...] "easy to fall in love with". In Misery Harbour, a Scandinavian/Canadian collaboration from the same year, Floberg returned to playing a negative character. He received critical acclaim for his depiction of the arrogant literary critic Johan Hoeg, being described as [...] "brilliant", and [...] "taking on the role (...) with razor-sharp spitefulness".|$|E
6000|$|His request seemed still {{something}} of a shock to the poor old lady's candour. [...] "Well, I see her very often, and <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> great deal. And then--won't Verena tell her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> lot of nonsense," [...] said Katharine, hiding her slip {{of paper}} as her mother stood by her, and {{spreading}} the old letter about Shelley in front of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! I {{am going}} to tell you," [...] replied Caddy, {{crossing}} her hands confidentially upon my arm. [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> good deal about it, and so I said to Prince, 'Prince, as Miss Summerson--'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Wasn't that nice? <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal}} together. He is as winning {{as his own}} face. But he wouldn't sign that {{photograph}} for Clara. [...] "That? No! She shall have a better one. I will send it to you." ...|$|R
60|$|June, 1.--Proofs and Court, the {{inevitable}} employment of the day. Louisa Kerr dined with us, and Williams looked in. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> good deal on Celtic witchery and fairy lore. I {{was glad to}} renew my acquaintance with this able and learned man.|$|R
6000|$|Sentiments beyond speech surged up in Turnbull and silenced {{him for a}} space {{just long}} enough to be painful. Then he said with his old gaiety: [...] "I vote <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> little first; I don't want to murder the first man I have met for ten million years." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{so it is}} {{with the}} workman of art. Art is long and life is short, and success is very far off. And thus, {{doubtful}} of strength to travel so far, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> little about the aim--the aim of art, which, like life itself, is inspiring, difficult--obscured by mists. It is not in the clear logic of a triumphant conclusion; it is not in the unveiling of one of those heartless secrets which are called the Laws of Nature. It is not less great, but only more difficult.|$|E
6000|$|He comes {{every day}} to paint and <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> great deal and he [...] reads me lovely things out of his books. I don't {{understand}} [...] them all, but I try to, and he explains them so nicely and is [...] so patient with my stupidity. And he says any one with my [...] eyes and hair and coloring {{does not need to}} be clever. He [...] says I have the sweetest, merriest laugh in the world. But I [...] will not write down all the compliments he has paid me. I [...] dare say he does not mean them at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Vicomte, you exaggerate. If {{you were}} to count it up, I am sure you would find that <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>an</b> hour at least, altogether. And then, {{although}} I am very young and inexperienced, I can imagine how many conquests you have made by the same arts." ...|$|R
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> for <b>a</b> while of Italy. They had a pained {{tenderness}} for it, sad, reserved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{positions}} have changed, Master Leigh, {{since last}} <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> in <b>a</b> ship's cabin," [...] was the renegade's inscrutable greeting.|$|R
60|$|The second vicious {{condition}} is positive and not negative. I mean the gross, and, I sometimes fear, increasing evil of casual labour. <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal about}} the unemployed, but the evil of the under-employed is the tap-root of unemployment. There is a tendency in many trades, almost in all trades, to have a fringe of casual labour on hand, available as a surplus whenever there is a boom, flung back into the pool whenever there is a slump. Employers and foremen in many trades are drawn consciously or unconsciously to distribute their work among a larger number of men than they regularly require, because this obviously increases their bargaining power with them, and supplies a convenient reserve for periods of brisk business activity.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{have not}} seen him," [...] said Anna; [...] "but he was at Diplow before my cousin was married, and I have heard my aunt {{speaking}} of him to papa. She said what you have been saying about him--only not so much: I mean, about Mr. Deronda living with Sir Hugo Mallinger, and being so nice, she thought. <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> great deal about every one who comes near Pennicote, {{because it is so}} seldom there is any one new. But I remember, when I asked Gwendolen what she thought of Mr. Deronda, she said, 'Don't mention it, Anna: but I think his hair is dark.' That was her droll way of answering: she was always so lively. It is really rather wonderful that I should come to hear so much about him, all through Mr. Hans knowing Rex, and then my having the pleasure of knowing you," [...] Anna ended, looking at Mrs. Meyrick with a shy grace.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> {{while about}} the Colonel's voyage home, {{the pleasures of}} the Spanish journey, the {{handsome}} new quarters in which Clive has installed his father and himself, my own altered condition in life, and what not. During the conversation a little querulous voice makes itself audible above-stairs, at which noise Mr. Clive begins to laugh, and the Colonel to smile. It is {{for the first time in}} his life Mr. Clive listens to the little voice; indeed, it is only since about six weeks that that small organ has been heard in the world at all. Laura Pendennis believes its tunes to be the sweetest, the most interesting, the most mirth-inspiring, the most pitiful and pathetic, that ever baby uttered; which opinions, of course, are backed by Mrs. Hokey, the confidential nurse. Laura's husband is not so rapturous; but, let us trust, behaves in a way becoming a man and a father. We forgo the description of his feelings as not pertaining to the history at present under consideration. A little while before the dinner is served, the lady of the cottage comes down to greet her husband's old friends.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> {{little on}} {{indifferent}} matters, while I pricked my fingers helping to pluck the roses. She {{asked me if}} I thought that Anscombe was getting on well, {{and how long it}} would be before he could travel. I replied that Dr. Rodd could tell her better than myself, but that I hoped in about a week.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she gave}} me her hand to kiss and glided away. I {{returned}} to the others and we ate, somewhat sparingly, for we wished to save our food in case of need, and having drunk of the Life-water, were not hungry. Also <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> little, but by common consent avoided {{the subject of the}} morrow and what it might bring forth.|$|R
2500|$|Mathematicians {{extend the}} idiom {{discussed}} earlier to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, when <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> about <b>a</b> recurring decimal, as in ...|$|R
6000|$|Therefore a {{difference}} in words is {{a difference}} in the things which those words mean, and {{there is a difference between}} religion and godliness; and we shew it by our words. Now these are religious times, but they are very ungodly times; and we shew that also by our words. Because we think that people ought to be religious, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> great deal about religion; because we hardly think at all that a man ought to be godly, we talk very little about God, and that good old Bible word [...] "godliness" [...] does not pass our lips once a-month. For a man may be very religious, my friends, and yet very ungodly. The heathens were very religious at the very time that, as St. Paul tells us, they would not keep God in their knowledge. The Jews were the most religious people on the earth, they hardly talked or thought about anything but religion, at the very time that they knew so little of God that they crucified Him when He came down among them. St. Paul says that he was living after the strictest sect of the Jews' religion, at the very time that he was fighting against God, persecuting God's people and God's Son, and dead in trespasses and sins. These are ugly facts, my friends, but they are true, and well worth our laying to heart in these religious, ungodly days. I am afraid if Jesus Christ came down into England this day as a carpenter's son, He would get--a better hearing, perhaps, than the Jews gave him, but still a very bad hearing--one dare hardly think of it.|$|E
6000|$|The country, after quitting {{the valley}} of Aix,[24] became flat and monotonous, {{and it was in}} the midst of a vast level {{district}} that we found the town of Juliers, the capital of the ancient duchy, buried behind grassy ramparts, that were scarcely visible until we were actually passing them. It is a tame and insignificant place, at present. At Berghem, a post or two further, I had another visit from the postmaster and his clerk, who made no scruple in asking me if I was the man who wrote books! <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> great deal of our national intelligence in America, and certainly with truth, when we compare ourselves with these people in many important particulars; but blocks are not colder, or can have less real reverence for letters, arts, or indeed cultivation of any kind, than the great bulk of the American people. There are a few among us who pretend to work themselves up into enthusiasm as respects the first, more especially if they can get a foreign name to idolize; but it is apparent, at a glance, that it is not enthusiasm of the pure water. For this, Germany is the land of sensations, whether music, poetry, arms, or the more material arts be their object. As for myself, I can boast of little in this way, beyond the homage of my two postmasters, which perhaps was more than properly fell to my share; but I shall never forget the feeling displayed by a young German, at Dresden, whom chance threw in my way. We had lodgings in a house directly opposite the one inhabited by Tieck, the celebrated novelist and dramatist. Having no proper means of introduction to this gentleman, and unwilling to obtrude myself anywhere, I never made his acquaintance, but it was impossible not to know, in so small a town, where so great a celebrity lived. Next door to us was a Swiss confectioner, with whom I occasionally took an ice. One day a young man entered for a similar purpose, and left the room with myself. At the door he inquired if I could tell him in which of the neighbouring hotels M. Tieck resided, I showed him the house and paused a moment to watch his manner, which was entirely free from pretension, but which preserved an indescribable expression of reverence. [...] "Was it possible to get a glimpse of the person of M. Tieck?" [...] "I feared not; some one had told me that he was gone to a watering-place." [...] "Could I tell him which was the window of his room?" [...] This I was able to do, as he had been pointed out to me at it a few days before. I left him gazing at the window, and it was near an hour before this quiet exhibition of heartfelt homage ceased by the departure of the young man. In my own case, I half suspect that my two postmasters expected to see a man of less European countenance than the one I happen to travel with.|$|E

I was in the corridor waiting for the announcement of my results and I see Shelley Page, the European representative of Dreamworks Animation. She walks up to me and gives me her business card and tells me she'll call me tomorrow. I was surprised and happy at the same time, but I did not know what was going on...We then enter the room to receive our end-of-year notes...and I learn that I am top of the class...All of a sudden I understand why Shelley Page gave me her card...The next morning, she called me and gave me an appointment in a Parisian restaurant. When I join her, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> little and she tells me that the studio would like to hire me. It was quite magical and I had the feeling that my dream came true." [...] After a ten month process, Staphylas was able to obtain a work visa and came to the United States.|$|E
