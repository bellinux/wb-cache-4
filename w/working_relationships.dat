5|$|Modern {{commentators}} consider Staunton's {{understanding of}} positional play {{to have been}} far ahead of his contemporaries'. Although not an all-out attacking player, he attacked when his preparations were complete. His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom, and his Chess-Player's Handbook (1847) was a reference for decades. The chess openings the English Opening and Staunton Gambit were named for his advocacy of them. Staunton has been a controversial figure since his own time, and his chess writings could be spiteful. On the other hand, he maintained good <b>working</b> <b>relationships</b> with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts, and demonstrated excellent management skills.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{largely the}} {{fighting}} went {{in favour of}} the Allies, and finally the Japanese assault ground to a halt. Despite forcing a contraction of the Australian forces defending the beachhead, on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove, although the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it. Fierce resistance from the 2/28th halted them and eventually the attack was called off on 24 October, with the Japanese having suffered heavily due to tactical deficiencies, poor co-ordination and operational security, {{and a lack of}} artillery. Meanwhile, the Allied response was hampered by poor <b>working</b> <b>relationships</b> at some of the highest levels between Australian and US commanders– particularly between I Corps commander Lieutenant General Edmund Herring and the VII Amphibious Force commander Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey– the lack of a unified command structure, over cautiousness amongst naval staff, and a poor appreciation of overall Japanese strength and intentions by the highest level of the Allied command who failed to send reinforcements until it was almost too late. Casualties during the attack amounted to at least 679 Japanese killed with another 821 estimated as wounded, while the Australians lost 49 killed and 179 wounded.|$|E

Abdallah Laroui summarizes the abiding results under foreign rule (here, by Carthage and by Rome) as: Social (assimilated, nonassimilated, free); Geographical (city, country, desert); Economic (commerce, agriculture, nomadism); and, Linguistic (e.g., Latin, Punico-Berber, Berber).|$|E
50|$|AAA {{developed}} a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2004. Through the relationship, AAA sent the luchadores Juventud Guerrera, Héctor Garza, Abismo Negro, Heavy Metal, and Mr. Águila to TNA {{to compete in}} the America's X-Cup Tournament as a contingent known as Team Mexico. Team Mexico dominated the America's X-Cup Tournament, defeating Team USA in the first round before retaining the Cup against both Team Canada and Team Britain. They eventually lost at the World X-Cup, which saw Team USA defeat Team Canada and Team Mexico in the Ultimate X finals to win the Cup. For multiple reasons TNA and AAA broke off their <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> late in 2004. TNA continued utilizing luchadores, but opted to contract them individually as opposed to working through AAA.In 2006, AAA and TNA worked again for an event in Toreo de Cuatro Caminos, utilizing some of TNA's talent and stage (which includes the tunnel and lasers). After Konnan left TNA in June 2007 any chance of a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> disappeared especially given that Konnan has filed a racial discrimination lawsuit against TNA, later dismissed. Afterwards TNA started a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> with AAA's rival CMLL. However, in February 2010 the companies once again began a <b>working</b> <b>relationship</b> and started exchanging talent.|$|R
