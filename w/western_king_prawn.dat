40|$|The <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penueus Zarisulcutus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} valuable species of crustacean in Australia. The experiment was carried out for 60 days to determine the growth, survival, haemolymph osmolality and organosomatic indices of the western lung prawn (2. 95 f 0. 26 g mean initial weight) reared at 10, 22, 34 and 46 g L of salinities. In addition, haemolymph osmolality and osmoregulatory capacity (OC) of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (5. 37 f 0. 1 g mean initial weight) reared at salinities (10, 22, 34 and 46 g/L) were determined following 7, 14 and 21 minutes of air exposure and compared with the brown tiger prawn (P, esculentus). Mean final weight, total length, carapace length and specific growth rate (SGR) of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> were highest at a salinity of 34 g/L. Moult increments (in weight and total length) of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> were not significantly different (P > 0. 05) when reared at four different salinities. Food conversion ratios were lowest in prawns reared at salinities of 22 and 34 g/L. Survival of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> was highest at a salinity of 22 g/L and lowest at a salinity of 10 g/L. Haemolymph osmolality of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> increased with an increase in salinity and weight. Isosmotic points of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> calculated from regression lines between haemolymph and medium osmolality were 28. 87, 29. 46 and 31. 73 g / L at 0, 20 and 60 days of rearing (accordingly to 2. 95 f 0. 26; 4. 02 f 0. 47; 5. 79 f 0. 64 g body weight), respectively. Tail moisture content of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> decreased with the increase of salinity. After 60 days of rearing, the lowest hepatopancreas moisture content of the prawns was at a salinity of 22 gL. Wet weight and dry weight hepatosomatic indices of the prawns were highest when reared at a salinity of 22 gL. Wet weight and dry weight tail muscle indices of the prawns were highest at a salinity of 34 gL. Isosmotic points of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> were 33. 79; 33. 29; 32. 75 and 33. 10 g/L at 0, 7, 14, and 21 minutes of air exposure, respectively. Isosmotic points of the brown tiger prawn were 30. 89; 31. 89; 32. 09 and 31. 07 g/L at 0, 7, 14, and 21 minutes of air exposure, respectively. Air exposure reduced OC of both the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> and brown tiger prawn. OC of both species at a salinity of 10 giL was reduced significantly after 14 minutes of air exposure. Twenty-one minutes of air exposure did not change OC of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> reared at salinities of 22, 34 and 46 g/L. OC of brown tiger prawn reared at 22 g/L decreased after 21 minutes of air exposure while OC of the brown tiger prawn reared at 46 g/L decreased after 7 minutes of air exposure. The results indicate that both species spent less energy on osmoregulation at 34 gL salinity than at other salinities. The results suggest that the optimum salinity for rearing of western king prawns ranges from 22 g/L to 34 g/L. Salinities of 10 and 46 gL are unsuitable for rearing brown tiger prawns and salinity 10 g/L is unsuitable for rearing western king prawns. Furthermore, a salinity range from 30 g/L to 32 gL is suitable for the culture of brown tiger prawns...|$|E
40|$|Intensive marine {{aquaculture}} may cause negative {{impacts on the}} aquatic environment by causing water pollution, algae bloom and reduction in biodiversity of the surrounding aquatic environment. The nutrient-rich effluents from aquaculture activities contain nitrogen and phosphate which serve as a nutrient source for bivalve, algae and invertebrates. Seaweed and mussels have been integrated with marine species in culture systems to remove the waste from aquaculture farms. The research has explored the nutrient uptake capacities of green seaweed (Ulva lactuca) and blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) integrated with <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus latisulcatus) in the integrated closed recirculating aquaculture systems (IRAS) and has evaluated the nutrient retention of seaweed and animals in the system. One experimental unit of an IRAS consisted of three tanks: a mussel tank, a prawn tank and a waste-collection tank. The mussel tank and the prawn tank were set {{on the top and}} lower tiers of a metal frame; the waste-collection tank was on the floor. Water was pumped from the waste-collection tank to the reservoir tank by a submersible pump, circulated to the prawn tank and then returned to the waste collection tank through gravity. A series of experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions to investigate the water quality; survival, growth of <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> and nutrient budget in the IRAS. The research results proved that the recirculating culture system could maintain acceptable water quality for <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> at stocking densities till 16 prawn m- 2 and at feeding rate of 3. 0 % of wet weight biomass. Increasing the stocking densities results in decreasing the water quality in the culture media, the growth and survival of <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> reared in the recirculating aquaculture system. In contrast, increasing feeding rate did not improved growth and survival rate of <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> but feed utilization efficiency decreased significantly with increasing the feeding rates. Total phosphorus (TP) and orthophosphate (PO 43 -) concentrations increased linearly with increasing the feeding rates of <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn.</b> High percentage of nutrient inputs accumulated into tank bottom at higher stocking densities whereas over 50 % of nutrient inputs were in discharged water at harvest in lower stocking densities. Inclusion green seaweed into <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> culture system improved the water quality in the IRAS. Concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrate (NO 3 -) and PO 43 - in the integrated culture system were lower than those in the monoculture system. Green seaweed effectively removed 24. 02 - 99. 05 % TAN and 13. 80 - 96. 40 % PO 43 - in the culture media. Feed utilization efficiency in integrated culture was significantly enhanced by 24. 90 % nitrogen (N) and 19. 41 % phosphorus (P). Nutrient budget revealed that <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> and green seaweed retained 28. 00 - 31. 90 % and 6. 53 - 29. 71 % N of total nitrogen (TN) inputs at harvest, respectively while P retention was 13. 46 - 14. 63 % and 1. 62 - 13. 50 % of TP inputs, respectively. The rest of total nutrient input was in discharged water and tank sediments. Integrated culture of blue mussel and <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> could improve the water quality in the IRAS though effectively removing of the total bacteria (TB), total suspended solids (TSS) and total nitrogen (TN) in the cultured media. However, concentrations of NO 2 -, NO 3 - and PO 43 - were increased due to the mussel excretion. Growth and survival of <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> were not affected by adding blue mussels into <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> culture in IRAS at stocking rate of 250 mussel m- 2 and 16. 07 prawn m- 2. When stocking rates exceed density of 312. 5 mussel m- 2 and = 21. 36 prawn m- 2, growth and survival of both <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> and blue mussel in the IRAS were declined significantly due to the low water quality and crowded effects in the culture media. Inclusion of blue mussels into <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> culture was enhanced the feed utilization efficiency further up to 10. 63 % N and 4. 89 % P and reduced the nutrient discharged through draining at harvest. N and P contents accumulated in mussel tanks increased linearly with the increasing mussel stocking densities in the IRAS. The results indicate that the use of integrated aquaculture system is a step forward to achieve sustainability in aquaculture...|$|E
40|$|Effluent {{water from}} {{intensive}} prawn aquaculture systems typically {{has a high}} concentration of dissolved nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. A study was conducted for 42 days to investigate the nutrient flow in a system where brown seaweed (Sargassum sp.) was integrated into <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus latisulcatus) culture. Three treatments namely, <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> monoculture (5. 48 ± 0. 29 g), Sargassum sp. monoculture and seaweed/prawn integrated culture were tested for nutrient flow among feed, water and species cultured. The results showed that by integrating seaweed into prawn culture, the concentrations of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN), nitrite–nitrogen (NO 2 −) and nitrate–nitrogen (NO 3 −), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total nitrogen (TN), phosphate (PO 43 −) and total phosphorus (TP) were significantly lower (p 0. 05) from the prawn monoculture. The mean biomass of Sargassum sp. in integrated culture increased at the rate of 3. 16 ± 0. 74 % g day− 1 after 7 days of the study, which was significantly higher than in the monoculture system (5. 70 ± 0. 82 % g day− 1).

Species richness and diversity also decreased towards the outfall. An increase in nutrient content in the water adjacent to the outfall is likely to explain these changes. At distances of 4 and 5 km away, species diversity increased and the abundance of M. latisulcatus decreased, possibly due {{to a change in}} habitat from sand to seagrass. The occurrence of a storm prior to sampling on one occasion masked the effects of pollution and habitat changes.

To achieve simultaneous removal of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite (NO 2 -N) and Chemical oxygen demand (COD), the current density {{had to be}} controlled over 23. 4 A/m 2. Concurrently, finely suspended particles (SS) were effectively separated from wastewater by electroflotation, while the current density was below 25 A/m 2. The retention time had insignificant effect on TAN, NO 2 -N and SS removal. However, the removal efficiency of COD was highly related with the retention time.

40|$|In recent decades, a rapid {{increase}} in fish production from the aquaculture sector has led to {{degradation of the environment}} due to indiscriminate use of chemical additives and veterinary medicines. Consequently, antimicrobial resistance among pathogenic bacteria has increased and environmental problems associated with these chemicals and antibiotics have become a burden for sustainable aquaculture development. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} alter the indiscriminate use of chemicals and antibiotics for the use in aquaculture by replacing these with prebiotics or other harmless substitutes. Different probiotics can confer huge functions and benefits to various hosts through the improvement in survival rates and enhancement of health. However, there is a need for special species-specific prebiotics in a particular culture environment. Customising the species-specific probiotics for prawn culture was performed via several experiments. After the specific prebiotics, Pseudomonas synxantha and P. aeruginosa were isolated and tested from a commercial product, the emphasis was on determining the effectiveness of them on the cultivation of the juveniles’ <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawns,</b> Penaeus latisulcatus. The customisation process began with trialling five inhibition test methods to determine the most effective detection method for the potential probiotic bacteria. P. synxantha and P. aeruginosa showed the highest inhibition against Vibrio spp. isolated from P. latisulcatus and pathogenic Vibrio isolated from other aquatic animals. A series of experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions to investigate the physiological and immune responses of the juvenile P. latisulcatus exposed to the customised probiotics. The research results proved the suitability of these probiotics for the cultivation of P. latisulcatus as they conclusively met all the essential requirements for the appropriate probiotics. The application of these customised probiotics at 10 [superscript] 5 CFU/mL as “water additives” or “feed supplements” improved the specific growth rate, survival and the health of juvenile P. latisulcatus. These customised probiotics showed similar beneficial effects as observed with other commercial prebiotics, Bio-Mos[superscript]® and ß- 1, 3 -D-glucan. The supplementation of these probiotics with the formulated feed was more efficacious and more practical than direct application into the rearing media. The prawns exposed to the combined probiotics were healthier than those exposed to the individual probiotics. In addition, P. aeruginosa was more effective than P. synxantha for improving prawn health. P. latisulcatus were not adversely affected by the customised probiotics, as P. latisulcatus grew well in the presence of a high probiotic density of 10 [superscript] 7 CFU/mL. The application of the probiotics however, reduced the negative effects of the pathogen V. harveyi as the probiotic-fed prawns survived 100 % when they were exposed to V. harveyi at 10 [superscript] 5, 10 [superscript] 7 and 10 [superscript] 3 CFU/mL for 24, 24 and 36 h, respectively. Hence customised probiotics are suggested as an alternative to antibiotic for disease control in prawn aquaculture. The prawn survival was also influenced by the concentrations of the pathogen and duration of the challenge. At a challengeconcentration of 10 [superscript] 3 CFU/mL of V. harveyi, the 100 % survival-hours were shorter (12 h) in the control group (prawns not fed with probiotics) than in the probiotic-fed prawns (36 h). Further, prawns not fed with probiotics died at a faster rate (96 h) than the probiotic-fed prawns (156 h). The prawns died when the exposure to V. harveyi (even at 10 [superscript] 3 CFU/mL) was longer than 36 h. The probiotic-fed prawns could not completely resist the pathogenic effects of the V. harveyi despite the detection of the probiotics in the intestine of the prawns earlier than detection of V. harveyi. It is recommended that these customised probiotics can be used as a substitute to antibiotics in the cultivation of <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawns...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Commercial {{fishing logbook}} {{data from the}} Shark Bay managed prawn fishery in <b>Western</b> Australia provide <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> catch rate data densely {{informed}} and irregularly spaced in both the spatial and temporal domains. Space–time geo-statistical analysis for {{the data from the}} 2001 to 2004 fishing seasons has shown that short term catch rate prediction is possible {{with the use of the}} product-sum covari-ance model and the subsequent kriging estimation process. However the operation of closure lines within the fishery makes it difficult to capture the high catch rate be-haviour in areas as they first open to trawling. One of these regions is the Extended Nursery Area which usually opens in the first week of May. Analysis of the survey trawls from seasons 2001 to 2003 in this region in March and April shows there is a moderate positive correlation between the actual catch rate and the survey catch rate.

40|$|In {{the coastal}} region of central Queensland female red-spot <b>king</b> <b>prawns,</b> P. longistylus, and the <b>western</b> or blue-leg <b>king</b> <b>prawns,</b> P. latisulcatus, had high mean ovary weights and high {{proportions}} of advanced ovary development {{during the winter}} months of July and August of 1985 and 1986. On the basis of insemination, both species began copulating at the size of 26 - 27 mm CL, but P. longistylus matured and spawned at a smaller size than P. latisulcatus. Abundance of P. longistylus was generally three to four times greater than that of P. latisulcatus but the latter was subject to greater variation in abundance. Low mean ovary weight and low proportions of females with advanced ovaries were associated with the maximum mean bottom sea-water temperature (28. 5 ºC) for both species. Population fecundity indices indicated that peaks in yolk or egg production (a) displayed a similar pattern for both species, (b) varied in timing from year to year for both species and (c) were strongly influenced by abundance. Generally, sample estimates of abundance and commercial catch rates (CPUE) showed similar trends.

An experiment was conducted for 28 days to investigate the nitrogen flow where seaweed (Sargassum sp.) was integrated into <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus latisulcatus) culture. Three treatments were used, each consisting of four, 0. 1 m 3 plastic tanks. Treatment 1 and 2 were the monocultures of western king prawns (5. 48 ± 0. 29 g) and seaweed (young seaweed).

40|$|Rapid global {{expansion}} of the aquaculture industry has prompted the need for development of techniques for effective environmental management. In intensive aquaculture, effluents have resulted in environmental degradation of surrounding ecosystems. As a result, wastewater treatment techniques using biological means is growing worldwide. The present research was conducted to investigate the nutrient flows in a system where seaweed Sargassum sp. was integrated into <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus latisulcatus) culture. Three laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the nutrient load discharged from <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> culture and, the capacity of Sargassum sp. to reduce nutrient loads in the integrated culture system. The effects of changes in stocking biomass of prawns and seaweed on the growth rates of both species and nutrient flows in an integrated culture system were also investigated. Prawn and seaweed growth, prawn survival, water quality parameters, nitrogen and phosphorus contents in tissue of prawns, seaweed and feed were analysed. These experiments demonstrated that by integrating seaweed into prawn culture, the concentrations of total ammonium nitrogen (TAN), nitrite-nitrogen (NO[subscript] 2 [superscript]-) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO[subscript] 3 [superscript]-), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total nitrogen (TN), phosphate (PO[subscript] 4 [superscript] 3 [superscript]-) and total phosphorus (TP) were significantly reduced (p ≤ 0. 05) than in the prawn monoculture and remained within non-toxic limits {{for the duration of}} the experiment. Overall, Sargassum sp. removed a greater percentage of DIN (35. 8 - 52. 6 %) and phosphate (5. 62 - 65. 9 %) than other nutrient forms. The mean nutrient uptake rates of Sargassum sp. were 0. 33 - 0. 69 mg g[superscript]-[superscript] 1 dry wt day[superscript]-[superscript] 1 for nitrogen and 0. 13 - 0. 25 mg g[superscript]-[superscript] 1 dry wt day[superscript]-[superscript] 1 for phosphorus. The integrated culture systems effectively retained nutrients into harvested products in comparison to monoculture system. The rates of nutrient conversion into waste were significantly lower in the integrated culture systems (52. 46 - 70. 05 % for nitrogen and 49. 09 - 69. 41 % for phosphorus) than in prawn monoculture (82. 31 % for nitrogen and 85. 53 % for phosphorus). Integrating Sargassum sp. with prawn culture did not alter the specific growth rate (SGR) and survival rate of the prawns. The SGR of Sargassum sp. in integrated culture increased at the rate of 3. 16 ± 0. 74 % day[superscript]-[superscript] 1, while was 5. 70 ± 0. 82 % day[superscript]-[superscript] 1 in seaweed monoculture. Decreasing the stocking biomass of Sargassum sp. negatively affected its growth rate and capacity in uptaking the nutrients. The results of this study suggest that integrating Sargassum sp. into prawn culture can benefit prawn farming by assisting in the maintenance of optimum water quality and thereby, reduce environmental impacts on surrounding ecosystems. However, the lower growth rate of seaweed cultured with prawns than those cultured in isolation suggests the presence of several limiting factors for the growth of the seaweed in integrated seaweed and prawn culture...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} development, testing, and {{application}} of computer programs for simulating Lagrangian-Stochastic particle dispersion in coastal seas, with particular application to tide and storm induced dispersion in South Australian seas. The three-dimensional tidal equations are briefly discussed for {{the two types of}} surge models used, and finite-difference methods for numerically solving these equations are considered. Different methods of simulating flows at open sea boundaries are investigated. The method of particle tracking and the development of the particle tracking model is also described. Various tests are conducted to investigate both the advective and diffusive aspects of dispersion, and a number of scenarios for the simulation of open (ocean) and closed (coastal) boundaries are considered. Various aspects of the particle tracking routine are given specific characteristics according {{to the nature of the}} particle being considered. Application of the tide and storm surge model to the Great Australian Bight is described. This uses spherical polar co-ordinates to account for the curvature of the earth, and an oblique boundary element to increase accuracy of the coastline representation. The effect of a low pressure system moving from west to east across the Bight and the resulting significant observed surge at Thevenard during the storm of April 1996 is simulated. This storm resulted in a significant number of deaths in aquaculture farms containing southern bluefin tuna (Thunnas maccoyii) within the Boston Bay region to the extreme east of the Bight due to the agitation of almost neutrally buoyant organic sediments at the sea floor. The effects of this storm are further considered using a Cartesian co-ordinate fine-grid local model of Boston Bay, in Spencer Gulf, South Australia, where both tidal and storm (wind and outside surge) induced flows are simulated. The dispersion of suspended neutrally buoyant sediment throughout the region is considered, and compared with the mortalities of tuna at various farms within the region. Tidal and storm induced currents in the Gulf St. Vincent region, South Australia, have also been modelled using Cartesian co-ordinates. Detailed consideration has been given to the modelling of tides, winds, atmospheric pressures and outside surges from the two open boundaries in Investigator Strait and Backstairs Passage. The information obtained has enabled the modelling of a number of storm surge scenarios. Further to this, various simulations of the dispersion of the larvae of the <b>western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (Penaeus latisulcatus) have been driven using the storm surge model developed. These incorporate currents near the surface and the sea floor, as well as the consideration of changes in behaviour during the life history of the larvae. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In 1988 a {{prevalence}} {{study of the}} Queensland coast identified Microsporidia infections in five species of prawns. Microsporidia were presumptively identified as being either Thelohania spp., which is now Agmasoma if found in a marine environment, or Ameson spp. (Owens and Glazebrook, 1988). Funding restraints precluded further identification work on these samples at the time. In 2011 <b>Western</b> <b>king</b> <b>prawns</b> were found off the Townsville coast. These presented with signs and histology identical to Thelohania spp. -infected prawns found off the Townsville coast 23 years earlier, providing another opportunity to study this infection. Since the original presumptive identification of these Microsporidia, {{it has become increasingly}} apparent that morphological identification of Microsporidia has limitations, such as divergent spore morphologies, that can be overcome by molecular analysis (Stentiford et al., 2013, Vossbrinck and Debrunner-Vossbrinck, 2005). The small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssrRNA) gene has been identified as a useful tool for phylogenetic analysis and identification in Microsporidia (Franzen, 2008). Current identification methods should therefore include molecular analysis for identification and the ssrRNA gene appears to be a good target. However, a lack of immediate external interest in funding further identification and other priorities for research students looking for a project put the samples collected in 2011 into cold storage. The School of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences at James Cook University delivers a block mode intensive course to third year and graduate students entitled “Microbial molecular diagnosis and epidemiology”. Good quality, highly infected tissues are desired for the course as it is designed to teach students the basics of extraction, detection and analysis of nucleic acids of microorganisms using authentic infected tissue samples. This requirement has provided an opportunity for researchers to be the beneficiaries of sequence data and phylogenetic analysis produced by the course. In 2012, the above mentioned prawns collected in 2011 were examined. Two published primer sets targeting the conserved ssrRNA gene (Fedorko et al., 1995, Lee et al., 2010) were purchased and briefly tested with RNA extracted from prawn tissue to ensure bands were produced on a gel.

40|$|Eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawns</b> (Melicertus plebejus) are {{the primary}} species for {{significant}} commercial fisheries in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. There {{is assumed to be}} a single stock of eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawns</b> that is shared between these jurisdictions with a large migration of both larval and adult prawns across the state borders. The two states manage their exploitation of this species separately. Considerable assessment work has been undertaken on the Queensland fishery and the stock assessment of eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawns</b> has been identified as priority research in NSW. A Bayesian framework was selected to calibrate a delay-difference model of eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> stocks in NSW. This allowed the more extensiv...|$|R

40|$|Aloe vera (Aloe vera chinensis Linn) cortex {{contains}} antibacterial compounds such as aloe emodin andaloin, {{that have}} potency as natural preservative for foods. The {{objectives of the}} research were to determinethe minimum concentration of aloe vera cortex extract to inhibit bacterial growth, {{and the effects of}} soakingin the extract and storage at 5 oC on the quality parameters of <b>king</b> <b>prawns.</b> The concentrations of extractwere varied i. e. 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/ml, respectively, and minimum concentration of extract forinhibition of Pseudomonas fluorescens was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) method. Antibacterial compounds in the extract were analyzed by HPLC and TLC methods. TPC, TVB‐N,TMA, pH and organoleptic characteristics of soaked <b>king</b> <b>prawns</b> were evaluated. The results showed 500 μg/ml aloe vera cortex extract was an optimum concentration, and soaking for 90 minutes was able toinhibit and to reduce one log cycle of bacteria population. Aloe vera cortex extracts contained 18. 21 ppmaloe emodin and 15. 5 mg/g aloin (1. 55 %). After 6 days storage at 5 oC, therefore the <b>king</b> <b>prawns</b> was performedby TPC 3. 9 x 105, TVB‐N 28, 6, TMA 4. 60 and pH 7. 7.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the Australian eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> (Melicertus plebejus) is {{understood}} in greater detail by quantifying the latitudinal effect. The latitudinal effect is {{the change in the}} species 2 ̆ 7 growth rate during migration. Mark-recapture data (N = 1635, latitude 22. 21 degrees S- 34. 00 degrees S) presents northerly movement of the eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawn,</b> with New South Wales prawns showing substantial average movement of 140 km (standard deviation: 176 km) north. A generalized von Bertalanffy growth model framework is used to incorporate the latitudinal effect together with the canonical seasonal effect. Applying this method to eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> mark-recapture data guarantees consistent estimates for the latitudinal and seasonal effects. For M. plebejus, it was found that growth rate peaks on 25 and 29 January for males and females, respectively; is at a minimum on 27 and 31 July, respectively; and that the shape parameter, k (per year), changes by - 0. 0236 and - 0. 0556 every 1 degree of latitude south increase for males and females, respectively...|$|R

Previous unpublished reports of Parapenaeon japonicum parasitizing P. longistylus have also been substantiated. Parasite species were not randomly associated with all prawn species but rather were associated with a single prawn host species or species group. The factors that give rise to such specific host-parasite associations, particularly the host-selective behaviour of the parasite and the habitat preferences of the juvenile prawns, are discussed. Bopyrids had no significant effect on the weight of the prawns, but they did {{have a significant effect on}} ovary weight and histology, causing sterility in their hosts...|$|R
40|$|The Queensland {{east coast}} trawl fishery {{is by far}} the largest prawn and scallop otter trawl fleet in Australia in terms of number of vessels, with 504 vessels {{licensed}} to fish for species including tiger prawns, endeavour <b>prawns,</b> red spot <b>king</b> <b>prawns,</b> eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawns</b> and saucer scallops by the end of 2004. The vessel fleet has gradually upgraded characteristics such as engine power and use of propeller nozzles, quad nets, global positioning systems (GPS) and computer mapping software. These changes, together with the ever-changing profile of the fleet, were analysed by linear mixed models to quantify annual efficiency increases of an average vessel at catching prawns or scallops. The analyses included vessel characteristics (treated as fixed effects) and vessel identifier codes (treated as random effects). For the period from 1989 to 2004 the models estimated overall fishing power increases of 6 % in the northern tiger, 6 % in the northern endeavour, 12 % in the southern tiger, 18 % in the red spot king, 46 % in the eastern <b>king</b> <b>prawn</b> and 15 % in the saucer scallop sector. The results illustrate the importance of ongoing monitoring of vessel and fleet characteristics and the need to use this information to standardise catch rate indices used in stock assessment and management...|$|R
