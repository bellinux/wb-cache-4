The pursuing Mongol army caught up with Mstislav of Kiev's forces and started to besiege the camp.|$|E
5|$|The Emir who had {{commanded}} the Mahdist army at Rejaf, Arabi Dafalla, withdrew with <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> his army northwest into Mahdist Sudan. He was ridiculed by his superiors for the defeat at Rejaf, and he later surrendered his army to Sultan Ali Dinar of Darfur after a failed {{attack on a}} French outpost in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The Pink Palace was sold. Its {{subsequent}} owners included Ringo Starr, Cass Elliot, and Engelbert Humperdinck. In 2002 Humperdinck {{sold it to}} developers, and {{the house}} was demolished in November of that year. <b>What</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> her estate subsequently came under the management of CMG Worldwide, an intellectual property-management company.|$|E

50|$|The first {{mention of}} {{permanent}} European habitation {{was that of}} a French Priest in 1635. <b>What</b> <b>remain</b> <b>of</b> the 1671 French census indicates a family of seven (Amand Lalloue) living in Cape Negro, with a farm which included grain, peas and other vegetables as well as sizeable herds of goats and pigs. Several Mi'kmaq families with children lived in Cape Negro, at least during the summer.|$|R
5|$|After {{a fire in}} 1177, the {{original}} palace complex was abandoned and emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former sato-dairi) within the city and villas outside it. In 1227 a fire finally destroyed <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In 1334 Emperor Go-Daigo issued an edict to rebuild the Greater Palace, but no resources were available to support this and the project came to nothing. The present Kyoto Imperial Palace is located immediately {{to the west of}} the site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city. The Jingi-kan, the final standing section of the palace, remained in use until 1585.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the site.|$|E

5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Empire.|$|E
5|$|By 22:45 the {{crossroads}} had been secured by <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> 'C' Company, the eighteen survivors of 'A' Company were {{in among the}} south-eastern buildings of Bréville. In the north-east of the village the twenty survivors of the Devonshire company had captured their objective. The shelling had stopped when 'B' Company reached the village unopposed and occupied abandoned German trenches beside the church. Fearing a German counter-attack on his weakened battalion, Parker ordered a defensive artillery bombardment. However, there was a misunderstanding when the order reached the artillery and a heavy bombardment landed on the British positions in the village, causing several casualties including three of the surviving officers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 20 September, the Eighth Ottoman Army {{had been}} pushed {{back out of the}} coastal Plain of Sharon and the Desert Mounted Corps was {{blocking}} the Seventh and <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Eighth Armies' main lines of retreat northwards. The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta, the 7th (Meerut) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf, while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe. Both the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions had continued to force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies' retreat.|$|E

50|$|The Picts survive, but the cataclysm {{brings them}} back to the Stone Age. They remain virile and started to regain <b>what</b> <b>remain</b> <b>of</b> their lands. By the time the Cimmerians and distant {{descendants}} of the Aesir and Vanir head west and scattered them, only vague legends <b>remain</b> <b>of</b> the old Pictish Empire and its predecessors. Their descendants, the Picts, would only enter history again when they encounter the Roman Empire. Howard addresses their further history in his Bran Mak Morn series. No further reference is mentioned to Aquilonians or their possible descendants.|$|R
5|$|Churchill and Maxime Weygand, who {{had taken}} over command from Gamelin, were still {{determined}} to break the German line and extricate their forces to the south. When they communicated their intentions to King Leopold and van Overstraten on 24 May, the latter was stunned. A dangerous gap was starting to open between the British and Belgians between Ypres and Menen, which threatened <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Belgian front. The Belgians could not cover it; {{such a move would}} have overstretched them. Without consulting the French or asking permission from his government, Gort immediately and decisively ordered the British 5th and 50th Infantry Divisions to plug the gap and abandon any offensive operations further south.|$|E
5|$|During {{the meeting}} in Kolwezi, Tshombe had ordered all {{remaining}} Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Events {{such as the}} Pentridge Rising, the March of the Blanketeers and the Spa Fields meeting, all {{serve to}} {{indicate}} the breadth, diversity and widespread geographical scale of the demand for economic and political reform at the time. Peterloo {{had no effect on}} the speed of reform, but in due course {{all but one of the}} reformers' demands, annual parliaments, were met. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, the newly created Manchester parliamentary borough elected its first two MPs. Five candidates including William Cobbett stood, and the Whigs, Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips, were elected. Manchester became a Municipal Borough in 1837, and <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the manorial rights were purchased by the borough council.|$|E

5|$|Fischer's {{estate was}} {{estimated}} at 140 million ISK (about 1 million GBP, or $2 million USD). It quickly became {{the object of a}} legal battle involving claims from four parties, with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Fischer's estate after government claims. The four parties were Fischer's apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young, his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ, and the U.S. government (claiming unpaid taxes).|$|E
5|$|Following Kubrick's {{death in}} 1999, Spielberg took the various drafts and notes left by Kubrick and his writers and {{composed}} a new screenplay {{based on an}} earlier 90-page story treatment by Ian Watson written under Kubrick's supervision and according to Kubrick's specifications. In association with <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Kubrick's production unit, he directed the movie A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001). which was produced by Kubrick's longtime producer (and brother-in-law) Jan Harlan. Sets, costumes, and art direction {{were based on the}} works of conceptual artist Chris Baker, who had also done much of his work under Kubrick's supervision.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement outside their assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined <b>what</b> <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
5000|$|In {{ungulates}} (hoofed mammals) the forelimb is {{optimized for}} speed and endurance {{by a combination}} of length of stride and rapid step; the proximal forelimb segments are short with large muscles, while the distal segments are elongated with less musculature. In two of the major groups of ungulates, odd-toed and even-toed ungulates, <b>what</b> <b>remain</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "hands" [...] — the metacarpal and phalangeal bones — are elongated {{to the extent that they}} serve little use beyond locomotion. The giraffe, the largest even-toed ungulate, has large terminal phalanges and fused metacarpal bones able to absorb the stress from running.|$|R
50|$|In late July and August 1945 the Potsdam Conference finally disbanded {{the former}} Nazi German state, {{reversed}} all German annexations and occupied territories, {{as well as}} agreed to jointly occupy and govern, denazify and demilitarize <b>what</b> had <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Germany.|$|R
