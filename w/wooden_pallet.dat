6000|$|The {{communication}} between the ducal palace and the prisons of Venice is by a gloomy bridge, or covered gallery, high above the water, and divided by a stone wall into a passage and a cell. The state dungeons called pozzi, or wells, were sunk in the thick walls of the palace: and the prisoner, when taken out to die, was conducted across the gallery to the other side, and being then led back into the other compartment, or cell, upon the bridge, was there strangled. The low portal through which the criminal was taken into this cell is now walled up; but the passage is still open, and is still known {{by the name of}} the [...] "Bridge of Sighs." [...] The pozzi are under the flooring of the chamber {{at the foot of the}} bridge. They were formerly twelve; but on the first arrival of the French, the Venetians hastily blocked or broke up the deeper of these dungeons. You may still, however descend by a trap-door, and crawl down through holes, half choked by rubbish, to the depth of two stories below the first range. If you are in want of consolation for the extinction of patrician power, perhaps you may find it there; scarcely a ray of light glimmers into the narrow gallery which leads to the cells, and the places of confinement themselves are totally dark. A small hole in the wall admitted the damp air of the passages, and served for the introduction of the prisoner's food. A <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet,</b> raised a foot from the ground, was the only furniture. The conductors tell you that a light was not allowed. The cells are about five paces in length, two and a half in width, and seven feet in height. They are directly beneath one another, and respiration is somewhat difficult in the lower holes. Only one prisoner was found when the republicans descended into these hideous recesses, and he is said to have been confined sixteen years. But the inmates of the dungeons beneath had left traces of their repentance, or of their despair, which are still visible, and may, perhaps, owe something to recent ingenuity. Some of the detained appear to have offended against, and others to have belonged to, the sacred body, not only from their signatures, but from the churches and belfries which they have scratched upon the walls. The reader may not object to see a specimen of the records prompted by so terrific a solitude. As nearly as they could be copied by more than one pencil, three of them are as follows:-- ...|$|E

As a result, Besman recorded Hooker playing guitar, singing and stomping on a <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> in time with the music. For much of this period he recorded and toured with Eddie Kirkland. In Hooker's later sessions for Vee-Jay Records in Chicago, studio musicians accompanied him on most of his recordings, including Eddie Taylor, who could handle his musical idiosyncrasies.

From there, they had to stack the bricks on a <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> to receive their clue. In Ice, teams had to load two 220 lb blocks of ice onto the back of flatbed tricycles and deliver them to a fish market four blocks away. Once there, they would have to break them into smaller pieces and place them into a tub to receive the next clue. After the Detour, teams had to take a taxi to the Pit Stop: the roof of the Peace Hotel South.|$|E

5000|$|Van Meter {{is noted}} for his pile of {{discarded}} wooden pallets from a beer company. In 1951 {{when the local}} beer company had a labor dispute they wished {{to get rid of}} thousands of broken-down used wooden pallets. Van Meter said he would take a [...] "few" [...] off their hands if they would deliver them to his property. Five truckloads of the pallets showed up. He decided he had to do something with them, so contrived a <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> tower structure. The 3 foot by 3 foot 6-inch-thick pallets soon became a structure over 20-feet high. It was 22 feet at the base and built in a circle. It took him just a few weeks to construct on his property and was over the grave site of an unknown three-year-old Native American child.|$|E
50|$|For the Detour, {{the teams}} chose between שקשק אותו (Sheqsheq Aotov; Slosh It) and פוצץ אותו (Potzetz Aotov; Pop It). In Slosh It, the teams tasted a fresh-fruit {{smoothie}} {{and had to}} identify the fruits from which it was made by taste. They then had to collect the fruits (scattered along the beach) while hopping in a sack. In Pop It, the teams participated in a traditional activity meant to scare off evil spirits. One team member put on a blindfold and entered a pool filled with balloons. Their partner chose a color of balloon the blindfolded member had to pop with their mouths or buttocks. In this leg's Roadblock, the participating contestant had to wear a white T-shirt and lie on the ground while an elephant put his leg on their body and hit them with its trunk. The team member then had to put a flat <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> under the T-shirt and let the elephant paint on the T-shirt before the elephant gave them the next clue. In the Double-Battle at Ban Amphur, teams had to attach coconut shells {{to their feet and}} race around a course collecting coconuts; if they dropped any coconuts, they had to start again.|$|E
50|$|In {{dealing with}} the killer, {{survivors}} can also make use {{of a handful of}} items and traps in the area - searching chests inside buildings will sometimes yield first-aid kits (which allow the survivors to heal themselves rather than wait for a teammate), maps (can be used to spot generators all around the map), flashlights (which can be used to temporarily blind the killer), tool-kits (which can be used both to repair generators faster and to disable the sacrificial meat hooks), broken key (does a variety of things depending on its addons), maps (which locate all the generators or more depending on its rarity and addons), dull key (which can be used to open the hatch whenever it's found), and skeleton key (which does a variety of things depending on its addons and can be used to open the hatch). One trap that survivors can use is a massive <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet,</b> many of which are placed upright, and can be pulled down when a survivor runs past them - if the killer is right behind them, the pallet will stun the killer for a brief period of time. The survivors can vault over fallen pallets, while the killer has to destroy them. They can also climb through windows. The killer can go through windows too, but does it significantly slower.|$|E

40|$|Wooden pallets {{are widely}} used {{in the field of}} logistics. Their {{frictional}} characteristics directly determine the reliability of transport. Microstructuring is an effective method to enhance the friction coefficient between the <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> and corrugated box. In this study, the micro-cutting method was used to manufacture the micro grooves and pillars efficiently. 12 different sizes of microstructure are designed and manufactured on pine wood which is commonly used for the <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet.</b> The experimental results show that sample with a thickness of the groove wall 100 μm has a poor structural strength and not suitable for microstructure design. The test results show that, micropillars has larger friction coefficient than grooved surface. It can lead to a 57 percent increase in the friction coefficient (from 0. 21 to 0. 33). This study lays the foundation for the manufacture of microstructures on wood to improve the frictional characteristic...|$|E
40|$|Czech etymologist V. Machek {{tried to}} explain Slovak ľahtikár ‘careless, light-headed person’ as a reflex of an {{original}} *ľahostikár, related to Slovak ľahký ‘light (weighted), easy, etc. ’ Тhis etymological hypothesis implies the following derivational chain: Slovak ľahosť ‘lightness, easiness’ > *ľahost-i-ť ‘to live easily, carelessly, etc. ’ > *ľahosti-ka-ť (expressive verbal formation) > *ľahostik-ár (nomen agentis). From the phonetic point of view, the reconstruction *ľahostikár > ľahtikár presupposes an irregular phonetic evolution; however, {{in the context of}} Slovak phonetics, we would rather expect here the development *ľahostikár > *ľahstikár > *ľastikár (instead of ľahtikár). In our opinion, Slovak ľahtikár might be traced back to *lachťikár, derived from Slovak dial. lachťika ‘primitive bed, pallet’ which we explain as a loanword from Latin (cf. Latin lectica ‘litter’, derived from Latin lectus ‘bed, couch’). *Lachťikár — modified into standard Slovak ľahtikár under the influence of ľahký — may have been used originally as a derogatory term for a person who, because of his social status, had to sleep on a primitive <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> in a stable (as opposed to the “standard” bed in the room of a village house); the semantic development of the word may be reconstructed as *‘who sleeps on a primitive bed, <b>wooden</b> <b>pallet</b> (lachťika) ’ > *‘servant, stable boy’ > *‘primitive, rude person’ > ‘not serious, careless, light-headed person’...|$|E
