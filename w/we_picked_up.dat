500|$|... "You Don't Know What to Do" [...] {{was written}} by Carey, Jermaine Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with {{featured}} artist Wale. The song interpolates a song called [...] "I'm Caught Up in a One Night Affair", written by Patrick Adams and Terri Gonzalez and originally performed by Inner Life in 1979. Adams and Gonzalez are credited as songwriters as a result. In August 2012, Cox revealed that he, Carey and Dupri had started working on Carey's then untitled fourteenth studio album, later revealed to be Me. I Am Mariah... The Elusive Chanteuse, before the singer became pregnant with twins in 2010, and then resumed working on the project after she gave birth in 2011. [...] "She was committed to making it before she got pregnant. Then she got pregnant and she took the time off. Then after she came back, we started really vibing again and <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> right where we left off.

He just sat there, so <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effects of age and experience on length perception. A total of 46 {{participants were asked to}} wield and estimate the length of unseen rods by adjusting a movable board to equal their estimate of the reachable distance of the rod. The results demonstrated that (a) participants used the haptic subsystem of dynamic touch to perceive dissimilarities in object length and (b) experience playing racquet sports was more influential than the effect of age in perceptual judgments regarding object length. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} ecological approach to haptic perception. Key Words: Dynamic touch—Length perception—Experience—Aging—Ecological perspective. <b>WE</b> <b>PICK</b> <b>up</b> objects and wield them. <b>We</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> scissorsand cut paper, <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> sticks and rub them together to make a fire, <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a racquet and swing it. Objects are material things, having mass, and mass resists our efforts to displace it. This resistance generates pressure on the hand, pressure that influences the stimulation of receptors in the skin, muscles, and tendons. For this reason, the act of wielding can provide an impression of the spatial dimensions of the object. This type of perception is known as dynamic touch (Gibson...|$|R

We had to bail. I was standing in ice cold water {{up to the top}} of my boots all the time, and rowing continuously for nearly five hours. We took off about fifteen more people who were standing on a capsized boat. In all, our boat had by that time sixty-five or sixty-six people. There was no room to sit down in our boat, so we all stood, except some sitting along the side.|$|E
2500|$|McDougall {{reported}} that the final three prahus {{did not attempt to}} escape like the first three had and they fought with determination even after all of the Sarawakian guns were brought to bear on them. One of the prahus was run over just as the second and split in two while the largest and final vessel was destroyed by gunfire and sank with a valuable cargo of gold and jewels. McDougall later said: [...] "The poor captives, who were all made fast below as we came up to engage them, were doubtless glad when our stem opened the sides of their ships, and thus let them out of prison. Few, comparatively, were drowned, being mostly all good swimmers. All those who were not lashed to the vessels, or killed by the Illanuns, escaped. Our decks were soon covered with those <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up,</b> men of every race and nation in the Archipelago, who had been captured by the pirates in their cruise, which had already lasted seven months." [...] McDougall also confirmed the loss of at least one dead and two wounded while several of the pirates were killed or wounded, most having been hit by cannon and rifle fire. In all at least 100 Sulus became casualties while many others escaped to the shore and retreated into the jungle.|$|E

2500|$|By 0530 on 6 June 1944, {{the first}} wave of attackers {{approached}} the beach, the 741 Tank Battalion (Duplex drive (DD) Sherman amphibious tanks destined for the eastern half of Omaha were guided by LCC-20). At 0542, {{the first wave}} was dispatched. At 0641 PC-552 reported to [...] that the entire first wave foundered. The waves were too high and many DDs destined for Omaha were swamped and sank while still well off shore. On other beaches the commanders realized the danger and brought their DDs much closer inshore before launching allowing them to reach the shore. PC-552 spent the next 45 minutes picking up survivors, but watched many of the soldiers drown in front of them, helpless to do anything about them. Crewmen Ted Guzda described the scene saying, [...] "We were the control vessel for {{the first wave of}} the invasion, they all went down, <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> all the survivors and threw them on deck." [...] Ted Guzda recalled, [...] "Later we had to sink most of ," [...] he said. [...] "We took off whatever identification they had, put weights on them and sank them. There was nothing else we could do." [...] Some soldiers were so weak from exposure, sailors from PC-552 were required to be lowered by rope to the water to place ropes around the soldiers to pull them from the water. Those soldiers did not have the strength to raise their arms to grab hold of the rope.|$|E
2500|$|The Indians {{always insisted}} that they took no prisoners. If they did—a thing I firmly believe—they were {{tortured}} and killed {{the night of the}} 25th.

2500|$|On October 6, 1990, [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] was {{recorded}} in a studio in New York accompanied by a live orchestra because the songwriters preferred to have all performers and musicians record together opposed to separating the singers from the instrumentalists. On {{the day of her}} scheduled recording session, Lansbury's flight was delayed due to a bomb threat, which prompted an emergency landing in Las Vegas. Unaware of her whereabouts for several hours, the filmmakers had begun making plans to reschedule the session until Lansbury finally telephoned the studio once she arrived safely in New York. At the behest of one of the directors, Lansbury recorded a demo of the song for them to use in the event that no other actress was available to sing it on her behalf, or no character other than Mrs. Potts was deemed suitable. Ultimately, Lansbury recorded her version in one take, which wound up being used in the final film. Producer Don Hahn recalled that the actress simply [...] "sang 'Beauty and the Beast' from beginning to end and just nailed it. <b>We</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a couple of lines here and there, but essentially that one take is what we used for the movie." [...] Lansbury's performance moved everyone who was present in the recording studio at the time to tears. Meanwhile, the actress credits recording the song with ultimately helping her gain further perspective on Mrs. Potts' role in the film.|$|E

They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances." [...] Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining [...] "McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like {{the next generation of}} their take on pop," [...] while bassist Connor Ball continued [...] "They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first in all of our collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and the little things <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said [...] "We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation...
