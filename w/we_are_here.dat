25|$|As a minor detail {{important}} {{more for}} its form than its content, {{the operations of}} an algebra are traditionally organized as a list. Although <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> indexing the operations of a Boolean algebra by the finitary operations on {0,1}, the truth-table presentation above serendipitously orders the operations first by arity and second by {{the layout of the}} tables for each arity. This permits organizing the set of all Boolean operations in the traditional list format. The list order for the operations of a given arity is determined by the following two rules.|$|E
500|$|The team {{held two}} Organized Team Activities (OTAs) {{prior to the}} draft, in {{addition}} to 12 throughout May and June. The OTAs were voluntary, however, most players did attend. Many players routinely worked on their conditioning and strength together, in addition to [...] "informal" [...] on field training. A week prior {{to the end of}} OTAs Mike Tomlin said he was happy with the team's progress during the sessions. Also stating, “We are having a productive off-season and that is what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> for. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to get better individually and collectively and I think we are doing that.” Limas Sweed experimented on special teams play for the first time ever, with a concentration in punt blocking. On the day of the final OTA, June 12, Tomlin stated that while he was pleased with the progress of the team, no positions would be gained or lost based on the voluntary camp. Tomlin added, [...] "it's been teach-oriented, it's been skill-develop-oriented. It's different than playing the game of football." [...] The team was given 44days off until the beginning of training camp.|$|E

In observing discussions among them during his visit, Callahan-Bever noted: [...] "Despite the heavyweights assembled, the egos rarely clash; talks are sprawling, enlightening, and productive ... <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to contribute, challenge, and inspire". In an interview with Callahan-Bever, Q-Tip described the process as [...] "music by committee" [...] and elaborated on its significance to the sessions and West's work ethic: ...|$|E

It is the board's desire that you accept." [...] Middleton was pressed to make a quick decision, and feeling confident that he could fulfill the job with no misgivings, he accepted the position. [...] There was some backlash from the resignation of Stoke, as students and members of the community criticized the board. [...] Nevertheless, the resignation became effective on 1 February 1951, on which day Middleton began his role as university president.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the highly}} publicized incident, West took a brief break from music and {{threw himself into}} fashion, only to hole up in Hawaii {{for the next few}} months writing and {{recording}} his next album. Importing his favorite producers and artists to work on and inspire his recording, West kept engineers behind the boards 24 hours a day and slept only in increments. Noah Callahan-Bever, a writer for Complex, was present during the sessions and described the [...] "communal" [...] atmosphere as thus: [...] "With the right songs and the right album, he can overcome any and all controversy, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to contribute, challenge, and inspire."

500|$|Unemployment {{originally}} {{rose from}} 4.2percent in January 2001 to 6.3percent in June 2003, but subsequently dropped to 4.5percent as of July 2007. Adjusted for inflation, {{median household income}} dropped by $1,175 between 2000 and 2007, while Professor Ken Homa of Georgetown University has noted that [...] "Median real after-tax household income went up 2 percent". The poverty rate increased from 11.3percent in 2000 to 12.3percent in 2006 after peaking at 12.7percent in 2004. By October 2008, due to increases in spending, the national debt had risen to $11.3trillion, an increase of over 100percent from 2000 when the debt was only $5.6trillion. Most debt was accumulated {{as a result of}} what became known as the [...] "Bush tax cuts" [...] and increased national security spending. In March 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling: [...] "The fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure." [...] By the end of Bush's presidency, unemployment climbed to 7.2percent.|$|E

Christabel was arrested after {{spitting}} at a policeman during {{a meeting of the}} Liberal Party in October 1905; Adela and Sylvia were arrested a year later during a protest outside Parliament. Pankhurst was arrested {{for the first time in}} February 1908, when she tried to enter Parliament to deliver a protest resolution to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith. She was charged with obstruction and sentenced to six weeks in prison. She spoke out against the conditions of her confinement, including vermin, meagre food, and the [...] "civilised torture of solitary confinement and absolute silence" [...] to which she and others were ordered. Pankhurst saw imprisonment as a means to publicise the urgency of women's suffrage; in June 1909 she struck a police officer twice in the face to ensure she would be arrested. Pankhurst was arrested seven times before women's suffrage was approved. During her trial on 21 October 1908 she told the court: [...] "We are here not because we are law-breakers; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> in our efforts to become law-makers." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> to speak to".|$|E

Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said [...] "On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify. It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." [...] Griffin's {{interview with}} Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, [...] "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act." [...] He rejected claims that the BNP was [...] "acting unlawfully" [...] and said [...] "...because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>here,</b> as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups—it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter there said that we'll only lift a finger for white people—that's a simple lie." [...] In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer, BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler, implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to [...] "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying [...] "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" [...] (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).|$|E
