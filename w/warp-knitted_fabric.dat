Compared {{with the traditional}} contourlet transform, wavelet transform {{takes the place of}} Laplacian pyramid in NWCT and the directional filter bank is non-subsampled. The wavelet transform with improved wavelet threshold is put to use, and the original fabric image can be decomposed into low-frequency approximate coefficient A and high-frequency detail coefficients V, H, and D. The high-frequency detail coefficients are processed by the non-subsampled directional filter bank to get directional sub-band coefficients. Afterward, the effective sub-band coefficients based on regional energy are chosen to reconstruct V, H, and D. And the reconstructed fabric image will be achieved by inverse non-subsampled wavelet-based contourlet transform. The adaptive threshold method and morphological processing are used to obtain the legible defect profile. The experiment demonstrates that NWCT can achieve the positive segmentation regarding the common defects, such as broken warp, width barrier, and oil, and has excellent performance on these directional defects and regional defects. It is acknowledged that NWCT will provide a new way to detect <b>warp-knitted</b> <b>fabric</b> defects automatically...|$|E

Depending on the averaging procedure used, upper and lower bounds for the elastic moduli ave found with the Voigt and Reuss method, respectively. These bounds ave shown to agree well with the experimental results for the Young's moduli and the shear moduli. Closer bounds are obtained by assuming that the matrix is uniformly distributed through the composite. These closer bounds are shown to be valid for the Young's modulus bur not for the shear modulus.

In this study, 12 types of <b>warp-knitted</b> <b>fabrics</b> with different stitch patterns, including tricot, cord, and pillar stitches, were produced.

This thesis explores electrically conductive textile surfaces made by combining conventional textile coating methods with the intrinsically conductive polymer complex poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) -poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). PEDOT:PSS {{was used in}} textile coating formulations including polymer binder, ethylene glycol (EG) and rheology modifier. Shear viscometry was used to identify suitable viscosities of the formulations for each coating method. The coating methods were knife coating, pad coating and screen printing. The {{first part of the}} work studied the influence of composition of the coating formulation, the amount of coating and the film formation process on the surface resistivity and the surface appearance of knife-coated textiles. The electrical resistivity was largely affected by the amount of PEDOT:PSS in the coating and indicated percolation behaviour within the system. Addition of a high-boiling solvent, i. e. EG, decreased the surface resistivity with more than four orders of magnitude. Studies of tear strength and bending rigidity showed that textiles coated with formulations containing larger amounts of PEDOT:PSS and EG were softer, more ductile and stronger than those coated with formulations containing more binder. The coated textiles were found to be durable to abrasion and cyclic strain, as well as quite resilient to the harsh treatment of shear flexing. Washing increased the surface resistivity, but the samples remained conductive after five wash cycles. The second part of the work focused on using the coatings to transfer the voltage signal from piezoelectric textile fibres; the coatings were first applied using pad coating as the outer electrode on a woven sensor and then as screen-printed interconnections in a sensing glove based on stretchy, <b>warp-knitted</b> <b>fabric.</b> Sensor data from the glove was successfully used as input to a microcontroller running a robot gripper. These applications showed the viability of the concept and that the coatings could be made very flexible and integrated into the textile garment without substantial loss of the textile characteristics.

40|$|This part {{presents}} a dynamic model for predicting the impact compressive responses of <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer <b>fabrics</b> under various loading conditions using quasi-static compressive stress–strain data. The model was established {{based on a}} nonlinear mass-spring-damper system by considering spacer yarns as nonlinear springs with damping effect and representation of their stiffness by the constitutive model developed in Part I. Based on the dynamic model, the impact compressive responses of a typical <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer <b>fabric</b> was parametrically studied in terms of damping ratio, initial velocity, striker mass and contact area. The study indicates that damping can reduce the peak acceleration and peak displacement regardless of loading conditions, and the increase of the initial velocity can enhance the damping effect. Increasing initial velocity or striker mass while keeping the counterpart constant can increase the peak acceleration and peak displacement. However, at a constant kinetic energy, either increasing striker mass or decreasing initial velocity can reduce the peak acceleration, but the peak displacement keeps constant. The study also shows that an optimal size of the spacer fabric exists for achieving minimal peak acceleration under impact at a certain kinetic energy. Experimental validation by drop-weight impact tests demonstrates that the predictions of the dynamic model are in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results.

This work is concerned with a study of compression mechanism of a selected <b>warp-knitted</b> spacer <b>fabric</b> with a given sandwich structure. Both experimental and numerical methods are used to study the effect of the material's structure on the overall compression mechanism. Compression tests are conducted to obtain force-displacement relationships of the fabric. A micro-computed tomography system is used to analyze specimens under different levels of compression displacement to investigate the change in material's structure during the compression process. At the same time, finite element models are developed separately to simulate the initial geometric structure and the compression behavior of the fabric. Three finite element models based on beam elements are firstly developed to simulate the effect of manufacturing process on shapes of monofilaments within the fabric and to determine their morphologies, which are used to assemble a geometry part of the finite element model of the overall fabric.

Methods based on the J-integral method and Betti’s reciprocal theorem in extracting the fracture parameters, critical stress intensity factors, T-stress, and the second term of y. r; 0 / near the crack tip prior to fracture initiation are formulated. Two fracture criteria, Tc; rcU and T"c; rcU are attempted to characterize the failure initiation for the fiber-dominated failure mode and self-similar crack extension in a given thickness of the laminate. Based on linear elastic fracture mechanics principle, these criteria are transformed into crack-driving forces TKQ; T U and TKQ; g 32 U. The two-parameter fracture criteria, TKQ; T U and TKQ; g 32 U provide a good correlation for the CCT and SENT specimens, {{but not for the}} high constraint CT specimens. With the limited experimental data, the results tend to show that the large tensile T-stress and large magnitude of negative g 32 may inhibit the crack extension in the same crack plane and promote crack kinking.
