40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of <b>wind</b> energy, <b>relay</b> protection for large-scale wind farms has been attracting some researchers, {{due to the}} absence of standards. Based on the large-scale doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) -based wind farms located in Gansu Province, China, this paper studies the differential protection for the outgoing power transformer of large-scale DFIG-based wind farms. According to the equivalent circuit of the power grid integrated with wind farms, the main frequency components of current and voltage during faults are identified mathematically and then verified by simulations. The results show that the frequencies of current and voltage at the terminals of outgoing transmission lines are inconsistent. Following the feature of frequency inconsistency, the adaptability of differential protection is analyzed, and it is found that differential protection for an outgoing transformer in large-scale wind farms may fail once ignoring the frequency inconsistency. Simulation studies demonstrate that inconsistent frequency characteristics will deteriorate the sensitivity and reliability of differential protection. Finally, several suggestions are provided for improving the performance of relay protections for large-scale DFIG-based wind farms...|$|R

5000|$|Violet {{was first}} {{observed}} {{from a small}} circulation to the south-west of Marcus Island. On October 2 the system had organized enough to warrant further investigation. After {{a few days of}} observation, a report of tropical storm force <b>winds</b> was <b>relayed</b> back to the JTWC and on October 4 it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Violet. Violet took an unusual track, moving in a southern direction after formation. This was due to its location west of a high pressure system which the storm struggled to move around. After completing a curve to the south of the ridge, Violet quickly intensified into a typhoon. The movement of the subtropical ridge to the east resulted in Violet turning abruptly to the northwest. Violet continued to intensify and soon reached a peak intensity, on October 7, of 205 mph (335 km/h) and a minimal surface pressure of however, the wind readings during this era of reconnaissance were erroneously high. Violet moved in a smooth path northward and clipped the Boso Peninsula area of Japan, near Tokyo. After landfall Violet began to translate into an extra-tropical cyclone and continued to move northward. By October 10 Violet had become fully extra-tropical.|$|R

30|$|Typically, a {{relay station}} is a {{low-power}} and flexibly deployable base station that {{is able to}} provide complementary wireless access to the macrocell network within a short range [5]. In both the WiMAX and the long-term evolution (LTE) systems, the deployment of relay station is a cost-effective solution to improving downlink data rate {{as well as to}} extending cell coverages [2, 6]. In particular, when the relay station communicates with the nearby mobile stations using a low transmission power and only uses the non-conflict unlicensed band, it can work as a network enhancement device to provide enhanced service without taking additional resources of the macro base station, e.g., the frequency band and the transmission power. On the other hand, green communication is a new evolution trend in the telecommunication industry, which calls for the use of renewable energy, and improved energy efficiency [7]. The rapid development of the renewable energy technology makes the deployment of the energy harvesting (EH) relay station possible [8]. Utilizing the renewable energy, e.g., the energy harvested from the sun or <b>wind,</b> the EH <b>relay</b> station will not only have the flexible deployment capability but also consumes less amount of the traditional energy, leading to lower carbon emission [5, 9]. To optimally utilize the renewable energy, scheduling for the energy harvesting transmitters is also discussed [10 – 12].|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} clean, {{renewable}} energy {{has resulted in}} new mandates to augment, {{and in some cases}} replace conventional, fossil based generation with renewable generation resources. Wind generation is among those resources that have {{been at the center of}} attention. These resources are environmentally friendly, renewable, and they do not produce green-house gases. Therefore, there has been a significant growth in the integration of wind power into power systems networks in recent years. This structural change in power systems results, however, in new concerns regarding the reliable and secure operation of the power system with high penetration of wind energy conversion systems. This thesis investigates the impact of large doubly-fed induction generator- and full- frequency converter-based wind farms on the performance of generator distance phase backup protection (Relay (21)) and the generator capability curves. In this context, comprehensive studies are conducted on a sample power system incorporating large DFIG- and FFC-based wind farms tapped to the transmission system. The results of these studies which provide an in-depth assessment of Relay (21) performance in the presence of this type of wind energy conversion systems show that a wind farm tapped to a transmission line has an adverse effect on the distance phase backup protection of a nearby generator. The severity of such an impact varies according to the fault type and its location. Moreover, the adverse effect of the <b>wind</b> farms on <b>Relay</b> (21) performance extends to affect the coordination between generator distance phase backup protection and the generator overexcited capability limits. Such an impact varies also according to the fault type, fault location and generator loading.

We will design {{a system which}} will combine inputs from solar and wind energy production to ensure the pump will have enough power to run. This will create a system powered by clean energy and will be self-sustained once completed. This will theoretically create a more sustainable source of power for the pump than {{only one of the}} sources. Because the power sources don’t require outside inputs (aside from sun and wind), the pump can be placed in a remote area. This could be very helpful in developing communities, where residents may not have a reliable power supply. This system will allow these types of communities to pump water from wells to bring back to their homes. This will also reduce dependence on non-renewable sources of energy. The system will consist of a solar panel, wind turbine, control system to integrate the sources, and the water pump. The system will be made to require minimal user input to run. Inside the control system, two DC-DC buck converters are used to regulate input voltages. Two diodes are used to joint 2 input sources and prevent backflow of energy. This method is selected instead of MISO (Multiple Inputs Single Output) converter due to its simplicity. An Arduino Uno microcontroller powered by AtMega 328 p microprocessor is used for displaying power reading from the two sources and the load.

40|$|During {{the course}} of a transformer's {{operational}} life, it experiences many challenges to its insulation. Chemical stresses, such as moisture in insulating oil, deteriorate insulation chemically. Mechanical stresses and thermal stresses, such as those experienced during a large external fault, also contribute to weakening a transformer's insulation. Once these stresses have weakened the insulation to the point of breakdown, a fault may occur between windings of the transformer. These faults, known as turn-to-turn faults, are difficult to detect electrically at the terminals of the transformer until they have grown to the point of damaging the transformer beyond repair. Current differential transformer protection is a simple, reliable, and cost effect method of detecting turn-to-turn faults. This method of protection is only able to detect faults involving 10 % of the windings or more. The sensitivity of current differential protection is limited as not to cause false tripping due to normal imbalances in current. Such imbalances in current may occur when a tapchanger is used to increase or decrease the voltage {{on one side of the}} transformer. Digital current differential relays, which monitor tap changer position, compensate for current imbalances due to tapchanger operation. Other causes of current imbalance include current transformer saturation, magnetizing inrush current, and over-excitation. A transformer is designed to operate continuously at 10 % above its rated voltage. In this overexcited state, a current imbalance appears which causes a differential current to be sensed by the current differential relay. This limits the current differential relay's sensitivity as it must be designed to ignore current imbalances due to the aforementioned causes. The current differential transformer protection algorithm, which only makes use of the current magnitude, is based on the principles of an electromechanical relay. Digital relays are capable of computing the negative sequence current on both primary and secondary sides of the transformer along with the phase difference between these two negative sequence currents. By using both phase and magnitude information, negative sequence current could be used to detect turn-to-turn faults involving 3 % of the transformer's windings or more. Turn-to-turn faults may still occur even if no current is flowing on one side of the transformer, such as during energization. With no current flowing in the secondary windings of the transformer, negative sequence current based algorithms become insensitive. A transformer is particularly likely to experience a turn-to-turn fault during this time due to the stresses of energization. This thesis introduces a relay prototype, using both negative sequence current and negative sequence voltage, which retains its sensitivity during energization. This prototype was constructed using a micro-controller and an analog-to-digital conversion board. The transformer protection relay algorithm, including all hardware interface code and signal processing code, was then designed to suit the prototype's hardware. A 3 -phase transformer real-time simulation model, capable of simulating turn-to-turn faults as well as the magnetic properties of the transformer's core, was developed. The voltage and current waveforms generated by the transformer model, running in the real-time simulator, were used to test the relay prototype. The sensitivity and speed of the relay algorithm proposed in this thesis was then tested, for faults involving 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 25 % of the windings along with two commonly encountered transformer <b>winding</b> configurations. The <b>relay's</b> performance for several commonly encountered system scenarios such as over-excitation, current transformer saturation, non-zero fault resistance, transformer energization, and external faults were also examined for several turn-to-turn fault severities. A fault resistance of one Ohm is typical for transformer turn-to-turn faults. These test results were compared to current differential protection with second harmonic restraint. The experimental results presented in this work indicate that the algorithm proposed in this thesis is faster and more sensitive than restrained current differential protection and capable of detecting turn-to-turn faults occurring during transformer energization...|$|R
