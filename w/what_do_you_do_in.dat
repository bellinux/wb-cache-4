50|$|Emotional {{approach}} coping can {{be assessed}} using the emotional approach coping scales developed by Stanton, Kirk, Cameron, and Danoff-Burg in 2000. The scales involve two distinct subscales of items: emotional processing and emotional expression. Emotional processing and emotional expression scales are positively correlated but distinct. The emotional processing items reflect an attempt to understand, consider and examine emotions {{in response to a}} stressful event. For example, “I acknowledge my feelings” and “I take time to figure out what I’m really feeling.” Emotional expression items assess attempts to verbally and non-verbally communicate and share emotions. Sample items include: “I allow myself to express my feelings” and “I feel free to express my emotions.” The emotional approach coping scales have been tested and validated using situational (i.e., <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> response to a specific stressor) and dispositional (i.e., <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> general) instruction sets. The scales are uncorrelated with social desirability. In addition to English, the emotional approach coping scale has also been validated in Norwegian and Turkish.|$|E

40|$|Mighty baobab Professor Gordana Kanjac-Berisavljevic Sustainable Land Management, Ghana Suggested {{introduction}} Of all African trees, {{perhaps the}} baobab {{is the most}} wonderful. These mighty trees can live {{for as long as}} five thousand years. The baobab has provided us with food for generations. In fact its seeds were found in the stomach of a man who lived on earth thirty thousand years ago. This shows that this tree has long been an important source of food. But despite its long history, eating the baobab has been going out of fashion. However there are signs it is making a comeback, with growing demand in European markets and in semi-arid areas of Africa. Professor Gordana is team leader of a sustainable land management project in northern Ghana. She is enthusiastic about baobab, and she explained to Benedict Komba where in Ghana, and when, the baobab is especially important. Track 3 In	?In northern parts of Ghana? Out	?improve life of the rural people. ? Duration	 4 ? 04 ? Suggested closing announcement: A report on the baobab tree, which has many uses and can live for more than 5000 years. Contact details: Professor Gordana Kanjac-Berisavljevic Vice-Dean Faculty of Agriculture University for Development Studies, Tamale, P. O. Box TL 1882 N, Ghana Email:gordanak@gmail. com Transcript Berisavljevic	In northern parts of Ghana very close to Burkina Faso there is a hungry period every year between January and June. A hungry season means that people subsist on two meals a day and they reduce to only one. It is in June, towards the end, that early millet is harvested and then the diet improves but before that period it is really very difficult and people collect products from the wild. Komba	How can baobab help to feed people in Ghana? Berisavljevic	We have evidence of research for over seventy years that in these particular poor rural communities baobab is always used to support feeding, as part of the diet in this hungry season. This is when all parts of the baobab tree are used to supplement the diet. Komba	May you describe the nutrients that can be available in baobab? Berisavljevic	Baobab is very rich in vitamins. It is now increasingly becoming a medicinal plant. The European market is highly interested in imports of baobab and there are already very strict regulations on what baobab products are to be imported. Particularly interesting is the pulp from the fruit, which is dried and used in a variety of energy drinks, snacks. Komba	And if a person wants to know how does a baobab tree look like, how can you describe it? Berisavljevic	It is probably the largest tree in your environment, it can be five metres wide and it is very old. It normally, some people describe it as having roots upside, up in the air, when there are no leaves on it. It can live up to 5, 000 years and is generally available everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa in drier environment. Komba	Which parts of the baobab are mostly used? Berisavljevic	In our communities where I did my study people use everything, they use each and every part of the tree. The bark is used as the firewood for local beer production. Roots are used for medicinal and spiritual purposes. The fresh leaves are used as a sauce, dry leaves are sold, fruit is eaten fresh as a snack. Pulp is dried and then added to the local staple food, and seeds are cracked and mixed with the local leafy vegetable. So there is really no part that is not useful in the traditional system. Komba	If we come to the fruits themselves, how do they look like? Are they so big or so small and what about their seeds? Berisavljevic	They are not too big, they are not too small, their size is maybe comparable to the smaller types of papaya in size. And they are a little bit difficult to crack but inside is a delicious pulp, which especially children like as a snack. That pulp surrounds seeds which are more or less black and then they are also used. Komba	And how do the seeds or the fruits taste? Berisavljevic	They taste very nice. They can be added to ice cream, and then the people also use it for porridge, for traditional meals and so on. Nobody complains about the baobab flavour! It is very nice. Komba	It seems that this baobab is among those neglected plants, so <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> your country to popularise it? Berisavljevic	Yes we are trying to show people that they can add value and process and export this product because {{there is a lot of}} market and then that will probably improve life of the rural people. End of track. The baobab tree has been used by man as a source of food and other materials for tens of thousands of years. In some parts of Africa, such as northern Ghana, the leaves, seeds and fruit pulp are a vitamin rich supplement to diets, particularly during the hungry season. The roots are also valued for their medicinal properties and there is growing interest in baobab products in the European market. As such, baobab deserves attention, having potential for adding value, processing and exporting of products, thereby boosting local economies...|$|E

40|$|New {{sources of}} {{resources}} CUE: Protecting natural forests from over-exploitation {{can be a}} difficult business. Many forest communities {{find it hard to}} believe that their natural forest resources can ever be finished. They may argue that their parents and grandparents have always used the forest, so why should they change their way of life? One way of convincing them of the need to use their forest in a sustainable way might be to show them some areas where the forests have been lost, and let them talk to the communities there. Indeed, this is one of the methods being tried by the Kalup National Park Project in south-west Cameroon. In our next report, Dr Hanson Njiforti, the project manager, talks to Martha Chindong about how the Kalup project has been helping local communities to get the right balance between conservation and exploitation. The park itself has become a ?no go? area for local people, but at the same time they have received some benefits from increased tourism in the area, and the project has also tried to introduce alternative ways for them to get vital resources and income. IN:		?When people don?t derive ? OUT:		? to show them examples. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 13 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Hanson Njiforti, showing how experience has been the best teacher for rainforest communities in Cameroon. Transcript Njiforti	When people don?t derive any benefit from whatever you want to conserve, it will be very difficult for you, right through your work. And when you are conserving a forest, you take care of the conservation aspect itself, conservation proper, and you take care of the needs of the people, what economic benefits people will have. So with us, the conservation aspect is mainly the national park. We have also community forests, where people exploit these forests and use the money for their own development. So we have development activities out of the national park, and in the national park we are doing conservation proper. Chindong	So how are the people around benefiting from this conservation proper? Njiforti	You can imagine that when tourists come to the park, they leave money. People who are working, taking care of tourists get money; the hotels and bar owners and so on get money from the tourists. Chindong	Apart from tourists coming to bring in some money for the local people, are there other ways they are gaining from this sustainable management of the forest? Njiforti	We have tried to teach people, for example, to grow non-timber forest products, like ?gansa?, ?eru?, those commonly used spices that women used to trek for hours to go and harvest; most of them can now grow them in their backyard. So a lot of people are cultivating these and they are selling. You get a truckload of all these ?eru?s and ?gansa? from the area, delivering it to other towns in Cameroon, and even out of Cameroon to our neighbouring countries. Chindong	That is an idea for keeping them out of the forest, from harvesting those trees. What of livestock? Njiforti	OK, as you might not have realised, domestic cattle do not do very well in the project area. We have to improve a local breed called a ?muturu? cattle, which is very resistant to trypanosomiasis. So that was one way of stopping them from going into the forest for wildlife. We promoted piggery and all other aspects linked to animal husbandry. Chindong	When you say ?promote? <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> actual terms? Njiforti	For the moment we are working with muturu cattle in collaboration with FAO. This breed was almost disappearing, and we have tried to promote breeding and increase the breeding of these cattle, and the population is increasing actually. Piggery, the project in the past did a lot to teach people how to do piggery, poultry and everything, and many people are already doing their own piggery. Chindong	As somebody working with farmers in the fields, what do you think are the best sustainable forest management practices? Njiforti	If people have never realised anything important in the forest, it will be very difficult for them to buy any ideas that you are selling. You need to show people that if they manage their forest well, they will get more income; if they manage their forest well, they can leave something for their children; if they manage their forest well, they will have basic natural resources constantly. But it is very difficult to sell sometimes. Chindong	Yes, they will always think that their parents lived on this forest and they left the forest for them. Njiforti	You know, people in the village might be thinking in terms of ?my grandfather?, twenty years or ten years. When we are talking conservation, we are talking hundreds of years, and it is very difficult to perceive this at the level of the village where our knowledge is limited to that of our grandfather and our grandmother. What we do now for example, is to take people to other areas where the resources are already finished. They will get the stories from the people from there, and that is when the people believe that their own too might one day disappear, because many people don?t believe it when you say, ?If we exploit irrationally these animals may disappear. ? They say ?It?s a lie! My grandfather used to use it!? So the best way is to show them examples. End of track. The project manager at Kalup National Park in Cameroon explains how local rainforest communities, who have lost their access to the park are being supported in finding new ways to earn income, and how the project is making them aware of the need to manage their community forests sustainably...|$|E
