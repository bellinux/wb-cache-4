40|$|International audienceWorm gears {{are widely}} used in power {{transmission}} applications, in which a compact high reduction and a relatively low speed drive is required. This paper presents a numerical model developed to compute the quasi-static load sharing. This method uses the equation of displacement compatibility and the influence coefficient method, which allows a fast and accurate computing. The bending deflections of the gear teeth and worm threads, and the local contact deformations of mating surfaces are included. The bending deflections of the gears are determined with the combination of: only one standard FEM computation and interpolation functions. To calculate the local contact deformations, the Boussinesq theory is used. The model allows to obtain numerous results, such as the load sharing, the contact pressure distribution or the loaded transmission error. The method allows {{taking into account the}} environment of the gear meshing, such as the actual shafts, rim, <b>web,</b> <b>bearing</b> locations...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of a concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) column and reinforced concrete (RC) beam produces a composite structural system that affords good structural performance, functionality, and workability. The effective transmission of moments and shear forces from the beam to the column {{is key to the}} full exploitation of the structural performance. The studs of the composite beam transfer the interfacial shear force between the steel beam and the concrete slab, with the <b>web</b> <b>bearing</b> most of the vertical shear force of the steel beam. In this study, the studs and vertical steel plate were welded to facilitate the transfer of the interfacial shear force between the RC beam and CFST column. Six groups of a total of 18 specimens were used to investigate the shear transfer mechanism and failure mode of the plate-studs connection, which was confirmed to effectively transmit the shear forces between the beam and column. The results of theoretical calculations were also observed to be in good agreement with the experimental measurements...|$|E
40|$|Bearing {{failure is}} a form of {{localized}} failure that occurs when thin-walled cold-formed steel sections are subjected to concentrated loads or support reactions. To determine the bearing capacity of cold-formed channel sections, a unified design equation with different bearing coefficients is given in the current North American specification AISI S 100 and the Australian/New Zealand standard AS/NZS 4600. However, coefficients are not available for unlipped channel sections that are normally fastened to supports through their flanges. Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 includes bearing capacity equations for different load cases, but does not distinguish between fastened and unfastened support conditions. Therefore, an experimental study was conducted to determine the bearing capacities of these sections as used in floor systems. Twenty-eight <b>web</b> <b>bearing</b> tests on unlipped channel sections with restrained flanges were conducted under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Using the results from this study, a new equation was proposed within the AISI S 100 and AS/NZS 4600 guidelines to determine the bearing capacities of cold-formed unlipped channels with flanges fastened to supports. A new design rule was also proposed based on the direct strength method...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a numerical model {{to predict the}} wear of worm gear. This last is based on well-known Archard’swear formulation. The influence of lubrication is taken into account with a local wear coefficient, depending on the ratiobetween the minimum lubricant film thickness and the amplitude of the surface roughness. When material on a wheelflank is worn, it is then necessary to update the surface profile, consequently the contact pressure calculations. Tocompute the quasi-static load sharing and thus the contact pressures required for the wear model, the equation ofdisplacement compatibility is solved, using the influence coefficient method, which allows a fast and accurate computing. The bending deflections of the worm and wheel, and the local contact deformations of mating surfaces are included. TheBoussinesq theory is applied for calculating the local contact deformations. The bending {{is determined by the}} combinationof only one standard finite element method computation and interpolation functions. This method allows takinginto account the environment of the gear meshing, such as the actual shafts, rim, <b>web,</b> <b>bearing</b> locations, which affect thequasi-static results and thus the wear. In addition, the model allows to obtain numerous results, such as load sharing,contact pressures distribution, transmission error, stiffness, wear distribution, etc. A comparison between theoreticalwear predictions and experimental results, issued from the literature, are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Meeting the heath {{care needs}} of {{patients}} {{is becoming more}} complex as individuals are living longer and often with multiple chronic health conditions. In Canada, the majority of patients will die in hospitals (Statistics Canada, 2009), many on medical units. Studies of hospital care have shown that end-of-life care (EOLC) could be improved. Qualitative nursing research studies on EOLC in hospital medical units have been few. More needs to be known about nurses’ experience of providing EOLC within the medical unit environment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to seek to understand the lived experience of nurses on a medical unit providing EOLC to patients. Interpretive phenomenology using van Manen’s (1990) approach guided the methodology and analysis of the findings. Face to face interviews with 10 nurses on two hospital medical units were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed. The underlying essence of these nurses’ experience was that of “battling a tangled web”. Battling a tangled web represented the nurses’ struggles in attempting to provide EOLC in an environment which was not always conducive to it. Seven themes were generated from the analysis of the data: caring in complexity, caught in a tangled <b>web,</b> <b>bearing</b> witness to suffering, weaving a way to get there: struggling through the process, creating comfort for the patient, working through the dying process with the family, and finding a way through the web. These findings add to our growing knowledge of nurses’ roles and actions as part of EOLC. It also highlights nurses’ perceived facilitators and barriers to EOLC within the medical environment...|$|E
40|$|Steel joints {{have always}} been {{considered}} as important parts of any structural steel building because they provide the strong links between the principal structural members. The properties and behaviour of joints in both steel and composite structures have been widely studied for some time. The focus has recently been on improving the design of structural frames {{by taking advantage of}} realistic connection moment-rotation response. This has necessitated the development of an effective and practicable methodology to describe steel connection behaviour, despite its inherent complexity. Although, the evaluation of steel connections' performance at ambient temperature has been a continuous research topic, the investigation of steel connections at elevated temperatures has only recently been tackled by researchers. However, the determination of the behaviour, available strength and stiffness of moment connections in fire conditions has been a dominant theme in these research works. Moreover, {{over a number of years}} the Component Method has been developed to describe the moment-rotation characteristics of end-plate connections, and the method is now included in Eurocode 3. To date, most of the research conducted on steel connections using the component method has focused on relatively stiff and strong connections - flush end-plates and extended end-plates. The modelling of more flexible ("pinned") connections using the Component Method has not received much attention, since the benefits arising from consideration of their behaviour in overall frame response are usually modest. However, in fire conditions connections are subject to complex force combinations of moment and tying forces, as well as vertical shear forces, and the real behaviour, even of nominally pinned connections, can have a significant effect on the overall response of the frame. To date very little information on the behaviour and the resistance of simple shear connections in fire conditions has been generated. Fin plate shear connections, which are economic to fabricate and easy to use in erection, are among these shear connections which are assumed to act as pins in normal service conditions In this research, the behaviour and robustness of simple fin plate beam-to-column connections has been investigated, under the conditions of catenary tension from highly deflected beams which occurs in fire. In addition, detailed investigations have been made on applying the component method approach to this connection at both ambient and elevated temperatures. ABAQUS software has been selected to create a very detailed 3 D finite element model. This is a complex model accounting for material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behaviour. The connection model has been analysed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. Bolt shear and bending, plate and <b>web</b> <b>bearing</b> have been observed as failure modes. A comparison between available experimental data at ambient and elevated temperatures and FEA results shows that the model has a high level of accuracy. However, by implementing the FE model the opportunity was then available to explore the connection tying resistance and the application of the Component Method to the fin plate connection. An intensive investigation has been conducted to develop a representation of this connection type via a simplified component model, enabling prediction of the connection response at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The three main components of a fin-plate connection have been identified as plate bearing, bolt shearing and web-to-plate friction. These components have been described in detail at ambient and elevated temperatures via intensive parametric FE analyses, leading to a simplified component model of a fin plate connection. This model has been evaluated against FE models of complete fin plate joints. Eventually, a fin plate connection spring model is proposed and successfully evaluated for tying, rotation, and shear actions. The Component Model presented in this research offers an opportunity to explore complicated behaviour of fin plate shear joints, and can be incorporated into frame analysis in fire conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the development of}} a new type of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) beam for use in civil engineering systems. After a detailed evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of current FRP beam technology, a different approach is proposed which combines traditional laminates with a novel casting technique. To pre-dimension the beam, the classical beam theory is adapted to allow for FRP materials. The resulting formulae were used to determine critical parameters, such as laminate thickness and location in the cross-section, and core dimensions, and to identify failure modes. Based on the results of this analytical study, a detailed testing program was developed. In addition to classical tests, such as bending, shear, and lateral torsion, the performance of the beam was also examined under particular loading regimes specifically designed to induce local failure modes, such as buckling of the <b>web</b> and <b>bearing</b> failure of the section under concentrated loads. The experimental results revealed very good agreement with the analytical predictions. These results were corroborated by a detailed non-linear finite-element analysis, including core cracking and laminate damage. This analysis, in particular, highlighted the synergy between bending and shear behaviour of the beam. This study has revealed that this new type of FRP beam behaves in a predictable manner. Furthermore, the experimental results verified that the cross-section, which combines traditional laminates with cast polymer concrete, did not suffer from many of the disadvantages identified in current FRP beams. The cracking of the polymer concrete under shear, however, does cause the beam to fail prior to the laminates reaching their ultimate shear stress...|$|R

A nonlinear finite element model was developed and verified against the test results in terms of failure buckling modes. It was concluded that the M-V interaction equation for specimens with web stiffeners was conservative where these specimens experienced plastic failure mode rather than local (Msl) or distortional (Msd) buckling mode.

The mathematical model of the shaft line with all associated parameters and boundary conditions are represented by calculation results and validated by measurement. An everyday example for the calculation of coupled axial vibrations with the associated measured data is shown in this paper.

40|$|Cold-formed steel {{members have}} many {{advantages}} over hot-rolled steel members. However, they {{are susceptible to}} various buckling modes at stresses below the yield stress of the member because of their relatively high width-to-thickness ratio. Web crippling {{is a form of}} localized failure mode that can occur when the members are subjected to transverse high concentrated loadings and/or reactions. The four common loading conditions are the end-one-flange (EOF), interior-one-flange (IOF), end-two-flange (ETF) and interior-two-flange (ITF) loadings. Recently a test method has been proposed by AISI to obtain the web crippling capacities under these four loading conditions. Using this test method 42 tests were conducted in this research to investigate the web crippling behavior and strengths of unlipped channels with stocky webs under ETF and ITF cases. DuraGal sections having a nominal yield stress of 450 MPa were tested with different <b>web</b> slenderness and <b>bearing</b> lengths. The flanges of these channel sections were not fastened to the supports.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the degree of influence of holes in the web of steel beams with long spanson weakening of their bearing capacity. Making holes in the web of the beam generally reduces the bearing capacity of the beam. However, it might be necessary seen from both an architectural perspective {{as well as from}} a building services perspective by creating an opportunity for building installations. The objective of this thesis is to examine how much an I-beam can be weakened without sacrificing safety and functionality. The investigation has been done by using Finite Element Method through commercial software. The regulation for structural design of building structures in Sweden used to be specified in the document known as BKR. But this was replaced by the European norm Eurocode back in May 2011. Starting from the transition between the norms, it is essential to investigate and define whether they differ and if so, what the consequences are of these possible differences. A secondary objective is therefore to define possible differences in structural design calculations between Eurocode 3 and BSK 07, which are the design rules for dimensioning of steel structures with Eurocode respectively BKR. The thesis work has been carried out in collaboration with Bjerking AB. The thesis has been divided into three sections: load calculations, structural design of single elements and finally the impact of the weakening by holes on bearing capacity. The following three structural elements have been studied:  Welded I-beam Welded I-beam with weakenings Truss beam The results from the structural design show that Eurocode demands more calculations than the BKR. However, Eurocode has in almost all cases indicated lower degree of utilization. This will most likely lead to lower material costs since less dimensions of structural elements is achieved. Eurocode has also showed lower limit for the effect of shear buckling during the structural design for shear resistance. The results from the analysis of the impact of <b>web</b> weakening on <b>bearing</b> capacity show that circular holes lead to higher bearing capacity than quadratic holes. Furthermore, the results show that the shear resistance of the beam, in principle, proportionally decreases with the area loss of the beam web. Regarding normal stresses, the analysis show that the most critical points to be considered in circular holes are at the very top and the very bottom of the edges of the hole where the largest compression stresses and tension stresses occur. Weakening of an I-beam’s web will also increase the vertical deformation of the beam in serviceability limit state but this increase of deformation is very small. The study has for example showed that a welded I-beam with span of 30 meters, height of 1300 mm, web thickness of 15 mm, flange width of 400 mm and flange thickness of 20 mm can accommodate 23 centered circular holes with diameter of 800 mm and center distance of 1200 mm without sacrificing safety and functionality. These holes result in a weight reduction of the beam from 8290 kg to 6930 kg...|$|R
