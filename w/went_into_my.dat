500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if I can help it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But every time I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Also," [...] cried Herr Heinrich, facing {{another aspect}} of his distresses, [...] "how am I to pack my things? Since I have been here I have bought many things, many books, and two pairs of white flannel {{trousers}} and some shirts and a tin instrument that I cannot work, for developing privately Kodak films. All this must <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> little portmanteau. And it will not <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> little portmanteau! ...|$|R

500|$|At {{the age of}} 52, {{he began}} to revive his career and started taking acting classes, {{something}} he had not thought about after being cast in Neighbours. He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is you will get cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head. I thought if I go for roles those guys would go for I'm more likely to get them." [...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the album, Dylan became seriously ill with near-fatal histoplasmosis. His forthcoming tour was canceled, and {{he spent most of}} June 1997 in excruciating pain. A potentially serious condition (caused by the fungal infection histoplasma capsulatum), it makes breathing very difficult. [...] "It was something called histoplasmosis that came from just accidentally inhaling a bunch of stuff that was out on one of the rivers by where I live," [...] said Dylan. [...] "Maybe one month, or two to three days out of the year, the banks around the river get all mucky, and then the wind blows and a bunch of swirling mess is in the air. I happened to inhale a bunch of that. That's what made me sick. It <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> heart area, but it wasn't anything really attacking my heart," [...] Dylan told Guitar World magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} work on Escape from L.A., John Carpenter {{was thinking about}} quitting filmmaking because [...] "it stopped being fun". Largo Entertainment approached him with a project called Vampires, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Steakley. They gave him two screenplays; each by Don Jakoby and Dan Mazur, respectively. Carpenter read both screenplays and the novel, and he saw the potential for a film he'd been interested in making. [...] "I <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>my</b> office and thought, 'It's going to be set in the American southwest and it's a western – Howard Hawks.'" [...] Vampires gave Carpenter the chance to do a western disguised as a horror film," [...] he said. [...] "The story is set up like a western. It's about killers for hire. They're a western cliché. In this movie they’re paid to kill vampires." [...] In terms of tone and look, Carpenter felt that his film was [...] "a little more like The Wild Bunch than Hawks in its style, but the feelings and the whole ending scene is a kind of replay on Red River." ...|$|E
