In a certain evaluation period, the technical and economic evaluation for <b>wire-line</b> <b>coring</b> and simulation roundtrip coring in ZK 3 borehole conducted by net present value (NPV) method, the result shows that, in ZK 3 borehole, comparing with roundtrip coring, the drilling efficiency of <b>wire-line</b> <b>coring</b> method improved by 85 %, the profit is 6. 3 times than roundtrip coring, its technical economy is more obvious along with the depth increase. The sensibility analysis shows, the most sensitivity factors effecting on the borehole efficiency are construction price and construction period...|$|E

40|$|The Gamburtsev Mountains, {{located in}} East Antarctica, is the direct geomorphological {{cause of the}} {{formation}} of Dome A. Drilling the core of the Gamburtsev subglacial mountains is one of the primary goals of modern polar research, which is important to understand its formation and evolution process, the ice sheet formation of Dome A, glacial motion, climate change, and so on. This paper describes the status and progress of subglacial bedrock drilling technology. Existing subglacial bedrock drilling technologies are also discussed, including common rig rotary drilling, <b>wire-line</b> <b>core</b> drilling, coiled tubing drilling, and electromechanical drilling. Results of this paper will provide valuable information for Chinese subglacial bedrock core drilling project in the Gamburtsev mountains. 東南極大陸にあるガンブルツェフ山脈はドームAを形成する直接的な地形要因である。氷床下にあるガンブルツェフ山脈の掘削は、現代の極地観測の重要なゴールの一つであり、ドームAを形成する氷床の形成・変動プロセス、気候変動などが解明できる。本論文は、氷床下岩盤掘削技術の現状と進捗状況について述べる。既存の氷床下岩盤掘削技術も議論している。これには、一般的なロータリー掘削工法、吊り下げ式コア掘削、フレキシブルチューブ掘削、電動式掘削を含む。本論文の結果は、ガンブルツェフ山脈における中国の氷床下岩盤掘削へ価値ある情報を提供する...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{determine}} the performance of the solid low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) disposal units located on a mesa top at TA- 54, Area G, Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Los Alamos, NM, and to provide in-situ (vadose zone) site characterization information to Area G`s Performance Assessment. The vadose zone beneath an active disposal unit (DU 37), was accessed by utilizing low-impact, air-rotary horizontal drilling technology. Core samples were pulled, via <b>wire-line</b> <b>core</b> method, in 3 horizontal holes fanning out below DU 37 at approximately 5 foot intervals depending on recovery percentage. Samples were surveyed and prepared in-field following Environmental Restoration (ER) guidelines. Samples were transferred from the field to the CST- 9 Radvan for initial radiological screening. Following screening, samples were delivered to CST- 3 analytical lab for analyses including moisture content, 23 inorganics, 60 volatile organic compounds (VOC`s), 68 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC`s), tritium, lead 210, radium 226 & 228, cesium 137, isotopic plutonium, americium 241, strontium 90, isotopic uranium, and isotopic thorium. Other analyses included matric potential, alpha spectroscopy, gamma spectroscopy, and gross alpha/beta. The overall results of the analysis identified only tritium as having migrated from the DU. Am- 241, Eu- 152, and Pu- 238 were possibly identified above background but the results are not definitive. Of all organics analysed for, only ethyl acetate was tentatively identified slightly above background. All inorganics were found to be well below regulatory limits. Based on the results of the above mentioned analyses, it was determined that Area G`s disposal units are performing well and no significant liquid phase migration of contaminants has occurred...|$|R

40|$|In February 2007, the U. S. Department of Energy, BP Exploration (Alaska), Inc., and the U. S. Geological Survey {{conducted}} an extensive data collection effort at the "Mount Elbert # 1 " gas hydrates stratigraphic test {{well on the}} Alaska North Slope (ANS). The 22 -day field program acquired significant gas hydrate-bearing reservoir data, including a full suite of open-hole well logs, over 500 feet of continuous core, and open-hole formation pressure response tests. Hole conditions, and therefore log data quality, were excellent due largely {{to the use of}} chilled oil-based drilling fluids. The logging program confirmed the existence of approximately 30 m of gashydrate saturated, fine-grained sand reservoir. Gas hydrate saturations were observed to range from 60 % to 75 % largely as a function of reservoir quality. Continuous <b>wire-line</b> <b>coring</b> operations (the first conducted on the ANS) achieved 85 % recovery through 153 meters of section, providing more than 250 subsamples for analysis. The "Mount Elbert" data collection program culminated with open-hole tests of reservoir flow and pressure responses, as well as gas and water sample collection, using Schlumberger's Modular Formation Dynamics Tester (MDT) wireline tool. Four such tests, ranging from six to twelve hours duration, were conducted. This field program demonstrated the ability to safely and efficiently conduct a research-level openhole data acquisition program in shallow, sub-permafrost sediments. The program also demonstrated the soundness of the program's pre-drill gas hydrate characterization methods and increased confidence in gas hydrate resource assessment methodologies for the ANS...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of a small-scale drilling project at the Colli Albani volcanic district (Central Italy), a 350 m deep borehole was drilled for 1) {{a better understanding of the}} shallow crust structure under the volcanic complex, which is considered now quiescent, by characterization of litho-stratigraphic units, 2) the definition of present-day stress field and 3) good seismic recordings in a urbanized area, by a broad-band seismometer installed at 200 m depth. We describe the investigations carried out at the drill site, first results of laboratory analysis and other ongoing studies. We want to highlight the amount of data coming from a relatively small hole, the wide range of different disciplines involved in the studies that can be done and the general contribution to the volcano-tectonics, with final application to hazard evaluations. The borehole is located in an area of the volcanic complex where most of the seismic swarms occurred and where an uplift was recognized by geodetic investigations and satellite images analysis. In addition, gas concentrations (mainly CO 2 and H 2 S) in the aquifers are high, local tectonics is peculiar and seems quite different from the regional trend. There is, however, still a lack of active stress data. The borehole was drilled <b>wire-line</b> with continuous <b>coring</b> and a very good core recovery in the volcanic units (tuffs and lavas) and in the underlying sedimentary basement of Plio-Pleistocene sands and clays. A detailed stratigraphic log was built, also thanks to biostratigraphic and petrographic analysis. A blow–out from the deeper sandy unit occurred while a hydraulic fracturing test was about to start and did not allow to continue the tests. Fluid and gas were sampled providing information about deep fluid flow and the likely connection to a deep-seated magma chamber. The following wire-line logs were performed: gamma-ray, resistivity, sonic, caliper, borehole televiewer (BHTV) and magnetic susceptibility. The data were compared with laboratory investigations (e. g. mechanical, magnetic analysis) to define the rock parameters, useful for a better comprehension of the different units behavior under different P and T conditions and their seismic response. Caliper and BHTV provided data that helps to interpret the main tectonic characters and the present-day stress field...|$|R
