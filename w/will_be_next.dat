Hagrid asks the three of them to look after Grawp if he himself must leave the school. Sure enough, Umbridge leads a party of Aurors to attack Hagrid in his house one night. Hagrid overpowers them and flees the school; McGonagall, trying to disrupt the violence, is badly injured and is put in St. Mungo's Hospital.|$|E

500|$|It is {{apparent}} {{that there is a}} consistent plan by some to create chaos around Beyoncé's B'Day album release on September 4 in the US. First, it was a petition against the single, 'Déjà Vu', then a rumor regarding conflict between Beyoncé and Rihanna, seizures caused by the 'Ring the Alarm' video, putting out a single to compete with LeToya's album and now to add to all the ridiculous rumors, is my plan to postpone the release of her 'B'Day' album. What <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>next?</b> Beyoncé's cut off all her hair? Dyed it green? Maybe she's singing the songs in reverse with some hidden subliminal message! ...|$|E
500|$|Following the Dutch general election, 2010, {{in which}} the PVV was the third biggest party, Wilders said Jordan should be renamed Palestine. The Jordanian {{government}} responded saying Wilders' speech was reminiscent of the Israeli right wing. His speech said [...] "Jordan is Palestine. Changing its name to Palestine will end {{the conflict in the}} Middle East and provide the Palestinians with an alternate homeland." [...] He also said Israel deserves a special status in the Dutch government because it was fighting for [...] "Jerusalem" [...] in its name. [...] "If Jerusalem falls {{into the hands of the}} Muslims, Athens and Rome <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>next.</b> Thus, Jerusalem is the main front protecting the West. It is not a conflict over territory but rather an ideological battle, between the mentality of the liberated West and the ideology of Islamic barbarism. There has been an independent Palestinian state since 1946, and it is the kingdom of Jordan." ...|$|E
