40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the mechanical strength of wounds closed with a combination of buried dermal absorbable sutures and superficial nonabsorbable nylon sutures will be higher than wounds closed with only superficial nonabsorbable nylon sutures. MethodsFour Yucatan pigs were anesthetized and each received four 4. 5 cm full thickness incisions on their dorsal surfaces, placed 8 cm apart. Half of all incisions were randomly allocated and repaired with 3 – 0 polyglactin 910 (Vicryl™) buried dermal absorbable sutures and superficial 3 – 0 nylon sutures, using a simple interrupted pattern. The other half received only 3 – 0 nylon sutures. Two pigs were humanely euthanized at day 10, with specimen harvest for mechanical testing; the other two pigs had superficial nylon sutures removed at day 10, as per current clinical practice, and were humanely euthanized at day 42, with specimen harvest for mechanical testing. Tensile loads were applied perpendicularly to the wounds with a displacement rate of 40 mm per minute. ResultsWounds at day 42 were > 9 times stronger than wounds at day 10 (p< 0. 0001). There was no difference in average wound strength at either day 10 or day 42 between wounds with and without buried dermal absorbable sutures. SignificanceBuried dermal absorbable sutures failed to provide additional <b>wound</b> <b>support</b> at either 10 or 42 days. This result may have immediate implications for clinicians who perform cutaneous surgery and keep superficial sutures in for at least 10 days. Future research will be directed to shorter time studies, other buried dermal absorbable suture materials, and alternatives to buried dermal absorbable sutures...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sternal {{precautions}} are utilized within {{many hospitals}} {{with the aim}} of preventing the occurrence of sternal complications (eg, infection, wound breakdown) following midline sternotomy. The evidence base for sternal precaution protocols, however, has been questioned due to a paucity of research, unknown effect on patient outcomes, and possible discrepancies in pattern of use among institutions. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate and document the use of sternal precautions by physical therapists in the treatment of patients following median sternotomy in hospitals throughout Australia, from immediately postsurgery to discharge from the hospital. Design: A cross-sectional, observational design was used. An anonymous, Web-based survey was custom designed for use in the study. Methods: The questionnaire was content validated, and the online functionality was assessed. The senior cardiothoracic physical therapist from each hospital identified as currently performing cardiothoracic surgery (N= 51) was invited to participate. Results: The response rate was 58. 8 % (n= 30). Both public (n= 18) and private (n= 12) hospitals in all states of Australia were represented. Management protocols reported by participants included <b>wound</b> <b>support</b> (n= 22), restrictions on lifting and transfers (n= 23), and restrictions on mobility aid use (n= 15). Factors influencing clinical practice most commonly included “workplace practices/protocols” (n= 27) and “clinical experience” (n= 22). Limitations: The study may be limited by response bias. Conclusions: Significant variation exists in the sternal precautions and protocols used in the treatment of patients following median sternotomy in Australian hospitals. Further research is needed to investigate whether the restrictions and precautions used are necessary and whether protocols have an impact on patient outcomes, including rates of recovery and length of stay...|$|E

40|$|Healthcare {{information}} technology systems are considered the ideal tool to inculcate evidence-based nursing practices. The <b>wound</b> clinical decision <b>support</b> system was built locally to support nurses to manage pressure ulcer wounds in their daily practice. However, its adoption rate is not optimal. The study&# 039;s objective was to discover the concepts that informed the RNs&# 039; decisions to adopt the <b>wound</b> clinical decision <b>support</b> system as an evidence-based technology in their nursing practice. This was an exploratory, descriptive, and qualitative design using face-to-face interviews, individual interviews, and active participatory observation. A purposive, theoretical sample of 14 RNs was recruited {{from one of the}} largest public tertiary hospitals in Singapore after obtaining ethics approval. After consenting, the nurses were interviewed and observed separately. Recruitment stopped when data saturation was reached. All transcribed interview data underwent a concurrent thematic analysis, whereas observational data were content analyzed independently and subsequently triangulated with the interview data. Eight emerging themes were identified, namely, use of the <b>wound</b> clinical decision <b>support</b> system, beliefs in the <b>wound</b> clinical decision <b>support</b> system, influences of the workplace culture, extent of the benefits, professional control over nursing practices, use of knowledge, gut feelings, and emotions (fear, doubt, and frustration).

25|$|The frills of ceratopsians are {{incredibly}} diverse. They {{may have been}} used for protective purposes as the frill sometimes splays over the neck. However, some say that the frill would have provided little protection from other large dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus. Other possible functions include intraspecific communication for mating purposes or as a visual display of territorial protection, as seen in many common day organisms such as red-breasted robins. The frills also could have been used for species recognition purposes, as they seem to develop fairly early in life. There has also been evidence that ceratopsians care for their young, as bone-beds have been found of adult individuals with a nest of juveniles, although some refute this as viable evidence of care for young. There have also been bone-beds found with hundreds of adult ceratopsians, indicating herd activity. A few specimens have been found with puncture <b>wounds,</b> <b>supporting</b> the use of horns as protective or combative weapons. Other research examining juvenile ceratopsians reveals a change in horn morphology over time, suggesting frills and horns could have been used for intraspecific communication of age. Horns also could have been used for thermoregulation as indicated by isotope analysis, as aid in knocking down vegetation, or for horn-locking agonistic behavior.|$|R

40|$|Bacterial {{colonization}} {{occurs in}} all wounds, chronic or acute, and {{the break in}} epithelium integrity that defines a wound impairs the forces that shape and constrain the microbiome at that site. This review highlights the interactions between bacterial communities in the wound and the ultimate resolution of the wound or development of fibrotic lesions. Chronic <b>wounds</b> <b>support</b> complex microbial communities comprising {{a wide variety of}} bacterial phyla, genera, and species, including some fastidious anaerobic bacteria not identified using culture‐based methods. Thus, the complexity of bacterial communities in wounds has historically been underestimated. There are a number of intriguing possibilities to explain these results that may also provide novel insights into changes and adaptation of bacterial metabolic networks in inflamed and wounded mucosa, including the critical role of biofilm formation. It is well accepted that the heightened state of activation of host cells in a wound that is driven by the microbiota can certainly lead to detrimental effects on wound regeneration, but the microbiota of the wound may also have beneficial effects on wound healing. Studies in experimental systems have clearly demonstrated a beneficial effect for members of the gut microbiota on regulation of systemic inflammation, which could also impact wound healing at sites outside the gastrointestinal tract. The utilization of culture‐independent microbiology to characterize the microbiome of wounds and surrounding mucosa has raised many intriguing questions regarding previously held notions about the cause and effect relationships between bacterial colonization and wound repair and mechanisms involved in this symbiotic relationship...|$|R
