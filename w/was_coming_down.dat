5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the {{darkness}} of the night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven remaining boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier who was about to bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E

25|$|The year 1869 {{began with}} Livingstone finding himself {{extremely}} ill {{while in the}} jungle. He was saved by Arab traders who gave him medicines and carried him to an Arab outpost. In March 1869, Livingstone suffered from pneumonia and arrived in Ujiji to find his supplies stolen. He <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> with cholera and had tropical ulcers on his feet, so he was again forced to rely on slave traders to get him as far as Bambara—where he was caught by the wet season. With no supplies, Livingstone had to eat his meals in a roped-off enclosure for the entertainment of the locals in return for food.|$|E
25|$|In June 1809, Napoleon {{placed the}} VI Corps under Marshal Nicolas Soult's command. With Ney's troops, plus the II and V Corps, Soult planned to sweep south and destroy Arthur Wellesley's British army. Wellesley beat King Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan at the Battle of Talavera on 28 July. When Spanish guerillas {{captured}} a French dispatch, the British general {{found out that}} Soult <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> from the north with three corps. Wellesley immediately bolted back toward Portugal and escaped the trap. During these operations, Ney's advanced guard clashed with a column under Robert Thomas Wilson at the Battle of Puerto de Baños on 12 August, but Marchand's troops were not engaged.|$|E
25|$|In late December 1934 the Ulmarra {{was partly}} disabled, {{by the loss}} of a {{propeller}} blade when the blade was snapped off when it came into contact with a submerged object in the Clarence River the Nimbin came to assistance and towed the Ulmarra the voyage of nearly 300 miles. The master of the Ulmarra (Captain Bysanton) said that the Ulmarra was not rendered helpless by the accident, and she could, if necessary, have steamed unaided, but as the motor ship Nimbin, <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> to Sydney from Richmond River it was considered advisable for her to assist.

25|$|Between 3 and 7 August 1811, Freire frittered {{away his}} chance to crush Leval. Soult left Granada and reached the Gor ravine on 9 August with 6,000 {{infantry}} and 1,500 cavalry. The position {{was so strong that}} Soult made no attempt to attack, but instead mounted occasional bombardments of the Spanish lines. Earlier, Soult had ordered Godinot to advance from Jaén against La Cuadra's position at Pozo Alcón. Godinot left Baeza on the 7th with at least 4,000 foot soldiers and 600 horsemen. In the face of this advance, La Cuadra abandoned Pozo Alcón on 8 August and fell back to the east in the direction of Huéscar. When he heard that Godinot <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> from the northwest, Freire sent O'Donnell's 4,000 men to occupy a blocking position at Zújar and ordered La Cuadra to join him there.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February {{when the}} British {{surrendered}} at Singapore, the Japanese pincers closed on Java.

A second fleet, even larger, <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> out of the China Sea around the western curve of Borneo against Batavia and Western Java. The men on the bomber fields in Java received the news of Singapore's surrender as forewarning of their own defeat. Attacks were flown against the fleets heading towards Java, but the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Commission credited the Army airplanes of all Allied Air forces in the theater {{with no more than}} three minesweepers, four passenger or cargo vessels, and one converted salvage vessel sunk, and a part in the sinking of two other cargo vessels.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Mark Jones gave the Buccaneers {{the ball at}} their own 49-yard line on a 24-yard punt return. Tampa Bay's offense then went on a 7-play, 51-yard drive that ended with quarterback Chris Simms' two-yard {{touchdown}} run. In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay drove to the Redskins 19-yard line, but linebacker Lemar Marshall tackled fullback Mike Alstott for no gain on third down and 1, and then Simms threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Buccaneers defensive back Brian Kelly intercepted a pass from Mark Brunell on the Redskins' next drive and returned it to the Redskins 35-yard line. With three {{minutes left in the}} game, Tampa Bay wide receiver Edell Shepherd caught {{what appeared to be a}} 35-yard touchdown reception, but he lost control of the ball as he <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> in the end zone for an incomplete pass. The Buccaneers got one last chance to tie the game when they received a punt at their own 46-yard line with 1:05 left in regulation, but Simms threw a pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage and went into the arms of Marcus Washington for a game-ending interception.|$|E

25|$|On Friday morning, February 23, 1945, {{four days}} after the Marines landed at Iwo Jima, Rosenthal was making his daily visit to the island on a Marine landing craft when he heard that an American flag was being raised atop Mount Suribachi, a volcano at the {{southern}} tip of the island. Upon landing, Rosenthal hurried toward Suribachi, lugging along his bulky Speed Graphic camera, the standard for press photographers at the time. Together with Marine combat still photographer Pvt. Bob Campbell and Marine color movie photographer Sgt. Bill Genaust, he began the climb up to the summit of Mount Suribachi. When they got about halfway up, they met Staff Sgt. Louis Lowery, a photographer with the Marine publication “Leatherneck” who <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the volcano after an enemy grenade explosion on top had knocked him off his feet and broke his camera. Lowery told them that the flag had already been raised at 10:40 am, and he had gotten photos of the flag on the summit. Lowery told them the view was good from the summit, and Rosenthal convinced Genaust and Campbell to continue {{to take him to the}} top with them since they were armed.|$|E

500|$|Gillom {{signed with}} the Browns in early 1947, making him the third black player to join the team after Bill Willis and Motley. Before the season started, {{he played in the}} College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) {{champion}} and a selection of the best college players from around the country. Gillom played well in the game as the All-Stars beat the Chicago Bears, 16–0. With the Browns, Gillom was used mostly as a punter and a defensive end. He came in second in the AAFC in punting average in his rookie season at 44.6 yards as Cleveland finished the regular season with a 12–1–1 record and beat the New York Yankees to win the AAFC championship. [...] "Gillom had such a powerful leg and kicked the ball so far; before that punters used to line up 10, 12 yards behind the center", running back Sherman Howard later said. [...] "He started the 15-yard drop. And with Horace, he would kick it so high that by the time guys got down, the ball <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down,</b> so most guys had to fair catch." ...|$|E

She was assigned as flagship of the 1st Mine Barrage Division, and was responsible for the Hungarian border on the Danube, under the operational control of the 30th Infantry Division Osiječka, which was part of the 2nd Army. Drava steamed upstream to Mohács in Hungary to shell the airfield there on 6 and 8 April, but was subjected to daily attacks by the Luftwaffe. On 10 April, Drava and her fellow monitor [...] were ordered to sail downstream to conform with the withdrawals of the 1st and 2nd Army's from Bačka and Baranja. About 14:00 the following day, a Yugoslav lookout near Batina signalled Drava that a group of four Hungarian patrol boats, armed with [...] guns, <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the Danube from the direction of Mohács.

500|$|In 2009, {{following}} {{the announcement that}} As the World Turns would be cancelled in 2010, rumors that Howarth would return to OLTL regained momentum. The rumors were further fueled by an August 2010 episode of OLTL, in which Howarth's picture was shown and a delirious Téa stated that the current Todd (St. John) was not Todd Manning. This resulted in what Dan Kroll of the website Soap Opera Central.com described as fans [...] "rac to their computers {{to figure out the}} meaning of the scene". Kroll speculated that the scene was [...] "crafted merely to get fans talking, or was it a hint to viewers something big <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> <b>down</b> the pike?" [...] Soap Opera Network, citing unnamed sources and pointing to the 2010 episode, reported on their website that they had [...] "learned exclusively Howarth [...] indeed be returning" [...] to the series in the near future. Soap Opera Digest columnist Carolyn Hinsey dismissed the report, stating on her Facebook page, [...] "Seriously, stop with the Howarth misinformation here please. [...] He is not coming back to OLTL. Case closed." [...] Some fans were convinced that St. John's character was an impostor, while others were not; although Howarth eventually returned as Todd in 2011, his return was initially accompanied with fan debate regarding what role he would play, Todd Manning or a new character.|$|E
