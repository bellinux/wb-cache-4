At Pentecost 1134, son Geoffrey was born in Rouen, but the {{childbirth}} was extremely difficult and Matilda appeared close to death. She made arrangements for her will and argued with her father about where she should be buried. Matilda preferred Bec Abbey, but Henry <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interred at Rouen Cathedral. Matilda recovered, and Henry was overjoyed by the birth of his second grandson, possibly insisting on another round of oaths from his nobility.|$|E
25|$|Governor Ventura sparked media {{criticism}} when, {{nearing the}} end of his term, he suggested that he might resign from office early to allow his lieutenant governor, Mae Schunk, an opportunity to serve as governor. He further stated that he <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the state's first female governor and have her portrait painted and hung in the Capitol along with the other governors.

Years later she asserted that he <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his patient at age 23 and made physical advances toward her, and that the horror she then felt toward the Swedish royal family, because of their unlimited support of Munthe, was the main reason she fled them and filed for divorce from Prince Wilhelm.|$|E
25|$|Hearst loved {{seeing her}} in {{expensive}} costume pictures, {{but she also}} appeared in contemporary comedies like Tillie the Toiler, The Fair Co-Ed (both 1927), and especially three directed by King Vidor, Not So Dumb (1930), The Patsy and the backstage-in-Hollywood saga Show People (both 1928). The Patsy contains her imitations which she usually did for friends, of silent stars Lillian Gish, Mae Murray and Pola Negri. King Vidor saw Davies as a comedic actress instead of the dramatic actress that Hearst <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> He noticed she was the life of parties and incorporated that into his films.|$|E
25|$|The Fish Commission {{wanted to}} develop a {{comprehensive}} understanding of the migration of food fishes {{in the spring and}} autumn as they travelled to and from their summer feeding grounds, and chose to construct Grampus as a sailing ship because it <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to remain at sea for weeks or months at a time to follow the migration continuously and investigate it completely without having to come into port for coal, as a steamer would. Grampus also had to be seaworthy enough to remain on duty and not lose contact with the migrating fish during bad weather. Finally, Grampus had to be designed and equipped to capture fish that did not swim near the surface in order to investigate fisheries completely, and she also needed to be able to capture and investigate minute life such as plankton, which supported the food fish population.|$|E

500|$|Haislett {{was born}} in St. Petersburg, Florida in 1972. She was a [...] "water baby"—she learned to swim at 18 months old.

She began to train with the St. Pete Aquatics Club {{at the age of}} 6. Haislett attended Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, where she swam for the Lakewood Spartans high school swim team, winning four Florida high school state championships in two years. As a 16-year-old high school junior, she won the 50-, 100- and 200-meter events at the U.S. Open Swimming Championships in 1989.

500|$|Nila Wahdati {{is a young}} Afghan woman {{renowned for}} her sexually charged poetry who is married off to a wealthy Kabul businessman. According to Hosseini, many aspects of her {{character}} were derived from women he encountered during parties his parents hosted in Kabul in the 1970s, many of whom he recalls as [...] "beautiful, very outspoken, temperamental...drinking freely, smoking". At some point prior {{to the beginning of}} the story, she was apparently sterilized while undergoing treatment for an illness, leading her to buy Pari as an adopted daughter. Described as unusually beautiful and discontent, she later relocates to Paris following her husband's stroke and eventually commits suicide. Hosseini explained that he was unconcerned with making Nila likable—"I just <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> real – full of anger and ambition and insight and frailty and narcissism." ...|$|E

500|$|Laurer met World Wrestling Federation (WWF) {{performers}} Paul [...] "Triple H" [...] Levesque and Shawn Michaels after {{a professional}} wrestling show in 1996. After watching tapes of her matches, {{they decided to}} bring her into the WWF as a bodyguard. Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} WWF, initially did not want her to join the company because he did not believe the audience would find a woman beating up men believable. While waiting for the WWF's decision, Laurer was approached by World Championship Wrestling (WCW), who <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the sole-female member of the New World Order. She initially accepted the offer, but later turned it down when Shane McMahon, Vince McMahon's son, informed her that she was about to be hired by the WWF.

500|$|Sue Ellen's storylines in {{the first}} season focus on the character's bout with alcohol and her slowly deteriorating {{relationship}} with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on {{the birth of her}} son with J.R., John Ross Ewing III. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen came into her own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: [...] "I never <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> boring. She was never boring before – she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting." [...] Gray later described Sue Ellen as being, [...] "one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original Desperate Housewife.

When asked whether Jackie {{was done with}} the show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have her come in to do an arc, but she will not be a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because I was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her.

[...] Seeing Giselle as [...] "a forest girl, an innocent nymph with flowers in her hair" [...] and [...] "a bit of a hippie", the animators <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> [...] "flowing, with her hair and clothes. Delicate." [...] For Prince Edward, Baxter's team [...] "worked the hardest on him {{to make him look}} like the actor" [...] because princes [...] "in these kinds of movies are usually so bland." [...] Many prototypes were made for Narissa as Baxter's team wanted her face to [...] "look like Susan Sarandon. And the costumes had to align closely to the live-action design." ...|$|E

Jay-Z said that Mary J. Blige was initially considered for Keys' part on [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] and admitted that he was [...] "two seconds away" [...] from asking Blige to appear on the record's chorus. His second choice for the track's vocals was Keys and that using Blige on the song would have been a safe move, but said that the combination of Keys' sound and piano talent had struck a chord with him. In December 2009 Hunte, who would not reveal many details, said the original version of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] will one day be released, adding that [...] "The original is so powerful it's {{only a matter of time}} till you hear it down the line".|$|E

Before his assassination, Taseer visited her at the jail several times with his wife, Aamna, and daughter, Shehrbano, though Pakistani court officials later ruled {{that she could be}} visited only by her husband and lawyer. Khalid Sheikh, the prison superintendent, said that while he <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> treated [...] "like any other prisoner", she had to be kept away from other inmates for her own well-being, as other individuals accused of blasphemy had been killed while in prison. Out of concern that she could be poisoned, prison officials began giving Noreen raw materials to cook her own food. The Masihi Foundation, a human rights group, described her physical condition as [...] "very frail", and her health was reported to be in decline due to poor living conditions at the jail.

That was my goal from day one: I <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> funny, badass and super cool.". During {{the first day of the}} shoot, he requested Spears to [...] "have as much fun as possible over these next two days". Pilliero also stated that the Crossroads (2002) reference [...] "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, [...] is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel. It just felt like the right thing to do. When Britney saw it, she loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline is {{voiced by}} Olivia Olson. Olivia's father Martin Olson was an {{acquaintance}} of Ward, and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted [...] "her as a voice" [...] on his show. She had originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read for the role of Marceline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Martin Olson later noted that Olivia's audition was a [...] "sham" [...] to please the network executives because Ward had already <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a voice on the show. In order to get into character, Olson often dresses {{in a manner similar to}} Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, [...] "I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, maybe some red lipstick, and just go in there." [...] Olson also is the character's singing voice. According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez, composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series. Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company. For instance, Rob Sugar—the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar—often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca. Furthermore, Frederator also posted demos, as well as a full version of the popular [...] "Fry Song", sung by Marceline in the episode [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere", on its official blog. In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres. In the fifth season episodes [...] "Finn the Human" [...] / [...] "Jake the Dog", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman. Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was [...] "pretty cool”.|$|E
