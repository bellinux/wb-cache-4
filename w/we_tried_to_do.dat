500|$|The writers {{started to}} work for [...] "Band Geeks" [...] {{with the idea of}} a rival. Williams said, [...] "We always wanted to do a rival show, and I think <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a rival show for SpongeBob, and it wasn't working. So we came up {{with the idea of a}} rival for Squidward and, in some ways it's Squidward's story, and SpongeBob and Patrick are just kind of around." [...] The idea of having a band was unspecified. Williams remarked, [...] "I forget who was in band. I was not in a band, but I think maybe Doug [...] was in a band. I think Steve [...] was in a band, too." ...|$|E
500|$|For Storaro, {{the limited}} color palette {{was the most}} {{challenging}} aspect of production. [...] "These are {{not the kind of}} colors the audience is used to seeing," [...] he noted. [...] "These are much more dramatic in strength, in saturation. Comic strip art is usually done with very simple and primitive ideas and emotions," [...] Storaro theorized. [...] "One of the elements is that the story is usually told in vignette, so what <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is never move the camera at all. Never. Try to make everything work into the frame." [...] For the matte paintings, Ellenshaw and Lloyd executed over 57 paintings on glass, which were then optically combined with the live action. For a brief sequence in which The Kid dashes in front of a speeding locomotive, only [...] of real track was laid; the train itself was a [...] scale model, and the surrounding train yard a matte painting.|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the season, Fazekas recalled the potential story revolving around Carter having a girls night out, saying that they realized that [...] "once Peggy is on the mission, it starts to become difficult for her to have a social life...we kept sort of punting that scene because every time <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, it was like, 'She's not going to stop to go out to dinner. She has the world to save.'" [...] Also, they felt they were not properly servicing Angie's character, instead [...] "just sticking her in scenes just to be there," [...] resulting in the decision to ultimately not bring Angie back for the season as planned. In her place, the characters of Ana Jarvis and Rose Roberts are featured as confidante's for Carter, [...] "both people who are 100% in on Peggy's secret. Angie sort of figures it {{out at the end of}} the first season but Ana and Rose—there is no need to hide the truth from them. So it makes it a lot easier for her to confide in them." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Lofton {{was one of}} six Indians' {{starters}} who batted [...]300 {{or higher}} (.310). He also had an MLB-best 13 triples. His 54 stolen bases led the AL {{for the third consecutive}} season. The Indians faced the Seattle Mariners in the 1995 ALCS. In the eighth inning of Game Six, Lofton had an infield bunt, stole second base, and scored from second on a passed ball between pitcher Randy Johnson and catcher Dan Wilson. The Indians won the game 40. It was described by The New York Times as [...] "the run that demoralized the Mariners." [...] Fifteen years after Lofton's crossing of home plate, the Plain Dealer recalled: [...] "Of all the electrifying moments on the Kenny Lofton highlight reel, none captures the essence of the player any better than his 180-foot dash to glory on October 17, 1995." [...] As a result of winning the game, the Indians had won the ALCS and in so doing, Lofton and the Indians had brought the AL pennant to Cleveland {{for the first time since}} the 1954 season. [...] "I'm glad for the city of Cleveland to be able to experience this, because they haven't experience this for a long time. The city of Cleveland has grown a lot, and it's improving, and <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this for the city", Lofton said. The Indians lost the World Series to the Braves in six games despite finishing the regular season with a major league-best 10044 record in the strike-shortened year. Lofton finished with a [...]200 batting average and six stolen bases in his first World Series appearance. In 2010, a few years into his retirement, Lofton stated he felt it was the toughest post-season loss of his 11 career playoff appearances, namely because he felt the umpires had favorable strike zones for Braves pitchers Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux.|$|E
500|$|The Jets' {{success in}} signing Namath {{and the rise}} of the team in the standings {{adversely}} affected their crosstown rivals, the Giants, who had played in five NFL championship games in six years to 1963, but who thereafter declined in the standings. [...] Giants owner Wellington Mara stated, [...] "I think the Jets coming in when they did contributed to our bad years, because <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything for the short term rather than the long haul—we'd trade a draft choice for a player, figuring he'd give us one or two good years. We didn't want to accept how the public might react if we had a bad year or two or three." [...] In 1968, the Giants traded for star Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton in the vain hopes he would lead them to renewed success and rival Namath in the public eye. In August 1969, the Jets faced the Giants in a preseason game at the Yale Bowl. [...] While the Jets' Super Bowl win legitimized the AFL as a comparable league to the NFL in the eyes of many, others doubted the AFL's standard of play, and the Jets were underdogs going into the game. Giants coach Allie Sherman approached the game as if it were a regular season contest, and the Jets sent the three remaining original Titans out for the coin toss. The Jets defeated the Giants 37–14, and Sherman was fired a few weeks later. The Jets' fellow tenants, the Mets, won a championship themselves; the baseball team's accomplishments forced the Jets to play their first five games on the road. The Jets recovered from a slow start to win their second consecutive Eastern Division championship, but fell to Kansas City in the divisional round of the playoffs, 13–6.|$|E

Abdullah ibn Zubayr, who could see {{troubles}} ahead {{after the death of}} Muawiyah and was opposed to the appointment of Yazid, later said of Muawiyah: [...] "Truly the son of Hind deployed a dexterity and mental resourcefulness as one will never see after him. When we tried to impose something on him, an irritated lion with claws unsheathed would not show more audacity than him. He knew when to give into us, to even allow himself to be tricked when <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that to him. He was the most artful of men, more crafty than a thief.

2500|$|Amid {{increasing}} anti-war protest, President John Hannah departed MSU in 1969 to {{head the}} United States Agency for International Development—the successor to the International Cooperation Administration that had initiated the MSUG contract. Although his abrupt departure from MSU might suggest otherwise, Hannah did not doubt the project's propriety; years later, he stated, [...] "We never felt any need for the University to apologize... for what <b>we</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in Vietnam. I think that if Michigan State were to face the same choice again in the same context, it might well agree to assist the U.S. Government as we did then." [...] Hannah's interim replacement as president was economics professor Walter Adams, who had long questioned the efficacy of university technical assistance programs and who in 1961 had encouraged Jaffe and Taylor to publish [...] "A Crumbling Bastion".|$|E

2500|$|On {{character}} interactions, Greenberg noted {{how there}} was [...] "a lot of dialogue between Jimmy and Mandy in the car. We {{used a lot}} of car mounts. I would light the alien so that he looked good, but if he passed into a shadow while going down the street you could see all the seams in his make-up. So I sometimes had to block all the streets with black paper." [...] The aliens were not too different from humans, and an incorrect lighting or camera angle could give away seams in the makeup. In attempting {{to identify with the}} aliens regarding a unique look, Greenberg chose a deep blue color for filming. He said, [...] "We ended up with very deep, strong blue – a sort of moonlight blue. <b>We</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all the scenes in the movie that appear to be their places heavily favored by this deep blue color. The Encounters Club was one of those places." [...] Greenberg used Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses along with Fuji stock. Commenting on film grain he said, [...] "I figured out from tests that it is better for me to use Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than Kodak. I can control the contrast with light, but I {{have to live with the}} grain." [...] Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, [...] "Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras." ...|$|E
