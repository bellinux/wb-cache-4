In fact, two of the top reasons people with SCI cite for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sex are for intimacy and to keep a partner.

Nash also co-hosted Showdown in Chinatown in 2008, an 8-on-8 charity soccer game held at Sara D. Roosevelt Park. He scored two goals in his team's 8–5 victory. Participants included Thierry Henry, Jason Kidd, Baron Davis, and Suns teammates Raja Bell and Leandro Barbosa.|$|E
5|$|Betances openly hated Estrada when {{he first}} met him in the late 1870s, but grew more {{tolerant}} of him with time, and even defended Estrada's actions as leader when he assumed control of the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The Puerto Rican affiliates to the Party viewed Estrada's leadership with great skepticism, since Estrada sympathized {{with the idea of}} having the United States intervene in the Cuban independence war to have the Spanish evicted from Cuba. They suspected that his weak leadership allowed opportunists to profit from an invasion and even suggest that the United States keep Puerto Rico in exchange for independence for Cuba. Some written evidence points to the truth of their affirmations, at least to the extent of <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party shut down, which eventually did happen.|$|E

In an interview with Mike Wallace, he said, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fight anymore. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> battle sponsors and agencies.

5|$|Thalaba {{travels to}} the land of Aloadin, who owns a great garden paradise, and he is invited to feast with the people, but he is unwilling to imbibe alcohol or be taken in by the dancing women that seek to entice him. The temptations {{overwhelm}} him {{to the point where he}} can no longer tolerate them and he flees. Shortly after leaving, he discovers one of the women being attacked by a man <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his way with her. It is revealed that the woman was Oneiza, who was captured, and that Aloadin was a sorcerer. After saving Oneiza, Thalaba is determined to stop the sorcerer and he ends up killing him. Following this, they are praised by a Sultan that Aloadin wanted to kill, and Thalaba decides to marry Oneiza. Before they can finish their marriage, she dies and Thalaba is left to mourn over her grave. While mourning, a spirit that appears to be Oneiza begins to haunt Thalaba and claim that God disapproves of the young warrior. However, Moath comes and is able to recognise the spirit as a vampire. After killing the vampire, the real Oneiza comes to guide Thalaba onwards.|$|E

Partly fearing for her own survival, and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fitting end to Poirot's series of novels, Christie had the novel locked away in a bank vault for over thirty years. The final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, Elephants Can Remember, was {{published}} in 1972, followed by Christie's last novel, Postern of Fate. Christie authorised Curtains removal from the vault and subsequent publication. It {{was the last of}} her books to be published during her lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Leone, Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni worked {{together}} on the film’s screenplay {{for three to four}} weeks, discussing characters and scenes for the film. Donati, who had previously acted as an uncredited script doctor for The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, conceived Juan Miranda’s character as an extension of Tuco from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Meanwhile, Leone was largely responsible for the character of John Mallory, and the film’s focus on the development of John and Juan’s friendship. At times, however, Leone, Donati, and Vincenzoni found that they had highly differing opinions about how the film should be made, with Leone <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the film produced on a large scale with an epic quality, while Donati and Vincenzoni perceived the film as a low-budget thriller.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, delegates of the Five Civilized Tribes {{met at the}} Sequoyah Convention {{to write}} a {{constitution}} for an Indian-controlled state. They wanted to have Indian Territory admitted as the State of Sequoyah. Although they took a thoroughly developed proposal to Washington, DC, seeking approval, eastern states' representatives opposed it, not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> two western states created in the area, as the Republicans feared that both would be Democrat-dominated, as the territories had a southern tradition of settlement. President Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, ruled that the Oklahoma and Indian territories had to be jointly admitted as one state, Oklahoma. To achieve this, tribal governments had to end and all residents accept state government. Many of the leading Native American representatives from the Sequoyah Convention participated in the new state convention. Its constitution was based on many elements of the one developed for the State of Sequoyah.|$|E

He {{was a special}} correspondent for The Insider for the 2005 Emmy Awards, and on the sets of the sitcom Reba with Reba McEntire and Dancing With the Stars. He co-hosted The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet in 2006, and on November 17, 2006, filled in for Regis Philbin as guest host on Live with Regis and Kelly. During an interview, Aiken covered Kelly Ripa's mouth with his hand. The incident drew considerable media reaction after Ripa complained at length about the incident on her show the following Monday. Aiken made fun of the controversy on the 2006 American Music Awards the next night with Tori Spelling. On The Tyra Banks Show in 2006, filmed before the Ripa incident, Aiken mentioned <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his own talk show someday, and Banks switched seats with him and let him interview her for one segment of the show. Aiken was a guest judge on the April 8, 2009 segment of Banks show America's Next Top Model; in what the show refers to as a teach, he worked with the remaining 8 contestants on their acting skills prior to the judging.|$|E

George Gamow added Bethe's name (in absentia) without {{consulting}} him, knowing that Bethe would not mind, and against Ralph Alpher's wishes.

Aguilera's vocals were recorded at The Red Lips Room in Beverly Hills, California by Oscar Ramirez. It is a pop song with a ragga flavour, and runs for a duration of three minutes and 24 seconds. Its instrumentation contains crashing drums and [...] "a thumping bassline". According to Chris Younie from 4Music, the song's chorus is [...] "insanely catchy". Lyrically, it talks about Christina <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> sexual intercourse with someone in different locations around the world, including Hollywood and Japan.

500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers."

500|$|The second {{episode of}} the series {{was the first to}} feature {{predominantly}} original writing, as the [...] "Pilot" [...] contained many jokes from the British series pilot. During one of Michael's impersonations, a racial expletive spoken by Michael had to be censored by the producers for NBC. Daniels was terrified that the scene would leak unedited, so he personally oversaw the censoring of the master copy. The scene where Pam rests her head on Jim's shoulder after Dwight has stolen his sale and Jim smiles and says [...] "not a bad day after all" [...] came about when Greg Daniels spoke to the writers about <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> small, happy interactions between Jim and Pam and mentioned the head-on-shoulder idea, which B. J. Novak immediately wrote into his script. Paul Lieberstein did not want to appear in the episode and did so assuming it would be a one-time event, but Kevin Reilly was impressed by his work and said the show should use him more, leading to the expansion of Paul's work as Toby Flenderson. Two scenes that were cut involved Michael Scott responding to Mr. Brown's [...] "HERO" [...] acronym by creating one that sounded good until everyone noticed the words created the acronym of [...] "INCEST", and Michael responded to Mr. Brown's nixing of that idea by pointing out the links between incest and racism in some states, while another had Jim replacing Dwight's [...] "Asian" [...] headband with [...] "Dwight" [...] and then having the other co-workers complain to a clueless Dwight about how annoying his behavior was.|$|E
