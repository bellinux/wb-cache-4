5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, Rivers briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that Rivers worked to pass. There is no official rule against serving both as the chair and a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, Rivers officially announced she would run for the office. On March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported Rivers would likely be withdrawing from the race later that <b>week.</b> <b>That</b> was confirmed when Rivers released a statement later that day that said Rivers {{would not be a}} candidate. Rivers cited the time commitment and desire to stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal. She was considered the front runner for the office.|$|E

5|$|On 20 October 2006, GMG Radio {{announced}} that it was requesting a change of format for 102.2 and 100.4 Smooth FM from Ofcom, to remove the stations' daytime soul and R licence commitments.

Ofcom approved the changes on 8 December 2006, with the condition that GMG retained the 45 hours of jazz per <b>week</b> <b>that</b> constituted part of the former licence requirement. As a result of the format change and to distance the station from its London rivals Magic and Heart 106.2, GMG Radio agreed that a minimum of 20% of its daytime music output would be over 40 years old.|$|E

5|$|The {{period between}} the Battle of Stillman's Run in May and the raid at Sinsinawa Mound in late June was filled with war-related activity. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, the Plum River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds, and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. Two key battles, one at Horseshoe Bend on 16 June and the other at Waddams Grove on 18 June, {{played a role in}} {{changing}} public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman's Run. The Battle of Apple River Fort on 24 June marked the end of a <b>week</b> <b>that</b> was an important turning point for the settlers.

5|$|Directly after commissioning, Prinzregent Luitpold {{took part}} in the annual autumn maneuvers, which {{followed}} the fleet cruise to Norway. The exercises lasted from 31August to 9September. Unit drills and individual ship training were conducted in October and November. In early 1914, Prinzregent Luitpold participated in additional ship and unit training. The annual spring maneuvers were conducted in the North Sea at the end of March. Further fleet exercises followed in April and May in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship went to Kiel <b>Week</b> <b>that</b> year. Despite the rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28June, the High Seas Fleet began its summer cruise to Norway on 13July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skadenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness.

The record was later certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding shipments of three million copies. Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus opened at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was recognized with a platinum certification in the country. In March 2008, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus reached number six the same <b>week</b> <b>that</b> Best of Both Worlds Concert reached number 10 in its second week of availability.

5|$|In the <b>week</b> <b>that</b> {{followed}} the brigade undertook defensive duties as the Germans attempted to apply {{pressure on the}} beachhead by infiltrating the defensive positions on the eastern flank. On 12 June, the airborne troops launched {{an attack on the}} village of Breville from where German artillery had been shelling them during the preceding week. Although successful, British casualties were high. Having been subjected to an intense artillery barrage, No. 6 Commando suffered 16 casualties. The barrage also wounded the brigade commander, Lord Lovat, to the extent that No. 6 Commando's commanding officer, Mills-Roberts, although wounded himself, was asked to take over from him. Major Anthony Lewis, formerly of the Dorset Regiment, stepped up to take over as commanding officer temporarily, before being confirmed in the role on 24 June and receiving a promotion to acting-lieutenant colonel. He remained in command until 8 August 1944, when Lieutenant Colonel Charles Courtney-Coade of the South Staffordshire Regiment took over, and Lewis reverted to the role of second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|June had offseason foot {{surgery in}} February 2008. During the opening {{game of the}} season, Brooks {{suffered}} a hamstring injury and removed himself from {{the game in the}} third quarter, which fueled speculation during the following <b>week</b> <b>that</b> he would miss the first start of his fourteen-year career and that June would start on the weakside. Brooks, however, made his 194th-consecutive start the following week. In a story not published until four weeks later, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson claims that June attempted to injure him in a November 16 game. June made his first interception of the season and second as a Buccaneer on a Drew Brees pass that was tipped by Ronde Barber in the twelfth game of the season as Tampa earned its fourth consecutive victory to improve its record to 93 on November 30 against the New Orleans Saints. After the Buccaneers lost their final four games to miss the playoffs, the Buccaneers replaced Jon Gruden and Bruce Allen with Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik as head coach and general manager. The team subsequently released five veteran players in a move that was said to be unrelated to the salary cap. June was released by the Buccaneers on February 25, 2009 along with Derrick Brooks, Ike Hilliard, Warrick Dunn and Joey Galloway. The transaction avoided a $2million roster bonus for June.|$|E

Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales percentages of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65% from the previous week. Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.|$|E
5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council.

The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a <b>week</b> <b>that</b> saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.|$|E
