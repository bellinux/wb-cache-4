5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{many people who}} died of typhoid, were those with private wells.

Flooding delayed continuation until 1904 until completion in 1910. In June 1903, a flood was then said to be [...] "the worst in history" [...] with business suspended, hundreds became unemployed and homeless. In 1910, ponds were constructed in the park began that could augment the water supply and in 1918, a pumping station built on the park pumped water from the river into the ponds.|$|E

The Reef Tank is best known for its sharks. The Salt <b>Water</b> <b>Gallery</b> contains fourteen tanks with tanks dedicated to the species of Veracruz, the Red Sea and the Pacific Ocean. Another exhibit is devoted to sharks, containing 25 species that swim around visitors as they walk through a glass tunnel built through the tank. There is also an exhibit dedicated entirely to manatees.|$|E

Three main outlets exist into the Thames, near to Hampton Gate of Bushy Park, under the <b>Water</b> <b>Gallery</b> at Hampton Court Palace Gardens opposite the confluence of the River Mole, and one in the east of that land, which is a mixture of golf course and farm, opposite Raven's Ait.|$|E

50|$|On August 11, 2010, a rare {{white sea}} turtle {{was brought to}} the {{aquarium}} for care. Nimbus, as the turtle was named, was weak and smaller than the average loggerhead hatchling. It turned up when a hatched-out Pine Knoll Shores nest was excavated for baby turtles left behind. Hampered by a cleft palate, it had to be coaxed into eating. It lagged behind in growth, also, but appears to be catching up with other hatchlings of the same age. Nimbus is on exhibit in the Tidal <b>Waters</b> <b>Gallery.</b> The turtle is something of a rock star at the aquarium — especially with visiting school groups.|$|R
