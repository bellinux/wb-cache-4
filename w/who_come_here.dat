6000|$|... "And when" [...] said Honora, [...] "when Mrs. Dwyer has dinner-parties for celebrated people <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> {{why does}} she invite you {{in to see the}} table?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{said the}} queen, [...] "mock me with no honourable seat <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> as a humble suppliant, {{and will make}} my prayer upon my knees." ...|$|E
30|$|You {{thought that}} Watan {{is the one}} <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> yesterday.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} is largely descendants of German settlers, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> {{mostly in the}} 18th century.|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE. It seems {{stirring}} to us; {{it must have}} been merely laughable to you, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> from a great city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Leger. [...] "Most of {{the boys}} <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> know where it is. I really don't {{think there is any}} reason why they shouldn't, either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{to drive}} {{customers}} away, but if any <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> have {{had a hand in}} murder, they'd better not show their heads 'round this place again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{learned more}} than one thing since you've been in the city," [...] he remarked, [...] "I suppose there are a good many fellows <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> all the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hush! <b>who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here?</b> The wizard Moor's employer! [...] Moors {{were his}} murderers, you say? Saints shield us [...] From wicked thoughts---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean the}} man <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> yesterday?" [...] the widow asked, while Teddy and Sam {{gazed at the}} old man in {{open-mouthed}} astonishment.|$|R
5000|$|The name Rairban {{belong to}} one tree {{is derived from}} a Pashto tribe saduzai <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> for Jihad at Dogra raj and settled here after that.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{certainly}} advise it," [...] said Leyton, quickly, [...] "for really, Rushbrook, {{you know that}} something {{is due to the}} respectable people <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> and any of them are likely to see"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> {{to look on}} {{have done}} what we could towards making a success of this here 'blow-out,' and now, {{according}} to my way of thinking, it's time we heard from Mr. Daniel Roberts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nineteen will be enough, citizeness," [...] she said; [...] "keep one for yourself, {{not only}} for me, {{but for all the}} poor women <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> with their heart full of hope, and go hence with it full of despair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe, sir," [...] the man answered, [...] "that it is {{the same}} young lady <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> some weeks ago to inquire after Mr. Norris Vine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] Hurd answered. [...] "Look here! You've been in {{communication}} with the man <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> and murdered my father. You know where he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, for {{the good}} of the family. Can you say {{positively}} that the man <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to your master was Talbot, or that he was not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hear {{little of}} what passes in the town," [...] the priest said, quietly. [...] "News would disturb my meditations, and I never {{question}} those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to ask for my prayers. I {{have heard of the}} escape of no prisoner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We did {{not think}} that you would {{be able to talk to}} us," [...] the elder, whose name was Doast Assud, said, smiling. [...] "We have been {{wondering}} how we should make you understand. Many of the white officers, <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> sometimes, speak our language, but none of them as well as you do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what {{half of all}} <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> want," [...] {{answered}} Caleb Walton. [...] "I reckon {{they think}} Commodore Schley's Flying Squadron is going to settle the whole war by going after that Spanish fleet said to be at Cadiz, or thereabouts. Well, the lad better come with me. I belong to the Brooklyn now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil take Monsieur Albert!" [...] Duncombe {{answered}} angrily. [...] "I am {{waiting to}} speak to some one <b>who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here</b> regularly, and I shall stay until she comes." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In the Cuman bishopric - {{as we were}} {{informed}} - is living a people called Vallah and others, Hungarians and Germans as well, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> from the Hungarian Kingdom." ...|$|R
6000|$|But what is this? <b>Who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here?</b> Why does Sir Miles {{return to}} the drawing-room, and why does Tom Claypool, who strides after the Baronet, wear a countenance so disturbed? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a fine {{class of}} people. I don't {{like some of}} these retired farmers <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to spend their last days--especially the Germans. They hate to pay school-taxes. They hate to spend a cent. But the rest are a fine class of people. Did you know that Percy Bresnahan came from here? Used {{to go to school}} right at the old building!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall not}} escape," [...] she continued, the words leaving her lips {{with a sort}} of staccato incisiveness, crisp and emotional. [...] "No! you are here, and you shall answer. Who are you <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to mock us all; because it is a dead man who speaks with your voice, and looks with your eyes? You will not dare to say that you are Duncan Fitzmaurice!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{experience}} {{of one of}} those transatlantic celebrities who seem to be rather multiplying upon us of late, and <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> with a proclamation of their worship of American women ready to present, as if in print, to the swarming interviewers on the pier, and who then proceed to find fault with our civilization on every other point, almost before they drive up to their hotels." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. Used to? You are not {{thinking}} of that wretched woman <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> last night? [Coming round and sitting R. of her.] You don't still imagine--no, you couldn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a point. Anything is {{good enough}} for a {{fisherman}} or a sailor to get a light with. The fellow <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> must have meant to have the best." ...|$|R
50|$|Vavar Masjid: The masjid at Erumely {{dedicated}} to Vavarswami {{is the most}} noted landmark of the place. Every pilgrim <b>who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here</b> visits the masjid to seek the blessings of Vavarswami.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is so generous, {{and shows}} so much fine feeling, {{that it is}} almost a duty to mention it. I {{said at the time}} that I always would mention it on every {{suitable}} occasion, without regard to personal sensitiveness. A--well--a--it's of no use to disguise the fact--you must know, Mr Clennam, that it does sometimes occur that people <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> desire to offer some little--Testimonial--to the Father of the place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{protection}} of Russia," [...] Domiloff cried, eagerly. [...] "My master himself shall guarantee your independence. I {{will give you}} pledges. You will reserve for a friend and an ally the most generous of the Powers. But you must be quick," [...] he added, with a sudden start. [...] "Now {{is the time for}} you to act. Close the gates upon those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> to-night. It shall be your answer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another day," [...] he said (without, however, {{fixing the}} day). [...] "I {{think you will}} find my house comfortable. My {{housekeeper}} may perhaps be eccentric--but in all essentials {{a woman in a}} thousand. Do you feel the change from London already? Our air at St. Sallins is really worthy of its reputation. Invalids <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> are cured as if by magic. What do you think of Mrs. Zant? How does she look?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Lemont's {{motto is}} [...] "Village of Faith", and its church spires reflect the many ethnic groups <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to quarry stone, dig the Sanitary and Ship Canal {{and work in}} other industries.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{living with}} Miss Churton--the lady <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> with me," [...] she replied. [...] "But {{she is going}} to be married soon, and I must find another place nearer Regent Street." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} we can do anything, Wilfrid, beyond trying to find out whether the fellows <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> were alone, or were part of a larger party. Where are your natives?" ...|$|R
