40|$|The {{concept of}} film world appears {{particularly}} effective in film studies because it identifies movies both as <b>worlds</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived, which emotionally involve the filmgoer, and <b>worlds</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interpreted, which {{call for a}} philosophical enquiry on their meanings. Adopting a hermeneutic phenomenological approach, this article addresses film ‘reality’, {{especially with regard to}} the relationship between film and philosophy. Emphasizing incommensurability among different film worlds, it explores two different screened cities: New York (Manhattan, Allen 1979) and Dogville (Dogville, von Trier 2003) ...|$|R

Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remained under debate until 2009, when multiple lines of molecular evidence showed it to represent the westernmost population of the Pacific walrus.|$|E

5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery in a concrete or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E
5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E
5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to other regions of the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the <b>world</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E
