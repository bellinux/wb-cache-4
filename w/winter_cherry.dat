In this film, the Tolstoy House serves as a kind of actor itself, playing up to the stars of the film and {{creating}} a certain mood. Maslennikov also used the Tolstoy House in his The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson series of television films to stand in for parts of Holmes's London. Other films using the Tolstoy House include A Doctor Called?, You Never Dreamed Of..., Born of the Revolution, and Gangster Petersburg.|$|R

60|$|Now, as in a dream, Rachel {{descended the}} steep, rock-strewn {{banks of the}} dry branch of the river-bed, wending her way between the {{boulders}} and noting that rotten weeds and peeled brushwood rested against the stems of the mimosa thorns which grew--there, tokens which told her that here in times of flood the water flowed. Well, there was little enough of it now, only a pool or two to form a mirror for the lightning. In front of her lay the island where grew the Cape gooseberries, or <b>winter</b> <b>cherries</b> as they are sometimes called, which she came to seek. It was a low piece of ground, {{a quarter of a}} mile long, perhaps, but in the centre of it were some great rocks and growing among the rocks, trees, one of them higher than the rest. Beyond it ran the true river, even now at the end of the dry season three or four hundred yards in breadth, though so shallow that it could be forded by an ox-drawn waggon.|$|R
5000|$|Withaferin A, {{the first}} withanolide to be isolated, {{was found in}} <b>Winter</b> <b>Cherry</b> (Withania somnifera), also known as Ashwagandha in ayurvedic medicine. The {{anti-inflammatory}} effects of a few dozen known withanolides have been demonstrated in animal experiments. Withaferin A acts as an anti-angiogenic compound by inhibiting Transcription Factors Sp1 and NF-κB. Withaferin A down-regulates angiogenic switch inducer vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and EAT cells induced angiogenesis on mouse peritoneal cavity. Withaferin A also inhibits angiogenesis on chick chorioallantoic membrane. [...] Withanalides inhibit COX-2 and exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. Salpichrolides A, B and G (isolated from Salpichroa origanifolia) exhibit an inhibitory effect on the growth of larva of the Mediterranean Fruit Fly (Ceratitis capitata). For this reason, potential pesticide uses for the compounds are being explored.|$|E

40|$|Background Paraoxonase enzyme is {{attached}} to HDL and {{is involved in the}} maturation of this lipoprotein. This enzyme is activated by several antioxidants. These antioxidants exist in <b>Winter</b> <b>cherry</b> (Physalis alkekengi). In fact, it contains a variety of antioxidants. Objectives The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects of a hydro-alcoholic extract of <b>winter</b> <b>cherry</b> fruits on serum lipid profile and paraoxanase 1 (Pon 1) activity in the rat. Methods In this randomized experimental study, hydroalcoholic extract of Physalis alkekengi fruits was obtained by a percolation method. Four groups of male Sprague Dawley rats (260 +/- 5 g), each containing 7 animals, were housed separately and fed standard rat chow and water ad libitum. Experiments were performed for 28 days on each group. Group 1 (control 1) received only the standard diet, with no hydroalcoholic extract. Group 2 (control 2) received 1 mL of water by gavage in addition to the standard diet. Groups 3 (experiment 1) and 4 (experiment 2) received, respectively, 200 and 400 mg /kg b. w. of the extract in 1 mL of water through gavage. At the end of the experimental period, animals were fasted overnight and lipid profile and paraoxonase activity were determined and compared statistically by one way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests, using SPSS version 11. 5 Results Triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were decreased dose dependently by the extract. HDL cholesterol and serum paraoxonase activities were increased significantly by Physalis extract. Conclusions The hydroalcoholic extract of Physalis alkekengi, possibly through the presence of antioxidants, increases paraoxonase activity and this enzyme, in turn, augments the level of HDL in serum...|$|E

5000|$|The 'Ulster' cherry is a midseason cultivar. The {{dark red}} fruit is firm and large, {{sometimes}} measuring {{more than one}} inch in diameter. Its fruit has a strong resistance to cracking brought about by pre-harvest rains, and the trees growing the Ulster cherry have been documented as showing a higher resistance to southwest trunk <b>winter</b> injury, <b>cherry</b> leaf spot and the late spring frosts that can prove fatal to this cultivar. Cracking can be high on some young trees, but the level of cracking declines as the trees mature.|$|R
40|$|Withania somnifera, {{also known}} as Ashwagandha, Indian ginseng and <b>winter</b> <b>cherry</b> has been an {{important}} herb in the Ayurvedic and indigenous medical systems for over 3000 years. The roots of the plant are categorized as rasayanas, which are reputed to promote health and longevity by augmenting defence against disease and creating a sense of mental wellbeing. Various researches support the use of Withania somnifera for anxiety, cognitive and neurological disorders. Ashwagandha contains steroidal compounds known as withanolides including withaferin A and withanolide A. These have been reported to be responsible for significant biological activities and are recommended as active markers for standardization. In the present study an attempt was made to evaluate the physico-chemical profile of Ashwagandha granules. Pharmacognostically authenticated Withania Somnifera root powder was used for the preparation of Ashwagandha granules and it was analyzed through qualitative and quantitative analysis for physico-chemical parameters.

MS supplemented with BAP at 0. 6 mg/l with 0. 4 mg/l IAA {{was found to be}} most effective in initiating multiple shoots at the rate of ten per explant. By repeated subculturing, a high frequency of shoot multiplication was established. About 90 % rooting was achieved with 0. 4 mg/l of IBA and 0. 4 mg/l IAA.

50|$|Sour {{cherries}} require similar cultivation {{conditions to}} pears, that is, they prefer a rich, well-drained, moist soil, although they demand more nitrogen and water than sweet cherries. Trees will do badly if waterlogged, but have greater tolerance of poor drainage than sweet varieties. As with sweet cherries, Morellos are traditionally cultivated by budding onto strong growing rootstocks, which produce trees {{too large for}} most gardens, although newer dwarfing rootstocks such as Colt and Gisella are now available. During spring, flowers should be protected, and trees weeded, mulched and sprayed with natural seaweed solution. This is also the time when any required pruning should be carried out (note that cherries should not be pruned during the dormant <b>winter</b> months). Morello <b>cherry</b> trees fruit on younger wood than sweet varieties, and thus can be pruned harder.
