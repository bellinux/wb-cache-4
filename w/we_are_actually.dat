500|$|By 1980, [...] "Captain Jack" [...] had mostly {{disappeared}} from Joel's concert setlists. Nevertheless, he always played it in Philadelphia, {{because he never}} forgot the role the song and the city played in his early career. A version recorded at The Spectrum in July 1980 was used on his live album, Songs in the Attic. Joel wrote, [...] "'Captain Jack' plays with much more power and conviction when a roaring Philadelphia audience sets off a kind of internal explosion and the adrenaline screams through our veins ... When we play 'Captain Jack', <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> committing an act of pure brutality." [...] Timothy White of Rolling Stone did not like this version, calling it [...] "grating".|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

2500|$|Expectations for 1975 {{were also}} {{based on the belief}} that Christ had set up his kingdom in heaven in 1914 and that [...] "this {{generation}} [...] would by no means pass away" [...] before the end came. The 1967 book, Did Man Get Here By Evolution Or By Creation?, similarly stated, [...] "We find that the time of our generation, our day, is the one that is identified in the Bible as the 'last days'. In fact, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> living in the final part of that time. This can be compared, not just to the last day of a week, but rather, to the last part of that day" [...]|$|E

5000|$|Unlike Winter Words, this {{compilation}} had {{the support}} and involvement of the band. Of it Julianne Regan (lead singer) said [...] "Compiling the album reminded me that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> a pretty good band about 70% of the time." ...|$|R

5000|$|In April 2009, bassist Andy Gilmour stated that: [...] "when band {{actually}} {{have something to}} release we’ll release it. I can’t really give a date. So far, we’ve only had one proper practise where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> writing. <b>We</b> came out with one really good song, but to do a whole album’s worth is tough; it’s {{going to take a}} while.".|$|R

When on expeditions, they must sleep in the open air." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The studio we had {{at school}} wasn’t {{actually}} affiliated with the music program there. That’s sort of an independent student group that Max and I <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> kind of running too. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> engineering there as commercial engineers so even when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> getting the record deal, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> still recording weird a cappella groups and viola players {{to pick up some}} cash on the side. It was good too because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to learn how to record all kinds of different music and instruments and all that knowledge ends up being a resource when you’re working out your own project." ...|$|R

60|$|Now, I {{confidently}} {{expect a}} steady extension of this feeling towards {{us as the}} Churches come {{more and more to}} recognize that we not only do not attack them, but that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> auxiliaries to their forces, not only gaining our audiences and recruits from those who are outside their ministrations, but even serving them by doing work for their adherents which {{for a variety of reasons}} they find it very difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish themselves.|$|E

5000|$|I {{think that}} one of the big {{problems}} with Warcraft Adventures <b>was</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> creating a traditional adventure game, and what people expected from an adventure game, and very honestly what we expected from an adventure game, changed over the course of the project. And when we got to the point where we cancelled it, it <b>was</b> just because <b>we</b> looked at where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> and said, you know, this would have been great three years ago. http://www.gamespot.com/features/pcgraveyard/p4_04.html ...|$|R

[...] Also she recalled, [...] "I {{wanted to make sure that}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>actually</b> talking about Atlanta".|$|R
60|$|Versailles {{originated}} as a hunting-seat, in {{the time}} of Louis XIII. In that age, most of the upland near Paris, in this direction, lay in forest, royal chases; and, as hunting was truly a princely sport, numberless temporary residences of this nature existed in the neighbourhood of the capital. There are still many remains of this barbarous magnificence, as in the wood of Vincennes, the forest of St. Germain, Compiègne, Fontainebleau, and divers others; but great inroads have been made in their limits by the progress of civilization and the wants of society. So lately as the reign of Louis XV. they hunted quite near the town; and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually,</b> at this moment, dwelling in a country house, at St. Ouen, in which, tradition hatch it, he was wont to take his refreshments.|$|E
60|$|My Dear-----, <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> {{settled in}} a West Indian country- house, amid a {{multitude}} of sights and sounds so utterly new and strange, that the mind is stupefied by the continual effort to take in, or (to confess the truth) to gorge without hope of digestion, food of every conceivable variety. The whole day long new objects and their new names have jostled {{each other in the}} brain, in dreams as well as in waking thoughts. Amid such a confusion, to describe this place as a whole is as yet impossible. It must suffice if you find in this letter a sketch or two--not worthy to be called a study--of particular spots which seem typical, beginning with my bathroom window, as the scene which first proved to me, at least, that we were verily in the Tropics.|$|E
60|$|Seventh: Every {{reflection}} is {{the image}} in reverse of just {{so much of the}} objects beside the water, as we could see if we were placed as much under the level of the water as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> above it. If an object be so far back from the bank, that if we were five feet under the water level we could not see it over the bank, then, standing five feet above the water, we shall {{not be able to see}} its image under the reflected bank. Hence the reflection of all objects that have any slope back from the water is shortened, and at last disappears as we rise above it. Lakes seen from a great height appear like plates of metal set in the landscape, reflecting the sky but none of their shores.|$|E
5000|$|We played {{four nights}} at The Tea Party, {{and by then}} we had {{an hour and a}} half's music to play; we played four and a half hours on the last night - we played the act twice, and then did {{everybody}} else's act with Who, Rolling Stones and Beatles numbers.

60|$|We {{have waited}} {{a week in}} the camp behind Spearman's Hill. The General has {{addressed}} the troops himself. He has promised that we shall be in Ladysmith soon. To replace the sixteen hundred killed and wounded in the late actions, drafts of twenty-four hundred men have arrived. A mountain battery, A Battery R.H.A., and two great fortress guns have strengthened the artillery. Two squadrons of the 14th Hussars {{have been added to the}} cavalry, so that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> to-day numerically stronger by more than a thousand men than when we fought at Spion Kop, while the Boers are at least five hundred weaker--attrition versus recuperation. Everyone has been well fed, reinforced and inspirited, and all are prepared for a supreme effort, in which we shall either reach Ladysmith or be flung back truly beaten with a loss of six or seven thousand men.|$|E

[...] The girl took my hand, {{and the young man}} bowed from his place; but if that poor old man had known, peace was not to be made so easily between two such bad-tempered women as Mrs. Thrall and myself. We expressed some very stiff sentiments in regard to the weather, and the prospect of the yacht getting off with the next tide, and my husband joined in with that manly gentleness of his, but we did not sit down, much less offer to stay to breakfast. We had got {{to the door of the}} tent, the family following us, even to the noble son-in-law, and as she now realized that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> going, Mrs. Thrall gasped out, [...] "But you are not leaving us?
