25|$|It {{can also}} be shown that if an extreme point is not a maximum point of the {{objective}} function then there is an edge containing the point so that the objective function is strictly increasing on the edge {{moving away from the}} point. If the edge is finite then the edge connects to another extreme point where the objective function has a greater value, otherwise the objective function is unbounded above on the edge and the linear program has no solution. The simplex algorithm applies this insight by walking along edges of the polytope to extreme points with greater and greater objective values. This continues until the maximum value is reached or an unbounded edge is visited, concluding that the problem has no solution. The algorithm always terminates because the number of vertices in the polytope is finite; moreover since we jump between vertices always in the same direction (that of the objective function), <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the number of vertices visited will be small.|$|E

Later in the season Carabott {{had a problem with}} Ben being so deceptive, as [...] "anything he imparts must be taken with a grain of salt". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also noted this, saying [...] "I don't trust Ben. I have no idea when he's lying and when he's telling the truth. The only thing I'm reasonably sure of is that everything he says is for the purpose of impacting a character — and the audience". Ben's father issues revealed towards the end of season three are described as [...] "not the most original Lost character trait by any means but it is the thrust behind Ben's development into the genocidal maniac he eventually becomes". Following the penultimate episode of the season, Carabott stated [...] "Even with his limited screen time, Michael Emerson's performance shines through and <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> he survives the events of the finale because we love seeing his character every week." [...] Erin Martell from TV Squad picked the Others as one of her season three highlights, partly due to the development of Ben, adding [...] "I cannot even picture the final three seasons without Ben".

40|$|Este estudo tem como objectivos: identificar as fontes de stress nos profissionais de saúde mental; comparar os níveis de stress ocupacional e burnout tendo em conta as variáveis sóciodemográficas e profissionais e analisar a relação entre as variáveis, apoio social burnout e stress ocupacional nos profissionais de saúde mental. Foram utilizados como instrumentos de avaliação um questionário sócio-demográfico, o Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), o Questionário de Stress nos Profissionais de Saúde (QSPS) e a Escala de Satisfação com o Suporte Social (ESSS). Neste estudo participaram 40 profissionais de saúde mental. Foram testadas sete hipóteses: na primeira hipótese, esperávamos que existissem diferenças entre os profissionais de saúde mental quanto à expressão de stress e burnout. Esta não se confirmou. Na segunda hipótese, esperávamos que existissem diferenças entre os profissionais de saúde do sexo feminino e masculino quanto à expressão de stress e burnout. Apenas se confirmou parcialmente. Na terceira hipótese, esperávamos que os profissionais de saúde mental casados tivessem níveis mais baixos de stress e burnout do que os solteiros. Não se confirmou. Na quarta hipótese esperávamos que os profissionais de saúde mais novos possuíssem níveis mais elevados de stress e burnout. Confirmou-se. Na quinta hipótese, esperávamos que os profissionais que trabalham mais horas por semana possuíssem níveis mais elevados de stress e burnout. Não se confirmou. Na sexta hipótese, esperávamos que os profissionais com mais reduzida experiência profissional apresentassem níveis mais elevados de stress e burnout. Apenas se confirmou parcialmente. Por último, na sétima hipótese esperávamos que quanto maior o apoio social, menor seriam os níveis de stress e burnout nos profissionais. Apenas se confirmou parcialmente.

This study involved 40 mental health professionals. Seven hypotheses were tested: on the first hypothesis, <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> differences exist between mental health professionals for the expression of stress and burnout.

On the fourth hypothesis hoped the younger health professionals have higher levels of stress and burnout. This was confirmed. On the fifth hypothesis <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> health professionals working more hours per week had higher levels of stress and burnout. This hypothesis was not confirmed. On the sixth hypothesis <b>we</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> health professionals reduced with more professional experience reported higher levels of stress and burnout.
