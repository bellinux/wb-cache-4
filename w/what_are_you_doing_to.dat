6000|$|So far the {{movement}} towards a world state has lacked any driving power of passion. We have been {{passing through a}} phase of intellectual revision. The idea of a world unity and brotherhood has come back again into the world almost apologetically, deferentially, asking for the kind words of successful politicians and for a gesture of patronage from kings. Yet this demand for one world-empire of righteousness was inherent in the teachings of Buddha, it flashed {{for a little while}} behind the sword of Islam, it is the embodiment in earthly affairs of the spirit of Christ. It is a call to men for service as of right, it is not an appeal to them that they may refuse, not a voice that they may disregard. It is too great a thing to hover for long thus deferentially {{on the outskirts of the}} active world it has come to save. To-day the world state says [...] "Please listen; make way for me." [...] To-morrow it will say: [...] "Make way for me, little people." [...] The day is not remote when disregardful [...] "patriotic" [...] men hectoring in the crowd will be twisted round perforce to the light they refuse to see. First comes the idea and then slowly the full comprehension of the idea, comes realization, and with that realization will come a kindling anger at the vulgarity, the meanness, the greed and baseness and utter stupidity that refuses to attend to this clear voice, this definite demand of our racial necessity. To-day we teach, but as understanding grows we must begin to act. We must put ourselves and our rulers and our fellow men on trial. We must ask: [...] "What have you done, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> help or hinder the peace and order of mankind?" [...] A time will come when a politician who has wilfully made war and promoted international dissension will be as sure of the dock and much surer of the noose than a private homicide. It is not reasonable that those who gamble with men's lives should not stake their own. The service of the world state calls for much more than passive resistance to belligerent authorities, for much more than exemplary martyrdoms. It calls for the greater effort of active interference with mischievous men. [...] "I will believe in the League of Nations," [...] one man has written, [...] "when men will fight for it." [...] For this League of Nations at Geneva, this little corner of Balfourian jobs and gentility, no man would dream of fighting, but for the great state of mankind, men will presently be very ready to fight and, as the thing may go, either to kill or die. Things must come in their order; first the idea, then the kindling of imaginations, then the world wide battle. We who live in the bleak days after a great crisis, need be no more discouraged by the apparent indifference of the present time than are fields that are ploughed and sown by the wet days of February and the cold indifference of the winds of early March. The ploughing has been done, and the seed is in the ground, and the world state stirs in a multitude of germinating minds.|$|E

40|$|Cue: The {{impact of}} global warming on {{agricultural}} production is most obvious in its threat to food production, particularly staple food crops grown by subsistence farmers. But cash crops can also suffer from changing weather patterns, and with global prices for many commodities falling, no farmer can afford to have poor harvests. This is particularly true for small-scale farmers. While large estates and plantations may {{have the resources to}} be able to adapt to meet the challenge of a changing climate, poorer farmers can seldom do so. In northern Tanzania, for example, some coffee estates have begun to respond to the changing rainfall patterns, but small-scale growers are struggling to continue with the crop. Lazarus Laiser recently visited both a large coffee estate and some smallholder growers, to find out how they were coping with changes in climate. IN:		?Burka coffee estate is a company? OUT:		?no more coffee in this country? DUR?N	 4 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mama Neuye ending that report on the difficulties facing coffee growers in northern Tanzania. Transcript Laiser	Burka coffee estate is a company dealing with production of coffee. It is situated {{in the northern part of}} Tanzania in Arusha region, on the slope of Mount Meru, the second largest mountain in Tanzania. The Junior Manager, Mrs Julian Mungure and Mr. Isdori Michael, the irrigation and weeding manager, have something to say about coffee and the change in temperature and rainfall, as a result {{of global warming}}. Mungure	What I can say is we lack temperature data from the previous years, so we don?t know, we are not sure, whether there is that drastic temperature change to conclude that it is due to global warming. Laiser	How about the rains, is the amount of rainfall changing? Mungure	Yes, the amount of rainfall changes. There is a logarithmic trend line applied to rain data from 1926. It shows a steady drop in average annual rainfall, from 920 mm to 850 mm now, so on average it rains 70 mm less than 80 years ago. Laiser	Has this affected the growth of coffee? Mungure	Yes there is an effect in coffee. The required amount of rainfall for coffee is at least 900 mm per year. The effect is obvious as in most of the years the rainfall is below the required amount of precipitation, which may lead to some effects, such as wilting, reduced bean size and weight, and therefore reduced production. Thus the need for irrigation is still there. Laiser	<b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> solve this problem of having little rains at the moment? Michael	We do irrigation. We have three methods: overhead irrigation, under-canopy or under-tree irrigation, and drip irrigation which is now in trial. Overhead irrigation has been done since this company was established many, many years ago. But according to the changes, we have been doing under-canopy irrigation since last year, and we are about to stop overhead irrigation. Laiser	Junior manager, I would like to know, do you have any variety which can tolerate, or maybe can adapt to the change in climate nowadays? Mungure	Currently my answer is no, we do not have any new variety which can tolerate or adapt to the climate changes in temperature here in Burka. Laiser	How do you think this problem has affected small-scale farmers? Mungure	What I can say is, in small-scale farming it is more family oriented. Their capital and labour are poor, leading to their failing to attend to the coffee trees and fields appropriately and at the right time. Pests and diseases are insufficiently attended to, once they occur. These all lead to a great reduction of the yield. And also during drought, these small-scale farmers are incapable of irrigating. Thus the coffee trees dry out. Laiser	I visited a farmer in Tengeru, 15 km from Arusha city. He showed me 50 coffee trees he had cut from his farm, because it was not giving any profit. He said that there were no rains, and there were a lot of diseases and insects, something it was very expensive to control. In Arumeru district at Sekei village I met Mama Neuye, who is 70 years old, and she has been a widow for about 30 years now. She told me how she had paid secondary school fees for her daughter in the 1980 s from her sales of coffee, but at the moment she is not getting any profit. As I can see your coffee is very very weak, and it is supposed to be flowering at this time, but it does not have any. What is the reason? Neuye	[Vernac]You can?t depend on coffee now, because there are not enough rains, there are a lot of diseases, no good price, and it gives flowers but will never produce fruits. No more coffee in this country. End of track.

40|$|Cue: One of {{the tragedies}} of the AIDS {{pandemic}} {{is that some}} of those who know they are HIV positive, or have even developed AIDS itself, continue to spread the disease. Many may feel they have nothing to lose. But how can this kind of attitude be changed? Clearly an important step is to make HIV and AIDS sufferers feel that they are still valued by their society - that their lives are not worthless. Achieving that goal requires action on many fronts: governments need to develop policies to prevent discrimination against HIV/AIDS sufferers, and there also need to be employment opportunities for those who have been weakened by the disease. Creating support networks and increasing public awareness about the disease are also important. This kind of holistic approach to AIDS is being strongly advocated by a charity working in Zimbabwe, Christian Care. In this report Sylvia Jiyane talks to Joseph Gari, an advocacy officer for the organisation. She begins be asking him to explain the links between agriculture and health. IN:		?There is a link between ?? OUT:		??. negative impact on our agriculture. ? DUR?N	 3 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Joseph Gari, an advocacy officer for Christian Care Zimbabwe. Transcript Gari	There is a link between agriculture and health. A healthy labour force is a prerequisite for a successful agricultural production. So what it means is like if the labour force is not healthy then there is no genuine agricultural production to talk of. On the other side agriculture has also an effect on health if its not done in the proper way. I mean in terms of sanitation. Like irrigation and the like, they can help breed mosquitoes and then {{at the end of the}} day we have malaria and that malaria?s going to affect people?s health. We can have other diseases like Bilharzia, which can be caused if agriculture?s not done in the proper way. Jiyane		Which one would you say is number one problem for Zimbabwe as we speak? Gari	I think the HIV/AIDS pandemic is the problem that is actually facing the nation. Jiyane	And you as an organisation, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> help the situation? Gari	We have got AIDS awareness programmes, advocacy programmes, some income generating programmes which are all aimed at helping people who are HIV/AIDS infected and also those who are affected. Jiyane	Would you cite an example? Gari	Yes we have got a programme which is done in urban area on the periphery of the Bulawayo city, that is a mushroom project. We?ve realised that this project could help those people who are both affected by HIV and infected in the sense that it doesn?t require a lot of manual input. Simply to take a bucket to water the mushroom and at the end of the day they can have something that they can eat and also have income because they will sell the mushrooms to the people. Jiyane	Talking about the same mushroom project, how does the community appreciate the growing of mushrooms since they are HIV positive? Gari	Very good comments are coming out of it. One good part of it is like we are also providing the material that is needed for that programme to be successful as well as the expertise. So we have trained people, now that people are trained they are able to grow mushroom on their own. So they are appreciating the programme because one they are getting the income after selling the mushroom. Two, they are also getting nutrients from that mushroom. Jiyane	And you mentioned advocacy earlier on. How does this advocacy come in to this programme? Gari	We have realised that in our country there is no policy per se, that is actually catering for the people who are affected by HIV and AIDS. So we are trying as an organisation to lobby for changes in that area to the Government that let?s recognise the status of the people who are living with HIV/AIDS. Let?s do something, let?s draft a policy that is going to accommodate those people so that at the end of the day these people are not discriminated against. On the same issue I think the government should also channel some of their resources towards rehabilitating people with HIV/AIDS. What we are trying to do is like we are trying to increase their life span so that maybe if they live longer the more impact they have on our agriculture because they have also a role to play in agricultural production. Jiyane	And what would be your message to people out there in Zimbabwe about this HIV and AIDS, seeing that it?s becoming a number one problem in the agricultural industry? Gari	Having realised that HIV/AIDS is becoming a new frontier to development in general, into agriculture in particular my message to the people is like, let?s stand up together, we fight discrimination, we fight this spread of AIDS through an enhanced network. If it means forming partnership, let?s form partnership and try to fight this disease HIV/AIDS in all our efforts, so that at the end of the day its not going to have a negative impact on our agriculture. End of track. An advocacy officer for Christian Care Zimbabwe stresses the importance of giving both economic and moral support to those with HIV/AIDS, so that they can continue to be productive members of societ...|$|E
40|$|Business sense {{needed from}} growers and {{government}} Cue: If farming {{is to be}} a profitable business, and not just a subsistence activity, there are two issues that farmers will need to think about very carefully: how to maximise their yields, and how to get the best price possible for their crop. With a cash crop such as cotton, there may be some help available for them to do both things. In Zambia, for example, {{there are a number of}} cotton promoting companies that depend on farmers to supply high quality cotton for their textile plants. Dunavant, Clark Cotton and Mulungushi are three such companies operating in the country, that are helping farmers both to grow and sell cotton. Despite this, however, the Zambian textile industry is struggling, not least because of a tax system which favours imported cotton, and makes Zambian cotton too expensive for the local industry to buy. Joseph Nkole is the Executive Secretary of the Cotton Producers Association of Zambia. He believes strongly that the government should be supporting its domestic cotton producers through a better tax system. He also believes that Zambia should be exploiting the Africa Growth Opportunity Act, known as AGOA, in order to export more cotton products to the United States. Under AGOA, a range of commodities, including finished clothes, can be exported without duty to the American market. Mr Nkole spoke recently, to Chris Kakunta, about how he believes the Zambian cotton industry can be resuscitated, or brought back to life. Chris began by asking how the cotton promoting companies were helping farmers in Zambia to increase their cotton production. IN:		?These organise the small-scale ? OUT:		? getting Bt into this country. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 08 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr Joseph Nkole of the Cotton Producers Association of Zambia was talking to Chris Kakunta. Transcript Nkole	These organise the small-scale farmers into schemes that are provided with inputs for production. They go into providing extension services to the farmers and then they provide the market for the farmers. But what we are seeing as a base is to have now these farmers to be trained in the various skills. To have best practices where they are dealing with a particular promoter, not leapfrogging from one promoter to another and avoiding to pay back loans. We want the farmers to have good ethics, appreciate the sanctity of contracts, so that they can now start to do business on a business footing, so that they can grow into bigger entities and run business on their own. Kakunta	How best can a small-scale farmer look after his or her cotton crop so that it gives maximum yield? Nkole	Well principally the farmer must plant his cotton early, on time. He must weed his crop, he must control the pests and he must have the correct plant population. For me these are the four non-negotiables in cotton production and if a farmer handles those with optimum efficiency they are bound to get very good yields from a hectare of cotton. Kakunta	Why do you think the yields are still low per hectare? Nkole	I think some farmers want to grow cotton as a by the way crop after they have planted maize or they have grown other crops. Now we are trying to get the farmers to appreciate that cotton is a main crop that they must engage in, plant on time, manage properly and they will see the good yields coming through. It has been done in many places and we are just hoping that we can now spread this to all the parts of the country where cotton is being grown. Kakunta	Zambia is part of the global village and obviously we have seen some cotton being imported into the country. Does that imported cotton affect the price of the local production and <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>to</b> help the farmers have the better price? Nkole	There are two issues here. One is the issue of second-hand clothing. Two is the issue of tax on raw cotton. Imported cotton is costing less to the textile industry than Zambian cotton because of the tax regime. And we have identified this with the ginners, and the Zambia National Farmers Union and we are trying to talk to the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry and their counterparts in finance to see how best we can give the Zambian cotton a price good enough for export so that it competes with cottons coming from outside. Yes cotton from outside is cheaper and the only reason is truly due to the tax regime. If government decides to tackle the issue of internal taxation again the service-providing companies will pass the benefit to the farmers by increasing the price. On the other hand, we would also work as an association to lobby the promoting companies, to pay the farmers a price that is good enough. But for Zambia, really for the price to improve we must get our textile industry to process the cotton produced in this country into finished products. Then you can start to benefit even from AGOA and the price to the farmer will obviously be increased. And so we are saying let us get quickly to look at what is Mulungushi doing? What is Mukuba doing? What is Mulungushi-China doing? Let us get them to have to produce garments; then we can break into the AGOA. There is a lot of benefit in there. Our counterparts and colleagues in West Africa are benefiting from it and I think it is a question of time. Very soon we will have these meetings to discuss how the government can come in to help us resuscitate the textile industry and then see our lint being processed internally. Kakunta	What about coming to Bt cotton? Do you think if a law was passed in Zambia to allow such cotton to be grown, as an association you would embrace it? And if you are going to embrace it, why? Nkole	We would definitely want to work within the ambits of the law. What we are seeing is the benefit to the small cotton farmer, like the other colleagues in the region are getting. So if we were to say ?Yes?, we would say it would be a welcome idea because we stand to benefit as a nation by increased volumes. We are, in the meantime, collecting a lot of data and evidence to show that this has got advantage for us. And as I said, we will not fight the law. If the law of the land determines that we have no Bt cotton, we shall go by that. But as an association we would want to have further investigation and compare the advantages and disadvantages. And at the moment we are currently thinking that it would be worth our while to increase productivity, to increase profitability and enhance the standards of living of our smallholder cotton farmers by getting Bt cotton into this country.
