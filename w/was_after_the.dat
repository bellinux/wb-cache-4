5|$|Thomas was an {{accomplished}} writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing {{he was capable}} of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work <b>was</b> <b>After</b> <b>the</b> Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction work can be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E
5|$|When Adelaide {{was first}} planned and mapped out by Col. William Light, Mount Osmond {{received}} the three allotments 1070, 1277 and 1278.

The first reported activity in the area <b>was</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> mining rush of Glen Osmond due to the Wheal Watkins and Wheal Gawler mines. Lot 1277 yielded a mine in Slaughterhouse Gully but it was worked only briefly. Subsequent finds of bluestone proved fruitful and the mineral was extracted until 1900, when mining ended and {{the last of the}} mines were either filled in or cordoned off.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1944, Bär, now a Major and rehabilitated {{from the}} demotion, was given command of II./Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG1). This <b>was</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> death of Hauptmann Hermann Segatz on 8 March 1944. JG1 was tasked with Reichsverteidigung (Defense of the Reich) and {{equipped}} with the Focke Wulf 190 A-7 fighter. Morale of the group soared following his appointment. He was considered the unofficial leader {{of the group and}} the best officer in the entire Geschwader. On 11 April 1944, Bär achieved his 199th aerial victory over a B-17 Flying Fortress near Fallersleben. His 200th aerial victory, a B-24 Liberator, was claimed on 22 April accompanied by his regular wingman Warrant Officer (Oberfeldwebel) Leo Schuhmacher, who would be awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 1 March 1945 as a fighter pilot in II./JG1. Bär had just landed at Störmede airfield from a II./JG1 intercept when a smoking United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24 of the 458th Bombardment Group passed overhead. Bär and his wingman quickly got into their aircraft and intercepted the B-24. The bomber's gunners had already bailed out of the aircraft, making it an easy aerial victory. Bär returned to Störmede airfield to the congratulations of his men. This double century victory earned Bär his third and final reference in the Wehrmachtbericht on 24 April 1944. After Oesau's death on 11 May 1944, Bär was made acting Wing Commander of JG1. In June, he was appointed Wing Commander of Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG3) following the death of Friedrich-Karl Müller. By the end of 1944, Bär's score had risen to 203.|$|E
