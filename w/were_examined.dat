5|$|In a 2001 study {{conducted}} by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 12 hand bones and 20 foot bones referred to Herrerasaurus <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fire}} of St. Germain-des-Prés in 1793 only 12 leaves were found, the other two have been {{transferred}} to Saint Petersburg. From 1795 until the present it has been held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Fragmenta Mosquensia were brought to Moscow in 1665. They <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> by Matthaei. The last was Porphyrius Uspensky, who took one leaf from the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Another {{specimen}} has {{a poorly}} healed fracture {{of the right}} fibula, which left a large callus on the bone. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 54 foot bones referred to Gorgosaurus <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{collocation}} {{method for}} solving the occluded radiosity equation <b>is</b> <b>examined,</b> theoretically and empirically. Theoretical results <b>are</b> <b>examined,</b> including questions of superconvergence of the collocation solution. The use of “discontinuity meshing ” <b>is</b> <b>examined</b> for both piecewise constant and piecewise linear collocation. Also, numerical {{integration of the}} collocation integrals <b>is</b> <b>examined,</b> and a near-analytic evaluation method is given...|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> by Montfaucon, Wettstein, and Cramer. It <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> {{and described}} by Paulin Martin. C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1885.|$|R

5|$|During the 1980s naval {{versions}} of the AH-64A for the United States Marine Corps and Navy <b>were</b> <b>examined.</b> Multiple concepts were studied with altered landing gear arrangements, improved avionics and weapons. The USMC was very interested and conducted a two-week evaluation of the Apache in September 1981, including shipboard operation tests.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{there was}} {{discussion}} of a rapid transit extension from Kennedy to Scarborough City Centre. As multiple types of technologies <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> many politicians requested a subway extension instead of the then proposed streetcar line. Instead, a medium-capacity rail transport system, known as the Scarborough RT was built.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{evidence}} of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma, {{was described in}} Edmontosaurus bones. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000fossils <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> in this manner, the tumors were limited to Edmontosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may {{have been caused by}} environmental factors or genetic propensity.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his remains <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> by Polish scientists, who in 2009 {{concluded}} {{that he died}} due to injuries consistent with an air crash, {{and that there was}} no evidence that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did not rule out the possibility of sabotage, which is still being investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. , the investigation continues.|$|E
5|$|In {{almost every}} case, dissidents <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> at the Serbsky Central Research Institute for Forensic Psychiatry in Moscow, where persons being prosecuted {{in court for}} {{committing}} political crimes were subjected to a forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation. Once certified, the accused and convicted were sent for involuntary treatment to the Special Psychiatric Hospitals controlled by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.|$|E
5|$|Nothing more {{is known}} of Cragh after his {{testimony}} to the papal commission in 1307. Thirty-eightposthumous miracles attributed to Thomas de Cantilupe <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> by the commissioners and submitted for consideration by the pope and his advisors. Twelve were rejected after further analysis, including Cragh's resurrection, but no reasons were recorded. Pope John XXII formally announced Cantilupe's canonisation on 17 April 1320, thirty-eight years after the new saint's death.|$|E
50|$|Some {{surgical}} specialties {{receive their}} training from separate colleges, these include: ophthalmic surgeons who <b>are</b> <b>examined</b> by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO), oral and maxillofacial surgeons who <b>are</b> <b>examined</b> by the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons (RACDS), and obstetric and gynecological surgeons who <b>are</b> <b>examined</b> by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG).|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> and {{described}} by Montfaucon and Wettstein. Scholz collated Matthew 1-8; Mark 1-4; John 4-8. It <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> {{and described}} by Paulin Martin. C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1885.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>{{examined}}</b> by Griesbach and Scholz. Scholz examined only {{texts of}} Mark 1-4 and John 5-8. It <b>was</b> <b>examined</b> and described by Paulin Martin. C. R. Gregory saw the manuscript in 1885.|$|R
5|$|Six {{defendants}} were then charged with stealing from George Stevens in Ely. Three witness <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> following which Dennis, Layton, Atkin, and Cammell were all pronounced guilty by the jury. Capital convictions against Aaron Chevall and William Beamiss, for robbing Henry Tansley of two £1 notes, were also returned by the jury. The court adjourned at 6pm.|$|E
5|$|These {{harmful effects}} {{may also be}} seen in non-smokers, as a recent {{meta-analysis}} including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> separately. As {{the majority of these}} low-bias trials dealt with either elderly people, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the Cochrane Collaboration; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of colon cancer. Beta-carotene may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.|$|E
5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery {{observed}} that antigens could be precipitated by antibodies {{and went on}} to show that antibodies are made of protein. The biochemical properties of antigen-antibody-binding interactions <b>were</b> <b>examined</b> in more detail in the late 1930s by John Marrack. The next major advance was in the 1940s, when Linus Pauling confirmed the lock-and-key theory proposed by Ehrlich by showing that the interactions between antibodies and antigens depend more on their shape than their chemical composition. In 1948, Astrid Fagreaus discovered that B cells, in the form of plasma cells, were responsible for generating antibodies.|$|E
