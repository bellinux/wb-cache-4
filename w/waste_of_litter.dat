In order to analyze litter carbon dynamics in depth, we investigated the actual mobility <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> in several natural forests in Sturt Meadows in an arid region of Western Australia, and estimated {{the difference between the}} removal rate of leaf and woody (twigs and branches) litter on the forest floor. Then we redeveloped a litter carbon dynamics model by incorporating physical removal <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> to show the different mobilities of leaf and woody litters. We also analyzed carbon balances and the effect <b>of</b> differential <b>litter</b> mobility on litter carbon dynamics. Except for twigs in one plot in a high density forest, 29 – 100 % <b>of</b> leaf <b>litter</b> and 10 – 100 % <b>of</b> woody <b>litter</b> was removed annually, demonstrating the physical removal <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> in these natural forests. The main cause <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> removal was wind, not flooding. Decreases in leaf and woody litters could be approximated as first order decay functions in most plots; first order decay or disappearance rate constants were then determined. Estimated disappearance rate constants of leaf and woody litter ranged from 0. 19 to 11 and 0. 11 – 12 year− 1, respectively; most of the constants ranged from 0. 19 to 2. 0 and 0. 11 – 0. 74 year− 1, respectively. Based on the disappearance rate constant, the mobility <b>of</b> woody <b>litter</b> was estimated to be roughly 20 % that <b>of</b> leaf <b>litter,</b> confirming that climatic factors move leaves more easily than twigs.

High inputs <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> produced by grazing-promoted species (C/N 11) stimulated net N mineralization rates, while high inputs <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> produced by grazing-reduced species (C/N 46) decreased rates of net N mineralization.

Grazing-induced variations in litter quality monitored in the field thus appeared unlikely to cause measured variations in net N mineralization rates.

This experiment includes leaf litters originating from 33 circumpolar and high-altitude global change experiments. Two-year decomposition rates <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> from these experiments were measured earlier in two common litter beds in sub-Arctic Sweden. • Response ratios of LSTs in plants of high-latitude ecosystems in the global change treatments showed a three-fold variation, and this was in the same range as the natural variation among species.

The accumulation <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> or thatch can affect plant community composition by affecting the temperature, nutrient availability, and light {{availability of the}} soil environment, thereby forming a potentially important linkage between recent productivity and current ecosystem processes. To investigate the importance <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> on a fen peatland plant community, we conducted a litter addition and removal experiment in a fen in northern Minnesota, USA, between 1998 and 2001. The addition <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> {{had little effect on}} fen plant community composition or microenvironmental variables, despite a two-fold increase in litter mass compared to control plots. However, the removal <b>of</b> <b>litter</b> dramatically increased cover of Rhynchospora fusca and R. alba, and reduced cover <b>of</b> Carex exilis. <b>Litter</b> removal also increased availability of light and soil temperature and increased the phosphorus content of aboveground plant biomass. Our results indicate that litter is an important control of plant community composition in this northern fen...|$|R
50|$|A common {{approach}} to using a mouse model {{is to apply}} an experimental treatment to a pregnant mouse in order to affect a whole litter. However, a key issue {{in the field is}} the treatment <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> in a statistical analysis. Most studies consider the total number of offspring produced as that may lead to an increase in statistical power. However, the correct way is to count by the number <b>of</b> <b>litters</b> and to normalize based on litter size. It was found that several autism studies incorrectly performed their statistical analyses based on total number of offspring instead <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>litters.</b>|$|R
