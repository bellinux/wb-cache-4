Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq war <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of all {{elements}} {{is based on}} properties of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, in range of oxidation states) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E

5|$|Geologically, {{the ground}} of Queen Maud Land is {{dominated}} by Precambrian gneiss, formed c.1 to 1.2Ga, before {{the creation of the}} supercontinent Gondwana. The mountains consist mostly of crystalline and granitic rocks, formed c.500 to 600Ma in the Pan-African orogeny during the assembly of Gondwana. In the farthest western parts of the territory, there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Research on the thickness of the ice has revealed that without the ice, the coast <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to those of Norway and Greenland, with deep fjords and islands.|$|E

Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E

5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing.

Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would {{have the option of}} using these for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E

However, NSB abandoned the plans and instead signed an agreement on 4 October 1940 for delivery of three electric locomotives. The units were intended to be delivered in 1942. The mechanical components and assembly was done by Thune, and electrical parts were delivered by NEBB, except the transformer and electric controllers, which were built by Per Kure.|$|E

5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{feared that}} they would be assassinated, and taught their {{followers}} that their deaths <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to those of the two witnesses of the Book of Revelation. Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early rejection by audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not making}} {{landfall}} on the United States, the hurricane caused widespread damage. Extensive precautionary measures were undertaken across the coast, particularly in New England. The heightened precautions were {{due in part}} to fears that effects from the storm <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to that of a devastating hurricane that struck the region two years prior. Most of the damage associated with the hurricane occurred in New Jersey, where the combination of moisture from the hurricane and a stationary front produced record rainfall, peaking at 24in (610mm) in the town of Ewan. This would make the storm the wettest in state history. The resultant floods damaged infrastructure, mostly to road networks. Damage in the state amounted to $4million. Farther north in New England, strong winds were reported, though damage remained minimal. Although the storm made two landfalls in Atlantic Canada, damage there too was minimal, and was limited to several boating incidents caused by strong waves. Overall, the hurricane caused seven fatalities.|$|E
5|$|A {{one-shot}} {{comic book}} {{adaptation of the}} show was announced in October 2014. Produced by KaBoom!, an imprint of Boom! Studios, the comic was released on November 5, 2014. The comic was supervised by McHale and was produced as an oversized special. The comic was illustrated by Jim Campbell, a writer/storyboard artist on the television series. A special variant cover, by McHale, was also released. The success of the standalone comic led to further issues being commissioned in May 2015 and began {{to be released in}} August 2015. According to Patrick McHale, the comic books <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to the one-shot comic, detailing the events that occurred in between certain episodes and will expand on the miniseries. The success of the series of one-shots led to an ongoing series of comics, serving as both a sequel and prequel to the series, rather than telling adventures that happened between episodes. The stories are told parallel, with half the comic detailing Greg returning to mysterious dreamlands in his sleep. The other half chronicles the Woodsman's daughter, Anna, and how she became lost in the Unknown.|$|E

5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. If this is the case they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
