5|$|Hafnium {{had been}} {{predicted}} by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869 and Henry Moseley measured in 1914 the effective nuclear charge by X-ray spectroscopy to be 72, placing it between the already known elements lutetium and tantalum. Dirk Coster and Georg von Hevesy {{were the first}} to search for the new element in zirconium ores. Hafnium was discovered by the two in 1923 in Copenhagen, Denmark, validating the original 1869 prediction of Mendeleev. There has been some controversy surrounding the discovery of hafnium {{and the extent to which}} Coster and Hevesy were guided by Bohr's prediction that hafnium would be a transition metal rather than a rare earth element. While titanium and zirconium, as relatively abundant elements, were discovered in the late 18th century, it took until 1923 for hafnium to be identified. This was only partly due to hafnium's relative scarcity. The chemical similarity between zirconium and hafnium made a separation difficult and, <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> to look for, hafnium was left undiscovered, although all samples of zirconium, and all of its compounds, used by chemists for over two centuries contained significant amounts of hafnium..|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E

25|$|The Dallas Morning News {{reported}} on November 17 that ABC News, citing anonymous sources, reported that investigators {{suspect that the}} shootings were triggered by superiors' refusal to process Hasan’s requests {{that some of his}} patients be prosecuted for war crimes based on statements they made during psychiatric sessions with him. Dallas attorney Patrick McLain, a former Marine, said that Hasan may have been legally justified in his request, but he could not comment <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> soldiers had said. Fellow psychiatrists complained to superiors that Hasan's actions violated doctor-patient confidentiality.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E

Zappa transcriptionist Kasper Sloots wrote, [...] "Zappa's guitar solos aren't meant to show off technically (Zappa hasn't claimed to be a big virtuoso on the instrument), but for the pleasure it gives trying to build a composition right {{in front of an audience}} <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> the outcome will be." ...|$|E

Grimm was effusive {{about the development of}} both children; Nannerl, he wrote, [...] "had the finest and most brilliant execution on the harpsichord", and: [...] "no-one but her brother can rob her of supremacy". Of Wolfgang he quoted a Prince of Brunswick as saying that many Kapellmeisters at the peak of their art would die <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> the boy knew at the age of nine.

500|$|The Royal Automobile Club campaigned vigorously {{against the}} {{pedestrianisation}} proposal. A publicity campaign fronted by actress Diana Dors {{in favour of}} reopening the bridge was launched, whilst a lobbying group of local residents led by poet Robert Graves campaigned {{in support of the}} GLC's plan. Graves's campaign collected over a thousand signatures in support, but was vigorously attacked by the British Road Federation, who derided the apparent evidence of public support for the scheme as [...] "sending a lot of students around to council flats [...] most people will sign anything <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> it is all about". A public enquiry of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid congestion on neighbouring bridges, and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and 2-ton weight limit in place.|$|E

The actor also stated that the script defined the character more than the comics, as Banshee went through various reinventions in print. Given Banshee gets involved with MacTaggert in the comics, Jones also tried to [...] "look at her just a little bit differently, you know, when I can." [...] As Jones suffers from acrophobia, using the rig that was to depict Banshee's flight required much preparation time with the stunt team.|$|E
500|$|Stanton {{originally}} {{wanted to}} juxtapose the opening shots of space with 1930s French swing music, {{but he saw}} The Triplets of Belleville (2003) {{and did not want}} to appear as if he were copying it. Stanton then thought about the song [...] "Put On Your Sunday Clothes" [...] from Hello, Dolly!, since he had portrayed the sidekick Barnaby Tucker in a 1980 high school production. Stanton found that the song was about two naive young men looking for love, which was similar to WALL-E's own hope for companionship. Jim Reardon suggested WALL-E find the film on video, and Stanton included [...] "It Only Takes a Moment" [...] and the clip of the actors holding hands, because he wanted a visual way to show how WALL-E understands love and conveys it to EVE.

500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} {{that can be achieved}} by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to understanding them as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that got him into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct was the nature of [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery <b>without</b> <b>knowing</b> <b>what</b> the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game. The island was divided into sections so that all the information the player needed to understand the specific behavior of puzzles in that section would be in one general location, a means to [...] " [...] down a lot of ambiguity that used to exist in adventure games". Puzzles within the game were designed to be meaningful {{within the context of the}} game, rather than to be simply a puzzle to be solved, and further aimed to be different from any other puzzle within the game.|$|E
