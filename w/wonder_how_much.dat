25|$|Sometimes the narrator's {{unreliability}} is made immediately evident. For instance, a {{story may}} open with the narrator making a plainly false or delusional claim or admitting to being severely mentally ill, or {{the story itself}} may have a frame in which the narrator appears as a character, with clues to the character's unreliability. A more dramatic use of the device delays the revelation until near the story's end. In some cases, the reader discovers that in the foregoing narrative, the narrator had concealed or greatly misrepresented vital pieces of information. Such a twist ending forces readers to reconsider {{their point of view}} and experience of the story. In some cases the narrator's unreliability is never fully revealed but only hinted at, leaving readers to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the narrator should be trusted and how the story should be interpreted.|$|E
500|$|In an editorial, the New York Herald Tribune {{pointed out}} that the {{circumstances}} of Broderick's forced retirement only came to light because he was seeking a new career in politics, and that [...] "voters may <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they are really told about city government, when the Broderick incident demonstrates how discreetly a little embarrassment can be obliterated." ...|$|E
500|$|Second-in-line to {{the throne}} was the prince's younger brother Albert ("Bertie"). Albert and his wife, Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), had two children, {{including}} Princess Elizabeth ("Lilibet"), the future Queen Elizabeth II. George V favoured Albert and his granddaughter Elizabeth and told a courtier, [...] "I pray to God that my eldest son will never marry and have children, and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne." [...] In 1929, Time magazine reported that the Prince of Wales teased his sister-in-law, by calling her [...] "Queen Elizabeth". The magazine asked if [...] "she did not sometimes <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> truth {{there is in the}} story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V – which would make her nickname come true".|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well-received upon release. Comic book letterer Todd Klein recommended {{the book to}} his readers, stating that the novel was able to convey the depths of Cope and Marsh's rivalry and [...] "we can only <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more could have been accomplished if [...] had only been willing to team up instead". Klein's complaints focused on the somewhat stiff art and the difficulty in telling some characters apart, but said these shortcomings {{did not affect the}} flow and reading. Johanna Carlson of ComicsWorthReading.com found Bone Sharpss central message, [...] "the question of whether promotion is a necessary evil (to gather funds through attention) or a base desire of those with the wrong motivations", still relevant to today's society; Carlson also lauded the flow of the novel and some of the intricate details in the story and setting. Other reviewers praised Ottaviani's inclusion of notable historical figures, and the educational yet entertaining feel of the work.|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Particular praise {{was given to}} the album's lyrical content and production quality. Ashleigh Kittle of Allmusic gave it 3 out of 5 stars, comparing the album's overall sound to that of Chapman, Caedmon's Call, and Phillips, Craig & Dean. Andy Argyrakis of CCM Magazine gave the album a B grade, praising the album as a [...] "promising freshman effort" [...] but critiquing its [...] "tendency to occasionally reflect its primary muse a bit too liberally". Belinda S. Ayers of Christian Broadcasting Network praised the album's lyrics and sound. Steve Best of Cross Rhythms gave Casting Crowns ten out of ten squares, saying, [...] "The passion of lead vocalist and youth pastor Hall jumps out of each set of lyrics, while Chapman's distinctive production touch...makes this a must listen album". While praising the album's overall production and lyrical content, Breimeier said the album [...] "too readily recalls the work of its producers, leaving us to <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of it is really Casting Crowns" [...] – he gave the album 3.5 out of 5 stars. The album received positive reviews from Brian Mansfield of USA Today, Robin Parrish of CMCentral.com, and Michael Herman of Christianity Today.|$|E
500|$|Both {{episodes of}} [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly described them as [...] "nearly perfect", calling them {{the two best}} episodes of the season so far: [...] " [...] nailed the characterizations, the interactions, the tossed-off one-liners, the weird-yet-realistic scenarios...I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it helps that she's out on the acting floor every day, getting attuned to her costars' rhythms?" [...] Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune of Scranton, Pennsylvania, said the first [...] "Lecture Circuit" [...] episode was his favorite episode of the fifth season so far, which he said provided several laugh-out-loud moments and a poignancy with Michael's decision to find Holly. McAuliffe described the second episode as a [...] "satisfying wrap-up" [...] and said Michael's outburst during the lecture was [...] "one of the most painful Michael meltdown moments in the show's history". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said the first episode perfectly balanced drama and comedy. He particularly complimented the chemistry between both Carell and Fischer and between Krasinski and Wilson, {{and said he was}} particularly pleased to receive closure over the Karen character. But Sepinwall said the second episode felt padded with [...] "material I would have been fine seeing as deleted scenes". Although he said Carell's reaction to the news that Holly still has feelings for him as a [...] "wonderful performance", Sepinwall also said the subplot involving Angela's cat was particularly unfunny and that subplot with Jim and Dwight, [...] "so brilliant last week, ran out of steam quickly here." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 19, 2010, Scribner {{published}} {{a collection of}} short stories, Palo Alto, by Franco. The book is named after the California city where Franco grew up and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories Palo Alto, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, consists of life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who {{spend most of their time}} indulging in driving drunk, smoking weed and taking part in unplanned acts of violence. Each passage is told by a young narrator. The book has received mixed reviews; Los Angeles Times called it [...] "the work of an ambitious young man who clearly loves to read, who has a good eye for detail, but who has spent way too much time on style and virtually none on substance". The Guardian said that Franco's [...] "foray into the literary world may be met with cynicism in some quarters, but this is a promising debut from a most unlikely source". Writing in The New York Times, reviewer and fellow author Joshua Mohr praised Franco for how, in the story [...] "American History", he juxtaposed historical parts with a present-day social commentary that [...] "makes the we <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we've actually evolved in post-bellum America". At least one editor of a literary journal testified he would not publish Franco's stories, claiming he has been published due to his star power, not literary talent. Publishers Weekly reviewed the collection, stating [...] "The author fails to find anything remotely insightful to say in these 11 amazingly underwhelming stories".|$|E

2500|$|Sachs {{himself said}} that the {{nomination}} was: [...] "a bit of a surprise", and that: [...] "One would question the reasons when it comes so quickly after what happened. I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{it has to do}} with trying to comfort him. I don't know. That is how it happens. That is showbusiness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before Gresham {{began his}} long career in outdoor journalism, {{he signed a}} {{baseball}} contract with the Chicago Cubs organization {{and was on the}} roster of the Cubs' Shelby, North Carolina farm team but never played. His son, Tom Gresham, learned of the baseball offer from the Cubs several years after his father's death while looking through old family records. [...] "He went to work {{to take care of his}} young family ... I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it hurt him to make that decision. So much that he never, ever told us he was signed by the Cubs." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1909 cricket season, Greswell left England for Sri Lanka, {{then called}} Ceylon, where he managed some of his family's {{business}} interests in tea plantations and assisted in the tea broking business in Colombo. Over the next 20 years, he played a lot of cricket in Sri Lanka for teams that would now be regarded as first-class: [...] "His record as a bowler was by local standards phenomenal. He was the first European to take one thousand wickets... Several times he captured all ten wickets in an innings... In 1911 alone, Greswell took 232 wickets, unquestionably a record for Ceylon in those days. One might reasonably <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> time was devoted to tea-planting and office matters." ...|$|E
