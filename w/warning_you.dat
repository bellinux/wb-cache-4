500|$|... "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira for her fifth studio album and first English-language album Laundry Service (2001). It was the first song Shakira wrote in English after being encouraged by American singer Gloria Estefan to record material in the language. She also produced the track along with Lester Mendez. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] musically combines elements of pop rock and tango, and contains instrumentation from the bandoneón and guitar. Through the lyrics of the song, Shakira aims to end a love triangle she is a part of. The song was released as the third single from the album on 6 July 2002. A Spanish version of the song, entitled [...] "Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)" [...] ("I'm <b>Warning</b> <b>You,</b> I'm Telling You"), was also {{recorded by}} the singer.|$|E
500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker <b>warning</b> <b>you</b> to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

500|$|Ford became Vice President as the Watergate scandal was unfolding. On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig {{contacted}} Ford to {{tell him}} that [...] "smoking gun" [...] evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had {{been a part of the}} Watergate cover-up. At the time, Ford and his wife, Betty, were living in suburban Virginia, waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president's residence in Washington, D.C. However, [...] "Al Haig asked to come over and see me," [...] Ford later said, [...] "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said, 'I'm just <b>warning</b> <b>you</b> that you've got to be prepared, that things might change dramatically and you could become President.' And I said, 'Betty, I don't think we're ever going to live in the vice president's house.|$|E
500|$|A few {{songs are}} also {{influenced}} by dance-based genres; the [...] "feisty" [...] "Rules" [...] is laced with new wave and [...] "Ready for the Good Times" [...] is inspired by disco music. The power ballad [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] has Shakira delivering [...] "racked" [...] vocals and features brass instrumentation influenced by English rock band The Beatles. It contains a melody {{similar to the one}} in [...] "Eternal Flame", a 1989 song by American all-female band The Bangles. Similarly, the tune of [...] "The One", another power ballad on the album, {{is similar to that of}} [...] "Michelle", a 1965 song by The Beatles. [...] "Fool" [...] and [...] "Poem to a Horse" [...] are more directly influenced by rock music. The former received comparisons to the work of Alanis Morissette while the latter also displays indie elements and contains instrumentation from a soul music-styled horn section and guitar riffs similar to the one present in songs by American grunge band Nirvana. Laundry Service also contains four Spanish tracks: [...] "Que Me Quedes Tú" [...] ("That You Remain With Me"), [...] "Te Dejo Madrid" [...] ("I Leave You Madrid"), [...] "Suerte" [...] ("Luck") and [...] "Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)" [...] ("I'm <b>Warning</b> <b>You,</b> I'm Announcing to You"); the latter two are Spanish translations of [...] "Whenever, Wherever" [...] and [...] "Objection (Tango)", respectively.|$|E

[...] "It was almost like we had a kind of perfect storm of circumstances falling into place," [...] Davis said.|$|E
