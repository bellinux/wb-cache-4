5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but <b>why</b> <b>would</b> I bless Him? Every {{fiber in}} me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics have}} noted {{similarities}} between names in Septimus Heap {{and those in}} Harry Potter, such as Petroc Trelawney (Jenna's pet rock) and Sybill Trelawney (a professor in Harry Potter); also both series feature Boggarts (which are intelligent Marsh creatures in Septimus Heap and shape-shifters in Harry Potter). In response, British author Phil Knight has commented: The Petroc Trelawney in the Septimus Heap books is {{nothing at all to}} do with Professor Trelawney. He is a Radio 3 presenter who may well be known to Angie Sage personally, but otherwise will be known over the air. Think: <b>why</b> <b>would</b> Jenna call a pet rock 'Trelawney'? To a Radio 3 listener like me, it's perfectly logical... And as for Boggarts, they've been around here in the North of England for a long time. Manchester has Boggart Hole Clough, for example. They're not really like either Sage's or Rowling's creatures, but pre-exist either of them.|$|E
25|$|Any {{drug court}} that relies {{primarily}} on jail, or punishment generally, is operating way outside our philosophy and just {{does not understand}} addiction. They’ve (addicts) lost their jobs, their income, they’ve lost their loved ones.

25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up for a bit of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent and I guess that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
25|$|Mercati {{posed the}} {{question}} to himself, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> anyone prefer to manufacture artifacts of stone rather than of metal, a superior material? His answer was that metallurgy was unknown at that time. He cited Biblical passages to prove that in Biblical times stone was the first material used. He also revived the 3-age system of Lucretius, which described a succession of periods based {{on the use of}} stone (and wood), bronze and iron respectively. Due to lateness of publication, Mercati's ideas were already being developed independently; however, his writing served as a further stimulus.|$|E
25|$|Late in 2014, News 12 aired an {{interview}} with Bonie, who had been held in jail since his arrest. He denied any involvement in Moore's disappearance or death, saying {{that she had been}} a good tenant who had paid her rent on time. If he had killed her, he asked, <b>why</b> <b>would</b> he have cooperated with the police investigation as much as he had, to the point of allowing officers to search his home without obtaining a search warrant? He said they had only considered him as a suspect after he filed suit for their allegedly taking money from the basement.|$|E

25|$|Among {{those who}} believe that the term Gurjara was {{originally}} a tribal designation, there are disagreements over whether they were native Indians or foreigners. The proponents of the foreign origin theory point out that the Gurjara-Pratiharas suddenly emerged as a political power in north India around 6th century CE, shortly after the Huna invasion of that region. Critics of the foreign origin theory argue that there is no conclusive evidence of their foreign origin: they were well-assimilated in the Indian culture. Moreover, if they invaded Indian through the north-west, it is inexplicable <b>why</b> <b>would</b> they choose to settle in the semi-arid area of present-day Rajasthan, rather than the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain.|$|E
25|$|In 1925 Huxley {{moved to}} King's College London as Professor of Zoology, but in 1927, to the amazement {{of his colleagues}} and on the prodding of H. G. Wells whom he had promised 1,000 words a day, he {{resigned}} his chair to work full-time with Wells and his son G. P. Wells on The Science of Life (see below). For some time Huxley retained his room at King's College, and continued as Honorary Lecturer in the Zoology Department. From 1927 to 1931 he was also Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution, where he gave an annual lectures series. No-one realised {{it at the time}} (<b>why</b> <b>would</b> they?), but he had {{come to the end of}} his life as a university academic.|$|E

500|$|Caragiale {{showed little}} {{surprise}} at the news. In an interview with poet Alexandru Antemireanu, he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms: [...] "They did well not to sentence the kid. Is he the guilty party? No!

[...] The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale's side, and Macedonski's reputation suffered greatly as a result, increasing his isolation on the literary scene.|$|E

Speaking on the Oldman controversy, Dinklage said, [...] "There was some flak: <b>Why</b> <b>would</b> you put Gary Oldman on his knees? That's almost like blackface.

500|$|Epstein {{added the}} Vic Lewis Organisation to NEMS in 1966, and later brought {{impresario}} Robert Stigwood in as a manager.

McCartney was taking a more active interest in NEMS' finances, as it became known that some artists with more ruthless managers claimed to be benefiting from more commercially advantageous terms, such as the Rolling Stones under the management of Allen Klein. After Epstein's death, Clive Epstein assumed control of NEMS as the company's second largest shareholder.
