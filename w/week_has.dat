5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a <b>week)</b> <b>has</b> a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University {{was founded}} by former Jesuits in the {{tradition}} of Ignatius of Loyola; it {{is a member of the}} Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. Georgetown is not a pontifical university, though seven Jesuits serve on the thirty-six member Board of Directors, the school's highest governance. Catholic spaces at the university fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Washington, such as Dahlgren Chapel, the university's principal Catholic place of worship. Fifty-two members of the Society of Jesus live on campus, and are employed by Georgetown mostly as professors or administrators. Jesuit Heritage <b>Week</b> <b>has</b> been held every year since 2001 to celebrate the contributions of Jesuits to the Georgetown tradition.|$|E

25|$|More recently, {{computer}} {{technology has been}} incorporated into treatment options. A key indication for good prognosis is treatment intensity. A minimum of two–three hours per <b>week</b> <b>has</b> been specified to produce positive results. The main advantage of using computers {{is that it can}} greatly increase intensity of therapy. These programs consist of a large variety of exercises and can be done at home in addition to face-to-face treatment with a therapist. However, since aphasia presents differently among individuals, these programs must be dynamic and flexible in order to adapt to the variability in impairments. Another barrier is the capability of computer programs to imitate normal speech and keep up with the speed of regular conversation. Therefore, {{computer technology}} seems to be limited in a communicative setting, however is effective in producing improvements in communication training.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles flew to India in February 1968, {{to visit}} the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram (after first meeting him on 24 August 1967, at the London Hilton hotel). Evans arrived in India {{a few days earlier}} to inspect the ashram, but as soon as Starr got off the plane, he demanded that Evans find a doctor, as his {{inoculation}} shots were causing him pain. Evans: “When we arrived at the local hospital, I tried to get immediate treatment for him , to be told curtly by the Indian doctor, 'He is not a special case and will have to wait his turn.' So off we go to pay a private doctor ten rupees for the privilege of hearing him say 'It will be all right'." [...] Evans wrote in his diary on 17 February 1968: [...] "The press really tried kicking down the gates into the Ashram, the Indian people on the Ashram called me half way through, but as soon as an Indian reporter told me [...] "No bloody foreigner is going to stop me in my own country", I cooled it." [...] Evans' diary says that he enjoyed his time in India: [...] "It's hard to believe that a <b>week</b> <b>has</b> already passed. I suppose the peace of mind and the serenity one achieves through meditation makes the time fly," [...] and that he also enjoyed the food, unlike Starr, who had brought a suitcase full of baked beans with him. After leaving India, Harrison and Evans flew to New York, visiting Bob Dylan and The Band, who were rehearsing at their Big Pink house/studio, in Woodstock.|$|E
