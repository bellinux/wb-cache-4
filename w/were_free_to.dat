5|$|The French 1st Army {{had also}} taken a {{battering}} and despite winning several tactical defensive victories it {{was forced to}} retreat on 15 May owing to developments elsewhere, leaving its tanks on the battlefield, while the Germans <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> recover theirs.|$|E
5|$|After Philip's {{withdrawal}} from his campaign against Rhodes, the Rhodians <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> attack Olous and Hierapytna and their other Cretan allies. Rhodes' search for allies in Crete bore fruit when the Cretan city of Knossos {{saw that the}} war was going in Rhodes' favour and decided to join Rhodes in an attempt to gain supremacy over the island. Many other cities in central Crete subsequently joined Rhodes and Knossos against Hierapytna and Olous. Now under attack on two fronts, Hierapytna surrendered.|$|E

5|$|Ahead of the 2011 season, NFF and NTF {{stated that}} Superfinalen would be discontinued, {{stating that the}} {{championship}} was interesting neither from a sports nor from a commercial aspect. However, the two would-be qualified teams, league winner Rosenborg and cup winner Str√∏msgodset, <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> play a pre-season friendly, although {{it would not be}} regarded as an official match. Rosenborg has traditionally played its final pre-season game against Viking and stated that they intended to take up that tradition following the abandoning of Superfinalen.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944, Allied {{submarines}} were sinking {{large numbers}} of Japanese ships. Their activities were frequently guided by 'Ultra' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines {{in the vicinity of}} convoys. The submarine commanders <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a second}} Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again {{reinstating}} the off-limits {{nature of the}} Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again ultra vires and unreasonable, and that the British government had violated legitimate expectation by passing the second Order after giving {{the impression that the}} Chagossians <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> return home.|$|E

5|$|On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and {{the band}} were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys {{initially}} refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that the Allman Brothers would be closing the show, and they <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> leave if they disagreed. The Allman Brothers' performance was used for additional tracks when an expanded version of At Fillmore East, The Fillmore Concerts, was reissued on CD.|$|E
5|$|On the West German side, {{there were}} no fortifications of any kind, nor even any patrol roads in most areas. Warning signs (Grenzschilder) with {{messages}} such as Achtung! Zonengrenze! ("Danger! Zonal border!") or Halt! Hier Zonengrenze ("Stop! Zonal border here") notified visitors. Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents. Signs in English and German provided notifications of {{the distance to the}} border to prevent accidental crossings. No such restriction applied to Western civilians, who <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> go up to the border line, and {{there were no}} physical obstacles to stop their crossing it.|$|E

Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|The Islamic {{principle}} of kafa'a discourages the marriages {{of women to}} men of differing religion or of inferior status. Neighbouring Muslim powers did not start to give their daughters in marriage to Ottoman princes until the fifteenth century, when they were seen to have grown in importance. This same principle meant that, while Ottoman men <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> marry Christian women, Muslim princesses were prevented from marrying Christian princes.|$|E
5|$|The first Championship {{was awarded}} at a Cardiff show in 1928, to {{a red and}} white Pembroke bitch named Shan Fach. The breeds {{continued}} to be judged together until 1934, when The Kennel Club recognised each breed separately. In that initial registration, some 59 Cardigans and 240 Pembrokes were listed in the pedigree books. The decisions about the breed to which each dog belonged were sometimes left to the owners, who <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> choose whichever they felt was the most appropriate. The first dog to be named Best in Show at an open conformation show was Ch. Bowhit Pivot.|$|E

5|$|A great {{imperial}} expedition under Leo Phocas and Romanos I Lekapenos {{ended with}} another crushing Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Achelous in 917, {{and the following}} year the Bulgarians <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> ravage northern Greece. Adrianople was plundered again in 923, and a Bulgarian army laid siege to Constantinople in 924. Simeon died suddenly in 927, however, and Bulgarian power collapsed with him. Bulgaria and Byzantium entered {{a long period of}} peaceful relations, and the Empire was now free to concentrate on the eastern front against the Muslims. In 968, Bulgaria was overrun by the Rus' under Sviatoslav I of Kiev, but three years later, John I Tzimiskes defeated the Rus' and re-incorporated Eastern Bulgaria into the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group were {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry and the Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E
5|$|As traders sailed farther east, the voyages became {{longer and}} more expensivea Smaller {{enterprises}} were merged into larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began to stand out {{as one of the}} most important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up farther and farther along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders <b>were</b> <b>free</b> <b>to</b> compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E
