During that meeting, Markin suggested that the transit authority should pressure the police to resolve the homicide case quickly and get the trains moving again, an element which Yoshimura eventually added to the script.

Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his people were being treated more like an enemy.

Finucane was treated in Horton Hospital which specialised in combat wounds. While recovering Finucane was sent messages of congratulations by Trafford Leigh-Mallory AOC 11 Group.

Finucane was moved to RAF Halton in Wendover, Buckinghamshire on 14 November 1941. On 22 November he moved to the former luxury Palace Hotel in Torquay.

Coligny was carried to his lodgings at the Hôtel de Béthisy, where the surgeon Ambroise Paré removed a bullet from his elbow and amputated a damaged finger with a pair of scissors. Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.• Frieda, 292. The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, Francis, Duke of Guise.• For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83–4.

500|$|The Beatles did {{not attend}} Epstein's funeral, both to allow his family some privacy, and to avoid {{attracting}} fans and the media.

However, flowers are forbidden at Jewish funerals and burials.

500|$|The New York Yankees {{returned}} for another exhibition {{game against the}} Sounds on April 28, 1983. New York had a four-run lead going {{into the bottom of}} the ninth inning, but a five-run rally with two outs propelled the Sounds to a 5–4win in front of 13,641 fans. Among the Yankees in attendance for the game were Billy Martin, Yogi Berra, Goose Gossage, Ken Griffey, Sr., Dave Winfield, Lou Piniella, and Willie Randolph. During the season, manager Doug Holmquist, frustrated with the team's disappointing first half, instituted a system of fines for player infractions or poor performance on the field. The program ranged from a US$10 fine for a pitcher walking a batter with one on and two outs to a US$100 fine for missing curfew. Rebounding, Nashville won the second-half pennant, earning the team a shot at the Western Division championship. The Sounds, however, lost the fifth game of the best-of-five series to the Birmingham Barons by a score of seven runs to five, ending their season. The Sounds finished 30 games over [...]500, with a 88–58 record. Pitcher Jamie Werly set the career franchise strikeout record (352) when he played for the Sounds in 1980, 1981, and 1983. On June 21, during a road trip to Orlando, Florida, teammates Scott Bradley, Mike Pagliarulo, Erik Peterson, and Buck Showalter were <b>walking</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their hotel when Peterson was hit by an automobile.

He survived, but with a bruised leg and several lacerations to the head, and he returned to play later in the season. The Southern League All-Star Game returned to Nashville in 1983. Not only did the Sounds host the event, but they also served as the All-Star team's competition. The All-Stars recorded the victory with a score of three runs to two.|$|E
