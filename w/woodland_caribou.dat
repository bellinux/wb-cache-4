5000|$|In {{late fall}} or early winter after the rut, male caribou lose their antlers. Female caribou keep their antlers until they calve. Antlers begin to grow on male caribou in March and on female caribou in May or June. This process is called antlerogenesis. While the antler is developing, it {{is covered in}} velvet which is rubbed off when the antler bone hardens. This velvet is dark brown on <b>woodland</b> or barren-ground <b>caribou</b> and slate grey on Peary caribou. Antlers grow very quickly every year on the males.

5|$|Canada is home {{to about}} 52,000–60,000 wolves, whose legal status varies {{according}} to province and territory. First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction, and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not. In Alberta, wolves on private land may be baited and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license, and in some areas, wolf hunting bounty programs exist. Large-scale wolf population control through poisoning, trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government-mandated programs {{in order to support}} populations of endangered prey species such as <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou.</b>|$|E
5|$|While loss {{of habitat}} has {{affected}} native {{animals such as}} the pine marten, elk, <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou,</b> and bison, others like whitetail deer and bobcat thrive. The state has the nation's largest population of timber wolves outside Alaska, and supports healthy populations of black bears, moose, and gophers. Located on the Mississippi Flyway, Minnesota hosts migratory waterfowl such as geese and ducks, and game birds such as grouse, pheasants, and turkeys. It is home to birds of prey, including {{the largest number of}} breeding pairs of bald eagles in the lower 48 states as of 2007, red-tailed hawks, and snowy owls. The lakes teem with sport fish such as walleye, bass, muskellunge, and northern pike, and streams in the southeast and northeast are populated by brook, brown, and rainbow trout.|$|E

5000|$|Tillenius {{travelled}} across Canada in 1954 {{to create}} a series of 200 large oil paintings of Canada's wildlife and wilderness landscapes entitled [...] "Monarchs of the Canadian Wilds", commissioned by the Monarch Life Assurance Company. These paintings are now grouped together in a collection at the Pavilion Gallery Museum at Assiniboine Park in Winnipeg. Hundreds of thousands of reproductions of these paintings and their accompanying texts have been distributed across Canada and around the world.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of spatial planning tools in con-junction with increases in the availability of geo-graphic information systems and associated data {{has led to the}} rapid growth in the exploration and applica-tion of species distribution models. Conservation professionals can choose from a considerable number of modelling techniques, but there has been relatively little evaluation of predictive performance, data requirements, or type of inference of these models. Empirical data for <b>woodland</b> caribouRangifer tarandus <b>caribou</b> was used to examine four species distribution models, namely a qualitative habitat suitability index and quantitative resource selection function, Mahalanobis distance and ecological niche models. Models for three sets of independent variables were developed and then a temporally independent set of caribou locations evaluated predictive performance. The similarity of species distribution maps among the four modelling approaches was also quantified. All of the quantitative species distribution models were good predictors of the validation data set, but the spatial distribution of mapped habitats differed considerably among models. These results suggest that choice of model and variable set could influence the identification of areas for conservation emphasis. Model choice may be limited by the type of species locations or desired inference. Conservation professionals should choose a model and variable set based on the question, the ecology of the species and the availability of requisite data...|$|R

The Gwich'in prefer to hunt Porcupine caribou or the barren-ground Blue Nose herd, who travel in large herds, when they are available. Many hunters claimed that <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> that form very small groups, are wilder, both hard to see and hard to hunt. They are very smart, cunning and elusive.

40|$|Over 60 % of the {{population}} in K'asho Got'ine, NWT, obtained less than 2 / 3 of the Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNI) for vitamin A and calcium, as reported in a previous nutritional assessment. Focus group discussions and a food preference assessment were conducted with adults in order to identify the cultural, ecological, and socioeconomic factors (food attributes) as well as the individual preferences which influence the consumption of vitamin A and calcium-rich traditional and market foods in K'asho Got'ine. The major attributes limiting intakes of traditional food rich in vitamin A and calcium included: lack of equipment for hunting/fishing; seasonality; distance traveled to obtain certain foods; occasional unhealthy appearance of food; no hunter/fisher in the household. The major food attributes reported as barriers to greater intakes of selected market foods were: cost, freshness, intolerance to certain items, availability and unfamiliarity. Foods that received the highest preference scores were rabbit liver, loche liver, and Canada goose meat (smoked/dried) for vitamin A-rich foods and connie eggs, rabbit flesh, <b>woodland</b> and barrenland <b>caribou</b> head for calcium-rich foods. Criteria for selection of traditional and market foods to promote in the community included: (1) convenience of the food; (2) difficulty to overcome barriers to increasing food consumption; (3) concentration level of contaminants in certain traditional food; and (4) food preference score. This study identified available and underutilized traditional and market foods rich in vitamin A and calcium which are most acceptable to the community, and may be promoted in future nutrition intervention programs...|$|R

25|$|In Northern Alberta, oil {{development}} activities bring {{an enormous number}} of people into a fragile ecosystem. Historically, population figures have been very low for this region. Water is easily polluted because the water table reaches the surface in most areas of muskeg. With the ever-increasing development and extraction of resources, wildlife are recipient to both direct and indirect effects of pollution. <b>Woodland</b> <b>Caribou</b> are particularly sensitive to human activities, and as such are pushed away from their preferred habitat during {{the time of year when}} their caloric needs are greatest and food is the most scarce. Humans' effect on the Caribou is compounded by road construction and habitat fragmentation that open the area up to deer and wolves.|$|E
500|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{subdivided into}} distinct geographical regions called biomes. Newfoundland and Labrador {{are divided into}} two biomes: tundra [...] and taiga. Northern Labrador {{is part of the}} tundra, while southern Labrador is part of the taiga. Newfoundland is not typical of either biome, as it lacks much of the plant and animal life that are characteristic to these biomes. During the last ice age the island of Newfoundland was completely covered by glaciers and swept clean of life. Only those species which were able to recolonize the island after the glaciers retreated about 18,000 years ago are considered [...] "native". Similarly, only freshwater-fish capable of surviving seawater swam to the island. Labrador has 42 native mammals, Newfoundland is home only to 14, with no snakes, raccoons, skunks or porcupines. [...] large herds of <b>Woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> {{can be found in the}} barren interior regions of the island. Two animals formerly resident in Newfoundland have been declared extinct: the Great auk, a flightless seabird, and the Newfoundland wolf, a subspecies of the Gray wolf. The Labrador duck, believed to have nested in Labrador, was one of the first North American bird species to be recorded as becoming extinct.|$|E
500|$|Virtually all the {{historically}} known {{plant and animal}} species, {{with the exception of}} the bison and <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou,</b> are still present, providing biologists with an intact ecosystem for plant and animal research. Two threatened species of mammals, the grizzly bear and the Canadian lynx, are found in the park. Although their numbers remain at historical levels, both are listed as threatened because in nearly every other region of the U.S. outside of Alaska, they are either extremely rare or absent from their historical range. On average, one or two bear attacks on humans occur each year; since the creation of the park in 1910, there have been a total of 10 bear-related deaths. The number of grizzlies and lynx in the park is not known for certain, but park biologists believed as of 2008 that there were just above 300 grizzlies in the park; a study which commenced in 2001 hopes to determine the number of lynx. The exact population figures for grizzlies and the smaller black bear are not known but biologists are using a variety of methods to try to determine an accurate population range. Another study has indicated that the wolverine, another very rare mammal in the lower 48 states, also lives in the park. Other mammals such as the mountain goat (the official park symbol), bighorn sheep, moose, elk, mule deer, skunk, white-tailed deer, bobcat, coyote, and cougar are either plentiful or common. Unlike in Yellowstone National Park, which implemented [...] a wolf reintroduction program in the 1990s, it is believed that wolves recolonized Glacier National Park naturally during the 1980s. Sixty-two species of mammals have been documented including badger, river otter, porcupine, mink, marten, fisher, six species of bat and numerous other smaller mammals.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1940s {{the decline}} of Rangifer tarandus caribou range {{occupancy}} in Ontario has been recognized. There are two populations of <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou,</b> the forest-tundra ecotype and the sedentary forest-dwelling ecotype. The boreal <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> population (forest-dwelling), estimated at approximately 3,000, make up approximately one-quarter of Ontario’s <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou,</b> was designated as threatened in 2000 (likely to become endangered if limiting factors are not reversed) by the Federal Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada and by the Province of Ontario.

2500|$|The <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> is {{the largest}} of the caribou {{subspecies}} and is darker in colour than the barren-ground caribou. Valerius Geist, specialist on large North American mammals, described the [...] "true" [...] <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> as ”the uniformly dark, small-manned type with the frontally emphasized, flat-beamed antlers" [...] which is [...] "scattered thinly along the southern rim of North American caribou distribution.” Geist asserts that ”the true <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> is very rare, in very great difficulties and requires the most urgent of attention”, but suggests that this urgency is compromised by the inclusion of the Newfoundland caribou, the Labrador caribou, and the western Osborn’s caribou in the Rangifer tarandus caribou subspecies. In Geist’s opinion, the inclusion of these additional populations obscures the precarious position of the “true” <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In eastern North America caribou are {{classified}} into three ecotypes – [...] "the mountain caribou which is found {{south of the}} St. Lawrence River, the barren-ground caribou which calves in the tundra, and in between, the forest-dwelling ecotype which lives all year long in the boreal forest. In west-central Alberta there are two ecotypes – boreal and mountain. In Québec there are three ecotypes with specific habitats and behaviour – migratory barren-ground ecotype, the mountain ecotype and the forest-dwelling ecotype (boreal caribou). In British Columbia caribou {{are classified}} into three ecotypes – Mountain, Northern, and Boreal. In Ontario caribou are classified into two ecotypes – forest-dwelling <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> and forest-tundra woodland. In Newfoundland/Labrador, <b>Woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> are classified {{as part of the}} boreal population of caribou, which is sub-divided into two ecotypes: the migratory forest-tundra and the sedentary forest-dwelling ecotype. In the Northwest Territories, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society identified five types of caribou – boreal <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou,</b> northern mountain <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou,</b> barren-ground caribou and Peary caribou and Dolphin-Union. [...] "The Boreal <b>woodland</b> <b>caribou</b> live in the forests east of the Mackenzie Mountains and tend to live in small groups.
