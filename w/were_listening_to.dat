But we <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> it on the plane ride on the way home, and even from the demo version, I really felt something very special.|$|E
5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> at the time. The {{response}} was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|The CAB Rating for {{the show}} was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening {{programs}} of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as The Shadow and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes did not perform as well – but {{it was less than}} half of Texaco's Fire Chief, which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be because of the time slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the radio at 7:00p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Jack Pearl's Baron Münchhausen, and Fire Chief all aired after 9:00p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and Five-Star Theater was not renewed for a second season.|$|E

25|$|The band cited bands such as Metallica, Pantera, Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Carcass, At the Gates, Acid Bath, Van Halen and Testament {{as their}} influences.

25|$|Always {{known as}} much for his sarcastic grouchiness as his barbed self-deprecation, Morgan's 1994 memoir, Here's Morgan! The Original Bad Boy of Broadcasting, found him satirizing many of his former co-stars while {{straining}} not to examine his professional life beyond a series of in-and-out zaps, asides, and declarative statements—almost as if the reader <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a vintage radio satire of Morgan's life.|$|E

Ping also showed users' top 10 lists of songs and albums among the people they followed. It also provided artist recommendations to follow based on one's library and preference options.|$|E
25|$|To {{look more}} closely at this issue, Saffran Aslin and Newport {{conducted}} another study in which infants underwent the same training with the artificial grammar but then were presented with either words or part-words rather than words or nonwords. The part-words were syllable sequences composed of the last syllable from one word and the first two syllables from another (such as kupado). Because the part-words had been heard during the time when children <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the artificial grammar, preferential listening to these part-words would indicate that children were learning not only serial-order information, but also the statistical likelihood of hearing particular syllable sequences. Again, infants showed greater listening times to the novel (part-) words, indicating that 8-month-old infants were able to extract these statistical regularities from a continuous speech stream.|$|E
25|$|But Paley, {{according}} to CBS historian Robert Metz, {{also learned that}} Benny chafed under NBC's almost indifferent attitude toward the talent that attracted the listeners. NBC, {{under the leadership of}} David Sarnoff, seemed at the time to think that listeners <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> NBC because of NBC itself. To Paley, {{according to}} Metz, that was foolish thinking at best: Paley believed listeners were listening because of the talent, not because of which platform hosted them. When Paley said as much to Benny, the comedian agreed. Because Paley took a personal interest in the Benny negotiations, as opposed to Sarnoff, who had never met his top-rated star, Benny was convinced to make the jump. He convinced a number of his fellow NBC performers (notably Burns and Allen, Edgar Bergen, Red Skelton and Kate Smith) to join him.|$|E

25|$|After the 2008 season, coach Shanahan {{was fired}} and {{replaced}} by the Patriots' offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. On February 28, 2009, ESPN reported that the Broncos <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> trade offers for Cutler, a possibility he found upsetting. McDaniels denied interest in trades, but Cutler did not believe him. On March 15, Cutler listed his Colorado home for sale, and confirmed that he had officially asked the Broncos to trade him. On March 31, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen announced that the team would accommodate his request, and three days later Cutler was indeed traded with the Broncos' 2009 fifth-round draft pick to the Chicago Bears for quarterback Kyle Orton, the Bears' first- and third-round selections in 2009, and first-round pick in 2010. On October 20, Cutler and the Bears came to terms on a two-year contract extension worth $30 million, running through 2013.|$|E
25|$|Idle {{stated that}} the two things that made his life bearable <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Radio Luxembourg under the bedclothes and {{watching}} the local football team, Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite this, he disliked other sports and would sneak out of school every Thursday afternoon to the local cinema. Idle was eventually caught watching the X-rated film BUtterfield 8 (suitable for audiences aged 16 years and over under the contemporary film certificates) and stripped of his prefecture, though by that time he was head boy. Idle had already refused to be senior boy in the school cadet force, as he supported the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and {{had participated in the}} yearly Aldermaston March. Idle maintains that there was little to do at the school, and boredom drove him to study hard and consequently win a place at Cambridge University.|$|E

"That was a {{conscious}} move by Max and myself, because we <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> alternative and indie music {{and talking about}} some song– I don't remember what it was. I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{praise for}} the album {{overwhelmed}} the band; Greenwood felt the praise had been exaggerated because The Bends had been [...] "under-reviewed possibly and under-received." [...] They rejected links to progressive rock and art rock, despite frequent comparisons made to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. Yorke responded: [...] "We write pop songs... there was no intention of it being 'art'. It's a reflection of all the disparate things we <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> when we recorded it." [...] He was nevertheless pleased that listeners identified the album's influences: [...] "What really blew my head off {{was the fact that}} people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create." ...|$|E
500|$|Poppy Reid of The Music Network {{criticized the}} song for its {{reliance}} on auto-tune and lyrics [...] "you just don't expect (or want) from a 41-year-old". UR Chicago's Neil Miller, Jr. also gave a negative review of the song, questioning if [...] "Run the World" [...] was meant for Lopez, stating that: [...] "Because up until this point, it seemed like we <b>were</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the album that Brave {{was meant to be}} – a collection of tracks meant to make us dance, not ones that we're supposed to blast out of our trunks. Swagata Panjari of Radio and Music gave a negative review of the song, stating that it is [...] "slow paced and has a miss on beats which leaves listeners wanting for more".|$|E
