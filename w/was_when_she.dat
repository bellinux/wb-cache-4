5|$|The {{last time}} Riefenstahl saw Hitler <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> married Peter Jacob on 21 March 1944. Riefenstahl and Jacob {{divorced}} in 1946. As Germany's military situation became impossible by early 1945, Riefenstahl left Berlin and was hitchhiking {{with a group}} of men, trying to reach her mother, when she was taken into custody by American troops. She walked out of a holding camp, beginning a series of escapes and arrests across the chaotic landscape. At last making it back home on a bicycle, she found that American troops had seized her house. She was surprised by how kindly they treated her.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in his life Beebe was {{developing}} a close friendship with the American romance novelist Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel Riders of the Wind was devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with, and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old she <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 1942, {{the ship}} was {{captured}} almost intact by the Germans when they occupied Toulon and {{was turned over to}} the Italians on 14 December. The Regia Marina redesignated her as FR 22 and she recommissioned on 19 January 1943 after Pierre Laval, head of Vichy France, agreed to transfer her on 11 January; she sailed to Taranto on 23 March where the Italians used her as a transport in Italian waters. The ship's most notable mission <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> transported former Italian Premier Benito Mussolini from Ponza Island to La Maddalena, Sardinia on 6 August. The ship was scuttled at La Spezia on 9 September 1943 following the Italian armistice and broken up after the war.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

25|$|After the Tarzis {{returned}} to Afghanistan, they were received at Court as wished by the Amir Habibullah Khan. This is where Soraya Tarzi met Prince Amanullah, {{son of the}} Amir Habibullah Khan. They struck an affinity. The prince, who was a sympathiser of Mahmud Tarzi's liberal ideas, married Soraya Tarzi in August 1913. Soraya Tarzi was King Amanullah Khan's only wife, which broke centuries of tradition. It <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> married into the monarchy that she grew {{to be one of}} the region's most important figures.|$|E

25|$|As Rebecca and her entourage {{approached}} Abraham's home, they spied Isaac from {{a distance}} {{in the fields of}} Beer-lahai-roi. The Talmud and the Midrash explain that Isaac was praying, as he instituted Mincha, the afternoon prayer. Seeing such a spiritually exalted man, Rebecca immediately dismounted from her camel and asked the accompanying servant who he <b>was.</b> <b>When</b> <b>she</b> heard that this was her future husband, she modestly covered herself with a veil. Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, married her, and loved her.|$|E
25|$|In early 1942, Sirius was {{attached}} to the United States Pacific Fleet and left San Pedro, California, on 1 March, with a convoy for Pearl Harbor. From 1942 until 1944, she maintained a schedule of operating from Pearl Harbor to Johnston Island, Midway Island, San Francisco, Christmas Island, Canton Island, and Baker Island. The most noteworthy event of this period <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> transported 35 Imperial Japanese Navy prisoners (recovered from the Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū) from Midway to Pearl Harbor in June 1942. In July 1944, the Marshall Islands were added to her list of resupply ports as well as Guam and Saipan.|$|E
25|$|Emma Smith {{claimed that}} {{the very first time}} she ever became aware of a {{polygamy}} revelation being attributed to Joseph Smith <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> read about it in 1853 in Orson Pratt's booklet The Seer. Many of the Latter Day Saints who joined the RLDS Church in the midwestern United States had broken with Brigham Young and/or James Strang because of opposition to polygamy. Emma's continuing public denial of the practice seemed to lend strength to their cause, and opposition to polygamy became a tenet of the RLDS Church. Over the years, many RLDS Church historians attempted to prove that the practice had originated with Brigham Young.|$|E

25|$|Although Jackson was {{internationally known}} and had {{moved up to}} the {{northern}} states, she still encountered racial prejudice. One account of this <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> tried {{to buy a house}} in Chicago. Everywhere she went, the white owners and real estate agents would turn her away, claiming the house had already been sold or they changed their minds about selling. When she finally found a house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection. White families started moving out and black families started moving in. Everything remained the same in her neighborhood except for the skin color of the residents.|$|E
25|$|DSHS {{was most}} {{concerned}} about Biryukova's mental health, given her OCD diagnosis and past hospitalizations, following a complaint from the person who delivered the child. They also found the father, Alan Morgan, a convicted felon, problematic. Authorities in Florida had taken a child from his home there. The month the two were married Biryukova reported him to the police in Redmond for allegedly assaulting her and got a no-contact order; she nevertheless visited him regularly in jail in Issaquah, where he <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> gave birth, under assumed names. Both claimed to investigators they did not live together despite giving them the same address; Biryukova {{said at one point}} she did not even know who the father was even though his name was on the child's birth certificate.|$|E
25|$|One of Zoe's {{last major}} storylines <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> became romantically {{involved}} with Dennis Rickman (Nigel Harman).

When Zoe starts {{to worry that}} Dennis will realise she is lying, Den persuades Zoe to sleep with him so she can get pregnant, though Dennis sees them in bed together. Her final storyline was with Chrissie Watts (Tracy-Ann Oberman) and Sam Mitchell (Kim Medcalf) who plot to kill Den after hurting them, in different ways.

25|$|In South Africa, {{she joined}} the African National Congress {{when it was still}} listed as an illegal {{organization}} by the South African government. While never blindly loyal to any organization, Gordimer saw the ANC as the best hope for reversing South Africa's treatment of black citizens. Rather than simply criticizing the organization for its perceived flaws, she advocated joining it to address them. She hid ANC leaders in her own home to aid their escape from arrest by the government, and she said that the proudest day of her life <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> testified at the 1986 Delmas Treason Trial on behalf of 22 South African anti-apartheid activists. (See Simon Nkoli, Mosiuoa Lekota, etc.) Throughout these years she also regularly took part in anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa, and traveled internationally speaking out against South African apartheid and discrimination and political repression.|$|E
25|$|Pitts enjoyed her {{greatest}} fame {{in the early}} 1930s, often starring in B movies and comedy short films, teamed with Thelma Todd. She played secondary parts in many films. Her stock persona (a fretful, flustered, worried spinster) made her instantly recognizable and was often imitated in cartoons and other films. She starred {{in a number of}} Hal Roach short films and features, and co-starred in a series of feature-length comedies with Slim Summerville. Switching between comedy short films and features, by the advent of sound, she was relegated to comedy roles. A bitter disappointment <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was replaced in the classic war drama All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) by Beryl Mercer after her initial appearance in previews drew unintentional laughs, despite her intense performance. She had viewers rolling in the aisles in Finn and Hattie (1931), The Guardsman (1931), Blondie of the Follies (1932), Sing and Like It (1934) and Ruggles of Red Gap (1935). In 1936 and 1937 she portrayed Hildegarde Withers in two movies, succeeding Edna May Oliver as the spinster sleuth, but they were not well received.|$|E
25|$|Furtado {{was born}} on December 2, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Her Portuguese parents, António José Furtado and Maria Manuela Furtado, were born on São Miguel Island in the Azores and had immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s. Nelly was named after Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim. Her {{siblings}} are Michael Anthony and Lisa Anne. They were raised Roman Catholic. At age four, she began performing and singing in Portuguese. Furtado's first public performance <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> sang a duet with her mother at a church on Portugal Day. She began playing musical instruments {{at the age of}} nine, learning the trombone, ukulele and, in later years, the guitar and keyboards. At the age of 12, she began writing songs, and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese marching band. Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a chambermaid with her mother, along with her brother and sister, who was a housekeeper in Victoria. She has stated that coming from a working class background has shaped her identity in a positive way.|$|E
