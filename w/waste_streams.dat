The facility mission was mainly to process dilute plutonium solution {{received from the}} 221 -F Canyon into highly purified plutonium metal.

25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{does not}} reduce {{the volume of}} high-level waste, it separates out the useful isotopes leaving an increased volume of liquid high-level waste {{as a result of}} the solution-based chemical processes used to dissolve fuel rods and extract useful isotopes. It does reduce total radioactivity of the total waste, however the overall volume of the waste is higher and it does not eliminate waste nor heat generation and therefore does not eliminate the need for a geological waste repository. Reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential to contribute to nuclear proliferation, the potential vulnerability to nuclear terrorism, the political challenges of repository siting (a problem that applies equally to direct disposal of spent fuel), the environmental risks of the aqueous and organic <b>waste</b> <b>streams,</b> and because of its high cost compared to the once-through fuel cycle.

Nuclear fuel reprocessing is performed routinely in Europe, Russia and Japan.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} actions along the {{recycling}} supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate. It {{begins with the}} waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can {{affect the quality of}} final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the recycling process. The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can {{make it more difficult to}} separate material back into separate <b>waste</b> <b>streams.</b> Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside where the product can become wet can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Special Analysis (SA) is to {{determine}} if the Oak Ridge (OR) Consolidated Edison Uranium Solidification Project (CEUSP) uranium- 233 (233 U) <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> (DRTK 000000050, Revision 0) is acceptable for shallow land burial (SLB) at the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site (RWMS) on the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). The CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> requires a special analysis because the concentrations of thorium- 229 (229 Th), 230 Th, 232 U, 233 U, and 234 U exceeded their NNSS Waste Acceptance Criteria action levels. The acceptability of the <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> is evaluated by determining if performance assessment (PA) modeling provides a reasonable expectation that SLB disposal is protective of human health and the environment. The CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> is a long-lived waste with unique radiological hazards. The SA evaluates the long-term acceptability of the CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> for near-surface disposal as a two tier process. The first tier, which is the usual SA process, uses the approved probabilistic PA model {{to determine if the}}re is a reasonable expectation that disposal of the CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> can meet the performance objectives of U. S. Department of Energy Manual DOE M 435. 1 - 1, “Radioactive Waste Management,” for a period of 1, 000 years (y) after closure. The second tier addresses the acceptability of the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> for near-surface disposal by evaluating long-term site stability and security, by performing extended (i. e., 10, 000 and 60, 000 y) modeling analyses, and by evaluating the effect of containers and the depth of burial on performance. Tier I results indicate that there is a reasonable expectation of compliance with all performance objectives if the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> is disposed in the Area 5 RWMS SLB disposal units. The maximum mean and 95 th percentile PA results are all less than the performance objective for 1, 000 y. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis indicates that there is a high likelihood of compliance with all performance objectives. Tier II results indicate that the long-term performance of the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> is protective of human health and the environment. The Area 5 RWMS is located in one of the least populated and most arid regions of the U. S. Site characterization data indicate that infiltration of precipitation below the plant root zone at 2. 5 meters (8. 2 feet) ceased 10, 000 to 15, 000 y ago. The site is not expected to have a groundwater pathway as long as the current arid climate persists. The national security mission of the NNSS and the location of the Area 5 RWMS within the Frenchman Flat Corrective Action Unit require that access controls and land use restrictions be maintained indefinitely. PA modeling results for 10, 000 to 60, 000 y also indicate that the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> is acceptable for near-surface disposal. The mean resident air pathway annual total effective dose (TED), the resident all-pathways annual TED, and the acute drilling TED are less than their performance objectives for 10, 000 y after closure. The mean radon- 222 (222 Rn) flux density exceeds the performance objective at 4, 200 y, but this is due to waste already disposed at the Area 5 RWMS and is only slightly affected by disposal of the CEUSP 233 U. The peak resident all-pathways annual TED from CEUSP key radionuclides occurs at 48, 000 y and is less than the 0. 25 millisievert performance objective. Disposal of the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> in a typical SLB trench slightly increases PA results. Increasing the depth was found to eliminate any impacts of the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream.</b> Containers could not be shown to have any significant impact on performance due to the long half-life of the <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> and a lack of data for pitting corrosion rates of stainless steel in soil. The results of the SA indicate that all performance objectives can be met with disposal of the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> in the SLB units at the Area 5 RWMS. The long-term performance of the OR CEUSP 233 U <b>waste</b> <b>stream</b> disposed in the near surface is protective of human health and the environment.
