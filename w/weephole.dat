40|$|Rain {{screen wall}} systems are {{effective}} {{for control of}} rain water. The ventilation in the air space of such walls {{is also expected to}} play a role in the drying of cladding and control of vapor flows through the wall. For example, wet cladding exposed to solar radiation may subject the wall to inward vapor flow, unless an air cavity short-circuits that vapor flow. Although the role of the air cavity has been previously studied, it is relevant to evaluate more quantitatively the movement of air within the air cavity between the cladding and the backwall. The effect of wind pressure notwithstanding, convective movement of air in the cavity is the result of buoyancy. Air movement can result from the increased temperature of the cladding due to solar radiation. The first objective of this thesis was the development of a numerical model of air movement driven by the variation of wall temperature with height, taking into account heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation and mass transfer by diffusion and convection. The model was validated by means of comparison with analytical results from the literature, as well as with two sets of experimental results. The experimental procedures involved the evaluation of the magnitude and direction of the air movement within a large-scale cavity with a uni-directional anemometer and with particle image velocimetry. Once the boundary conditions were known, they were used to determine experimentally the mass transfer coefficients at the surface of wetted brick in the cavity with a horizontal wind tunnel setup. The validated model was used to evaluate parametrically the air movement's effects on heat and moisture flow within the assembly, assuming the brick had wetted by rain water before exposure to the solar radiation. Conclusions were drawn as to the effect of the air movement on the evacuation of heat and moisture from the assembly, based on variation of six parameters. It was found that the air movement in the cavity plays a significant role in the drying of the cladding by saturation of rain water. As well, under average summer conditions for Montreal, the air velocity in the cavity was found to have an approximate peak of 0. 20 m/s, neglecting the effects of wind pressure. The air flow is turbulent at the <b>weephole</b> entrance of the cavity, before becoming laminar within approximately 10 centimeters of flow development. Finally, convective mass and heat transfer surface coefficients increase with air velocity, except for air velocities lower than 0. 10 m/...|$|E
40|$|Springs and seeps {{occur in}} the spaces around Po Hing Fong Street in the Mid-Levels area, Hong Kong. Most of the springs occur through the {{drainage}} <b>weepholes</b> on retaining walls at the street. This paper first examines the geology {{and history of the}} springs. The paper then reports the findings from a 1 -year comprehensive spring monitoring programme. The temporal variations of flow rate, physiochemical parameters and hydrochemistry of the springs are discussed. The average temperatures of the springs were close to the mean air temperature, although there was a systematic lag time of 40 to 50 days between the peak air temperature and highest water temperatures. Spring waters from two rows of <b>weepholes</b> in the retaining wall showed significantly different physical and hydrochemical responses to the changes in rainfall and temperature, though their vertical distance is only about 1 m. The results suggest that water from the upper row of <b>weepholes</b> may represent a recharge source that is shallow or close to the spring outlets, whereas that from the lower row of <b>weepholes</b> may represent a recharge source that is much deeper or further up the hill. Although the spring flows increased rapidly after rainstorms, analysis of the total dissolved solids showed a delayed response to rainstorm events. The concentration of individual ions in the spring water varied in a unique way in response to rainstorm events. It is clear that the presence of underground man-made drainage systems and the leakage from water mains in the study area may add complexity to the solute responses and transport mechanisms. Further studies are required to constrain the impacts of these man-made structures on the hydrogeology of the springs. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
