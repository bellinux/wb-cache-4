We present a unified multiple layer ontology framework modeled in OWL that consists of three ontology layers: the domain ontology, the domain communication ontology, and the communication ontology. The domain ontology contains factual application-neutral concept configurations and relations. The domain communication ontology models data aggregation, qualitative interpretation of numerical data, user tailored <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> triggered by an environmental condition given in a specific context, etc., while the communication ontology specifies knowledge needed for the tasks involved in the generation process, and is populated using a pipeline of SPARQL queries.

We investigated an outbreak to evaluate possible risk factors, and to determine the appropriate public health recommendations. Of 230 athletes, we contacted 148 (64 %) and 20 (13. 5 %) met our case definition. Five were hospitalized and none were fatal. Ten (91 %) of the 11 ill athletes who were tested were confirmed by PCR or serology. Serogroup Pyrogenes was commonly found. Cutaneous cuts, reported by 14 (73. 7 %), was the only potential risk factor using univariate analysis. Sporting event participants in tropical areas should {{be made aware of}} specific <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> concerning the risk of leptospirosis, especially after periods of heavy rainfall or flooding. Rapid diagnostic assays such as PCR are particularly appropriate in this setting for early diagnosis and for formulating public health recommendations...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{learning}} technologies, especially multimedia provide varied facilities for students’ learning {{that are not}} possible with other media. Pedagogical literature has proved that individuals have different learning styles. Flipped classroom is a pedagogical approach which means that activities that have traditionally taken place inside the classroom take place outside the classroom and vice versa. Flipped classroom environment ensures that students become more active participants compared with the traditional classroom. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to fulfil the needs regarding the review of recent literature on the use of flipped classroom approach in education. The contribution of flipped classroom to education is discussed in relation to the change of students' and instructors' role. Subsequently, flipped classroom applications in various disciplines of education are illustrated. The recommendations made in the literature for design specifications that integrate flipped classrooms with technology are discussed. The paper concludes that a careful consideration of the <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> made in the literature can help to produce effective flipped classroom environments and also this paper attempts to inform those who are thinking of using new technologies and approaches to deliver courses...|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{has been}} {{recognized}} {{to be among the}} principal causes of many chronic diseases such as diabetes, cholesterol, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, monitoring, controlling, and preventing obesity will mitigate the risks generated from the complications of these diseases. Comprehensive preventive measures are essential to control the spread of obesity, while healthcare systems should be organized on the basis of locally derived data to provide adequate and affordable care to the increasing groups of overweight and obese people. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that relies on both data collected from sensors and participatory data collected from a social network community established to provide value-added obesity awareness, monitoring, and prevention. The model encompasses some key smart features including tracking food intake, lifestyle, and exercise activities, generating <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations,</b> and triggering interventions whenever needed. Our model also mines the collected data to produce statistical analysis that can be used by health authorities to have a clear picture of the health status of the population and might help in making rational and informed decisions. Moreover, we implement a prototype of our model as a set of Web services using the SOA paradigm and lightweight protocols. Promising results of our prototype are reported and analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study is to identify the dimensions implied by female entrepreneurialism, especially its potential economic contribution to national growth, its specificities, or the analysis of public or private initiatives willing to promote it. Thus, our goal is to issue a number of hypotheses as well as <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> for the launch of specific initiatives towards women entrepreneurship. Female entrepreneurship is often considered as an insufficiently-exploited source of economic growth. The recent evolutions of the labour market forced number of women to create their own position so that they can balance their working and family lives with the drive to succeed on a meaningful project. Women entrepreneurs create employment for themselves and for others, sometimes in order to cater for needs a common employee status cannot fill (schedule and/or family obligations). Thanks to their specificities as managers dealing with common business issues such as organisation, they also bring their own potential to society. Women need more financial supports, adapted trainings, more mentoring, and more networks to reach equal opportunities with men. Depending on each country, both cultural context and the way gender diversity is achieved have an importance in reaching this goal. Economic Growth; Tools of Success; Women Entrepreneurship...|$|E

40|$|Co-Drive {{on-board}} {{traffic information}} system is a complementary tool providing a dynamic management of transportation infrastructure and traffic {{as well as the}} diffusion of accurate real-time information about the road environment and motorists’ driving behaviour. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine drivers’ acceptability of Co-Drive by investigating the impact of traffic information provided via on-board display devices on motorists’ beliefs and behaviour. 116 drivers (Men = 46. 6 %), between 22 and 62 years, participated to a driving simulator experiment. They were randomly divided into two experimental groups according to the type of display device (Black-berry vs. iPhone) and a control group. The experimental groups were exposed to fourteen on-board traffic messages: warning (e. g., road crash), recommendation (e. g., the use of seat-belt) and comfort messages (e. g., the location of a gas station). They had to validate each message by pushing the headlight flashing button as soon as they understood it. At the end, all participants had to fill in a questionnaire. Drivers evaluated positively the on-board messages, expressed a high level of confidence in the on-board information and estimated having received it sufficiently in advance for them to adjust their behaviour. Regardless of the type of display device, they took more time to read <b>warning</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendation</b> messages as compared to comfort messages and complied with them. Finally, those exposed to the messages adapted their behaviour easier to the road events than those who did not receive them. Practical implications of the results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceApproaches {{that use}} the pseudolikelihood to perform {{multilevel}} modelling on survey data have been presented in the literature. To avoid biased estimates due to unequal selection probabilities, conditional weights can be introduced at each level. Less-biased estimators can also be obtained in a two-level linear model if the level- 1 weights are scaled. In this paper, we studied several level- 2 weights that can be introduced into the pseudolikelihood when the sampling design and the hierarchical structure of the multilevel model do not match. Two-level and three-level models were studied. The present work was motivated by a study that aims to estimate the contributions of lead sources to polluting the interior floor dust of the rooms within dwellings. We performed a simulation study using the real data collected from a French survey to achieve our objective. We conclude that it is preferable to use unweighted analyses or, at the most, to use conditional level- 2 weights in a two-level or a three-level model.

40|$|Objective: To explore doctor-patient {{interactions}} and decision-making processes before high-risk cardiac surgery or intervention with {{special attention to}} existential challenges. Design, setting and participants: We conducted a qualitative study with data drawn from doctor-patient dialogues preceding high-risk procedures. The study setting was the cardiac department of a university hospital with 24 -hour emergency service. We recruited a purposive sample of 10 patients and eight doctors. The patients were categorised as high-risk patients in accordance with EuroSCORE and established angiographic procedural high-risk criteria. Transcripts from the dialogues were analysed with systematic text condensation, inspired by discourse analysis. Main outcome measure: Accounts of doctor-patient interaction reflecting existential aspects of the decisionmaking process. Results: The main existential concerns identified in the doctor-patient interactions were surviving uncertainty, negotiating responsibility and trusting the doctor’s proficiency. When handling uncertainty, doctors imparted complex information about risk, <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations,</b> while patients sought and trusted the doctors’ advice. Though the decisions were made in asymmetrical power relations, they {{were based on a}} shared responsibility discussed and defined throughout the dialogues. The patients expressed a profound confidence in the doctor’s ability to get them through the high-risk treatment and give the best help possible. Conclusions: Uncertainty, mortality, responsibility and trust are fundamental existential issues concerning both patients and doctors before high-risk procedures, with an impact on decision-making processes. Increasing focus on underlying existential conditions, ethical reasoning and power relations in medical education may improve the quality of shared decision-making and informed consent related to high-risk treatment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractSustainable pest {{management}} implies less pesticide use and replacement by safe control alternatives. This requires decision support for rational {{pest management}}. However, in practice, successful {{decision making is}} dependent upon the availability of integrated, high-quality information. Computer-aided forecasting and related decision support systems make pest control more sustainable by avoiding unwanted consequences of pesticide applications. Here, I review integrated pest management for web-based decision support systems. The major points are the following: (1) Principles of integrated pest management are compatible with sustainable agriculture. (2) Pest models serve as basis of decision making because they offer means to predict the exact time of pest phenological development and initiate management actions. Most models are climate driven. (3) New hardware technology has permitted the registration of automatically recorded climatic data. This data can be combined with pest models through logical operations and forecasting algorithms to develop a software of pest management. (4) Dynamic web interfaces can serve as decision support systems providing the user with real-time pest <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> for management actions. (5) Ontology web programing and semantic knowledge representations provide a way to classify and describe agrodata to facilitate information sharing and data exploitation over distributed systems. (6) Most available pest management data is published on static web pages and, thus, cannot be classified as decision support systems. Some web-based decision support systems provide user-interactive content and real-time pest forecasts and management support...|$|E
40|$|Mount Merapi {{is one of}} {{the most}} active volcanoes in the world, located 25 - 30 km north of densely {{populated}} area. Merapi volcano delivered its largest eruption in a century between 26 October and 4 November, requiring evacuation of more than 300, 000 people. The intrusive magma erupted first on 26 October, and then eruptions occurred on 30 October, 3 November and the paroxysmal eruption on 5 November. These eruptions released large SO 2 and ash clouds, which affected local villages and international air traffic. Combined observations in real-time of phenomena associated with the main eruption and the response of a worldwide collaboration led by CVGHM, the MIAVITA European project and the USGS provided the basis for timely <b>warnings</b> <b>and</b> <b>recommendations</b> by CVGHM to local authorities, which saved tens of thousands of lives. Satellite data (TerraSAR, Radarsat, OMI, AIRS, Digital Globe and others), broadband and short-period seismic data, EDM, tilt and mini-DOAS data were discussed to understand the status of the volcano. Remote sensing data showed that the 2010 eruptions were much more explosive than those of the recent past and rates of extrusion much higher. Seismic data from a station 50 km south of Merapi showed in real time that the magnitude of the 4 November explosion was much larger than the 3 November explosion. This triggered the decision to extend the exclusion zone from 15 to 20 km. This multi-national cooperation proved to be of crucial importance for the successful crisis management, especially with such a large and rapidly evolving eruption...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development and}} implementation of EU Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) and security policy by taking a political science approach to what is an extremely complex legal and political framework. It identifies a highly sophisticated EU security apparatus that has not been adequately described or' explained by contemporary theories of European integration or the concept of 'multi-level governance'. Instead, the thesis draws on critical theories of the state and globalisation to contextualise and explain the EU state apparatus. The research provides a comprehensive overview of the historical development of EU JHA and security policy, the distribution of executive and political power and the EU decisionmaking process, immigration and asylum policy, police and judicial cooperation, frameworks for surveillance and social control, and the EU's external security policy. Three crucial, interrelated questions are considered throughout. First, what are the implications of EU JHA security policy for the people of Europe; how does EU law and practice affect their human rights and civil liberties? Second, to what extent are these measures subject to democratic and judicial control; how are they accountable to the public? Third, do the structures and policies adopted and pursued by the EU match its stated values and principles; are they legitimate in a democratic society? The findings challenge benign assumptions about the EU by exposing a repressive immigration regime that has continued to strip migrants and refugees of their human rights, an overbroad EU criminal law that undermines judicial safeguards, the imposition of a 'surveillance society' in which state intrusions into private life are no longer regulated by the judiq:olry, and a foreign policy based increasingly on neocolonial rule.
