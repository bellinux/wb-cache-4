25|$|During a {{performance}} of L'elisir d'amore by Donizetti at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on December 11, 1920, he suffered a throat haemorrhage and the performance was canceled {{at the end of}} Act 1. Following this incident, a clearly unwell Caruso gave only three more performances at the Met, the final one being as Eléazar in Halévy's La Juive, on 24 December 1920. By Christmas Day, the pain in his side was so excruciating that he <b>was</b> <b>screaming.</b> Dorothy summoned the hotel physician, who gave Caruso some morphine and codeine and called in another doctor, Evan M. Evans. Evans brought in three other doctors and Caruso finally received a correct diagnosis: purulent pleurisy and empyema.|$|E
25|$|A 2002 {{article by}} Kerr Cuhulain not only {{explored}} the inconsistencies in Smith’s allegations, {{but also their}} unlikeliness. Among other things, Cuhulain noted that it seemed unlikely that a sophisticated cult that had secretly existed for generations could be outwitted by a five-year-old; that the cult could hold rituals in the Ross Bay Cemetery unnoticed given that Smith claimed she <b>was</b> <b>screaming</b> and given that the Ross Bay Cemetery is surrounded on three sides by residential neighborhoods; that an 81-day non-stop ceremony involving hundreds of participants and a massive round room could have gone on in Victoria unnoticed; and that none of Smith’s tormentors (other than her mother) have ever been identified, especially given {{that some of them}} had cut off one of their middle fingers at the Black Mass. He also notes that during the alleged 81-day ritual, Michelle was confirmed to be attending school, with no remarkable absences and no apparent signs that she was being abused. Like other authors, Cuhulain also noted that many of Smith's recovered memories appear to have reflected elements in popular culture at the time (e.g.: the movie The Exorcist) and Pazder's own religious beliefs and experiences from when he was living and working in Africa in the early 1960s. Finally, Cuhulain hypothesized that Smith's motivation for making the allegations may have come from her desire to spend time with Pazder; though both were initially married to other people, they divorced their spouses and remarried each other after the publication of the book.|$|E
500|$|Music critics universally {{criticized the}} video {{because of the}} limited amount of {{clothing}} Hilson wore in it. In an interview with gossip hound Perez Hilton, Hilson defended the clip, calling the video [...] "racy" [...] but {{in line with the}} perspective of her album: [...] "If you put it in context with my album, my album is called No Boys Allowed but really it means no bullshit allowed. In this album, I <b>was</b> <b>screaming</b> in a room — just like I <b>was</b> <b>screaming</b> in the song — I <b>was</b> <b>screaming</b> in a room with all my girlfriends, yelling all the shit we really say." [...] Rebecca Thomas of MTV News wrote: [...] "A platinum-blond Keri gyrates, thrusts, licks and gets (way) low as she laces the song with enough saucy language and expletives to make your favorite rapper blush." [...] while Jocelyn Vena the same news division of MTV commented that even though there are several cameo appearances in the mini-move, it is ultimately Hilson's [...] "scantily clad popping and locking that has everyone buzzing." [...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the video [...] "overproduced and under-clothed." ...|$|E

500|$|On January 1, 1923, the Taylors' {{neighbor}} {{reported that}} she heard a scream {{while it was still}} dark, grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten, with scuff marks across the white floor. Taylor <b>was</b> <b>screaming</b> that someone needed to get her baby. She said a black man was in her house; he had come through the back door and assaulted her. The neighbor found the baby, but no one else. Taylor's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed. [...] The charge of rape of a white woman by a black was inflammatory in the South: the day before, the Klan had held a parade and rally of over 100 hooded Klansmen [...] away in [...] Gainesville under a burning cross and a banner reading, [...] "First and Always Protect Womanhood".|$|E

Three days after the murder, the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit of the D.C. police were called in, but unit head Sgt. Brett Parson declined to discuss the unit's involvement. Within two weeks of the murder, police publicly alleged that the crime scene had been tampered with. Investigators spent more than three weeks examining the townhouse in detail, [...] "removing flooring, pieces of walls, a chunk of staircase, the washing machine, even sink traps." [...] Allegations that the area around Wone's body had been cleaned were revealed in an affidavit in support of a search warrant for homeowner Joseph Price's offices at the D.C. law firm of Arent Fox.|$|E

500|$|... "Time Will Crawl" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Bowie in mid– to late–1986 at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland. He produced the recording alongside David Richards. Lyrically, the song addresses the pollution {{and destruction of}} the planet by industry. Bowie has cited hearing of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986 as {{the genesis of the}} lyrics, and was in Switzerland {{at the time of the}} accident. He said, [...] "I was taking a break from recording [...] it was a beautiful day and we were outside on a small piece of lawn facing the Alps and the lake. Our engineer, who had been listening to the radio, shot out of the studio and shouted: 'There's a whole lot of shit going down in Russia.' The Swiss news had picked up a Norwegian radio station that <b>was</b> <b>screaming</b> – to anyone who would listen – that huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren't rain clouds." [...] In another contemporary interview, Bowie said that the song [...] "deals with the idea that someone in one's own community could be the one responsible for blowing up the world." [...] At the time, he also stated that it was his favorite song from the album.|$|E

500|$|The six {{finally agreed}} that Capper {{had to be}} removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her {{stepfather}} was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly [...] "giggled" [...] as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: [...] "Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [...] said 'Get up.' Bernie pushed her down the hill and poured petrol on her." [...] When McNeilly had difficulty getting the petrol to ignite, Glyn Powell asked Dudson for some paper, who handed him a folded envelope which Powell then attempted to light and use as a taper. After three failed attempts, Dudson said: [...] "In the end he just went up to her with a lighter and lit her. He lit her on the back. She went straight up in flames and <b>was</b> <b>screaming.</b> The flames lit up the whole forest." [...] McNeilly began to sing [...] "Burn baby burn! Burn baby burn!" [...] from the Trammps' song Disco Inferno. [...] Believing Capper to be dead, the four returned to Jean Powell's house, stopping to buy canned drinks on the way. Both Leigh and Pook were at the house when they arrived and Dudson stated: [...] "Cliff [...] asked Glyn , 'Have you done it?' Glyn said 'Yes' and he was laughing. He gave Cliff his lighter back." ...|$|E
