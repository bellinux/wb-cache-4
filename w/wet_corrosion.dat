40|$|Corrosion science {{exhibits}} a major division between dry and <b>wet</b> <b>corrosion.</b> Dry corrosion {{is dominated by}} high temperature oxidation of metals and {{is controlled by the}} rate at which oxygen can diffuse through the oxide skin and by stable oxide adhesion to the metal substrate involved. <b>Wet</b> <b>corrosion</b> involves electrolytic interactions that require the presence of an aqueous solution. Good design can prevent onset of in service (<b>wet)</b> <b>corrosion</b> by limiting the contact of the electrolyte. However, changes in operational procedures and manufacture can reverse any good design practice. Furthermore, the combined effects of stress and corrosion can result in a special type of failure known as stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Stress corrosion cracking presents an especially difficult problem, since not only is it highly localised but it can occur in environments that are only mildly corrosive to the material. The damaging concentration of harmful ions in that environment may be quite small and difficult to detect and, {{even in the absence of}} applied stress, residual stresses in a structure can often be of a sufficiently high level to cause SCC and failure in service. The role of the forensic or failure engineer in this arena is often to assess if basic design, manufacture and material choice reflect professional engineering practice. To this end a brief review of salient points relating to corrosion and stress corrosion as product failure mechanisms is presented and illustrated by numerous studies from the authors' forensic casebooks...|$|E

This is the temperature at which the oxide is in equilibrium with the oxyhydroxide or hydroxide and water vapor under the expected repository conditions of temperature and pressure. Because localized corrosion requires the presence of an ionically conducting phase on the surface (to support oxygen reduction) T{sub cr} is also the temperature below which ''wet'' corrosion first becomes possible.

40|$|For {{corrosion}} resistant materials exposed to low-temperature atmospheric environments, the corrosion mode of highest risk {{is expected to}} be localized corrosion (pitting, crevice, stress-corrosion cracking) due to accumulation of aggressive species within thin solution layers and/or formation of occluded local geometries. The stability of such a localized corrosion site requires that the corroding site (anode) must dissolve at a sufficient high rate to maintain the critical chemistry, and a robust cathodic area (cathode) must exist that can provide sufficient cathodic current. The characteristics of both the anode and the cathode depend on a large number of physiochemical variables (e. g., temperature, ionic concentration, water layer thickness, etc) and electrochemical parameters (i. e., cathodic and anodic polarization behavior). The effects of all these parameters add significantly to the dimensionality of the problem and a systematic study of these parameters is thus more tractable computationally than experimentally. The objective {{of this study was to}} computationally characterize the stability of such a local corrosion site and explore the effects of physiochemical and electrochemical parameters on that stability. The overall goal is to contribute to the establishment of a scientific basis for the prediction of the stabilization of localized attack on <b>wetted,</b> <b>corrosion</b> resistant material surface. A localized corrosion site, illustrated in Figure 1, consists of two parts: (a) the external wetted surface (cathode) and (b) the crevice (anode).

Furthermore, it is shown that Ducrolloy Cr 44 Fe 5 A 10. 3 Ti 0. 5 Y 203 is almost inert to boiling concentrated nitric acid. The corrosion rate is lower than that of most HN 03 -resistant alloys cited in the literature. Finally, the hot air oxida-tionlnitridation behaviour of Ducropur can be improved by small additions of rare earth oxides and alloying with iron and aluminum.

With the aim of tuning the structural and physical properties, we have demonstrated the <b>wet</b> <b>corrosion</b> process (WCP) as a simple method for nanostructure fabrication using various Ti-based materials, namely Ti– 6 Al– 4 V alloy (TAV), Ti–Ni (TN) alloy and pure Ti, which have 90 %, 50 % and 100 % initial Ti content, respectively. We have systematically investigated {{the relationship between the}} Ti content in the initial metal and the precise condition of WCP to control the structural and physical properties of the resulting nanostructures. The WCP treatment involved various concentrations of KOH solutions. The precise conditions for producing K-incorporated nanostructured titanium oxide films (nTOFs) were strongly dependent on the Ti content of the initial metal. Ti and TAV yielded one-dimensional nanowires of K-incorporated nTOFs after treatment with 10 mol/L-KOH solution, whereas TN required a higher concentration (20 mol/L-KOH solution) to produce comparable nanostructures. The obtained nanostructures revealed a blue-shift in UV absorption spectra due to the quantum confinement effects. A significant enhancement of the photocatalytic activity was observed via the chromomeric change and the intermediate formation of methylene blue molecules under UV irradiation.

One of the key methods for studying the properties of inhomogeneous fluids in simple geometries has been density functional theory (DFT).

This paper details our efforts to develop efficient numerical algorithms so that no local DFT calculations in complex geometries that require two or three dimensions can be performed.

To improve on this situation data of corrosion losses were reassessed and a new model for corrosion was proposed.

The analysis approach adopted is unique and is based on the notion, also suggested by Tomashov, that active corrosion in soils is <b>wet</b> <b>corrosion</b> and therefore should have similarities with corrosion under immersion and wet atmospheric conditions. Following on from this the concept of a “time of wetness” was taken from atmospheric corrosion as a way to estimate the wetness at the corroding interface. Also, the analysis considered the influence of microbiological attack being controlled by a limiting nutrient, as observed for corrosion under immersion conditions. It was found that the main factors influencing soil corrosion are, in order, time of wetness and inorganic nitrate concentration (for microbiological attack).

C 1018 and X 65 have different sensitivities to pitting with a variation in Cl- concentration. Thus the pitting density concept is proposed to describe localized corrosion behavior. Surface analysis on iron carbonate films, by SEM and XRD, revealed different film thicknesses and crystal structures from the top to the bottom of the pipe. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the thin corrosion product film, usually less than 10 microns, attached to the metal surface, is responsible for the low corrosion rate on top of the line, while the thick and porous film formed on the bottom, generally detached from the metal surface, was responsible for the initiation of localized corrosion...|$|R

A similar improvement was evident in sulphuric acid where yttrium containing coatings passivated at high potential (Ti 0. 44 Al 0. 53 Cr 0. 03 N films did not passivate). These effects may be ascribed to reduced porosity in the fine-grained Ti 0. 43 Al 0. 52 Cr 0. 03 Y 0. 02 N as well as the well-known effects of low concentrations of yttrium on high-temperature oxidation performance.

40|$|Many {{areas of}} {{technology}} rely on interfacial {{events that are}} controlled by nanometer-level interactions present at solid/liquid interfaces. Properties of <b>wetting,</b> <b>corrosion</b> inhibition, and molecular recognition provide convenient examples. To investigate such interactions at the molecular level, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been employed as a model system as they offer the ability to produce well-defined organic surfaces of controlled composition. This thesis addresses the development and characterization of such films for controlling the adsorptive properties of surfaces toward various surfactant-like molecules and for proteins. Adsorption is controlled to facilitate the organized assembly of molecular precursors, retard the non-specific adsorption of proteins, provide a specificity for the adsorption of select proteins, {{and the use of}} molecular adsorption to generate local surface energy gradients useful for directing self propelled drop movement. A common theme in these studies is the importance of controlling the energetics and compositions of surfaces at the molecular level to influence microscopic events that translate into macroscopically observable changes in behavior. The first part of this thesis details the formation of monolayer films by the solution-phase adsorption of n-alkyl-chained adsorbates [CH 3 (CH 2) ~ Y] onto the polar surfaces of terminally substituted SAMs [Au/S(CH) mX]. The polar tail groups (X and Y) of the adsorbate and SAM included amine, carboxylic acid, and amide groups, and the formation of the adsorbed monomolecular films on the SAMs relied on non-covalent interactions between X and Y. Highly organized monomolecular adlayers could be produced that were as densely packed as the alkanethiolate SAMs on gold comprising the first layer. This thesis also used this molecular adsorption process to cause liquid drops to move spontaneously on surfaces by creating local changes in surface energy. The drops could be directed to move along specified paths using patterned substrates that contained inner tracks of polar functionality and exterior domains of oleophobic methyl groups. The adsorption process allowed sequential transport of two drops on a common track and also regeneration of the initial high energy surface for reuse. The developed system provides an experimental platform for examining reactive flow and offers a novel "pumpless" method for sequentially delivering multiple drops along surfaces and within microfluidic devices. The second part of this thesis discusses various oligo(ethylene glycol) -terminated alkyltrichlorosilanes [C 13 Si(CH 2) 11 (OCH 2 CHnX; X = -OCH 3 or -O 2 CCH 3, n= 2 - 4] that can form robust films on glass and metal oxide surfaces and control the adsorption of proteins. The adsorption of the methyl-capped trichlorosilanes produces densely packed, oriented monolayer films that are 2 - 3 nm in thickness. The trichlorosilyl group anchors the molecules to the surface, and the resulting film exposes the ethylene glycol units at its surface, as noted by its moderate hydrophilicity. The films are robust with stabilities similar to those of other alkylsiloxane coatings. These oligo(ethylene glycol) -terminated silane reagents produce films that exhibit resistances against the non-specific adsorption of proteins and that are better than for films prepared from octadecyltrichlorosilane. These oligo(ethylene glycol) -siloxane coatings offer performance advantages and could easily provide a direct and superior replacement for protocols that presently use silane reagents to generate hydrophobic, "inert" surfaces. This thesis also discusses the development of an acetate-capped oligo(ethylene glycol) -terminated silane to produce a HO-terminated oligo(ethylene glycol) -based coating on glass and metal oxide surfaces. The HO-termini of these films provide sites for covalently grafting biomolecules to the parent surface. As a demonstration, biotin and mannose moieties were covalently attached to the HO-surfaces to provide a means to induce the specific adsorption of proteins. For these surfaces, the presence of oligo(ethylene glycol) groups reduces the nonspecific adsorption of other competing proteins. The results indicate that the developed systems could offer a strategy to arrange biomolecules selectively on glass and metal oxide surfaces. by Seok-Won Lee. Thesis (Ph. D.)

25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding <b>corrosion.</b> <b>Wet</b> cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, Chromic acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|R
40|$|In {{crude oil}} {{production}} from brown fields or heavy oil, there is production {{of water in}} oil emulsions which can either be controlled or avoided. This emulsion resulted {{in an increase in}} viscosity which can seriously affect the production of oil from sand phase up to flow line. Failure to separate the oil and water mixture efficiently and effectively could result in problems such as overloading of surface separation equipments, increased cost of pumping <b>wet</b> crude, and <b>corrosion</b> problems. Light hydrocarbon diluent was added in varied proportions to three emulsion samples collected from three different oil fields in Niger delta, Nigeria, to enhance the demulsification of crude oil emulsion. The viscosity, total petroleum hydrocarbon, and quality of water were evaluated. The viscosity of the three emulsions considered reduced by 38, 31, and 18 %. It is deduced that the increase in diluent blended with emulsion leads to a corresponding decrease in the value of viscosity. This in turn enhanced the rate of demulsification of the samples. The basic sediment and water (BS&W) of the top dry oil reduces the trace value the three samples evaluated, and with optimum value of diluent, TPH values show that the water droplets are safe for disposal and for other field uses...|$|R
40|$|Lead-tin alloy {{pipes in}} {{historic}} organs frequently suffer from damaging atmospheric corrosion. Organic acids emitted from {{the wood of}} organ cases had been established previously {{as the cause of}} deterioration in pure lead pipes. In the present study, lead-tin alloy samples containing 3. 4 and 15 atom % tin were subjected to laboratory exposure experiments under atmospheres of 1100 ppb acetic acid, 350 ppm CO 2, and 60 or 95 % relative humidity (RH). <b>Wet</b> and dry <b>corrosion</b> mass gains were monitored, and corrosion product compositions and morphologies were characterized by grazing incidence angle X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Cross sections were cut through corrosion sites using a focused ion beam milling method, and elemental information was obtained using wavelength dispersive and energy dispersive X-ray analyses. The corrosion products and morphologies observed in the alloys are the same as those reported for pure lead, but the corrosion susceptibilities of the alloys show a much stronger dependence on RH. The presence of 3. 4 or 15 atom % Sn provides corrosion protection at moderate humidity, but this protective effect breaks down at high humidity. These findings highlight the importance of humidity control as well as pipe material selection in the conservation of historic and newly constructed organs...|$|R
