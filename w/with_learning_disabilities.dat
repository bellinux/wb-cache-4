5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E
40|$|Sexuality {{is an area}} {{in which}} people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> are {{disabled}} by social attitudes. Stereotypical views about the sexuality of people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> range from asexuality, implying that they have no erotic or romantic inclinations, to hyper-sexuality which reinforces institutionalized sex segregation through the process of social exclusion. In Malta all these influences contribute to hinder the rights and {{the quality of life of}} people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability.</b> The theory of the social model of disability underpins the research aims, while reflecting discourses of equality and rights. The research aims at giving a better understanding of the sexual lives of people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> in a Maltese context, whilst eliciting the opinions and beliefs of people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> themselves, their parents and their service providers. Qualitative data, collected from people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> their I' parents and service providers is interpreted using phenomenological analysis. A sex education intervention pilot project is also run as part of the research, being informed by the findings of the same research. Findings identify ideologies, highlight missing structures and illustrate feasible future strategies. They reveal a lack of community support and emphasise the need of platforms where people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> can form and maintain friendships and relationships. The dearth of any adequate form of sex education currently available for people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> across Malta as well as the lacuna in policies related to sexuality, and particularly referring to the sexuality of people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> is also uncovered. Recommendations reflecting findings from the main research study and the pilot project mainly target the necessity of sex education, policies and procedures surrounding sexuality in the context of people <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> in services across the islands.

METHOD: A postal questionnaire was sent to all 242 general practitioners in Gwent, south Wales.
