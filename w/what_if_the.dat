500|$|The Gunpowder Plot was commemorated {{for years}} by special sermons {{and other public}} acts, such as the ringing of church bells.

[...] In <b>What</b> <b>If</b> <b>the</b> Gunpowder Plot Had Succeeded? historian Ronald Hutton considered the events which might have followed a successful implementation of the plot, and the destruction of the House of Lords and all those within it. [...] He concluded that a severe backlash against suspected Catholics would have followed, and that without foreign assistance a successful rebellion would have been unlikely; despite differing religious convictions, most Englishmen were loyal to the institution of the monarchy.

500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Simpsons went to Quahog?'

500|$|The {{concept of}} the hero has invited {{comparisons}} between Watership Down's characters and those in Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid. Hazel's courage, Bigwig's strength, Blackberry's ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion's and Bluebell's poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the epic poem Odyssey. Kenneth Kitchell declared, [...] "Hazel stands {{in the tradition of}} Odysseus, Aeneas, and others". Tolkien scholar John Rateliff calls Adams's novel an Aeneid [...] "what-if" [...] book: <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> seer Cassandra (Fiver) had been believed and she and a company had fled Troy (Sandleford Warren) before its destruction? What if Hazel and his companions, like Odysseus, encounter a seductive home at Cowslip's Warren (Land of the Lotus Eaters)? Rateliff goes on to compare the rabbits' battle with Woundwort's Efrafans to Aeneas's fight with Turnus's Latins. [...] "By basing his story {{on one of the most}} popular books of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Adams taps into a very old myth: the flight from disaster, the heroic refugee in search of a new home, a story that was already over a thousand years old when Virgil told it in 19 BC." ...|$|E

It's more about our people than {{it is about the}} organization itself this time around." [...] It was noted that [...] "the bad guy [...] is in charge and Inhumans are being hunted" [...] could be taken as a commentary on the political climate under the Presidency of Donald Trump. On approaching this subject, Tancharoen said that there was no nervousness in the writer's room, and Whedon said that the similarities to Trump's America was simply an attempt to [...] "paint the reality where, <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> world just turned upside down?" [...] The pod sees Hydra based out of the Triskelion, a S.H.I.E.L.D. building that was destroyed by Hydra previously in the MCU. It also features the return of the character Grant Ward to the series, with Whedon explaining, [...] "We figured when you get dropped into an alternate reality, what better way to show that it might not be everything you imagined than the return of one of our most loved and most hated characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{research}} {{seems to}} be unanimous; a stable, secure, loving, honest and supportive family in which all members feel safe to explore their identity {{is necessary for the}} formation of a sound identity. Transracial and International adoptions are some factors that {{play a significant role in}} the identity construction of adoptees. Many tensions arise from relationships built between the adoptee(s) and their family. These include being [...] "different" [...] from the parent(s), developing a positive racial identity, and dealing with racial/ethnic discrimination. It has been found that multicultural and transnational youth tend to identify with their parents origin of culture and ethnicity rather than their residing location, yet it is sometimes hard to balance an identity between the two because school environments tend to lack diversity and acknowledgment regarding such topics. These tensions also tend to create questions for the adoptee, as well as the family, to contemplate. Some common questions include what will happen if the family is more naïve to the ways of socially constructed life? Will tensions arise if this is the case? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> very people that are supposed to be modeling a sound identity are in fact riddled with insecurities? Ginni Snodgrass answers these questions in the following way.|$|E
2500|$|The theory {{underlying}} this [...] "exemption" [...] {{is derived}} from the nature of the hearsay rule itself. The hearsay rule operates to exclude extrajudicial assertions as untrustworthy because they cannot be tested by cross-examination. When an assertion is offered into evidence against the defendant and the defendant objects, [...] "hearsay", the defendant is in essence saying [...] "I object to this statement as untrustworthy because I am not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the person who made it. How can we trust what he said?" [...] But <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> defendant is the person who made the statement that is now being offered against him? To object, [...] "hearsay" [...] in this circumstance would be as absurd as to argue, [...] "This statement is unreliable because I cannot cross-examine myself; therefore, how can I trust what I said?" [...] In this situation the objection of the Hearsay rule falls away, because the very basis of the rule is lacking, viz. the need and prudence of affording an opportunity of cross-examination. Another {{way of looking at it}} is that a defendant who faces his own statement being used against him has an opportunity to cross-examine himself – he can take the witness stand and explain his prior assertion, so the rule is satisfied.|$|E
