The MOVPE technique, at the time, provided superior radiative efficiency as compared to the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) used by Bell Labs. Later, however, <b>Won</b> <b>T.</b> Tsang at Bell Laboratories succeeded in using MBE techniques in the late 1970s and early 1980s to demonstrate dramatic improvements in performance of quantum well lasers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The public {{value of}} {{agriculture}} and rural areas is {{closely associated with the}} concept of multifunctionality {{of agriculture and}} rural areas, which in turn signifies economic values other than the production function of agriculture and rural areas. Based on the survey results, virtual scenarios were set up and the contingent valuation method (CVM) was used to estimate the amount consumers are willing to pay (WTP) for the public functions of agriculture and rural areas. This study selected five domains of the public value (environment conservation, maintenance of landscape and cultural tradition, enhancement of national prestige, local community maintenance and socio-economic functions, and food security) and 21 value items as components of the public value. An economic assessment of the public value of agriculture and rural areas was conducted using a binomial logistic regression model. The estimation results showed that the public value consumers are willing to pay ranges from a minimum of 6, 346. 8 billion <b>won</b> <b>t...</b>|$|E

The nation 2 ̆ 7 s major agricultural (primarily food) sectors have been introduced with the aim of assessing their future in a world with a much larger population and corre¬ spondingly increased food requirements. We have looked far into the future, then on occa¬ sion taken the story back to European settlement of Australia to add perspective. Change can be rapid, slow or anywhere in between. It can be foreseen with a degree of certainty or simply appear out of the unknown. Looking back we now know that China, unexpectedly becoming a communist 2 ̆ 7 capitalist country, doubled its gross domestic product on average every seven years. Its prosperity has fed much of Australia s growth in wealth in recent years.

This book {{will help you}} get beyond memorizing electricity-related formulas, rules, and {{procedures}} so you can understand the topic at a deep level deep enough to teach it with confidence and comfort. By covering the basics of static electricity, current electricity, and magnetism, the book develops a scientific model showing that electricity and magnetism are really the same phenomenon in different forms. A bonus feature: access to interactive software that you can download from the NSTA Web site. The software will help you investigate electrical circuits from simple to complex without having to {{buy a lot of}} expensive materials (or risking electrocution!).

40|$|In his 1973 essay {{entitled}} The Rhetorical Situation, Burke {{spoke of}} technology {{as a great}} unwieldy leviathan and man s identification with technology as central to the rhetorical situation as we now confront it. Today, humanity s identification, or oneness, with technology has become increasingly literal. The situation is not just rhetorical, but also ethical, and ontological. The scope of the situation goes well beyond how much surveillance we subject ourselves to when we use a smart phone or social media, or {{the extent to which}} we give up on democracy when we mistake the political technology of voting for democracy itself. What s more, we are imagined and hailed as elements of numerous machinic assemblages. The better adjusted we are to the technological environment, the more we become servomechanisms of gadgets. We are probably not that far from the break boundary where the statement that technology is the extension of man needs to be reversed. The permeation of technology is by no means limited to our external environment. Endo-colonization is increasingly becoming a fact of life.

40|$|An {{abstract}} {{representation of}} a map was used to incorporate realistic con-ditions not currently in place in commercial path finding programs. As the project {{is focused on the}} back-end of random graph generation and search-ing, it can be useful for other projects as an educational tool about efficiency and memory usage, as well as more sophisticated frontend systems. The project incorporates more realistic aspects of traffic movement such as traf-fic light and stop sign delays in order to provide realistic delay calculation when traversing a map. Other factors such as whether one is turning left or right are also considered in delay calculation. Traffic light intersections are weighed in favor of larger roads, meaning smaller roads tend to have less green-light time on average than larger ones intersection with smaller roads. Exits are placed only in realistic locations, meaning a tiny driveway <b>won.</b> <b>t</b> have its own exit onto I- 95. The map is generated using a sophisticated random graph generator, which was also developed as part of this project. The graph generator works by assigning random location a higher density value, making roads stem-ming from that location more likely to be larger roads. interstate and local highways, so on. Residential areas are properly structured with a road ar-chitecture that resembles real life, and intersections are placed with realistic 1 delay mechanisms (traffic lights, stop signs, different kinds of exits, etc). The entire project is also designed to be easily testable, flexible, and scalable.

The Java display is more of a testing and debug tool, {{and the vast majority of}} the work is done on the back-end, with little visual representation.

40|$|Serge Andriantsitohaina {{has always}} had a calling for the soil. He was born into a family of tobacco planters, and as a child he would dream of raising {{chickens}} and keeping a plantation of maize to feed them. He graduated as an optician in France, but back in Madagascar he saw the opportunities laid before him by an extension campaign on growing geraniums, and he grabbed them. He decided to run the family estate located an hour-and-a-half from the capital. He hired consultants, cleared the land, set up with a biochemist for distilling the flours, and engaged twenty families to look after the land, and to grow food crops (rice). At harvest he employed 80 workers. Having become well-known, he found himself elected as mayor of the commune, and started to see a path of considerable profits roll out before him. And then, suddenly, three years of investment and hard work were wiped out by a disease which killed off his geraniums. Three months ago, in mid- 1999, Serge turned back to the old loves of his family, and re-invested in tobacco. Not for him any export, since he sells his produce to the state monopoly Ofmata (Malagasy Tobacco Authority), nor any technical risks: Oftmata extension agents provide seeds, fertiliser and technical training. The support provided by Oftama, Serge recounts, is more and more pathetic. But, look on the bright side, the land is being worked, the rice crop is still there, and the small farmers have keep their work.
