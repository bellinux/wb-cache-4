500|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} Brazil, Rapinoe came on as a {{substitute}} and served the precise cross to Abby Wambach's equalizer goal in the 122nd minute of the game: a goal that holds the record for latest goal ever scored in a World Cup match. Rapinoe would later convert her shot during the penalty shootout to help send the United States to the semifinals. Rapinoe described her last minute cross against Brazil: [...] "I just took a touch and friggin' smacked it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> foot. I don't think I've hit a ball like that <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> foot. I got it to the back post and that beast in the air just got a hold of it." ...|$|E

I'm inspired by my mentors. I'm inspired by various religious doctrines. [...] Many of my songs are impressed on my mind just before I wake up. Others I get from just doodlin' around on the piano". He also wrote that, [...] "when I wake up with a melody in my head, I jump right out of bed before I forget it and run to the piano and my tape recorder. I play the melody with my right hand and then harmonize it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left.</b> I put it down on my tape recorder, and then I work on getting a bridge or eightbar release for the tune." ...|$|E

500|$|Villa {{was born}} in Tuilla, a small parish in Langreo, Asturias, a region in {{northern}} Spain, the son of José Manuel Villa, a miner. When Villa was four, his chances of becoming a footballer were put in jeopardy when he suffered a fracture to the femur in his right leg, but he made a complete recovery. Due to the injury, {{he and his father}} worked on strengthening his left leg and Villa ultimately became ambidextrous. He recalls his father being consistently supportive: [...] "He would be there throwing me the ball over and over, making me kick it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> leg when my right was in plaster after breaking it, I was four. I can barely remember a single training session when my dad wasn't there. I have never been alone on a football pitch." ...|$|E
500|$|Houllier was {{disappointed}} with Liverpool's start and noticed his players {{struggled with the}} humidity. He nevertheless saw set-pieces {{as an opportunity to}} score goals from and felt the equaliser turned the final in his team's favour: [...] "Suddenly the confidence switches to the other camp. They're affected, they become a bit unsettled, and you keep going." [...] Houllier revealed he gave a frank assessment of the task facing his players before the match; although in his words Arsenal were [...] "...probably a bit better than us, probably more mature, more experienced, more ability in some areas," [...] dealing with setbacks would make the difference on the day. He dismissed accusations that Liverpool were boring, rather describing his team as difficult to beat. Owen, the match winner, felt he answered his critics by scoring left-footed: [...] "It's nice to prove people wrong when they say you haven't got a left foot. I {{was supposed to be the}} worst header and the worst player <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> foot in the league, and how could an England player play when they haven't got a left foot.... It does go to show that I have improved and I am improving." ...|$|E
500|$|Coach McKay had {{won four}} {{national}} championships while coaching at USC, {{and he never}} hesitated to express his lack of awe at the NFL. He earned enemies in the league with his dismissive comments and nonchalant attitude. The league liked to promote the games as having life-or-death significance, and were undercut by a coach who would make statements such as, “You draw Xs and Os on a blackboard and that’s not so difficult. I can even do it <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand”. Such statements made the Buccaneers’ road more difficult, as a feeling grew around the league that McKay was a newcomer who needed to be taught a lesson. Linebacker Richard “Batman” Wood echoed those sentiments: “It was a brand-new organization. Who cared about us? They wanted to devastate us, beat us in the ground. And with coach McKay coming from college, they wanted to maybe even play us a little harder." [...] Examples given of opponents using McKay’s comments {{as an excuse to}} run up the score included the reverse that Denver ran late in a 48–10 victory, and the timeout that Chuck Fairbanks called {{at the end of the}} Patriots game to enable Steve Grogan to break the NFL record of season rushing touchdowns by a quarterback. One sports analyst had predicted that McKay’s lucrative contract would encourage opposing coaches to run up the score on the Buccaneers, to be able to demonstrate to their team owners that they were deserving of similar money.|$|E

Suddenly, my right eye was blinded by a light which appeared instantaneously all about without any build up of intensity. <b>My</b> <b>left</b> eye could see the ball of fire start up like a tremendous bubble or nob-like mushroom. I dropped the glass from <b>my</b> <b>left</b> eye almost immediately and watched the light climb upward. The light intensity fell rapidly, hence did not blind <b>my</b> <b>left</b> eye {{but it was still}} amazingly bright. It turned yellow, then red, and then beautiful purple. At first it had a translucent character, but shortly turned to a tinted or colored white smoke appearance. The ball of fire seemed to rise in something of toadstool effect. Later the column proceeded as a cylinder of white smoke; it seemed to move ponderously. A hole was punched through the clouds, but two fog rings appeared well above the white smoke column. There was a spontaneous cheer from the observers. Dr. von Neumann said [...] "that was at least 5,000 tons and probably a lot more." ...|$|R

2500|$|I was to {{have dinner}} that night with [...] Cadogan. As I lay in my bath, I {{reflected}} that the last time I had seen him {{had been in his}} room at the Foreign Office when I had handed him my letter of resignation from the Diplomatic Service. [...] It seemed a long time ago. [...] Looking back on the few but crowded years between, it occurred to me forcibly how fortunate I had been in my decision and how lucky not to miss the experiences which had fallen to my lot in the intervening space of time. To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. <b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly.|$|E
2500|$|The Dubai Marathon in January 2009 was {{the venue}} for Atsede's debut over the {{marathon}} distance. While poor weather prevented {{the possibility of}} a quick time, she finished in 2:25:17 for second place behind Bezunesh, beating more experienced runners including defending champion Berhane Adere and Helena Kirop. Given her strong first time performance, she was among the elite women's field for the Boston Marathon three months later. She ran a time of 2:35:34 for seventh place in her first outing in North America. The 21-year-old took part in her second World Marathon Major of the year at the Berlin Marathon in September. Her fellow Ethiopian Askale Tafa was the pre-race favourite, but Atsede upset the prediction by taking the lead at the 30km and never relinquishing it. She recorded a personal best of 2:24:47 to win the race, crossing the line over a minute and half ahead {{of the rest of the}} field."I am happy to have reached my goal and achieved a time of sub 2:25", she said.

2500|$|Bruno {{took the}} fight to Lewis, but Lewis won the first round. Bruno then went on the {{offensive}} and took the second round, with Lewis trying to use his left jab to win points. Bruno hit Lewis {{on the right of}} his head in the third round, which shook him. Lewis later said that [...] "It didn't hurt me", but the punch concentrated Lewis' efforts on the job in hand. At the end of the sixth round, both Castellano and Roth had the fight level at 57–57, with Morgan scoring the fight 59–55 in favour of Bruno. At the start of the seventh round Bruno hit Lewis with a left jab and continued with a series of short punches. Lewis said [...] "He thought he had me... but actually I just lost my footing. I saw every punch coming". Lewis then hit Bruno with a looping left hook which staggered him, and continued with a series of head punches. Lewis said [...] "I saw him drop his right hand and just came out <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hook". In a momentary break during the onslaught, Lewis was warned by Vann for stiff-arming with his left hand. Upon resuming Lewis finished off Bruno, who was by then staggering on unsteady legs and completely unable to defend himself. Vann stopped the fight one minute and twelve seconds into the seventh round.|$|E

[...] According to the book AC/DC: Maximum Rock & Roll, George Young was involved early on but had to bow out because of personal issues.

2500|$|Like Dutch {{football}} in general until the mid-1960s, Cruyff's early playing career was considerably influenced by coaching philosophy of British/English coaches such as Vic Buckingham. However, his footballing philosophy shares more similar aspects to free-flowing style of South American football (Brazilian {{football in}} particular) than traditional British/Anglo-Saxon school of football (with distinctively direct, aggressive, heavily athletic, muscular, physical elements in coaching and playing style). The mind-body duality always {{plays an important}} role in his footballing philosophy. In Cruyff’s words, quoted in Dennis Bergkamp's autobiography Stillness and Speed: My Story, “...Because you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you. If you don't use your head, using your feet won't be sufficient. Why does a player have to chase the ball? Because he started running too late. You have to pay attention, use your brain and find the right position. If you get to the ball late, it means you chose the wrong position. Bergkamp was never late.” For Cruyff, football (the so-called beautiful game) is much an artistic-oriented mind-body game instead of an athletic-oriented physical competition. As he put it, [...] "Every trainer talks about movement, about running a lot. I say don't run so much. Football is a game you play with your brain. You have to be in the right place at the right moment, not too early, not too late." [...] The creativity is always the key element in his footballing philosophy, both as a player and as a manager. Cruyff once compared his more intuitive and individualistic approach with Louis van Gaal's more mechanized and rigid coaching style, “Van Gaal has a good vision on football. But it's not mine. He wants to gel winning teams and has a militaristic way of working with his tactics. I don't. I want individuals to think for themselves and take the decision on the pitch that is best for the situation... I don't have anything against computers, but you judge football players intuitively and with your heart. On the basis of the criteria which are now in use at Ajax [...] I would have failed the test. When I was 15, I could barely kick the ball 15 metres <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> and with the right maybe 20 metres. I would not have been able to take a corner. Besides, I was physically weak and relatively slow. My two qualities were great technique and insight, which happen to be two things you can’t measure with a computer.” ...|$|E
