Don’t give me a whole bunch of boy scouts who are going to knock it dead out there and don’t give me a whole bunch of absolute beginners who are setup for failure. Give me a wide variety, let’s have regular, normal kids and don’t profile beyond that.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't {{go back to the}} punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The only thing I could do <b>was</b> <b>get</b> on my bike and go forward." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pusher" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Gilligan crafted the episode with the intention to feature a tense cat and mouse game between Mulder and Modell. He later explained, [...] "the only conscious thing I wanted to do from the start <b>was</b> <b>get</b> them together as much as I could". When Gilligan turned in his script, he told series creator Chris Carter that the episode was [...] "the best work I'm ever gonna [...] do for you." [...] Carter retorted that the writers for the show should always [...] "better yourself" [...] by trying to out-do their last scripting effort. The character of Modell would later return in the fifth season episode [...] "Kitsunegari".|$|E

500|$|New York {{plastic surgeon}} Dr. Pamela Lipkin, {{who has never}} treated Jackson or {{reviewed}} his medical records, said, [...] "when {{you look at the}} other features, the skin bleaching sort of goes along with what I think was his quest for beauty, so I have to wonder what came first? Vitiligo or lighter skin?" [...] Noting that Jackson had even skin tone when he was younger, Lipkin's interpretation was that [...] "probably he's trying to look Caucasian: His skin is whiter. His nose <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> thinner every six months. His lips <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> thinner. His eyebrows <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> higher. His eyes <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> wider every time. His cheekbones <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> bigger." ...|$|R
500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do <b>was</b> <b>get</b> on my bike and go forward." [...] After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.|$|E
500|$|Another {{successful}} album on the Aftermath label <b>was</b> <b>Get</b> Rich or Die Tryin', the 2003 major-label {{debut album}} by Queens, New York-based rapper 50 Cent. Dr. Dre produced or co-produced four tracks on the album, including the hit single [...] "In da Club", a joint production between Aftermath, Eminem's boutique label Shady Records and Interscope. Eminem's fourth album since joining Aftermath, Encore, again saw Dre {{taking on the}} role of executive producer, and this time he was more actively involved in the music, producing or co-producing a total of eight tracks, including three singles. In November 2004, at the Vibe magazine awards show in Los Angeles, Dr.Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson, who was supposedly asking for an autograph. In the resulting scuffle, then-G-Unit rapper Young Buck stabbed the man. Johnson claimed that Suge Knight, president of Death Row Records, paid him $5,000 to assault Dre in order to humiliate him before he received his Lifetime Achievement Award. Knight immediately went on CBS's The Late Late Show to deny involvement and insisted that he supported Dr. Dre and wanted Johnson charged. In September 2005, Johnson was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr.Dre until 2008.|$|E
500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, he told me to be polite, and all it did <b>was</b> <b>get</b> me picked on. I fucking hate that man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis. Munky said the band were going to send it to the radio as a joke because they [...] "knew they wouldn't play it, then follow up about a week later with the real thing". [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an Acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex". Davis explained the background behind [...] "Good God": [...] "Ass Itch" [...] is about Davis' difficulty with songwriting. [...] "Kill You" [...] is about Davis' ex-stepmother. Davis explained: ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the series, Hannigan used her own experiences in high school—which she called [...] "overwhelmingly depressing"—to guide her portrayal of Willow: [...] "My theory on high school <b>was,</b> <b>get</b> in, get out and hopefully I won't get hurt. Basically it was a miserable experience, because you're a walking hormone in this place that is just so cruel. There were times that were OK, but it's not the little myth that high school is the best years of your life. No way." [...] Whedon intended Willow to be realistically introverted, saying, [...] "I wanted Willow {{to have that kind of}} insanely colorful interior life that truly shy people have. And Alyson has that. She definitely has a loopiness I found creeping into the way Willow talked, which was great. To an extent, all the actors conform to the way I write the character, but it really stands out in Willow's case." ...|$|E

Sir Amyas made another attempt to elicit whether Aurelia were really at the school in Queen's Square, but Lady Arabella still refused to answer directly. Then he tried the {{expedient}} of declaring that she was only trying to tease him, and had not really seen the lady. He pretended not to believe her, but when she insisted, [...] "Hair just the colour of Lady Belamour's," [...] his incredulity vanished; but on his next entreaty, she put on a sly look imitated from the evil world in which she lived, and declared she should not encourage naughty doings. The youth, who though four years older, was by far the more simple and innocent of the two, replied with great gravity, [...] "It is the Lady Belamour, my own wife, that I am seeking." ...|$|E
6000|$|If I {{were to go}} {{early in}} the morning and tell that fat, bilious man: “Look here, your Ortega’s mad,” he would {{certainly}} think at once that I <b>was,</b> <b>get</b> very frightened, and [...] . one couldn’t tell what course he would take. He would eliminate me somehow out of the affair. And yet I could not let the fellow proceed to where Doña Rita was, because, obviously, he had been molesting her, had filled her with uneasiness and even alarm, was an unhappy element and a disturbing influence in her life—incredible as the thing appeared! I couldn’t let him go on to make himself a worry and a nuisance, drive her out from a town in which she wished to be (for whatever reason) and perhaps start some explosive scandal. And that girl Rose seemed to fear something graver even than a scandal. But if I were to explain the matter fully to H. he would simply rejoice in his heart. Nothing would please him more than to have Doña Rita driven out of Tolosa. What a relief from his anxieties (and his wife’s, too); and if I were to go further, if I even went so far as to hint at the fears which Rose had not been able to conceal from me, why then—I went on thinking coldly with a stoical rejection of the most elementary faith in mankind’s rectitude—why then, that accommodating husband would simply let the ominous messenger have his chance. He would see there only his natural anxieties being laid to rest for ever. Horrible? Yes. But I could not take the risk. In a twelvemonth I had travelled a long way in my mistrust of mankind.|$|E
