40|$|PhD (Tourism Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Currently, {{there are}} {{environmental}} issues {{the world is}} facing which include global climate change, ozone depletion, pollution, high consumption of resources and increasing amounts of solid <b>waste.</b> <b>Tourism</b> {{is one of the}} largest industries and it is an important economic tool. However, it also has many negative effects on the environment. Hotels as one of the tourism industry’s component parts have a significant impact on the environment. From an environmental perspective, hotels consume a large amount of resources such as water and electricity as they make efforts to provide physical comfort to guests. In addition, hotels generate large quantities of waste, which is one of their most visible effects on the environment. Hotels also make a significant contribution to greenhouse gases which are a cause of concern due to the ozone layer depletion. Many hotel customers have become aware of the environmental damages and wasting of environmental resources caused by hotels and they now look for hotels that follow eco-friendly practices. This has brought increasing pressure on hotels to implement more green initiatives. There is limited documented information on green management among hotels in South Africa and in Zimbabwe. While the number and range of impacts hotels have on the environment suggests an urgent need to address them, the environmental management initiatives in these hotels are scantly addressing these green issues and this study is the first to address these issues. The goal of the study was therefore to develop a green management framework for hotels in South Africa and Zimbabwe so that these developing countries may contribute significantly in mitigation of the negative environmental effects. To achieve this goal, two literature chapters addressed the issue of green management and how it can be implemented by hotels. A qualitative research was then carried out employing the case study strategy to collect data from hotel managers in South Africa and Zimbabwe (four in Zimbabwe and four in South Africa). Data was collected using personal interviews involving a direct meeting of the interviewer and the interviewee. Personal interviews were carried out in Zimbabwe. In South Africa, data was collected using telephone interviews. In both Zimbabwe and South Africa, data was recorded on a digital voice recorder. Data was later transcribed and then analysed using the content analysis method. Some of the main findings of the study are that, while some perceptions of managers about the green management concept are consistent with a number of aspects emphasised in literature, some hotel managers do not fully understand or grasp what the concept of green management entails. This indicates that a gap exists between managers’ knowledge and what green management really means, at least according to literature. The study has also established that in most hotels, there is unavailability of green management policies, suggesting that there is a lack of knowledge about the importance of a green management policy amongst hotel managers in these two developing countries. The key contributions of this study are that, it provides insights on the current debate on green management in hotels as revealed through green management initiatives implemented in hotels in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Secondly, the study makes a contribution by doing a supply side analysis and identifying the views of hotel managers with regard to green management. This study also contributed by proposing a green management framework for hotels – an aspect that is currently lacking in the existing literature especially from a developing country point of view. The green management framework proposed has guidelines for implementation. The hoteliers in the two countries will thus benefit from the framework and will be in a position to implement green initiatives to mitigate the negative impacts hotels have on the environment.

30|$|Investigating the {{economic}} and environmental effects of tourism is important, particularly in certain regions, because the priority associated with reducing environmental loads differs between regions. Economic repercussion effects are not usually limited to the target tourist site but also bring about economic benefits to other areas. However, an increase in tourism is also accompanied {{by an increase in}} waste, which is inevitably treated within the target tourist site (Lenzen 2008). Most Japanese tourist sites need to treat increased <b>waste</b> due to <b>tourism</b> because each municipality in Japan must basically treat general waste within the municipality. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to find new landfill sites in Japanese metropolitan cities, and one of the top priorities in these cities is to reduce landfill waste (Nakamura and Kondo 2002 b; Sasao 2004; Tsukui et al. 2015).

Average daily eBC concentration was 74 ± 50 ng/m 3, reflecting a global background level. Meteorological conditions influenced eBC concentrations largely at seasonal scale, which are higher in February–May but lower in June–January. The highest eBC concentrations (greater than 210 ng/m 3) were more associated with the W and WSW winds smaller than 6 m/s. The diurnal variations of eBC showed plateaus from 10 : 00 to 15 : 00 with seasonal variations, associated with local anthropogenic activities, such as indigenous Tibetan burning animal <b>waste</b> and <b>tourism</b> traffic. The PBLHs showed a co-variance with eBC concentrations, implicating close sources. The aerosol optical depths derived from the MODIS data over the Nam Co Observatory Station (NCOS) -included sub-area (30 ° N– 40 ° N, 90 ° E– 100 ° E) showed significant relationship with eBC concentrations.

40|$|According to the Rocky Mountain Lodging Report (1998), {{there are}} {{approximately}} 220, 000 available rooms in SaltLake County. Based on the average occupancy rate, this translates into approximately 150, 000 occupied rooms onany given day. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, waste, in the United States, is generated at an average rate of approximately 4. 4 pounds (2 kg) per person per day. If each room has only one guest per room, this would generate a minimum of 660, 000 pounds (or 264 tons) of waste every day. Large festival and special event exacerbate the problem of waste. During the 2002 Winter Olympics, for example, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee anticipates booking 100 % of the available rooms for the sixteen days of the event. Full occupancy of the rooms {{with a minimum of}} two guests per room would generate 1, 936, 000 pounds a day or 30, 976, 000 pounds (12, 390 tons) of additional garbage total during the Olympics. This places an unseen burden on the taxpayers and the city employees at the Salt Lake County landfill. One of the basic components of sustainability is recycling. Recycling can improve the quality of the environment, reduce the amount of material waste generated, and reuse materials as secondary products (Lansana, 1992).

We first deal with the theoretical and policy contexts for environmental taxes and the so-called green tax reforms, to proceed with an enumeration of actions by the different levels of government in Spain. We show how the central and local governments' stand has not been favorable to the use of these tax instruments due to political beliefs and legal constraints, which have led to a poor energy and environmental performance in comparative European terms. At the same time, the lack of interest of central and local governments in such taxes has fostered an intense regional design and implementation in this field, mainly on emissions to air and waters. These applications share positive and negative aspects, as they contribute to internalize negative environmental effects, but often do so in an inefficient way with a clear revenue-raising component. We conclude that a serious and comprehensive use of environmental taxes in Spain should take into account optimal jurisdictional allocation and the presence of new regulatory approaches in environmental policies, with a focus on some specific fields such as <b>waste,</b> transport and <b>tourism.</b> Environmental Taxes,Spain,Tax reform. environmental policies...|$|R

Translocating species to areas of suitable habitat, when coupled with predator control, is an effective method of expanding species distribution as well as increasing population numbers. This study investigated the requirements for both effective translocation and site assessment in relation to the development of tourism based on black-flanked rock-wallabies. A species-specific habitat ranking system was devised to identify suitable areas for translocated populations. This was followed by an assessment of the tourism potential of the identified sites. When both sets of results were added together potential sites were identified that could satisfy both habitat and tourism requirements. Avon Valley National Park and Billyacatting Nature Reserve were found to be the most suitable sites for translocating rock-wallabies on the basis of suitable habitat and the potential for subsequent development of wildlife tourism. Viable breeding population size, feral predator control, competing introduced herbivore control and fire management are all identified as aspects that require management action. Tourism management requires stakeholder liaison, possible zoning and separation strategies and appropriate <b>waste</b> disposal at <b>tourism</b> sites. Public contact with translocated animals requires an educative approach that avoids any feeding of wildlife. Relatively close contact between visitors and wildlife may be achieved through a process of habituation. Such strategies should however be subject to review...|$|R

It is based on maintaining coherence across scales and different dimensions (e.g. economic, demographic, energetic) of quantitative assessments generated using different metrics. It is designed to detect and analyze patterns in the societal use of resources and the impacts they create on the environment. The approach was created around 1997 by Mario Giampietro and Kozo Mayumi, and has been developed since then {{by the members of}} the IASTE (Integrated Assessment: Sociology, Technology and the Environment) group at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and its external collaborators. MuSIASEM strives to characterize metabolic patterns of Socio-Ecological Systems (how and why humans use resources and how this use depends on and affects the stability of the ecosystems embedding the society). This integrated approach allows for a quantitative implementation of the DPSIR framework (Drivers, Pressures, States, Impacts and Responses) and application as a decision support tool. Different alternatives of the option space can be checked in terms of feasibility (compatibility with processes outside human control), viability (compatibility with processes under human control) and desirability (compatibility with normative values and institutions). The ability to integrate quantitative assessments across dimensions and scales makes MuSIASEM particularly suited for different types of sustainability analysis: (i) the nexus between food, energy, water and land uses; (ii) urban metabolism; (iii) <b>waste</b> metabolism; (iv) <b>tourism</b> metabolism; (v) rural development.|$|R
40|$|General {{description}} Within URBANWASTE Work Package 2 {{data from}} the pilot cases needed to perform the metabolic analysis was collected. In this sense, mainly data regarding waste generation and management, tourism (accommodation capacity, tourist flows, tourism economy) and socio-economic data of each pilot was collected. The indicator sets finally collected were previously cross-checked with the 11 URBANWASTE Pilot Cases regarding data availability on pilot case scale to ensure their suitability and practicability to answer specific URBANWASTE questions. This cross-checking {{was done by the}} means of performing a “Survey on data availability” within Task 2. 3. Origin, Nature and scale of data For data collection, all pilot cases partners received an empty excel database divided into three thematic areas (waste related data, socio-economic data and tourism related data). In case the pilot case partners did not have access to the requested information, other organisations such as local municipal departments, <b>waste</b> management companies, <b>tourism</b> associations, national statistical agencies etc. were contacted by them for support in data provision. The data collected with these databases mainly represent statistical data. For transparency reasons, data sources were to be specified as well. The spatial scale of the collected data {{was supposed to be the}} pilot case area (meaning for the whole city, municipality or metropolitan area). As data on this small scale was not available for all data sets, some of the provided data is on regional or even national level. For ensuring transparency, the spatial scale had to be specified for each data set. According to the type of indicators, the temporal scale varies from annual data to monthly data. For selected data sets, time series data at annual scale were collected for the period 2000 – 2015. For some selected data sets (e. g. waste quantities, tourist arrivals & overnight stays), additionally, also time series on monthly scale were collected for the period 2013 – 2015. Data Format The database prepared to collect the data needed for performing the metabolic analysis was divided into three thematic areas, which are further divided in categories as indicated below: Waste related data - Waste generation and waste quantities [number] - Waste prevention [text] [number] - Waste management [number] [%] [€] Socio-economic data - Description of the pilot case [number] [km²] - Economy [number] [%] [€] - Society [number] [%] - Building statistics [%] Tourism related data - Tourism economy [€] - Accommodation capacity [number] - Tourist flows [number] - Other tourism related information [number] Each category contains a lot of indicators, each indicator being identified by a data ID, a unit, and a spatial scale. Data sources had to be specified as well. When needed, the definitions of these indicators were added directly in the database template. In total, 48 data sets (some of them further divided into sub-sets) were collected. Most of the collected data represent quantitative data in the format of [number], [%] [€] or [km²]. The data on urban metabolism received from the pilot cases is stored in 1 excel database. Further Information and Contact The data on waste generation and management, socio-economic data and tourism data used for all the assessments performed within Work Package 2 and presented in this report was provided by the URBANWASTE pilot cases. More detailed information is contained within the database.
