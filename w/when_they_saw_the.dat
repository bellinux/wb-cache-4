5|$|On October 7, the British saw the new allied trench {{just out}} of musket-range. Over {{the next two days}} the allies {{completed}} the gun placements and dragged the artillery into line. The British fire began to weaken <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> large number of guns the allies had.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} men {{eventually}} {{made their way}} to Pine Ridge. Among the first was Lieutenant Eric Plant's platoon from the 9th Battalion. Captain John Whitham's company of the 12th Battalion moved forward from Bolton's Ridge <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> 6th Battalion moving up behind them. As the 6th Battalion reached the ridge, the companies carried on towards Gun Ridge, while Lieutenant-Colonel Walter McNicoll established the battalion headquarters below Bolton's Ridge. As the 6th Battalion moved forward they were engaged by Turkish small arms and artillery fire, causing heavy casualties. At 10:00 brigade headquarters received a message from the 6th Battalion asking for reinforcement, and McCay sent half the 5th Battalion to assist. At the same time the 8th Battalion were digging in on Bolton's, except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of Turks that had come up from the south behind the 6th Battalion. By noon the 8th Battalion was dug in on the ridge; in front of them were scattered remnants of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th Battalions, mostly out of view of each other in the scrub. Shortly after, McCay was informed that if he wanted the 6th Battalion to hold its position, it must be reinforced. So McCay sent his last reserves, a company of the 1st Battalion, and ordered the 8th to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the 6th Battalion. The scattered formations managed to hold their positions {{for the remainder of the}} afternoon, then at 17:00 saw large numbers of Turkish troops coming over the southern section of Gun Ridge.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a story}} that, {{when the}} Odessa people learned that the {{construction}} cost 1.3 million gold rubles, they gasped, but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> new theatre, they gasped again, this time in admiration.|$|E

25|$|The {{batteries}} surrounding Puerto Cabello {{opened fire}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> ship sailing away, and scored {{a number of}} hits on the ship, but no major damage was done. Hamilton ordered no shots to be fired, and no light to be shown; a tactic which worked, as Santa Cecilia sailed out of danger.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> British {{waving a}} white flag, the Kentucky riflemen thought {{it meant a}} call for a truce. Instead, a British officer handed them a written order from General Winchester to surrender. They refused and decided {{to fight to the}} death rather than trust the Indians. After another three hours of fighting, Major Madison issued a formal {{declaration}} of surrender.|$|E
25|$|Australian {{aircraft}} had reconnoitred Damascus for {{the first}} time on 27 September <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> railway station filled with hundreds of carriages and engines. Retreating columns and transport were also seen on the roads from Deraa and north from Jisr Benat Yakub. During the afternoon of 28 September, Damascus aerodrome was bombed and burnt and the following morning Damascus was being evacuated. All during 30 September long columns of retreating Ottoman and German soldiers had passed through Damascus.|$|E

25|$|At 10:50 Zaken's column, {{stretched}} {{for over}} a mile, started moving up the main street, {{an extension of the}} Cairo-Suez highway. His battalion was divided into three groups, each containing eight tanks, each tank followed by an APC or halftrack. Zaken had three miles to go before reaching a large square {{on the bank of the}} Gulf of Suez. Along the way, he saw Egyptian soldiers, mostly unarmed, and some of them raised their hands in surrender <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Israeli column. All the Israeli tank and APC commanders were standing in their turrets.|$|E
25|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. They had written BASIC language programs since their days at Lakeside School in Seattle and knew the Altair computer was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted {{to be the first to}} offer BASIC for the Altair computer and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of the dog {{was published in the}} Connecticut Quarterly, (April–June, 1898), by New York geologist W.H.C. Pynchon. According to Pynchon, in February 1891 he and geologist Herbert Marshall of the USGS were conducting geologic research in the Hanging Hills <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> dog. Pynchon had seen the dog once before. Marshall, who had seen the dog twice, scoffed at the legend. Shortly after the two of them saw the dog, Marshall slipped on the ice atop one of the cliffs and plunged to his death. His body was recovered by authorities. Reports of the Black Dog continue to circulate today.|$|E

25|$|Feldman's {{first major}} test of his {{authority}} occurred in 1955, when the congregation {{moved into a}} church building. Feldman had a mechitza installed for {{the first night of}} Selichos. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> tall divider separating the men's and women's sections, most of the board members' wives stormed out of the shul. The next morning, the mechitza was missing. When board members dragged their feet about reinstalling it, Feldman put his young rabbinate on the line and threatened to quit if it they didn't bring it back. On the morning before Rosh Hashana, the mechitza reappeared without comment. From that point on, the congregation acceded to its rabbi on all halakhic matters.|$|E
25|$|On the Jets' second possession, Namath threw deep to Maynard, who, {{despite his}} pulled hamstring, was open by a step. The ball was overthrown, {{but this one}} play helped change {{the outcome of the}} game. Fearing the speedy Maynard, the Colts decided to rotate their zone defense to help cover Maynard, leaving Sauer covered {{one-on-one}} by Lenny Lyles, helping Sauer catch 8 passes for 133 yards, including a crucial third quarter 39-yard reception that kept a scoring drive alive. The Jets kept rushing Snell to their strong left, rushing off tackle with Boozer blocking the linebacker, and gained first down after first down as the Colts defense gave ground. The Colts defense was more concerned about Maynard, the passing game, and the deep threat of a Namath to Maynard touchdown. Although the Colts were unaware of Maynard's injury, the Jets were aware that Lyles had been weakened by tonsillitis all week, causing them great glee <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> one-on-one matchup with Sauer.|$|E
25|$|Republican {{presidential nominee}} John McCain had early hopes {{for winning the}} state. New Hampshire {{strongly}} supported McCain in the 2000 and 2008 Republican primaries, attracted by his status as an independent maverick; New Hampshire voters have historically been friendly to independent-minded Republicans. After he clinched the GOP nomination in March 2008, McCain began to move more {{to the right to}} appease the base of his party, and his selection of the socially conservative Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin to be the vice presidential nominee alienated several independents and libertarian-leaning Republicans in New Hampshire. Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama campaigned extensively throughout the state in 2008 to try and unite the party in the general election after the historic and divisive 2008 Democratic primary. Despite the polls that had Obama leading by double digits, New Hampshire voters gave a surprise comeback win to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the January 2008 New Hampshire Democratic Primary {{thanks in large part to}} an enormous number of women who turned out to support Clinton after her emotional moment at a campaign stop in Portsmouth a few days earlier. Obama acknowledged this phenomenon throughout the campaign when he advised his supporters not to get so cocky and arrogant <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> polls that had him leading.|$|E

25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, it was getting dark and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the vast}} scope of the damage, {{initially}} Windsor town officials feared many, possibly even hundreds, of people could have been killed. While there were many serious injuries, only three people {{were killed by the}} storm. Two victims, construction workers working in a bank parking lot, took shelter in a work truck <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> storm approach. [...] The first victim was killed immediately by a piece of flying lumber, the other died a few weeks later from his injuries becoming the 3rd victim. The second victim was found the next day across the street from her obliterated house. Over 400 people were hospitalized, mostly for injuries from flying glass or the victims' having been thrown by winds.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles's {{introduction}} to [...] "Prellies" [...] (Preludin) was in Hamburg. As {{the group had}} to play for hours, Sheridan offered them Preludin, saying: [...] "Here's something to keep you awake." [...] Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin, which when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until {{the early hours of}} the morning. Looking back, Harrison said that the whole group would be [...] "frothing at the mouth" [...] and would sometimes stay awake for days. Lennon recalled, [...] "The waiters always had these pills , so <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> musicians falling over with tiredness or drink, they'd give you the pill. You could work almost endlessly until the pill wore off, and then you'd have another." [...] McCartney said that he would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meantime}} what Captain Tanner {{had said about}} another attack was true. But this time the Indians were more cautious and they hardly exposed themselves, {{while waiting for the}} fire to aid them. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> blazing arrows had little or no effect they fell back once more, with two warriors wounded, one mortally.|$|R
60|$|During {{the attack}} on the last house, a shot struck Captain Bullen in the chest, and he {{instantly}} fell. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> this, <b>the</b> Pioneers dashed forward with a howl of rage, carried the fort, and bayoneted its defenders. The doctor of the party at once examined <b>the</b> wound, and <b>saw</b> that it would probably be fatal.|$|R
50|$|The squadron's Vulcan B2s served {{mainly in}} that {{low-level}} penetration role until 1982 <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> action during <b>the</b> Falklands War. No. 44 Squadron was then disbanded on 21 December 1982.|$|R
500|$|Development on Remastered began shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} The Last of Us in June 2013. Though initially under light development, the team began working harder on Remastered <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> demand for it; work on the game's code did not begin until a larger team was introduced to Remastered in February 2014. As development on the original game ended, the programmers expected that the game would be ported to the PlayStation 4, but planning and preparation did not begin until The Last of Us had launched. The team aimed at creating a [...] "true" [...] remaster, maintaining the [...] "same core experience" [...] and not changing any large story or gameplay elements. For the game's frame rate, the team was initially split, with some preferring 30 frames per second rather than 60; when the game was running at the latter, the whole team became convinced. The team that worked on Remastered was significantly smaller than the team for The Last of Us; in particular, the team did not include any designers, which led to various design issues remaining from the original game. Druckmann attributed this {{to the fact that}} Remastered was developed as a recreation of the original, altering only technical and graphical aspects.|$|E
500|$|An {{immediate}} focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit, with Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions hired {{to create the}} costume. Shinkle noted that [...] "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", {{and he tried to}} balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave the costume a slimmer, [...] "quintessential Deadpool" [...] look. Miller and Reynolds wept <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> completed costume, with Reynolds explaining that [...] "we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That’s hard to accomplish and a feat, but we’re just so happy with how this came out." [...] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind, with the eye areas on the mask removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without changing the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI, which visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed on its fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to [...] "get into the gutters and the cracks ... the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt." [...] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.|$|E
500|$|Art {{director}} Randy McIlvain led the set re-creation for the Enterprise and K7, {{describing the}} excitement over {{working on the}} episode as [...] "contagious". McIlvain spent {{a fair amount of}} time getting the window angles correct on the sets. Mike Okuda re-created the graphics seen on the Enterprise sets using a computer, whilst others were re-drawn by artist Doug Drexler. Some sets were not re-created in full, such as the bridge, which required parts of it to be later added digitally. The captain's chair from the bridge re-creation was later one of the Star Trek items to be auctioned by Christie's. Set designer Laura Richarz watched [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] carefully looking for small details to replicate on the new sets, such as the legs of benches in the bar on K7. However, she said her biggest challenge was tracking down the chairs seen on the space station. She contacted John M. Dwyer, who had worked on the original episode. He explained to her that the company which created the original chairs had gone out of business. After searching shops selling retro furniture, the production team found a single chair that matched those seen in the original episode. It was purchased and a mold was made to create more chairs. The actors were impressed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> resulting sets, with Terry Farrell exclaiming [...] "Wow, we're on the Enterprise!" ...|$|E
25|$|Slaves {{working in}} the fields were wary <b>when</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{approaching}} Union ships and troops, but word spread quickly that the forces were there to liberate them. Many slaves ran to the riverbank and begged to be taken on board the ships, despite the efforts of overseers and Confederate soldiers to stop them.|$|R
50|$|From the Polish territories called Lingonia {{seven or}} eight tribal clans arrived under Totilo. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> Croatian land would be {{suitable}} for habitation because in it there were few Roman colonies, they sought and obtained for their duke...The people called Croats...Many call them Goths, and likewise Slavs, according to the particular name of those who arrived from Poland and Bohemia.|$|R
50|$|In 1930 Continental Baking Company {{introduced}} Wonder Bread as a sliced bread. It {{was followed}} by other major companies <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> how <b>the</b> bread was received. By 1932 the availability of standardized slices had boosted sales of automatic, pop-up toasters, an invention of 1926 by Charles Strite. In 1933 American bakeries {{for the first time}} produced more sliced than unsliced bread loaves.|$|R
