5|$|In 1949, Grant starred {{alongside}} Ann Sheridan in {{the comedy}} I Was a Male War Bride {{in which he}} appeared in scenes dressed as a woman, wearing a skirt and a wig. During the filming he was taken ill with infectious hepatitis and lost weight, affecting the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> in the picture. The film proved to be successful, becoming the highest-grossing film for 20th Century Fox that year with over $4.5 million in takings and being likened to Hawks's screwball comedies of the late 1930s. By this point {{he was one of}} the highest paid Hollywood stars, commanding $300,000 per picture.|$|E
500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, and the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I {{saw him in the}} costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh {{shoot in}} Canada, an angry crew member put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate {{one night in}} Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, {{including}} actor Bill Paxton. [...] "There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics," [...] said actor Lewis Abernathy. Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked.</b> [...] "One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four." [...] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.|$|E

500|$|Spacey {{loosely based}} Lester's early [...] "schlubby" [...] deportment on Walter Matthau. During the film, Lester's {{physique}} improves from flabby to toned; Spacey worked out during filming {{to improve his}} body, but because Mendes shot the scenes out of chronological order, Spacey varied postures to portray the stages. Before filming, Mendes and Spacey analyzed Jack Lemmon's performance in The Apartment(1960), because Mendes wanted Spacey to emulate [...] "the way [...] moved, the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked,</b> {{the way he was}} in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man". Spacey's voiceover is a throwback to Sunset Boulevard(1950), which is also narrated in retrospect by a dead character. Mendes felt it evoked Lester's—and the film's—loneliness. Bening recalled women from her youth to inform her performance: [...] "I used to babysit constantly. You'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside, and then be inside their house and see the difference." [...] Bening and a hair stylist collaborated to create a [...] "PTA president coif" [...] hairstyle, and Mendes and production designer Naomi Shohan researched mail-order catalogs to better establish Carolyn's environment of a [...] "spotless suburban manor". To help Bening get into Carolyn's mindset, Mendes gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like. He lent Bening the Bobby Darin version of the song [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade", which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car.|$|E
2500|$|After {{escaping}} {{first to}} Mozambique, then to Brazil, the family settled in Argentina. Living under her assumed name, Henao became a successful real estate entrepreneur {{until one of}} her business associates discovered her true identity, and Henao absconded with her earnings. Local media were alerted, and after being exposed as Escobar's widow, Henao was imprisoned for eighteen months while her finances were investigated. Ultimately, authorities were unable to link her funds to illegal activity, and she was released. According to her son, Henao {{fell in love with}} Escobar [...] "because of his naughty smile [...] the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at [...] [...] was affectionate and sweet. A great lover. I fell in love with his desire to help people and his compassion for their hardship. We [...] drive to places where he dreamed of building schools for the poor. From [...] beginning, he was always a gentleman." [...] Henao is now believed to be living under an alias in North Carolina.|$|E
