[...] In the script, when Francis Barnard is first introduced to Nicholas, the young man asks about loud, strange noises he had heard a few moments earlier. [...] Don Medina responds: [...] "Uh...an apparatus, Mr. Barnard. (turning) <b>What</b> <b>brings</b> <b>you</b> to us?" [...] Price penciled in the suggestions [...] "that must be kept in constant repair" [...] and [...] "that cannot be stopped". [...] Later in the screenplay, when Nicholas recalls his father's chamber of torture, Price devised alternate explanations for Sebastian Medina's violence. [...] During Nicholas' death scene, after falling {{to the bottom of}} the pit the character originally had dialogue at the point of dying, asking in a voice of horror, [...] "Elizabeth. [...] What have I done to you? [...] (beat) [...] What have I done to you?" [...] The camera was to then cut directly to Elizabeth's face trapped in the iron maiden. [...] Corman decided to jettison the lines, believing that the film should remain purely visual at that point and dialogue would ruin the power of the scene.|$|E
