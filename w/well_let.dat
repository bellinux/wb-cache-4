The breed standard 'bend of stifle' refers to where the upper and the lower thighs meet. The stifles are moderately bent and taper smoothly into the hocks. The hocks are <b>well</b> <b>let</b> down and straight when viewed from the rear. The hock joint corresponds to the human ankle and first short bones in the foot; the dog does not walk on the heel as people do. Feet are round and compact with well-arched toes; they turn neither in nor out. Dewclaws should be removed.|$|E

In August 1945, Shain was working at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan, New York City as a nurse when she and a friend heard on the radio that World War II had ended. They went to Times Square where all the celebrating was and as soon as she arrived on the street from the subway, the sailor grabbed her in an embrace and kissed her. She related that at the time she thought she might as <b>well</b> <b>let</b> him kiss her since he fought for her in the war. Shain did not claim that she was the woman in the white dress until many years later when she wrote to Eisenstaedt. He notified the magazine that he had received her letter claiming to be the subject.|$|E

Some think, as the same writers observe, that the word [...] "Tob", translated [...] "well", {{is the name of the}} kinsman, the same with Tobias; so R.

2500|$|In February 2006, {{while visiting}} Europe, Ma said that {{although}} he and the KMT favor eventual reunification, the KMT respects the opinions of Taiwanese people and independence is a choice {{for the people of}} Taiwan. This caused widespread criticism within the party and from the PRC. In a December 2005 Newsweek International interview, when asked about unification, Ma stated that [...] "for our party, the eventual goal is reunification, but we don't have a timetable", explaining that he meant it was a choice for Taiwan, but also a choice for the Chinese KMT. Perhaps to deflect heavy criticism from the Pan-Green Coalition, the KMT later made an advertisement in the Liberty Times recognizing that independence is an option for the Taiwanese people. Wang Jin-pyng praised Ma for the policy shift, since Wang himself made a similar statement during the 2004 election, but James Soong said he was [...] "shocked" [...] and Lien Chan said he was never consulted. This event actually won some welcome voices from Southern Taiwan, where voters customarily favor the Pan-Green Coalition. One top KMT official said [...] "we might as <b>well</b> <b>let</b> the measles out now so that we will be immune to it when election year comes close, because reunification or independence can be a hot topic by then." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer David Puttnam viewed {{footage from}} a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with {{scriptwriter}} Colin Welland and Liddell's unorthodox running style as {{portrayed in the}} film, with {{his head back and}} his mouth wide open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440 yard final in which Liddell was a long way behind the leaders {{at the start of the}} last lap (of a 220-yard track) remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, [...] "His head's no' back yet." [...] Liddell then threw his head back and with mouth wide open caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death The Guardian wrote [...] "He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship. When he appeared in the heats of the 400m at Paris in 1924 his huge sprawling stride, his head thrown back and his arms clawing the air, moved the Americans and other sophisticated experts to ribald laughter." [...] Rival Harold Abrahams said in response to criticism of Liddell's style: [...] "People may shout their heads off about his appalling style. <b>Well,</b> <b>let</b> them. He gets there." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Romney is {{in general}} an open-faced breed with long wool that grows over the legs in full. Romney breed {{standards}} are not identical across all countries, but {{have much in}} common. [...] The oldest Romney breed society, that of England (founded 1895), adopted the following standard in 1991, The Official Description of the typical Romney sheep is as follows: Head wide, level between ears, with no horns nor dark hair on the poll. Eyes should be large, bright and prominent and the mouth sound. [...] Face in ewes full, and in rams broad and masculine in appearance. [...] Nose and hooves should be black. [...] Neck well set in at the shoulders, strong and not too long. [...] Shoulders well put in and level with the back. [...] Chest wide and deep. [...] Back straight and long, with a wide and deep loin. Rump wide, long and well-turned. [...] Tail set almost even with the chine [...] [...] Thighs <b>well</b> <b>let</b> down and developed. [...] The face should be white, and {{the skin of a}} clean pink colour. [...] Ribs should be well sprung. [...] Legs well set, with good bone and sound feet. [...] Sheep should stand well on their pasterns. The fleece should be of white colour, even texture and a good decided staple [...] from top of head to end of tail and free from kemp. A Romney may have either a colored or white fleece.|$|E
