5|$|Todd {{discovers that}} the beggar woman <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Lucy, whom he {{believed}} to be dead, and that Mrs. Lovett deliberately misled him so she could have him to herself.

Toby appears, enraged at Mrs. Lovett's death, and Todd allows Toby to slit his throat with his own razor. Toby leaves as Todd bleeds to death over his dead wife.|$|E
5|$|Around 38 AD, Vespasian married Domitilla the Elder, the {{daughter}} of an equestrian from Ferentium. They had two sons, Titus Flavius Vespasianus (born in 39) and Titus Flavius Domitianus (born in 51), and a daughter, Domitilla (born in 45). Domitilla the Elder died before Vespasian became emperor. Thereafter his mistress Caenis <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> in all but name until she died in 74. The political career of Vespasian included the offices of quaestor, aedile and praetor, and culminated with a consulship in 51, the year Domitian was born. As a military commander, he gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43. Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian's upbringing, even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors Caligula (3741) and Nero (5468). Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories were later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a propaganda campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius (4154) and his son Britannicus. By all appearances, imperial favour for the Flavians was high throughout the 40s and 60s. While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as proconsul of the Africa province in 63, and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of Greece in 66.|$|E

25|$|The central {{portion of}} the present house, known as Rossdhu Mansion, was {{completed}} in 1773.

25|$|The {{title was}} created in 1388 for the future Henry III of Castile and Catherine of Lancaster.

The title was {{to belong to the}} official successor of the Castilian throne. Thus the first holder of the princedom was the young Henry of Castile and the first woman to hold the title by marriage <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Catherine of Lancaster.|$|E

Fatmawati was therefore his only wife at that time.|$|E

She mentioned the marital problems, saying that she and their son had only recently returned after a several weeks' stay with her parents. Shortly after the policemen arrived, Scott Randolph returned, explaining to them that he had removed their son to a neighbor's house, worried that his wife might again take the boy out of the U.S.; Scott Randolph denied using cocaine, and countered that it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Janet, who used illegal drugs and abused alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Marie Louise's son William married Anne, Princess Royal, eldest {{daughter}} of George II of Great Britain, on 25 March 1734 at St. James' Palace in London. Upon {{return of the}} wedding party to the Netherlands, William had written his mother, warning her that Anne was allowed precedence over Marie Louise because she <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and a king's daughter. This warning was hardly needed, as Marie Louise had eagerly exited Prinsenhof as soon as her son came of age, opting {{to live in an}} elegant but unpretentious house in Harlingen. She had long displayed her disinterest in royal technicalities and the royal lifestyle. She welcomed her son and his new wife upon their arrival, but then returned to her quiet house, taking no part in their ceremonious entry.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} many of the rumors {{surrounding}} Caligula and Drusilla may be derived from formal Roman dining habits. It was customary in patrician households for the host and hostess of a dinner (or in other words, the husband and the wife in charge of the household) to hold the positions of honor at banquets in their residence. In the case of a young bachelor being the head of the household, the female position of honor traditionally was to be held by his sisters, in rotation. If that were Caligula, it would have been Agrippina the Younger, Drusilla, and Julia Livilla taking turns sitting in the place of honor. Apparently, Caligula broke with this tradition in that rather than having his sisters take turns at the place of honor, the place was reserved exclusively for Drusilla. Furthermore, although he was married to Lollia Paulina, through this deviation from traditional practices Caligula publicly proclaimed that Drusilla <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> and the female head of his household.|$|E

Feeling betrayed, Lois returns to Metropolis and does not speak to Superman for a while. When Lois is kidnapped by Lisa Jennings, a woman who wants to destroy Superman, he rescues her.
