He is also bossy, stubborn and sadistic. Herkabe loses his GPA award in light of his actions for flunking Gym.|$|E

500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post {{praised the}} scene in which Yang broke down to Meredith, noting the {{exceptional}} chemistry between them. Pascua was positive of the storyline between Torres, Carlos, and Robbins, writing that it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see {{an emphasis on the}} gay storyline. Adam Bryant of TV Guide wrote that Baker's character [...] "seems like the only decent guy in the bunch", though PopSugar asserted that Williams' character [...] "proves to be most likable of the new doctors".|$|E

500|$|Compared to [...] "Colonel Homer", Lurleen's {{comeback}} episode [...] "Papa Don't Leech" [...] received rather negative {{reviews from}} television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad expressed dislike for the episode, stating {{that he hopes}} the show will reconsider {{the next time they}} decide to give a [...] "solo opportunity" [...] to a one-off character [...] "many people don't remember". Robert Canning of IGN said, [...] "there were too few laugh-out-loud moments in this lackluster episode. Overall, it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see Lurleen again, but she'd probably get more laughs in future cameos than in carrying an entire episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came up to me and said 'I should have capped you'. It <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a little disappointed I didn't get one." ...|$|E
500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. I wanted to have press, and it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> {{get that kind of}} space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E

500|$|Paramount {{secured the}} {{likeness}} rights of Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto {{in the summer}} of 2011 for an upcoming game based on the universe of the film Star Trek (2009). It was not until a year later in June 2012 that the voice work contracts were signed for the pair, and it was also announced that the likeness rights and voice acting {{of the rest of the}} main cast from the film had been secured. Some cast members such as Pegg improvised parts of their performances. Quinto praised the positive experience in the recording studio, and said that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be able to play the character and not have to do all this physical stuff".|$|E
500|$|Several film reviewers drew precise {{parallels}} between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, and The Avengers. Indeed, the producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles. Bird was not surprised that comparisons arose due to superheroes being [...] "the most well-trod turf on the planet," [...] but noted {{that he had not}} been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be compared to it, since [...] "if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good".|$|E
500|$|The {{staff were}} {{concerned}} over the animation of the characters' {{eyes in the}} episode, as the pupils were larger than normal, making the characters look [...] "stoned", and the eyeballs were [...] "too round" [...] and large. The animation artists at the animation studio in South Korea, {{where much of the}} animation process takes place, had begun stenciling the eyes with a template, which according to Lynch resulted in [...] "strangely round eyes which look a little too big sometimes and much too perfect. Which is very un-Simpsons like." [...] Marge was designed with shorter hair in the flashback sequences to make her appear younger. Lynch thought it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see Marge in a [...] "younger, more attractive mode, and sort of watching her progress through pregnancy." ...|$|E

I admire {{the show for}} being brave+fighting for such modern social messaging. Never back down." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance a [...] "B+", and commented that it wasn't her favorite group number, mostly because she felt the song [...] "wasn't [...] best effort". Berk was less kind about the song, and called it a [...] "crappy but thematically admirable Gaga tune", though he gave it three stars out of five. Slezak gave it an [...] "A−" [...] and approved of the rendition: [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see and hear Tina, Mercedes and Kurt on lead vocals—instead of, say, Blaine, Rachel, and Mr. Schue." ...|$|E
500|$|Following his {{involvement}} with this episode, Campbell was considered as a possible contender {{for the role of}} John Doggett, a character that would appear in the eighth season. Over a hundred actors auditioned for the role. Due to a contractual obligation, Campbell could not take any work during the filming of his series Jack of All Trades. On potentially being cast as the series regular, Campbell mused, [...] "I had worked on an X-Files episode before, and I think they sort of remembered me from that. It <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> be involved in that – even if you don't get it, it's nice to hang out at that party." [...] The character was eventually portrayed by actor Robert Patrick. Later in Campbell's novel Make Love! The Bruce Campbell Way, he joked that Patrick [...] "stiffed him out of the role".|$|E
500|$|It was {{the absence}} of Symonds, sent home from the 2008–09 series against Bangladesh for {{skipping}} a team meeting to go fishing, that gave White another opportunity in the ODI team. Although stand-in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain, White claimed a career-best three wickets for five runs off the 10balls he bowled. After the match, White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket, but was upbeat, saying [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> get a few wickets {{but it would have}} been nice to get a few overs under the belt as well." [...] He claimed two more wickets in the second match and, after not being required to bowl in the third, finished the series with an average under 10.|$|E

500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] because he liked [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E
500|$|After the {{coaching}} situation had been settled, Gillis next {{turned his attention}} back to trading Luongo. The Canucks were hoping to make a deal at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. As the draft approached, it was reported the Canucks were also shopping Schneider. Originally, it was believed the rumors were an attempt by Gillis to gain leverage for any potential Luongo deals. However, in a surprise move, Schneider was trade to the New Jersey Devils for the ninth overall pick in the draft, which Vancouver used to select Bo Horvat. Fans, as well as both Luongo and Schneider, were shocked by the news. Luongo stated, [...] "I have to let this sink in and figure out what I'm going to do." [...] While Schneider stated he was not sure what to say or think and he was speechless, adding, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> have resolution to the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Franks {{reviewed}} the VHS {{release of the}} episode for Dreamwatch magazine, {{saying that it was}} [...] "below average" [...] and could have been a plot used on [...] with Data replacing Seven of Nine. In the season six review by Dreamwatch, [...] "Tsunkatse" [...] was given a rating of three out of five. The fight scenes in the episode were reviewed by Robert W. Young for Black Belt magazine. Young described it as being [...] "uncharacteristically cool from a martial arts perspective" [...] and that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see a value-judgement-free depiction of no-holds-barred competition on such a respected TV series." [...] He thought that the combat itself was believable and that Seven may have been using moves taken from Jeet Kune Do, a style founded by Bruce Lee. He summed it up by saying that in this episode [...] "The martial arts of Star Trek have finally gone where no one has gone before." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Cindy White {{praised the}} writing for Deangelo's character saying that [...] "Ferrell {{is much better}} carrying the show on his own than being second banana to Carell. It seemed like he was having more fun with the role in this episode". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. New Yorks Phoebe Reilly wrote that [...] "while it <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> see the staff responding to someone new, it didn't feel like enough to make an audience antsy to come back after a long summer." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode a mediocre review commenting that [...] "judging by tonight's episode alone, {{the transition from the}} Carell era to the post-Carell era is going to be shaky, to say the least". [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] was voted the fourth lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally. In another poll, the episode was voted the third lowest-rated episode out of 24 episode out of 24 from the seventh season and was rated 6.86 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Gordon {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the 2009 season in front of 176,300 who attended the race. He also earned $541,874 in race winnings.

We finally had one {{and put it in}} position." [...] Johnson was happy with his second-place result, saying, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> get our car up front and get some clean air on it. We had to work really hard all day long to keep the car right. I'm very proud of the team." [...] Third-place finisher Biffle was candid with his performance: [...] "We worked our way {{all the way back to}} fourth, third -- 15 more laps, would've passed [...] and then a little while longer we could've gotten [...] But, I just ran out of time, lost track position and weren't able to capitalize on it." ...|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{signed a}} one-year deal for $1.1 million with the Toronto Maple Leafs on August 28, 2010, {{ahead of the}} 2010–11 season. When asked later about his {{decision}} to sign in Toronto, MacArthur said, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>nice</b> <b>to</b> come back to a hockey community." [...] He later added, [...] "It's the most fun I've had since junior." [...] Maple Leafs captain Dion Phaneuf, one of MacArthur's teammates at the 2005 World Junior Championships, was influential {{in the decision to}} sign with Toronto. MacArthur scored goals in each of his first four games with the club, becoming the first player in team history to do so. [...] On November 16 he tied a club record by recording three assists in a period against the Nashville Predators. The following month, he tied his personal career-best when he scored two goals against the Pittsburgh Penguins on October 13. At the end of his first season with the Maple Leafs, he signed a two-year contract extension at $3.25 million per annum on July 5, 2011, thereby avoiding salary arbitration with the club.|$|E
