40|$|DOT, DOE and NRC Type A and Type B {{radioactive}} material (RAM) transport packages routinely use industrial or military specification drums with conventional clamp ring closures as an overpack. Considerable testing has been performed on these type packages {{over the past}} 30 years. Observations from test data have resulted in various design changes and recommendations to the standard drum specification and use, enhancing {{the reliability of the}} overpack. Recently, performance capability of the 9975 conventional clamp ring closure design was questioned by the Regulatory Authority. This paper highlights the observations of recent 9974 and 9975 package testing that led to redesign of the 9975, replacing the standard clamp ring closure with a bolted ring closure. In the course of this review and redesign effort, 18 package designs and approximately 100 Hypothetical Accident Condition (HAC) drops of various size and <b>weight</b> <b>drum</b> packages were evaluated. A trend was observed with respect to overpack lid failures for packages utilizing conventional ring closure. Based on this trend, a limit on the ratio of the content weight to total package weight was identified, beyond which clamp ring closure failure may be expected...|$|E

40|$|With the {{objective}} of mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for performance and carcass traits, an F 2 chicken population was developed by crossing broiler and layer lines. A total of 2063 F 2 chicks in 21 full-sib families were reared as broilers and slaughtered at 42 days of age. Seventeen performance and carcass traits were measured. Parental (F 0) and F 1 individuals were genotyped with 80 microsatellites from chicken chromosome 1 to select informative markers. Thirty-three informative markers were used for selective genotyping of F 2 individuals with extreme phenotypes for body weight at 42 days of age (BW 42). Based on the regions identified by selective genotyping, seven full-sib families (649 F 2 chicks) were genotyped with 26 markers. Quantitative trait loci affecting body weight, feed intake, carcass <b>weight,</b> <b>drums</b> and thighs <b>weight</b> and abdominal fat weight were mapped to regions already identified in other populations. Quantitative trait loci for weights of gizzard, liver, lungs, heart and feet, as well as length of intestine, not previously described in the literature were mapped on chromosome 1.

5000|$|The drums {{are played}} {{near the edge}} of the head, like timpani, these areas are often called [...] "zones". This allows for the optimum {{resonance}} and fundamental tone of the drum to project. Rim shots are not needed to be hit hard depending on the choice of sticks; hard hits can warp aluminum sticks. The player's sticks can move across the main four drums in a pattern that forms a straight line from drum-to-drum, or the closest part of the drum to the player's body. This reduces the amount of space the player must travel to execute some of the more complex movement patterns.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Effects {{of cooked}} and sun dried fish offal, fishmeal, on intake, growth and carcass traits of Rhode Island Red (RIR) chicks was {{evaluated}} at Wolayta Soddo, southern Ethiopia. After 14 days of uniform brooding of unsexed day old RIR chicks, a feeding trial, with 6 dietary groups (T 1 to T 6), 5 replicates each and 10 chicks per replicate, was run for 11 weeks when daily group feed intakes were recorded. Results showed that chicks fed T 1 had significantly (p≤ 0. 01) lowest (68. 5 g dry matter (DM), 13. 3 g crude protein (CP), 0. 54 g calcium (Ca), 0. 35 g phosphorus (P) and 231 kcal metabolizable energy (ME) head- 1) but those on T 6 {{had the highest}} daily intakes (77 g DM, 14. 8 g CP, 1. 81 g Ca, 0. 58 g P and 243 kcal ME head- 1).

40|$|Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is {{a potent}} {{carcinogen}} that causes growth stunting, immunosuppression and liver cancer in multiple species. The recent trend of replacing fishmeal with plant-based proteins in fish feed has amplified the AFB 1 exposure risk in farm-raised fish. NovaSil (NS), a calcium montmorillonite clay, has previously been shown to reduce AFB 1 bioavailability safely and efficaciously in several mammalian species. This study was designed to: (1) evaluate AFB 1 impact on cultured red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus, {{over the course of}} seven weeks; and (2) assess NS supplementation as a strategy to prevent aflatoxicosis. Fish were fed diets containing 0, 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, 3, or 5 ppm AFB 1. Two additional treatment groups were fed either 5 ppm AFB 1 + 1 % NS or 5 ppm AFB 1 + 2 % NS.

40|$|This {{research}} was to establish sorting machine for melon fruit to replace the traditional manpower grading operations to decrease {{the costs of the}} production. It was to achieve the fast and accurate grading operation so as to increase the melon purchasing price and raise the farmer's income. This research first applied the image processing technique to investigate the basic physical characteristics of the melon. The results studied showed that the correlation with the shape size and weight of the melon was not high. Therefore, a shape sorting mechanism was designed for the farmer. The multi-plane hole belt sorting machine was combined together with the parts of the cargo desk, the choosing fruit desk, the washing and supplying unit, and the sorting mechanism. The clean ratio of the multi-plane hole belt sorting machine by this {{research was}} well and the average grading accuracy then obtained of the whole testing cases could be raised up to 98. 7 %. The processing capacity of the system was reached up to about 4219. 3 kg per hour which was 1. 99, 1. 8 and 2. 48 times, respectively as compared to the system obtained with the single-rail <b>weight</b> sorting mechanism, <b>drum</b> hole sorting mechanism and single-row hole belt sorting machine. Moreover, the newly developed multi-plane hole belt sorting machine also held the lower operation cost than the single-rail <b>weight</b> sorting mechanism, <b>drum</b> hole sorting mechanism and single-row hole belt sorting machine.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the paternal contribution to stock reproductive potential in Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua L.). An equation for estimating total annual viable sperm production (VSP) was parameterised for NEA cod based on new and historical data obtained at the Lofoten spawning grounds. A {{principal component analysis}} indicated {{that there were no}} obvious changes in the relationships between the variable male traits each year which supported the use of a single equation for fitting the historical data. VSP was estimated in the time period the stock has been assessed (1946 - 2005). The parameterised equation resulted in approximately tenfold higher VSP than the original equation, but followed the same temporal changes. The VSP from the parameterised equation was used to predict recruitment in a Beverton-Holt model, but resulted in similar recruitment predictions as the traditional spawning stock biomass or total egg productions methods. Male characteristics were evaluated as possible important traits affecting the reproductive potential, including condition, GSI, drumming muscles mass, sperm motility and sperm density. Sperm density was positively correlated with GSI in 2007, but negatively correlated to fish length. No correlations were found in 2008 between sperm density and any of the evaluated male traits. Sperm motility correlated positively to gonad <b>weight,</b> GSI and <b>drumming</b> muscle mass in 2008. Some of these results may indicate that sperm quality is related to fish size. Indications of sperm quality related to fish size may affect the reproductive potential in exploited fish stocks where size selective harvesting can cause a lower mean fish size and potentially a lower sperm quality. More detailed experiments, including direct assessment of fertilisation success in NEA cod, may improve the parameterised equation which might narrow the gap of knowledge of reproductive processes at the population level...|$|R
40|$|Since March 1999, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), {{located in}} southeastern New Mexico, has been {{operated}} by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO), as a repository for the permanent disposal of defense-related transuranic (TRU) waste. More than 1, 450 shipments of TRU waste for WIPP disposal have been completed, and the WIPP is currently receiving 12 to 16 shipments per week from five DOE sites around the nation. One of the largest fleets of Type B packagings supports the transportation of TRU waste to WIPP. This paper discusses {{the development of this}} fleet since the original Certificate of Compliance (C of C) for the Transuranic Package Transporter-II (TRUPACT-II) was issued by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1989. Evolving site programs, closure schedules of major sites, and the TRU waste inventory at the various DOE sites have directed the sizing and packaging mix of this fleet. This paper discusses the key issues that guided this fleet development, including the following: While the average weight of a 55 -gallon drum packaging debris could be less than 300 pounds (lbs.), drums containing sludge waste or compacted waste could approach the maximum allowable weight of 1, 000 lbs. A TRUPACT-II shipment may consist of three TRUPACT-II packages, each of which is limited to a total weight of 19, 250 lbs. Payload assembly weights dictated by ''as-built'' TRUPACT-II <b>weights</b> limit each <b>drum</b> to an average weight of 312 lbs when three TRUPACT-IIs are shipped. To optimize the shipment of heavier drums, the HalfPACT packaging was designed as a shorter and lighter version of the TRUPACT-II to accommodate a heavier load. Additional packaging concepts are currently under development, including the ''TRUPACT-III'' packaging being designed to address ''oversized'' boxes that are currently not shippable in the TRUPACT-II or HalfPACT due to size constraints. Shipment optimization is applicable not only to the addition of new packagings, but also to the addition of new payload containers (used inside the NRC-approved Type B packaging) with revised design limits. For example, to address the shipment of specific TRU waste forms, a series of pipe overpack payload containers have been designed and approved by the NRC. The ''standard'' pipe overpack configuration is designed to allow the shipment of higher fissile gram containers, each with a maximum fissile gram equivalent (FGE) loading of 200 grams (g). For shipments of waste packaged in the standard pipe overpack, the FGE limit is 2, 800 g per TRUPACT-II and 1, 400 g per HalfPACT. The ''S 100 '' and ''S 200 '' pipe overpack configurations allow the use of shielded configurations of the pipe overpack for shipment of specific gamma- and neutron-emitting waste forms. The 72 -B Cask and the 10 - 160 B Cask have been approved by the NRC for the transportation of remote-handled (RH) TRU waste, which comprises {{a small fraction of the}} overall inventory that will be shipped to WIPP...|$|R
