500|$|Screenwriter Ian Watson has speculated, [...] "Worldwide, A.I. {{was very}} {{successful}} (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg." ...|$|E

In 2007, he appeared in the film December Boys, an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid-September 2007. Also in 2007, Radcliffe co-starred with Carey Mulligan in My Boy Jack, a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising Radcliffe's performance as an 18-year-old who goes missing in action during a battle. Radcliffe stated, [...] "For many people my age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I've always been fascinated by the subject and think it's as relevant today as it ever was." ...|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music.

But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

2500|$|Bjelland {{was married}} and {{divorced}} twice and had a son, Henry (born 1999), with her second husband. In 2007 Bjelland had a schizophrenic episode and had received treatment. Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't know who I was or where I was at.

[...] Chomsky's differences with student activists at this time led to what he has called [...] "considerable conflict". He described the rebellions across US campuses as [...] "largely misguided" [...] and he was unimpressed by the student uprising of May 1968 in Paris, saying, [...] "I paid virtually no attention {{to what was going on}} in Paris as you can see from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> - rightly, I think."

[...] Season 2 only ran for 11 episodes; several of the unproduced episodes would be filmed for season 3. In regard to writing for the episode [...] "The Girl I Married", J. M. DeMatteis commented [...] "I have a feeling that the show that appears will not bear much relation to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote.</b> What I've found out is that this season—unlike last, where the script was pretty much regarded as sacrosanct—the network is really interfering a lot.

2500|$|Her {{following}} effort, Klondike Annie (1936) dealt, as best {{it could}} given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy. Some critics called the film her screen masterpiece, {{but not everyone}} felt the same way. Press baron and would-be film mogul William Randolph Hearst, ostensibly offended by an offhanded remark West made about his mistress, Marion Davies, sent a private memo to all his editors stating, [...] "That Mae West picture 'Klondike Annie' is a filthy picture...We should have editorials roasting that picture, Mae West, and Paramount...DO NOT ACCEPT ANY ADVERTISING OF THIS PICTURE." [...] At one point, Hearst asked aloud, [...] "Isn't it time Congress did something about the Mae West menace?" [...] Paramount executives felt they had to tone down the West characterization, or face further recrimination. This may be surprising by today's standards, as West's films contained no nudity, no profanity, and very little violence. Though raised {{in an era when}} women held second-place roles in society, West portrayed confident women who were not afraid to use their sexual wiles to get what they wanted.

In 1997, she starred in Perdita Durango, a controversial film in which many scenes of excessive violence, sex and nudity were edited out of the version released in the United States but remained intact in the version released throughout Latin America. In 1999, Perez starred in Nancy Savoca's The 24 Hour Woman. She provides the voices of Click, the camera, on Nick Jr.'s Go, Diego, Go! and Chel, a beautiful native woman in the DreamWorks Animation film The Road to El Dorado.

2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> it about." ...|$|E
