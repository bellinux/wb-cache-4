50|$|By 1968, GKN Steel had recreated its {{downline}} business, {{and then}} started to build its upline business through aggressive building of a steel stockholding business. In 1972 it acquired Firth Cleveland, a hot and cold rolled strip business with a downline in sintered products, reinforcement steels, <b>wire</b> <b>fasteners</b> and garage equipment. In 1973 it exchanged the remaining assets at Dowlais along with £30 million in cash to the nationalised British Steel Corporation, {{in return for the}} previously nationalised Brymbo Steelworks. After acquiring steel stockholding competitor Miles Druce and Co, by 1974 the company had created a full integrated steel production and manufacturing business.|$|E
5000|$|Wesley Wait (May 15, 1861 [...] - [...] July 16, 1949) was an American inventor, author, dental surgeon, and florist. Wait {{graduated}} from the New York College of Dentistry in 1884 and in 1885 married Emily Smith Rawlins, daughter of the Civil War general John Aaron Rawlins. Many of Wait's inventions have been patented and published in the Official Gazette of the United States Patent Office. Wait's patents included aerial vessels, bridges, greenhouses, frame supports, <b>wire</b> <b>fasteners,</b> and interlocking joints. In 1901 Wait wrote a book titled [...] "The Unity of the Universal Existence" [...] and worked with the Smithsonian Institution between 1921 and 1925 to further his research in this area.|$|E
50|$|A bowtie {{cotter pin}} is a formed <b>wire</b> <b>fastener</b> that resembles an R-clip, except it {{positively}} locks when installed. This keeps them from accidentally falling off or vibrating loose. It was patented by Pivot Point, Inc. on March 23, 1999.|$|R

25|$|A bowtie {{cotter pin}} is a formed <b>wire</b> <b>fastener</b> that resembles an R-clip, except it {{positively}} locks when installed. Rue S. Leitzke and Roman J. Baus first patented the bowtie cotter pin in 1999. U.S. patent #6,135,693 was filed on March 23, 1999 and issued to Leitzke and Baus on October 24, 2000.|$|R
50|$|A circle cotter, {{also known}} as a cotter ring or split ring, is a formed <b>wire</b> <b>fastener</b> that is shaped like a circle, hence the name. The open end of the wire {{is in the middle of}} the cotter so when it is {{installed}} the inner tab is first installed in the hole. Because of this feature it is often used in applications where a sharp edge cannot be tolerated, such as fabric applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{technical}} {{definition of an}} EIFS does not include wall framing, sheathing, flashings, caulking, water barriers, windows, doors, and other wall components. However, some architects have begun specifying flashings, sealants, and <b>wiring</b> <b>fasteners</b> as {{being a part of}} the EIFS scope of work, essentially requiring EIFS contractors to carry out that work as well. The technical national consensus standard for the definition of an EIFS, as published by ASTM International does not include flashing or sealants as part of the EIFS. Many of the EIFS manufacturers have their own standard details showing typical building conditions for window and door flashings, control joints, inside/outside corners, penetrations, and joints at dissimilar materials which should be followed for that manufacturers warranty.|$|R
5000|$|While EAFs {{were widely}} used in World War II for {{production}} of alloy steels, {{it was only later}} that electric steelmaking began to expand. The low capital cost for a mini-mill—around US$140-200 per ton of annual installed capacity, compared with US$1,000 per ton of annual installed capacity for an integrated steel mill—allowed mills to be quickly established in war-ravaged Europe, and also allowed them to successfully compete with the big United States steelmakers, such as Bethlehem Steel and U.S. Steel, for low-cost, carbon steel [...] "long products" [...] (structural steel, rod and bar, <b>wire,</b> and <b>fasteners)</b> in the U.S. market.|$|R
25|$|On December 25, 2007, Berkshire Hathaway {{acquired}} Marmon Group. Previously it was {{a privately}} held conglomerate owned by the Pritzker family for over fifty years, which owned and operated an assortment of manufacturing companies that produce railroad tank cars, shopping carts, plumbing pipes, metal <b>fasteners,</b> <b>wiring</b> and water treatment products used in residential construction.|$|R
50|$|For certain {{applications}} where safety <b>wiring</b> is common, <b>fasteners</b> come pre-drilled {{with holes}} to accept safety wire. When wiring {{something that did}} not come with pre-drilled fasteners stock, however, the more cost-effective way (as opposed to replacing all stock fasteners with pre-drilled ones of the same type) is often to drill the stock fasteners.|$|R

50|$|Besides {{having to}} comply with the various {{limitations}} of a particular class, motorcycles must meet other criteria to be allowed to compete in CCS sanctioned events. Requirements include safety modifications (such as safety <b>wiring</b> of crucial <b>fasteners),</b> homologation, proper display of race numbers, and so on. Also counted in the Equipment category is the riders' personal gear, such as leathers, helmets, back protectors, boots, and gloves.|$|R
50|$|Stay rods {{are used}} for {{relieving}} weights on a higher elevation. These systems are particularly useful to control movements caused by wind or tree growth, however they are the used less often, due to the natural limits of the systems. Higher elevation and more branches tailing off decreases capacity and increases wind sensibility.As building materials for hanging are used ropes, <b>wire</b> cables, tension <b>fasteners,</b> springs etc.|$|R
50|$|As pliers in {{the general}} sense are an ancient and simple invention, no single point in history, or inventor, can be credited. Early metal working {{processes}} from several millennia BCE would have required plier-like devices to handle hot materials {{in the process of}} smithing or casting. Development from wooden to bronze pliers would have probably happened sometime prior to 3000 BCE. Among the oldest illustrations of pliers are those showing the Greek god Hephaestus in his forge. The number of different designs of pliers grew with the invention of the different objects which they were used to handle: horseshoes, <b>fasteners,</b> <b>wire,</b> pipes, electrical, and electronic components.|$|R
50|$|Safety wire tabs are washers {{that are}} used to secure {{fasteners}} by transferring the force of the safety wire {{to the head of the}} fastener to be secured. They are installed just like any other washer, after which the sides of the tab are bent up to make contact with the sides of the head of the fastener. One side of the tab is longer than the other with a small hole at the top, through which safety wire is threaded. Once the Safety Wire is properly installed, the sides of the tab transfer the force of the safety <b>wire</b> to the <b>fastener,</b> as though the fastener itself had been drilled and had the safety wire run though it.|$|R
5000|$|Assembling (joining of the pieces) {{is done by}} welding, binding with adhesives, riveting, {{threaded}} fasteners, or even {{yet more}} bending {{in the form of}} a crimped seam. Structural steel and sheet metal are the usual starting materials for fabrication, along with the welding <b>wire,</b> flux, and <b>fasteners</b> that will join the cut pieces. As with other manufacturing processes, both human labor and automation are commonly used. The product resulting from fabrication may be called a fabrication. Shops that specialize in this type of metal work are called fab shops. The end products of other common types of metalworking, such as machining, metal stamping, forging, and casting, may be similar in shape and function, but those processes are not classified as fabrication.|$|R
40|$|Aerospace {{coatings}} {{represent a}} complex technology which must meet stringent performance requirements in {{the protection of}} aerospace vehicles. Topcoats and primers are used, primarily, to protect the structural elements of the air vehicle from exposure to and subsequent degradation by environmental elements. There are also many coatings which perform special functions, i. e., chafing resistance, rain erosion resistance, radiation and electric effects, fuel tank coatings, maskants, <b>wire</b> and <b>fastener</b> coatings. The scheduled promulgation of federal environmental regulations for aerospace manufacture and rework materials and processes will regulate the emissions of photochemically reactive precursors to smog and air toxics. Aerospace organizations {{will be required to}} identify, qualify and implement less polluting materials. The elimination of ozone depleting chemicals (ODC's) and implementation of pollution prevention requirements are added constraints which must be addressed concurrently. The broad categories of operations affected are the manufacture, operation, maintenance, and repair of military, commercial, general aviation, and space vehicles. The federal aerospace regulations were developed around the precept that technology had to be available to support the reduction of organic and air toxic emissions, i. e., the regulations cannot be technology forcing. In many cases, the regulations which are currently in effect in the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD), located in Southern California, were used as the baseline for the federal regulations. This paper addresses strategies used by Southern California aerospace organizations to cope with these regulatory impacts on aerospace productions programs. All of these regulatory changes are scheduled for implementation in 1993 and 1994, with varying compliance dates established...|$|R

5000|$|Because the use {{of twisted}} safety <b>wire</b> to secure <b>fasteners</b> {{requires}} the fasteners to be drilled, tool makers offer [...] to help technicians drill the fasteners to be secured. Although pre-drilled fasteners can be obtained, most fasteners to be secured start out never having been intended to be secured (e.g., a production motorcycle which was built for the street but which has {{been converted into a}} race-bike). Such fasteners need to be drilled. Drilling them is often difficult as, due to their small size and irregular shape, securing them properly and applying a drill effectively can be trying. As a result, technicians often break drill bits or damage the fastener when the bit slides off position. A useful tool is a drill press, because it allows the technician to apply the force of the drill bit directly to the fastener being drilled and eliminates lateral movement; but even with a press the fastener needs to be secured to prevent it from sliding out from beneath the bit. Even though drill presses ease the process, a press isn't always available, such as at a race event; and even with a press, the problem of securing the fastener still exists. To solve those problems, jigs are available which are designed to securely hold the fastener while providing a guide-channel for a drill bit (with either a hand drill or a press) so that the technician can easily and directly apply force from the drill to the fastener without having it slip off or breaking the bit.|$|R
