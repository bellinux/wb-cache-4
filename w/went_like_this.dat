5000|$|Seventy {{years after}} the play was produced, the comic playwright Aristophanes {{mentions}} an apparent Athenian reproduction of The Persians in his Frogs (405 BCE). In it, he has Aeschylus describe The Persians as [...] "an effective sermon on the will to win. Best thing I ever wrote"; while Dionysus says that he [...] "loved that bit where they sang about {{the days of the}} great Darius, and the chorus <b>went</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> with their hands and cried 'Wah! Wah!'" [...] (1026-28).|$|E

5000|$|He {{played with}} a great deal of enthusiasm at the 1968 Championat de Europe at Lyon Sport Hall. He was very good in team events and still better in a {{completely}} unplanned double. The Association at the time made a new combination Korpa - Šurbek which was triumphant in Europe, while Tova, they decided, should play with Edvard Vecko, although they never trained or played before. Tova recalled, [...] "...unburdened, without high pretensions we played you can say for our pleasure. In the final [...] "round" [...] we played against Swedish experts Johanson and Alser who did not lose a single match in two last world championships. We played the whole match offensively, well, firmly. The result <b>went</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> 21:17, 20:22, 22:20 and 21:14! A big applause from the objective spectators in Palais des Sportes was a great reward. What an unforgettable reception at the Pleso airport and again in Duga Resa! I had to make a speech at the improvised platform, everyone was there...." ...|$|E
5000|$|Milly Santiago {{inserted}} {{herself in}} the middle of a controversy involving the 2016 World Series featuring the Chicago Cubs vs the Cleveland Indians. The Cubs franchise offered Chicago aldermen the option of purchasing tickets at face value. However, the Board of Ethics determine this to be a gift over $50 due to the secondary market markup on the tickets. Santiago and some of her peers believed that they should be exempt from this because they are too poor to purchase tickets on the secondary market. As an alderman, Santiago makes roughly $116,000 a year. Santiago is quoted as saying [...] "First of all, those tickets were not front-row tickets. They were all the way in the upper-deck. If I <b>went</b> <b>like</b> <b>this,</b> I would almost touch the ceiling. That’s how bad those tickets were," [...] Santiago said, lifting her arm over her head. Ald. Milly Santiago (31st) said she is [...] "a poor alderman" [...] who can’t afford to pay thousands of dollars for Cubs tickets purchased on the secondary market according to the Chicago Sun-Times.|$|E
5000|$|For {{a second}} Top of the Pops appearance, {{the band played}} a song called [...] "Don't You Believe It". This was {{actually}} a Jonathan Kelly solo single released shortly before Humpy Bong got together. The single had featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar - but Clapton was unavailable for the Top of the Pops appearance so Staffell played the lead guitar parts. Remembers Staffell: [...] "I struggled to duplicate a guitar part that Eric Clapton had played, {{because we had to}} re-record it for Top Of The Pops, you weren't allowed to mime, and Eric Clapton couldn't make the session. I was {{in a bit of a}} shambles, I can tell you". Humpy Bong, going nowhere, went downhill. Before the end of 1970 the group broke up without having played any real concerts. Staffell remembers: [...] "As I recall, it <b>went</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> - Colin Petersen played drums, I played bass at first, but was crap, so we used, I think, Rick Kemp from Steeleye Span a couple of times. Jonathan Kelly played guitar and wrote the songs, and I have an idea that Tim Renwick from Quiver might have played lead once or twice, and we had Peter Wood on keyboards (Quiver, Sutherland Brothers). Actually, there was never really a firm band. Humpy Bong never did a single gig, anyway, so I guess they weren't really a proper band." [...] Humpy Bong was basically a front for the management and production aspirations of Petersen and his wife. They hand-picked the group and attempted to shape it into a bubbly hit machine, but their lively but superficial honkytonk pop was indistinct and the band fell apart within a few months.|$|E
