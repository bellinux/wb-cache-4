40|$|There {{has been}} a great {{interest}} for improving the machining of composite materials in the aerospace and other industries. This paper focuses on the comparative study of jetting techniques and laser machining technics. This paper concentrates on the machining of composite materials like epoxy pre-impregnated graphite woven fabric and fibre reinforced plastic materials that are used in aerospace industries. While considering machining these materials with the traditional machining there are many disadvantages projected. One of these advantages is that all the traditional machining processes involve the dissipation of heat into the workpiece. This serious shortcoming has been dealt by the jetting technologies, which, contrary to the traditional machining, operate under cold conditions. The two methods in the jetting technologies used for processing materials are <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machining</b> and abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machining.</b> The first of these, <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machining,</b> {{has been a}}round for the past 20 years and has paved the way for abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> technology. <b>Water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machining</b> and abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machining</b> have been used for processing composite materials because of the advantages offered by this technologies as compared to traditional techniques of processing.

Wear of the nozzle becomes {{a major problem}} since it may affect the <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machining</b> performance.

There are various parameters that may influence the wear rate of the nozzle such as nozzle length, nozzle inlet angle, nozzle diameter, orifice diameter, abrasive flow rate and water pressure. The wear rate of the nozzle can be minimized by controlling these parameters. The mechanism of wear in the nozzle is similar to other traditional machining processes which uses a cutting tool.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the effect of}} jet pressure, abrasive flow rate and work feed rate on smoothness of the surface produced by abrasive <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machining</b> of carbide of grade P 25. Carbide of grade P 25 is very hard and cannot be machined by conventional techniques. Cutting was performed on a <b>water</b> <b>jet</b> <b>machine</b> model WJ 4080. The abrasive used in investigations was garnet of mesh size 80. It was tried to cut carbide with low and medium level of abrasive flow rate, but the jet failed to cut carbide since it is too hard and {{very high level of}} energy is required. Minimum rate of abrasive flow that made it possible to cut carbide efficiently was 135 g min - 1. It was found from the investigations that with increase in jet pressure the surface becomes smoother due to higher kinetic energy of the abrasives. But the surface near the jet entrance is smoother and the surface gradually becomes rougher downwards and is the roughest near the jet exit. Increase in abrasive flow rate also makes the surface smoother which is due to the availability of higher number of cutting edges per unit area per unit time.
