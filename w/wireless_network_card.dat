5000|$|... “Malicious associations” {{are when}} {{wireless}} devices can be actively made by attackers {{to connect to}} a company network through their laptop instead of a company access point (AP). These types of laptops are known as “soft APs” and are created when a cyber criminal runs some software that makes his/her <b>wireless</b> <b>network</b> <b>card</b> look like a legitimate access point. Once the thief has gained access, he/she can steal passwords, launch attacks on the wired network, or plant trojans. Since wireless networks operate at the Layer 2 level, Layer 3 protections such as network authentication and virtual private networks (VPNs) offer no barrier. Wireless 802.1x authentications do help with some protection but are still vulnerable to hacking. The idea behind this type of attack may not be to break into a VPN or other security measures. Most likely the criminal is just {{trying to take over}} the client at the Layer 2 level.|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, I {{was happy}} with gNewSense 3.0. Being based on Debian, the {{distribution}} {{can be counted on}} to provide both stability and amazing performance. The distribution is lean, fast and uncluttered. The flip side to this is gNewSense's system installer and default package management tools are geared more toward experienced users and will probably provide a steep learning curve to novice Linux users. Not much is automated and there is a minimum of hand holding. The main feature of gNewSense, the lack of proprietary software, is also a double-edged blade. On the one hand, it means the entire operating system can be audited, modified and redistributed. This is great from the perspective of software freedom. The fact that the distribution can play most multimedia formats and handled Flash content fairly well is a testament of the power of free and open source software. The one problem I ran into with gNewSense's software policy was with regards to my <b>wireless</b> <b>network</b> <b>card.</b> Most distributions ship with the non-free Intel firmware, but gNewSense doesn't include it and this means the distribution isn't a good fit with my laptop. It is, on the other hard , a great match with my desktop system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — When {{computers}} connect {{together on}} a network, a network card or <b>wireless</b> <b>network</b> <b>card</b> are typically used. Each network card or <b>wireless</b> <b>network</b> <b>card</b> has a Media Access Control (MAC) address {{that is used to}} tell them apart. The MAC address is a series of 12 characters usually in the form xx-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx and is burned into the hardware of a network card. The first 6 characters distinguish what company made the card and the rest are unique to identify that specific card. This is in accordance with IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1) standards. MAC address spoofing refers to someone changing their MAC address in order to resemble that of another network card for various reasons. This Specification defines the different MAC Spoofing Techniques and its Countermeasure. This document includes detail description about MAC Address...|$|E

40|$|Differences in signal {{strength}} among <b>wireless</b> <b>network</b> <b>cards,</b> phones and tags are a fundamental problem for location fingerprinting.

The proposed solution has been evaluated by extending two well-known location fingerprinting techniques to hyperbolic location fingerprinting. The extended techniques have been tested on tenhour-long signal-strength traces collected with five different IEEE 802. 11 <b>network</b> <b>cards.</b> The evaluation shows that the proposed solution solves the signal-strength difference problem without requiring extra manual calibration and provides a performance {{equal to that of}} existing manual solutions. ...|$|R
