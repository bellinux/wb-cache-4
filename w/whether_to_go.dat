5|$|The seven {{chapters}} of the book cover the origins {{and implementation of the}} school, and other topics in childrearing. Summerhill, founded in the 1920s, is run as a children's democracy under Neill's educational philosophy of self-regulation, where kids choose <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to lessons and how they want to live freely without imposing on others. The school makes its rules at a weekly schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote alike. Neill discarded other pedagogies for one of the innate goodness of the child.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward with a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E

On his father's advice, Mathis opted to embark on a professional singing career. His LP record album was released in late 1956 instead of waiting until the first quarter of 1957.|$|E

25|$|During {{the casting}} process of Stargate SG-1, the {{producers}} {{were looking for}} an actress who could portray a strong woman whom the audience would accept as a soldier.

25|$|Ontario, Canada's {{most populous}} province, generates some 9,600 MW annually, {{over half of}} that coming from one dozen nuclear reactors. Ontario also has natural gas, and hydro facilities. However, Ontario faces a {{challenge}} as it must replace 80% of its generating capacity in the next twenty years—the old stations have time-expired and the nuclear reactors are overstressed. A debate continues over <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> largely nuclear or go with renewables. Since the Green Energy Act 2009, the debate has become even more heated. As one of the outcomes of the Act, electricity prices have exponentially - by 95% for homeowners and by 115% for small businesses {{in the province of}} Ontario.|$|E

25|$|The DVD Forum (chaired by Sony) {{was deeply}} split over <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{with the more}} {{expensive}} blue lasers or not. Although today's Blu-ray Discs appear virtually identical to a standard DVD, when the Blu-ray Discs were initially developed they required a protective caddy to avoid mis-handling by the consumer (early CD-Rs also featured a protective caddy for the same purpose.) The Blu-ray Disc prototype's caddy was both expensive and physically different from DVD, posing several problems. In March 2002, the forum voted to approve a proposal endorsed by Warner Bros. and other motion picture studios that involved compressing HD content onto dual-layer DVD-9 discs. In spite of this decision, the DVD Forum's Steering Committee announced in April that it was pursuing its own blue-laser high-definition solution. In August, Toshiba and NEC announced their competing standard Advanced Optical Disc. It {{was adopted by the}} DVD forum and renamed to HD DVD the next year.|$|E
25|$|Though Bermuda {{has been}} {{classified}} as a self-governed colony since 1620, internal self-government was bolstered by {{the establishment of a}} formal constitution in 1968, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage; debate about independence has ensued, although a 1995 independence referendum was soundly defeated. For many, Bermudian independence would mean little other than the obligation to staff foreign missions and embassies around the world, which would be a heavy obligation for Bermuda's small population, and the loss of British passports (which could severely restrict travel, as few enough countries have even heard of little Bermuda, and could regard travellers with suspicion). Another concern, which raised its head during the 1991 Gulf War, was the loss of the protection provided by the Royal Navy, especially, to the large number of merchant vessels on Bermuda's shipping register. The Bermuda government is unlikely to be able to provide naval protection to oil tankers plying the Persian Gulf, or other potentially dangerous waters. At present, Bermuda is {{able to take advantage of}} its status as part of the United Kingdom to attract overseas shipping operators to its register, although it does not contribute to the navy's budget. With independence, it was feared, a large chunk of the money currently flowing into the Bermuda Government's coffers would disappear. The current government is promoting independence – by means of a general election (that is, the government of the day would have the power to decide <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> independent or not) as opposed to a referendum (a direct vote by the people) – by establishing a committee to investigate (though the committee is notably staffed with party members, and without representation by the opposition party). This stance is being supported by the UN, who have sent delegations to the island claiming that Bermuda is being suppressed by the British.|$|E
500|$|Earlier US battleships {{had used}} 13-inch guns with black powder propellant; the 1898 {{design of the}} Maine class used more {{powerful}} but smaller 12-inch guns using smokeless powder, giving a greater velocity and flatter trajectory. [...] The 12-inch rifles available in 1904 had a range of , about double {{the range of the}} black powder main armament used in the Spanish–American War. [...] These were considered an excellent compromise between weight and firepower, since limitations in gunnery control made longer-range guns impractical. The contemporary consideration was not <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> larger, but <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with more. In 1902, naval officers, with the backing of President Theodore Roosevelt, began to develop superior fire control techniques and equipment. The development of better spotting and range finders led to improvements in range capacity and accuracy. At the same time, superior training and systems significantly reduced the time required to load and fire the large guns, from three minutes to one minute.|$|E

Seeking input, he passed his sketches around Square's offices, {{and the majority}} of the staff members approved of the miniskirt design. This additionally served as a contrast to Aerith, whose [...] "Long Skirt" [...] was her trademark. The attire was explained in respect to the game as giving her freedom of movement, due to her affinity with hand-to-hand combat, and the skirt, referred to as [...] "quite short [...] giving a considerable degree of exposure," [...] was kept as a staple of her alternate costumes. The developers additionally noted that due to her figure, her otherwise plain garments took on a pleasant appearance.|$|E

500|$|In {{the run-up}} to World War II, Voorhis urged neutrality. He {{proposed}} enactment of a law which would require a national referendum on <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to war. According to Voorhis, laws banning the sale of munitions to foreign nations and forbidding Americans from making loans to other nations for war preparations would keep the United States out of war. In September 1939, when interviewed by The New York Times for his reaction to the President calling Congress into special session to consider amendments to the Neutrality Act, Voorhis stated that a special session should quickly increase relief to the working poor. In early November 1939, however, Voorhis announced his support for repealing the arms embargo mandated by the Act, {{at the same time}} urging that the country remain neutral. Voorhis also opposed a peacetime draft, and supported [...] "lend-lease" [...] legislation.|$|E
500|$|After {{the conquest}} of Malacca in 1511, {{not only did the}} Portuguese monopolize the European spice trade, but they also met and traded avidly with Chinese merchants. When Portuguese under Diogo Lopes de Sequeira had earlier arrived in Malacca in 1509 to open trade relations, he was {{supported}} by the local Chinese merchants there (along with Javanese and Tamil merchants). D'Albuquerque sent Jorge Álvares to explore northward; his expedition sailed along the coast of Guangdong in 1513 and hoisted a flag on [...] "Tuen Mun island". This mission was followed up later that year by Rafael Perestrello, who later traded with Chinese merchants of Canton in 1516. He provided an enticing report to other Portuguese on the lucrative trade in China. This prompted Andrade to speed up the course of his mission while stalled in Malacca and debate with his crew on <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to China or Bengal.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{commented on}} the gameplay's chafing {{difficulty}} and uneven difficulty progression. TumbleSeed stops short of the [...] "masocore" [...] genre of punishingly difficult games, but its imprecise controls nevertheless demand patience to develop proficiency and mastery. At a fundamental level, Eurogamer found the controls [...] "maddening and mesmerizing", and Polygon, out of frustration, wanted to directly control the seed. The multitasking player is made to [...] "never feel safe" [...] between balancing encroaching enemies, unpredictable enemy spawns, precarious controls, and easy deaths, all while managing crystal resources. Polygon considered the game's strategic elements, such as deciding <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on offense or defense, to be its most interesting aspect. Others focused on TumbleSeed art and movement mechanics, as Wired reviewer appreciated the slow process of learning how best to navigate the game and additionally found a new aspect to appreciate each time she played it. Some disagreed {{as to whether the}} game's challenge was appropriate and never malicious, or often unbalanced and frustrating compared to its rewards. The randomness of each basecamp's power-up offerings also contributed to uneven difficulty between playthroughs.|$|E

500|$|There {{was some}} {{disagreement}} over the day {{selected for the}} race, mainly {{in an attempt to}} coincide with a suitable tide. [...] The Cambridge cox for the 1839 race, Thomas Selby Egan, along with Oxford's R. G. Walls were umpires for the race along with referee Edmund Antrobus from St John's College, Cambridge. [...] Both universities rowed in boats constructed by Searle of Stangate; [...] the vessels were [...] "justly and generally admired", the only significant difference between them being that Oxford's boat was carvel built while Cambridge's was clinker built. [...] The race took place on a five-and-three-quarter-mile (9.2km) stretch of the Thames between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge. [...] No arrangements had been made for the police to keep the course clear: according to Cambridge's number seven George Denman [...] "it was often ticklish work for the coxswains to decide <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead or astern of a train of barges catering across the river".

500|$|Another {{approach}} to Troilus' love {{story in the}} centuries following Chaucer is to treat Troilus as a fool, something Shakespeare does in allusions to him in plays leading up to Troilus and Cressida. In Shakespeare's [...] "problem play" [...] there are elements of Troilus the fool. However, this can be excused by his age. He is an almost beardless youth, unable to fully understand the workings of his own emotions, {{in the middle of}} an adolescent infatuation, more in love with love and his image of Cressida than the real woman herself. He displays a mixture of idealism about eternally faithful lovers and of realism, condemning Hector's [...] "vice of mercy". His concept of love involves both a desire for immediate sexual gratification and a belief in eternal faithfulness. He also displays a mixture of constancy, (in love and supporting the continuation of war) and inconsistency (changing his mind twice in the first scene on <b>whether</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to battle or not). More a Hamlet than a Romeo, by the end of the play his illusions of love shattered and Hector dead, Troilus might show signs of maturing, recognising the nature of the world, rejecting Pandarus and focusing on revenge for his brother's death rather than for a broken heart or a stolen horse. [...] The novelist and academic Joyce Carol Oates, on the other hand, sees Troilus as beginning and ending the play in frenzies – of love and then hatred. For her, Troilus is unable to achieve the equilibrium of a tragic hero despite his learning experiences, because he remains a human-being who belongs to a banal world where love is compared to food and cooking and sublimity cannot be achieved.|$|E
