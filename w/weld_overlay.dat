Using the Spiral weld process eliminates the possible distortion of the component due to unbalanced stresses from normal welding processes.

The objective of this work was to develop and verify a FE model, to determine the magnitude and distribution of residual stresses in the <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> tube, and to evaluate the significance of two contributing factors to residual stress: (1) difference in material properties between tube and weld material, and (2) thermal gradients in the weld. An axisymmetric FE model was developed to simulate the circumferential two-layer welding process of alloy 625 overlay on SA 210 tube. The first layer was modeled as a {{gas metal arc welding}} process with filler metal, whereas the autogenous gas tungsten arc welding process was modeled for the second layer. Neutron diffraction technique was used to experimentally determine residual elastic strains in the <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> tube. Comparison with the FE results shows overall good agreement. Both the experimental and FE results show high compressive stresses at the inside tube surface and high tensile stresses in the <b>weld</b> <b>overlay.</b> This suggests that <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> may be used to relieve tensile or produce compressive stresses at the inside tube surface, which is significant for applications where crack initiation is found at the root pass of the joining weld...|$|E

Traditionally, <b>weld</b> <b>overlays</b> are produced using cold or hot wire gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Potential advantages of cold metal transfer (CMT) welding, a low heat input gas metal arc welding process, over the conventional GTAW in production of <b>weld</b> <b>overlays</b> were evaluated. Metallurgical characterization was performed on CMT overlays of Alloy 625 filler metal on Grade 11 and Grade 22 steels. Significant grain refinement was found in the high temperature HAZ compared to the traditional coarse-grained HAZ in arc welding.

The specimen was a 2. 5 inches OD carbon steel tube covered with a layer of Inconel 625 <b>weld</b> <b>overlay.</b> Residual strains in the carbon steel and <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> layers were determined using the ferritic (211) and austenitic (311) reflections, respectively. Residual stresses in each material were derived from the measured strains using Hooke`s law and appropriate elastic constants. Tensile stress regions were found not only in the weld metal but also in the heat affected zone in the carbon steel. The maximum tensile stress was located in the <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> layer and was found to be 360 MPa, or about 75 % of the yield strength of the weld metal.

In the current phase of work, Fe-Al alloy <b>weld</b> <b>overlays</b> were produced by depositing commercially pure aluminum wire on to low carbon steel substrates using Gas Tungsten Arc Welding.

40|$|Abrasive wear {{behaviour}} {{of materials}} {{can be assessed}} using {{a wide variety of}} testing methods, and the relative performance of materials will tend to depend upon the testing procedure employed. In this work, two cermet type coatings have been examined, namely (i) a conventional tungsten carbide-cobalt thermally sprayed coating with a carbide size of between ∼ 0. 3 – 5 μm and (ii) a tungsten carbide-nickel alloy <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> with large spherical carbides of the order of ∼ 50 – 140 μm in diameter (DuraStell). The wear behaviour of these two materials has been examined by the use of two abrasion tests, namely the micro-scale abrasion test using both silica and alumina abrasives (typically 2 - 10 μm in size), and the dry sand-rubber wheel test (ASTM G 65), again with both silica and alumina abrasives (typically 180 – 300 μm in size). It was found that when the abrasive particles were of the same scale or larger than the mean free path between the hard phase particles, then the matrix phase was well protected by the hard phases. Testing (in both test types) with alumina abrasives resulted in wear of both the hard carbide phases and the matrix phases in both the thermally sprayed coating and the <b>weld</b> <b>overlay,</b> with the thermally sprayed coating exhibiting lower wear rates. The wear behaviour of the materials with the more industrially relevant silica abrasive was more complex; the thermally sprayed coating exhibited a lower wear rate than the <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> with the fine abrasive in the micro-scale abrasion test due to effective shielding of the matrix from abrasive action due to the fine reinforcement particle size. In contrast, with the coarser silica abrasive in the dry sand-rubber wheel test, the <b>weld</b> <b>overlay</b> with the large carbides was able to provide matrix protection with low rates of wear, whereas the thermally sprayed coating wore by fracture of the more brittle microstructure.
