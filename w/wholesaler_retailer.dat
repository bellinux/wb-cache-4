40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at mapping the dairy value chain, {{assessing}} constraints and opportunities in the sector, and identifying factors affecting channel choices of producers in Harar and Dire Dawa milkshed areas. Data were collected from 93 producers, six collectors, seven <b>wholesalers,</b> seven <b>retailers,</b> and ten consumers. Both descriptive and econometric analysis were employed. The study revealed that the channel choices available to producers include selling to collectors, <b>wholesalers,</b> <b>retailers,</b> and directly to consumers. The multinomial model output indicated that being in rural areas, breed type, separate milking place, and supply of hay negatively determined the choice to sell to <b>wholesalers,</b> <b>retailers,</b> and consumers. In contrast, education status and milk storage duration positively determined producers’ choice not to sell to collectors. The major recommendations include provision of training, disseminating dairy technologies, encouraging value chain actors to add values; and enhancing collective actions of producers...|$|R

50|$|Trade {{marketing}} is a discipline of marketing {{that relates to}} increasing the demand at <b>wholesaler,</b> <b>retailer,</b> or distributor level {{rather than at the}} consumer level. However, {{there is a need to}} continue with Brand Management strategies to sustain the need at the consumer end. A shopper, who may be the consumer him/herself, is the one who identifies and purchases a product from a retailer. To ensure that a retailer promotes a company's product against competitors', that company must market its product to the retailers as well. Trade marketing might also include offering various tangible/intangible benefits to retailers. The alignment of sales and marketing discipline to profitability can be another explanation for trade marketing.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} has been conducted on April 1 st to May 1 st 2010, at Malang City, East Java Province. Result of research shows four patterns of marketing chain. The first marketing chain is farmer/producer ? <b>wholesaler</b> ? <b>retailer</b> ? consumer. The second marketing chain is farmer/producer & wholesaler ? RPA ? retailer ? consumer. The third marketing chain is farmer/producer ? wholesaler ? restaurant ? consumer. The final marketing chain is farmer/producer ? <b>wholesaler</b> ? <b>retailer</b> ? broker ? consumer. Basically, value chain on each chain is about the unbalanced profit share taken on each chain, the final marketing agent is inclined to take the highest profit, thus make the price on consumers become higher. The result of marketing margin analysis indicates that the margin distribution of first chain is 26. 52 %, while those of second, third and fourth chain are 28. 08 %, 13. 36 % and 32. 04 %. Farmers share in first chain is 44. 72 %, while those in second, third and fourth chain are 43. 57 %, 61. 56 % and 40. 22 %. Profit share per cost of each farmer is similar in rate of 0. 08.

40|$|Food-supply chains {{have become}} {{extensively}} vertically coordinated {{through the use}} of contracts as an organizational response to satisfy the needs of consumers in the saturated food markets of the industrialized countries. The contracts involved must establish an optimal trade-off between incentive provision and risk reduction. Agency theory can be used to model this trade-off. We show how to do this in a three-stage (producer, <b>wholesaler,</b> <b>retailer)</b> principal-agent supply-chain model. Its application to the Dutch supply chain of ware potatoes shows that during the period 1961 – 2002, retailers have been able to provide more incentives to the wholesalers and producers and as a consequence the costs of coordination in the supply chain decreased. Food-supply chains are facing a transition from using open-market mechanisms for coordinating the various stages of value-adding (e. g., produc-tion, wholesale, retail) to negotiated coordination involving governance forms such as alliances, joint ventures, contracts, franchising agreements, and vertical integration (e. g., Boehlje, Hoffi ng, and Schroeder 1999).

The simulation employs the demand pattern following normal distribution, exponential smoothing and moving average forecast techniques and order-up-to level inventory policy. The reverse supply chain from customer to third recycling company ended at manufacturer to form the closed loop. The results of simulation is analysed by changing the variables including lead time, percentage of recycled and reused bottles, and parameters related to forecast methods.

Bacterial contamination at any of these steps remains {{to be a serious}} public health concern. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the {{distribution channel}} and microbial characteristics of pig by-products in Korea. Upon evaluation of pig by-products in cold storage, we found that the small and large intestine were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in pH value compared to the heart and liver. The total plate counts were not significantly dif-ferent among offals until cold storage for 7 d. The coliform count after 1 d of cold storage was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in small and large intestine than in the other organs. The coliform count of heart, liver, and stomach showed a higher coliform count than small and large intestine until 7 d of cold storage. As determined by 16 S rRNA sequencing, contamina-tion of major pig by-products with Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and other bacterial species occurred. Therefore, our results suggest that a more careful washing process is needed to maintain quality and hygiene and to ensure the safety of pig by-products, especially for small and large intestine...|$|E
