500|$|In an {{interview}} discussion {{about his relationship}} with Westfeldt, Hamm said: [...] "We may not have a piece of paper that says we're husband and wife, but after 10 years, Jennifer {{is more than just a}} girlfriend. What we have is much deeper and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> To me, people get married when they're ready to have kids, which I'm not ruling out." [...] Along with Westfeldt, Hamm has appeared in Gap-related campaign advertisements. During April 2009, Hamm and Westfeldt formed their own production company, Points West Pictures. Hamm and Westfeldt are advocates of animal rescue and have adopted a mixed breed dog named Cora from the Much Love Animal Shelter in California.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} helped, sir. Miss Baker {{can do nothing}} in the matter now; nor can any one else. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the {{marriage}} would not suit us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} certain," [...] Arnold declared, vigorously, [...] "that {{if there}} has been anything irregular in her uncle's life, Miss Lalonde knew nothing of it. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he talked wildly, but, for the rest, his doings have been as much a mystery to her as to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{about your}} debts? Of course I couldn't pay debts which were always increasing. And of course your {{promises}} {{for the future}} were false. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> they were false when they were made. Did we not?"

60|$|The Boy was black-haired, {{and so was}} the Major, luckily. I cut off a {{piece of}} the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we were making.

You have heard, by chance, of the Anglo-German Peace Society?" ...|$|E

60|$|Another night {{consultation}} with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I always took him home, and always looked well about me), {{led us to}} the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havisham's. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to consider separately what {{it would be best to}} say; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose an expedition. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I had but to propose anything, and he would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} are wrong, wife; I {{hope you are}} wrong," [...] he said, putting {{his hand on her}} shoulder. [...] "I don't think the doctor thought badly of it, but he seemed puzzled like, I thought; but if there's trouble, Hesba, we will bear it together, you and I; it's sent for good, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> We goes the same way, you know, wife, if we don't go by the same road." ...|$|E

But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he has been profligate {{in every sense of}} the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall see}} it directly. If I marry {{an old woman}} for her money, I have no {{occasion}} to be a hypocrite; <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> our marriage is a mere matter of form. But if I make a young woman my wife because I want her money, and if that young woman happens to be worth a straw, I must deceive her and disgrace myself by shamming love. That, my boy, you may depend upon it, I will never do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{the very}} remark by which I put my foot in it, but my Lady was horrified, and the {{consequence}} was, that it fell to me to advise Felix to resign the class. I never hated {{a piece of work}} so much in my life, for he had worked the lads well, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> there would be an end of them. Moreover, Felix has some of the true Briton about him, and he stood out--would give up the class if the Rector ordered him, but would relinquish Sunday-school altogether in that case; and the two girls were furious; but, after one Sunday, he came to me, said that he found hostility poisoned his teaching, gave up, and accepted the younger ones.' ...|$|R
60|$|We {{all felt}} a little anxiety to hear O'Brien's account of the matter, and after having {{deposited}} the ladies at their homes, Mackinnon and I went off to his lodgings. At first he was denied to us, but after awhile we got his servant to acknowledge {{that he was at}} home, and then we made our way up to his studio. We found him seated behind a half-formed model, or rather a mere lump of clay punched into something resembling the shape of a head, with a pipe in his mouth and a bit of stick in his hand. He was pretending to work, though <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it {{was out of the question}} that he should do anything in his present frame of mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall it be {{a bargain}} between us? Say so, and {{whatever}} is mine shall be mine and yours too.

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you--between ourselves--that I {{heard one of}} the {{foremost}} critics of the age say, {{in the presence of a}} great poet (whom <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know),</b> <b>that</b> it was such another fragment as the Venus of Milo, 'whose lost arms,' said he, 'we should fear to see, lest they should be unworthy of her.' 'You are right,' said the poet: 'I, for one, should shudder to see the fragment completed.' That is a positive fact. But look at some of the sonnets! Burgraves says that his collection of English sonnets is incomplete because it does not contain your 'Clytemnestra,' which he had not seen when his book went to press. You stand in the very forefront of literature--far higher than I, who am--dont tell anybody--five years older than you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't call Major Pendennis an old cove, if you'll 'ave the goodness, Lightfoot, and don't call me an old cove, nether. Such words ain't used in society; and we {{have lived}} in the fust society, both at 'ome and foring. We've been {{intimate}} with the fust statesmen of Europe. When we go abroad we dine with Prince Metternitch and Louy Philup reg'lar. We go here to the best houses, the tip-tops, I tell you. We ride with Lord John and the noble Whycount at the edd of Foring Affairs. We dine with the Hearl of Burgrave, and are consulted by the Marquis of Steyne in everythink. We ought to know a thing or two, Mr. Lightfoot. You're a young man, I'm an old cove, as you say.

6000|$|... "This IS {{the confessional}}. It closes to-morrow morning {{but it is}} the confessional still. Look at the thing frankly. You, I say, are also at loose ends. Can you deny it? My dear sir, don't <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> ever since we left London you have been ready {{to fall in love with}} any pretty thing in {{petticoats}} that seemed to promise you three ha'porth of kindness. A lost dog looking for a master! You're a stray man looking for a mistress. Miss Grammont being a woman is a little more selective than that. But if she's at a loose end as I suppose, she isn't protected by the sense of having made her selection. And she has no preconceptions of what she wants. You are a very interesting man in many ways. You carry marriage and entanglements lightly. With an air of being neither married nor entangled. She is quite prepared to fall in love with you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The look Scott {{envisioned for}} Legend was {{influenced}} somewhat by {{the style of}} Disney animation. He had even offered the project to Disney, but they were intimidated by the film's dark tone {{at a time when}} Disney still focused on family-friendly material. Visually, he referenced films like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Fantasia and Pinocchio. Early on, Scott worked with Alan Lee as a visual consultant who drew some characters and sketched environments. However, Scott eventually replaced Lee with Assheton Gorton, a production designer whom he had wanted for both Alien and Blade Runner. Scott hired Gorton because he knew [...] "all the pitfalls of shooting exteriors on a soundstage. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> whatever <b>we</b> did would never look absolutely real, but would very quickly gain its own reality and dispense with any feeling of theatricality".|$|R
6000|$|There was {{something}} so frank and cordial, so simple and straight-forward in this invitation, {{that we did}} not know how to decline it. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the name of Ten Eyck was respectable in the colony; our new acquaintance was well dressed, he seemed to be in good company when we first met him, his sleigh and horses had been actually of a more dashing stamp than usual, and his own attire had all the peculiarities of a gentleman's, with the addition of something even more decided and knowing than was common. It is true, the style of these peculiarities was not exactly such as I had seen in the air, manners and personal decorations of those of Billings and Harris; but they were none the less striking, and none the less attractive; the two Englishmen being [...] "macaronis," [...] from London, and Ten Eyck being a [...] "buck" [...] of Albany.|$|R
50|$|Donna and I {{discussed}} it several times, and Donna was amazing. Not once {{did she say}} I should or shouldn't. What she did say {{was that it was}} my choice, and nobody else's. During those discussions I realized very powerfully that I was {{in the presence of a}} person who in her own time had made her own hard choices, and sometimes paid a terrible price, but kept on stepping up to the plate and hitting them out of the park, and that's what I was learning from her. Theory, of course theory. But courage, how do you teach courage? American academics give plenty of lip service to speaking truth to power, and then they run like scared rabbits, but here I was, gifted with being in the presence of an astonishingly courageous person. Now it was my turn, and I had to stand up to that level of self-honesty and be equal to it. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> publishing the Posttranssexual Manifesto could be a career-ending move. But I think Donna knew, as I <b>knew,</b> <b>that</b> if I didn't publish I wouldn't be able to live with myself afterward. So I published. You know the rest.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Dan, {{it is wise}} to {{keep this}} {{innocent}} fancy, if it helps and comforts you, till something more real and possible comes to make you happier. I wish I could give you any hope; but <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the dear child is the apple of her father's eye, the pride of her mother's heart, and that the most perfect lover they can find will hardly seem to them worthy of their precious daughter. Let her remain for you the high, bright star that leads you up and makes you believe in heaven.' Mrs Jo broke down there; it seemed so cruel to destroy the faint hope Dan's eyes betrayed, that she could not moralize when she thought of his hard life and lonely future. Perhaps it was the wisest thing she could have done, for in her hearty sympathy he found comfort for his own loss, and very soon was able to speak again in the manly tone of resignation to the inevitable that showed how honest was his effort to give up everything but the pale shadow of what, for another, might have been a happy possibility.|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve a}} tone and quality {{that was true}} to the story as well as {{reflected}} {{the period in which}} it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, saying, [...] "Early on, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did not want this to look like a Technicolor extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." [...] Kamiński had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that [...] "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." [...] The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through bleach bypass, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The shutter timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180-degree timing. Kamiński clarifies, [...] "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic." ...|$|R

"You {{may think}} that with so many tracks as we had made in the {{fortnight}} we had been there, {{they would not have}} an idea which was made the first day and which was made the last, but that ain't so. In the first place, the snow was packed hard, and the footprints were very slight. Then, even when it is always freezing there is an evaporation of the snow, and the footprints would gradually disappear; besides that, the wind on most days had been blowing a little, and though the drift does not count for much on packed snow, a fine dust is blown along, and if the prints don't get altogether covered there is enough drift in them to show which are old ones and which are fresh. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> they could not make much mistake about it, and that they would be pretty sure to hit on the trail I had made in the morning when I went out, and on that of the chief to the rocks, and following mine back to the same place would guess that we had cached there till it was dark.|$|R

6000|$|... "This {{is a long}} introduction, {{you will}} say, and {{does not seem to}} have much to do with bears; but it is really necessary, as you will see. I had joined about six months when three {{companies}} of the regiment were ordered to relieve a wing of the 15th, who had been under canvas at a village some four miles to the north of the point where the line crosses the top of the Ghauts. There were three white officers, and little enough to do, except when a party was sent off to assist the police. We had one or two brushes with the Dacoits, but I was not out on either occasion. However, there was plenty of shooting, and a good many pigs about, so we had very good fun. Of course, as a raw hand, I was very hot for it, and as the others had both passed the enthusiastic age, except for pig sticking and big game, I could always get away. I was supposed not to go far from camp, because in the first place, I might be wanted; and, in the second, because of the Dacoits; and Norworthy, who was in command, used to impress upon me that I ought not to go beyond the sound of a bugle. Of course <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if I intended to get any sport I must go further afoot than this; but I merely used to say 'All right, sir, I will keep an ear to the camp,' and he on his part never considered it necessary to ask where the game which appeared on the table came from. But in point of fact, I never went very far, and my servant always had instructions which way to send for me if I was wanted; while, as to the Dacoits, I did not believe in their having the impudence to come in broad daylight within a mile or two of our camp. I did not often go down the face of the Ghauts. The shooting was good, and there were plenty of bears in those days, but it needed a long day for such an expedition, and in view of the Dacoits who might be scattered about, was not the sort of thing to be undertaken except with a strong party. Norworthy had not given any precise orders about it, but I must admit that he said one day: ...|$|R
