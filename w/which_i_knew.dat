They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
2500|$|Brian {{originally}} intended to sing lead vocal on [...] "God Only Knows" [...] but after the instrumental portions of the song had been recorded, Brian thought Carl could impart the message better than he could. Brian reflected in October 1966, [...] "I gave the song to Carl because I {{was looking for a}} tenderness and a sweetness <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Carl had in himself as well as in his voice. He brought dignity to the song and the words, through him, became not a lyric, but words." [...] At the time, it was rare for Carl to sing lead on a Beach Boys song.|$|E
2500|$|He {{joined the}} Labour Party in 1977, but {{left it in}} 1983 {{when he became a}} {{political}} reporter at the Daily Express, thinking it wrong to carry a party card when directly reporting politics. This also coincided with a culmination of growing personal disillusionment with the Labour movement. [...] In 2009, Hitchens wrote of this period, [...] "Against the Labour Party, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> to be penetrated by all manner of Marxists, and soaked in the ideas of the revolutionaries, it was increasingly necessary to support the Tories. This was partly because of the strikers' lies, but much more because of Poland and Czechoslovakia. On the Cold War, I knew she (Thatcher) was right and the Left were wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|While the {{insanity}} explanation {{was not uncommon}} during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish Riddarhuset (The House of the Nobility), the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered {{by some to be}} remarkably coherent. [...] Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a [...] "kind and warm-hearted man", [...] "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking [...] "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences", with pleasant and interesting conversation... An English friend of Kant's who visited Swedenborg at Kant's behest described Swedenborg as a [...] "reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar". Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and [...] "Do not believe that without this express command I would have thought of publishing things <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..." ...|$|E
