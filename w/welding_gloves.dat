50|$|It is {{possible}} to buy flammable juggling balls. Gloves are often needed but not always; fyrefli juggling balls for example are designed so the flame sits a few centimeters above the hand. Ball juggling is easier than club juggling, and with juggling fire balls, any stage performances look impressive. However, juggling necessarily requires the hands to alternately grip the flaming balls for 1 or more 'juggling beats'(usually around 0.5 second), known as 'dwell time'. This restricts the size of flame and {{the duration of the}} burn to avoid overheating the hands, even with gloves. For these reasons all commercially available fire juggling balls use a smaller wick and flame than standard juggling torches. Some enthusiasts have attempted to overcome this problem using fuel-soaked balls of kevlar rope and <b>welding</b> <b>gloves</b> or similar, but have been unable to achieve more than 30 seconds of useful juggling before the gloves catch fire.|$|E

Usable responses were received from 69 of 89 instructors via self-administered mailed questionnaires. Findings were consistent with results of similar studies. Instructors were not using recommended safety practices or providing student safety and emergency equipment to the extent warranted by the hazards present in the laboratory. Instructional techniques most commonly used in safety instruction were demonstrations conducted by students and instructors in use of power tools. Most instructors (94. 2 percent) required students to pass safety examinations. Instructors used safety manuals and booklets and worksheets most often as instructional materials.
