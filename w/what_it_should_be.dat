5|$|At {{the time}} when the poem Lietuva, Tėvyne mūsų was written, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. Kudirka, a medical student at the University of Warsaw, was writing as a {{columnist}} for the newspaper Varpas (The Bell). In his Varpas columns, Kudirka urged Lithuanians to take pride in their heritage, discussed the problems the Russian Government was causing the Lithuanian population, and denounced those who wished to work for the Tsarist autocracy. In the course of writing for Varpas, he wrote down his thoughts on what Lithuania was and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> resulting in the fifty-word poem Lietuva, Tėvynė mūsų ("Lithuania, Our Homeland").|$|E
5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The third group, who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E

5|$|The {{obvious choice}} for a supreme {{commander}} in the Pacific was General Douglas MacArthur. He had been ordered to leave the Philippines for Australia to take command of a reconstituted ABDA area on 22 February 1942, and had therefore been promised the command even before there were discussions on <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> MacArthur had solid support from the President, the Army and the American people, but not the Navy. The Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, Admiral Ernest King, saw the Pacific lines of communication primarily as a naval responsibility and would not yield command to an Army officer and proposed a division placing all of the Solomons within the Australian area, but excluding the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, and New Zealand. While the Army planners, led by Brigadier General Dwight Eisenhower, were willing to compromise on a divided command, they objected to placing Australia and New Zealand in separate theatres. The Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed the matter between 9 and 16 March, the result {{of which was a}} decision to adopt the Navy's plan, with only minor amendments.|$|E

Toriyama proceeded to create names for all the techniques, except for the series' signature [...] which his wife came up with when he was indecisive about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> called. He even selected them specifically for each character, saying someone like Vegeta would use English names, and using kanji for the more sophisticated like Piccolo.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Scott {{said that}} he was filming Prometheus with both adult-oriented R and more {{accessible}} PG-13 film ratings in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience. When asked about the rating, Scott said, [...] "the question is, do you go for the PG-13, or do you go for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference... essentially it's kinda R... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful." [...] Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made. According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would {{be the only way to}} gain a lower one. A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role. Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.|$|E

Lyons asked the Stratstone executives <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> called; Smillie suggested [...] "Sovereign" [...] while Olley suggested [...] "Royale".

2500|$|Business process {{reengineering}} (BPR) is {{the practice of}} rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's mission and reduce costs. Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and customer needs. Basic questions are asked, such as [...] "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?" [...] An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly {{in terms of the}} wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> doing, does it go on to decide how best to do it.|$|E

In his address to the assembled students and faculty at Hickman, President Reagan praised the school's academic quality, saying, in part, [...] "If America is to be <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in the 21st century, then it's going to need a lot of schools, good schools. And Hickman, I'm pleased and proud to tell you, is one of the best." [...] During the presentation, President Reagan was made an honorary Kewpie and given a school sweatshirt as a gift.|$|E

2500|$|Describing why he {{continued}} using the Guns N' Roses name, instead of labeling the upcoming album an 'Axl Rose solo album', Rose stated [...] "It is something I lived by before {{these guys were}} in it. And {{there were other people}} in Guns n' Roses before them, you know. I contemplated letting go of that, but it doesn't feel right in any way. I am not the person who chose to try to kill it and walked away. It's not an Axl Rose album, even if it's what I wanted it to be. Everybody is putting everything they've got into singing and building. Maybe I'm helping steer it to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> built like." [...] Also in the interview, Rose attributed the breakup of the old lineup to drug addictions and 'an effort from inside the band to destroy him', stating [...] "There was an effort to bring me down. It was a king-of-the-mountain thing," [...] and that he [...] "needed to take control to survive". Rose also described the dissolution as [...] "a divorce".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2005, Pierre Mazeaud, then {{president}} of the Council, announced that the Council would take a stricter view of language of a non-prescriptive character introduced in laws, sometimes known as [...] "legislative neutrons".Jean-Pierre Chevènement] presents us a bill of which I'll say, without talking in latin for once, but instead borrowing my words from the physicists, that it is mostly an assembly of legislative neutrons, I mean of texts with a null juridical charge." [...] Instead of prescribing or prohibiting, as advocated by Portalis, such language makes statements {{about the state of}} the world, or wishes about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> Previously, this language was considered devoid of juridical effects and thus harmless; but Mazeaud contended that introducing vague language devoid of juridical consequences just dilutes law unnecessarily. He denounced the use of law as an instrument of political communication, expressing vague wishes instead for effective legislation. Mazeaud also said that, because of the constitutional objective that law should be accessible and understandable, law should be precise and clear, and devoid of details or equivocal formulas. The practice of putting into laws remarks or wishes with no clear legal consequences has been a long-standing concern of French jurists.|$|E
