5|$|Author Robert R. Frump {{wrote in}} The Man-eaters of Eden that Mozambican {{refugees}} regularly crossing Kruger National Park {{at night in}} South Africa are attacked and eaten by the lions; park officials have conceded that man-eating is a problem there. Frump believes thousands may {{have been killed in}} the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced the refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the park in daytime with little harm.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened on}} 17December 2015, with a bridge walk, in which Sheet Harbour {{residents}} <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the old bridge to commemorate its closure, then walked {{back across the}} new bridge signifying its opening. That same day, the new bridge was opened for pedestrians, and open to traffic the following day. The new bridge has a projected lifespan of at least 75years, until 2090. It also has a sidewalk, which connects to Sheet Harbour's current sidewalk system. Officials hope this will encourage active transportation.|$|E

5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s – one being successful, one ending in Australia's first emergency parachute descent, and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|E

25|$|June 15, 1980: Franklin {{shot and}} killed Arthur Smothers (22) and Kathleen Mikula (16) with a high-powered rifle as the couple <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the Washington Street Bridge in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Smothers was black; Mikula was white. On {{the day of the}} murder, Franklin took a {{concealed}} position on a wooded hillside overlooking downtown Johnstown and waited for potential targets to enter his line of sight. He was never arrested for these murders, but he confessed to them during a jailhouse interview after he was apprehended.|$|E
25|$|The first non-Indigenous {{person to}} <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> Australia {{from the west}} to the east coast, Henri Gilbert, crossed the Nullarbor Plain on foot, with no support team or stock, {{in the middle of}} summer. His <b>walk</b> <b>across</b> Australia, from Fremantle to Brisbane, was {{achieved}} between August 1897 and December 1898.|$|R

50|$|<b>Walking</b> <b>Across</b> Egypt is a 1999 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film {{directed}} by veteran director Arthur Allan Seidelman and written by Paul Tamasy, based on Clyde Edgerton's {{novel of the}} same name. <b>Walking</b> <b>Across</b> Egypt {{represents one of the}} more significant independent films produced in the Florida film industry in recent times.|$|R
25|$|Lord Raglan's Hero Pattern lists many {{religious}} figures whose bodies disappear, or {{have more than}} one sepulchre. B. Traven, author of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, wrote that the Inca Virococha arrived at Cusco (in modern-day Peru) and the Pacific seacoast where he <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the water and vanished. It has been thought that teachings regarding the purity and incorruptibility of the hero's human body are linked to this phenomenon. Perhaps, this is also to deter the practice of disturbing and collecting the hero's remains. They are safely protected if they have disappeared.|$|E
25|$|On January 18, 1971, Sammartino {{lost the}} {{championship}} at Madison Square Garden to Ivan Koloff. After the pin, Koloff slowly <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the ring while the ref {{raised his hand}} three times, and the announcer came into the ring with the championship belt; however, fearful of a riot, he did not present it to Koloff. Koloff left the ring while Sammartino stayed inside to keep the crowd's attention off Koloff. As Sammartino left the ring, people started crying. Three weeks later, Pedro Morales beat Koloff to win the title, and Sammartino congratulated the new champion as he was announced.|$|E
25|$|One {{informant}} who {{was close}} to DeStefano described him as a highly emotional, temperamental individual, extremely egotistical and concerned with his personal appearance. The walls of his home were lined with mirrors and as DeStefano talked to people he continually watched his reflection in those mirrors as he <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the room. He was described as being of such a temperament {{that he could be}} crying at one moment and laughing the very next. DeStefano would often state if he had not been framed for rape at age 17, he would have been the president of the United States.|$|E

25|$|As more {{officers}} converged, Farook <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> {{the street}} towards some homes {{while continuing to}} fire, pinning officers behind their squad cars. He intended to flank the sheriff's deputy who had first stopped. Realizing this, several officers repositioned themselves and focused their gunfire on Farook. One police officer eventually shot Farook in the right side, allowing others to flank and shoot at him. Farook fell to the ground, shot {{several times in the}} legs and upper body. He fired at the police once with a handgun as he lay wounded on the ground, injuring an officer before the gun malfunctioned. Farook was shot again several times and killed. His body was handcuffed and positioned to lie face-down afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} Craxi {{government}} had made its final decision, Abbas and Badrakkan wearing unidentified uniforms {{had been put}} back on the EgyptAir 737 airliner. They were joined by Egyptian diplomat Zeid Imad Hamed {{who had been with}} them in their initial flight from Cairo. Hamed had arranged for JAT, a Yugoslav national airline to take the men from Fiumicino (Rome's main airport) to Belgrade. With no objections from Craxi, at 5:30p.m. EgyptAir flight 2843 flew the 10 minutes from Ciampino airport to Fiumicino. Abbas and Badrakkan left the Egyptian plane, <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the ramp escorted by Italian security forces and embarked on the Yugoslav aircraft. They left for Belgrade, Yugoslavia at 7:10p.m., Saturday, October 12, 1985.|$|E
25|$|For the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Cathy Freeman <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> a {{circular}} {{pool of water}} and ignited the cauldron through the water, surrounding herself within a ring of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp {{to the top of}} the stadium. When it was discovered what the problem was, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued up the ramp, where it finally rested on a tall silver pedestal.|$|E

25|$|The {{funeral service}} and requiem mass went ahead as planned, and the cortege {{made its way}} to Milltown Cemetery, off the Falls Road. Present were {{thousands}} of mourners and top members of the IRA and Sinn Féin, including Sinn Féin's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. Two RUC helicopters hovered overhead. Stone claimed that he entered the graveyard through the front gate with the mourners. Some eyewitnesses claimed to have seen Stone enter the graveyard from the M1 motorway with three other people (two men and a woman). The others <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the graveyard and later left on the Falls Road side. As the third coffin was about to be lowered into the ground, Stone threw two grenades—which had a seven-second delay—toward the republican plot and began shooting.|$|E
25|$|Chaisson talked Kỳ's marines into pulling back, and {{relieved}} {{them with a}} company of his marines on the western banks of the bridge. He then asked permission from rebel officer to place his marines {{on the other side}} of the bridge, but was rejected. Chaisson ignored the rebel officer and ordered his men to deploy to the Struggle Movement positions anyway. The Americans simply sat down on the road among the rebels without using any force. Walt then arrived and he and Chaisson <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the bridge. They never reached the other side, as a rebel warrant officer ordered them to halt, threatening to explode the bridge. In the meantime, the rebels fired machine guns low at the Americans, briefly forcing them to duck.|$|E
25|$|On April 3, 1882, {{after eating}} breakfast, the Fords and Jameses {{went into the}} living room before {{traveling}} to Platte City for a robbery. From the newspaper, James had just learned that gang member Dick Liddil had confessed to participating in Wood Hite's murder. He was suspicious that the Fords had not told him about it. Robert Ford later said he believed that James had realized they were there to betray him. Instead of confronting them, James <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the living room and laid his revolvers on a sofa. He turned around and noticed a dusty picture above the mantle, and stood on a chair to clean it. Robert Ford drew his weapon, and shot the unarmed Jesse James {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E

25|$|Sheriff Wann {{stood in}} front of the jail and {{addressed}} the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door. He removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> the street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. He took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.|$|E
25|$|Biomechatronics mimics how {{the human}} body works. For example, four {{different}} steps must occur {{to be able to}} lift the foot to walk. First, impulses from the motor center of the brain are sent to the foot and leg muscles. Next the nerve cells in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the muscle groups or amount of force required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of force are applied {{depending on the type of}} surface being <b>walked</b> <b>across.</b> The leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to set it down.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then moved}} towards the coaches. One {{of the coach}} drivers, Royce Thompson, {{was shot in the}} back as he was moving along the passengers' side of a coach. He fell to the ground and was able to crawl, then roll under the bus to safety, but later died of his wounds. Brigid Cook was trying to guide a number of people down between the buses and along the jetty area to cover. Bryant moved to the front of this bus and <b>walked</b> <b>across</b> to the next coach. People had quickly moved from this coach towards the back end, in an attempt to seek cover. As Bryant walked around it, he saw people {{scrambling}} to hide and shot at them. Brigid Cook was shot in the right thigh, causing the bone to fragment, the bullet lodging there. A coach driver, Ian McElwee, was hit by fragments of Miss Cook's bone. Both were able to escape and survived.|$|E
