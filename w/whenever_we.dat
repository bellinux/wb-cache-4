25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so <b>whenever</b> <b>we</b> understand some chain of ideas of things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E

25|$|Top-down approach: This is {{the direct}} {{fall-out}} of the recursive formulation of any problem. If {{the solution to}} any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. <b>Whenever</b> <b>we</b> attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table {{to see if it}} is already solved.

25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're doing things on your own {{you can do whatever}} you want.

25|$|For {{a simple}} example, take the {{presentation}} {a | a3}. Writing A for the inverse of a, we have possible strings combining {{any number of}} the symbols a and A. <b>Whenever</b> <b>we</b> see aaa, or aA or Aa we may strike these out. We should also remember to strike out AAA; this says that since the cube of a is the identity element of G, so is the cube of the inverse of a. Under these conditions the word problem becomes easy. First reduce strings to the empty string, a, aa, A or AA. Then note that we may also multiply by aaa, so we can convert A to aa and convert AA to a. The {{result is that the}} word problem, here for the cyclic group of order three, is solvable.|$|E

500|$|After {{their debut}} album Murmur (1983) {{received}} critical acclaim, R.E.M. quickly {{began work on}} their second album. The band wrote new material prodigiously; lead guitarist Peter Buck recalled, [...] "We were going through this streak where we were writing two good songs a week [...] We {{just wanted to do}} it; <b>whenever</b> <b>we</b> had a new batch of songs, it was time to record". Due to the number of new songs the band had, Buck unsuccessfully tried to convince everyone to make the next album a double album. In November 1983, the band recorded 22 songs during a session with Neil Young producer Elliot Mazer in San Francisco. While Mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce the band's next album, R.E.M. ultimately decided to team up again with Murmur producers Mitch Easter and Don Dixon.|$|E

In February of that year, the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover feature and described Homework as [...] "one {{of the most}} hyped debut albums in a long long time." [...] According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. As noted by critic Alex Rayner, Homework brought together established club styles and the [...] "burgeoning eclecticism" [...] of big beat. In 1997 Daft Punk also launched their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour the duo opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage. As Bangalter stated, [...] "Everything was synched up—the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in <b>whenever</b> <b>we</b> wanted to."
