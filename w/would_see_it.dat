5|$|Candide, the impressionable and incompetent {{student of}} Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and {{eventually}} despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it)</b> of his optimism.|$|E
5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't have any real gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, {{enrollment}} began {{a steady}} increase that <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> {{more than double}} {{over the next two}} decades, from less than 600 in 1993 to 1,379 in 2009. The endowment also grew substantially, from $23.6 million in 1993 to $87.2 million in 2013. Between 2002 and 2013, more than $120 million was invested in new construction and renovations to the campus.|$|E

25|$|The 2004–05 {{season is}} remembered {{as one of}} the toughest ever in Chievo's history. Mario Beretta, a Serie A novice from Ternana, was named the coach but, after a strong start that brought Chievo to third behind Juventus and Milan, the team slowly lost {{position}} in the league table. With three matches remaining in the season, Chievo was third-from-last, a position which <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> relegated to Serie B. As a last resort, Beretta was fired and Maurizio D'Angelo, a former Chievo player, was appointed temporarily to replace him as coach. Morale improved, and two wins and a draw from the final three matches proved just enough to keep Chievo in Serie A.|$|E
25|$|The {{final round}} of the Pura Cup was also played out; the winner of the Bushrangers–Warriors match at Junction Oval in Melbourne would join the Bulls in the final, while a draw <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> come down to {{quotient}} with other sides. The Tigers finished first, winning their third match in succession after bowling the Bulls out for 176 and 140, while Michael Bevan scored a century and captain Daniel Marsh made 96 not out. The Redbacks and the Blues played out a match with three declared innings at Adelaide; South Australia batted first, making seven for 541 after centuries from Shane Deitz, Cameron Borgas and Mark Cosgrove, and the Blues responded with six for 314 before declaring, knowing that their only chance of qualifying for the final would be a win in this game. The Redbacks batted for 27 overs, making three for 115 before setting the Blues 343 in a minimum of 100 overs. The Blues were five for 233 after 80 overs, when the Redbacks took the new ball , but Paul Rofe took three wickets in thirteen balls. In the last hour, the Redbacks needed two wickets, and claimed the last when Aaron O'Brien was bowled for 48 by former Australian Test bowler Jason Gillespie with seven balls remaining.|$|E
500|$|In February 1832 Balzac {{received}} an intriguing letter from Odessa—with no return address and signed simply [...] "L'Étrangère" [...] ("The Foreigner")—expressing sadness at the cynicism and atheism in La Peau de Chagrin and its negative portrayal of women. His {{response was to}} place a classified advertisement in the Gazette de France, hoping that his anonymous critic <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Thus began a fifteen-year correspondence between Balzac and [...] "the object of [...] sweetest dreams": Ewelina Hańska.|$|E

500|$|UK {{diplomatic}} sources, speaking anonymously to The Times, {{said that}} if the government had been asked, it would have advised against the creation of the scholarship, because Iran <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as an act of provocation, and because it would interfere with efforts to free Iranians working for the British Embassy in Tehran who had been detained for participating in the post-election protests. The sources said the scholarship had put [...] "another nail into the coffin" [...] of relations between Britain and Iran.|$|E

500|$|There {{was also}} a letter of {{introduction}} for Martin from his putative commanding officer, Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Chief of Combined Operations, to Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Fleet and Allied naval commander in the Mediterranean. Martin was {{referred to in the}} letter as an amphibious warfare expert on loan until [...] "the assault is over". The document included a clumsy joke about sardines, which Montagu inserted {{in the hope that the}} Germans <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as a reference to a planned invasion of Sardinia. A single black eyelash was placed within the letter to check if the Germans or Spanish had opened it.|$|E
500|$|The {{nomination}} of Siemens <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> {{break into the}} French high-speed market for the first time, as all French and French subsidiary high-speed operators use TGV derivatives produced by Alstom. Alstom attempted legal action to prevent Eurostar from acquiring German-built trains, claiming that the Siemens sets ordered would breach Channel Tunnel safety rules, but this {{was thrown out of}} court. Alstom said, after its High Court defeat, that it would [...] "pursue alternative legal options to uphold its position". On 4 November 2010, the company lodged a complaint with the European Commission over the tendering process, which then asked the British government for [...] "clarification". Alstom then announced it had started legal action against Eurostar, again in the High Court in London.|$|E

Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised. I {{try to do that}} in the words and music and try to be what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era."

500|$|Hoar {{replied that}} 'the people' were both a less {{permanent}} and a less trusted body than state legislatures, and that moving {{the responsibility for}} the election of senators to them <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> passing into the hands of a body that [...] " [...] but a day" [...] before changing. Other counterarguments were that renowned senators could not have been elected directly, and that since a large number of senators had experience in the House, which was already directly elected, a constitutional amendment would be pointless. The reform was considered by opponents to threaten the rights and independence of the states, who were [...] "sovereign, entitled...to have a separate branch of Congress...to which they could send their ambassadors". This was countered by the argument that a change in the mode in which senators were elected would not change their responsibilities.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, Variety {{reported}} that New Line Cinema, with producers Neal Moritz and Roy Lee, intended {{to produce a}} new American film adaptation of Battle Royale. However, New Line never secured remake rights and following the Virginia Tech massacre in April 2007, Lee stated that prospects for the project had been [...] "seriously shaken." [...] In 2012, Lee stated a remake {{would no longer be}} possible due to the release of the film adaptation of The Hunger Games, which has been criticized for its similarities to Battle Royale, stating that: [...] "Audiences <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as just a copy of Games — most of them wouldn't know that Battle Royale came first. It's unfair, but that's reality." [...] However, he stated that he might return to the film in ten years to [...] "develop a Battle Royale movie for the next generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Based on {{comments}} {{he heard}} that his talents were [...] "deceptive", Lin stated in a 2013 60 Minutes interview {{that it was his}} [...] "gut feeling" [...] his ethnicity contributed to his being undrafted. NBA commissioner David Stern also believed Lin was not drafted due to discrimination. [...] "I don't know whether he was discriminated against because he was at Harvard. Or because he was Asian," [...] said Stern. Some fans and commentators wrote off his Warriors signing as a publicity stunt. Larry Riley, the team's general manager, denied catering to the Bay Area's large Asian population. He understood that some people <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> that way. [...] "We evaluated him throughout summer league," [...] Riley said. [...] "All that had to happen was for him to confirm what we already believed." [...] While the team created a campaign around him, Riley said {{it would not have been}} advisable if Lin was not a basketball player first.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{has said}} that he began to truly define his {{politics}} only after his military retirement and the 2000 presidential election, won by George W. Bush. Clark had a conversation with Condoleezza Rice in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush. Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the interventionist policies of the Clinton administration. He said he <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> as a sign that things were [...] "starting to go wrong" [...] with American foreign policy under Bush. Clark supported the administration's War in Afghanistan in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks but did not support the Iraq War. Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on CNN that he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq. He said the war was [...] "never ... WMD or regime change" [...] and believes [...] "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown." ...|$|E

Mr. Paik later summons Sun's husband, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), saying that Jae has been stealing from him, and telling Jin {{to put an end to}} it (implying that he is to be killed). But when Jin ambushes and beats up Jae, he still cannot bring himself to commit murder, and instead orders Jae to leave the country. However, as Jin gets into his car, Jae's body suddenly lands on his windshield. Jae's corpse hand is clutching the pearl necklace, implying that he jumped from the window. At Jae's funeral, Sun runs into her father. She asks if he would ever tell Jin about the affair, but he says that it was not his place to tell Jin.|$|E
500|$|Soon after Europeans reached Ming China in {{the early}} 16th century, {{accounts}} of the Great Wall started to circulate in Europe, even though no European <b>would</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> with their own eyes for another century. [...] The work A Treatise of China and the Adjoyning Regions by Gaspar da Cruz (c. 152070) offered an early discussion of the Great Wall in which he noted, [...] "a Wall of an hundred leagues in length. And some will affirme to bee {{more than a hundred}} leagues." [...] Another early account written by Bishop Juan González de Mendoza (15501620) reported a wall five hundred leagues long, but suggested that only one hundred leagues were man-made, with the rest natural rock formations. The Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci (15521610) mentioned the Great Wall once in his diary, noting the existence of [...] "a tremendous wall four hundred and five miles long" [...] that formed part of the northern defences of the Ming Empire.|$|E
