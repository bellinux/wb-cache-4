25|$|News Knight {{is about}} the news {{broadcast}} that McDonald has always wanted to do. As a result, it is he who sets the news agenda. This is mainly {{in the form of}} McDonald's top three stories of the week, which are discussed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel.</b> Therefore, it is more akin to a traditional news broadcast rather than a talk show, but with a comic agenda.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the You're Fired studio audience combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> disagreed with the decision to fire Raef, and also with Alpha winning the task. The panel felt that Michael most deserved to be fired out of the three in the final boardroom, and that all three members of Alpha would have been equally deserving of being fired; Alex for being unconvincing as project manager; Lee for his terrible presentation; Lucinda for contributing little and being uncooperative.|$|E

500|$|Members of {{the hearing}} panel met with Robb prior to the hearing to review the {{contents}} of Oppenheimer's FBI file. The 1946 Administrative Procedure Act included a legal principle known as [...] "the exclusivity of the record" [...] or the [...] "blank pad rule". This meant that a hearing could only consider information that had been formally presented under the established rules of evidence. However, while the act applied to the courts and to administrative hearings held by agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission, it {{did not apply to}} the AEC.

[...] The parole board postponed the hearing in September, stating that it was awaiting the receipt of additional information to complete Chapman's record.

2500|$|The {{style of}} the {{furnishings}} {{of the room and}} the modernity of the town visible through the arched window set the panels in a contemporary 15th century setting. The interiors have been cited {{as one of the first}} representations of medieval [...] "bourgeois domestic culture". Borchert sees this familiar setting as a device to allow 15th century viewers to connect <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> and so reinforce the conceit that the two saints are apparitions occupying the same space and time as the donor or observer. Yet a number of features in the interior suggest that it is not a secular domestic space, most obviously the cool and austere surfaces, the domed windows and stone columns.|$|E

The Captain then asked the First Officer {{if one of the}} ground crews had tampered <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> near the plane's rear door, and subsequently stated that [...] "the guy" [...] had problems and was pissed at them. The flight continued to Lagos and the crew continued to discuss the problem they were facing. They noticed that there were differences on the EPR value on the engines. The crew also noticed that there was no response from the left engine when they advanced the throttle lever, thus concluded that the left engine was inoperative. The crew decided to start their descent towards Lagos. As a failure on the left engine occurred, the crew should have looked at their Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and followed procedures accordingly, but failed to do so.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} three years of What's My Line?, Block had gained {{popularity}} with a wide portion of the television viewing audience, but behind the scenes he was having problems with the sponsor and producer. According to publisher and fellow panelist Bennett Cerf, Block's personality and background set him apart from the other cast members. Cerf had joined the cast during the show's second year when Untermeyer was dropped from the show because of accusations of being a communist. Upon his first meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> members, Cerf thought of Block as [...] "a clod. He wasn't in the same class as the others." [...] Norman Barasch, who once wrote for Block, said [...] "Suave, Hal Block wasn't." [...] What's My Line? producer Gil Fates, in his 1978 book about the show, described Block as [...] "a strange man", adding he was [...] "stocky with curly black hair, heavy lips and, rather bulging eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Pencak silat men's class F (70–75kg) event, Secretary–General of the Malaysian National Silat Federation (Pesaka) Datuk Megat Zulkarnain Omardin was {{dissatisfied}} {{with what he}} said was an unfair ruling by the event's chairman of the jury in the semifinal match between Mohd Fauzi Khalid of Malaysia and Muhd Nur Alfian Juma'en of Singapore, the host nation. At the final moments of the last round, Muhd Nur Alfian made a controversial drop on Mohd Fauzi which was later deemed to be valid after consultation with the chairman as well as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> of five jury members. Megat Zulkarnain said that after watching video replays of the drop, the drop should not have counted as Mohd Fauzi was pulled down instead of being dropped legally according to the regulations, and thus Malaysia should have won the match instead. He felt that the eventual decision to award the match to Singapore's Muhd Nur Alfian was just so as to maintain the dignity of the home nation's pencak silat, which was widely criticized by many nations.|$|E

After seven BAFTA Award nominations for [...] "Best Entertainment Performance", he finally won the award in 2003, defeating fellow Have I Got News for You star Angus Deayton, {{who had been}} dismissed from the show the previous October. He has since been nominated for a further three awards – a total of eleven nominations – including a nomination for his travel documentary Paul Merton in China.

2500|$|The last Holden to {{wear the}} Kingswood badge {{was one of the}} {{variants}} of the WB series utility released in 1980. Although the WA and WB projects at Holden were meant to have resulted in all-new full-size cars, the 1973 fuel crisis and cost-cutting meant the scope of changes became more limited each time. Eventually, the WB project was condensed into a major upgrade of the luxury Statesman models and a facelift of the HZ-series commercial models with new headlights, tail lights, grilles and the updated Holden [...] "Blue" [...] six-cylinder engine (4.2-litre V8 optional). The Kingswood was now available on utility only <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> van joining the One Tonner, but the 5.0-litre V8 engine was no longer officially offered as an available performance option although some were built. There were no passenger car versions of the Kingswood, their place in the Holden range having been absorbed by the Commodore. Production of the entire WB-series finished in 1984 when Holden announced they were vacating local production of large luxury and commercial vehicles—due to economics—to concentrate on their medium car range, i.e. Camira and Commodore, and imported Isuzu commercial product.|$|E
2500|$|The judging {{panel has}} also varied {{considerably}} {{in size and}} composition over {{the run of the}} series. Typically a season has 2–3 permanent judges with an additional 1–2 guest judges for most episodes, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>panel</b> ballooning up to six to nine members for Vegas Week and the finale. [...] Executive producer Nigel Lythgoe is the only permanent judge on the panel for all of the seasons. Other permanent judges have included ballroom specialist Mary Murphy, film director and choreographer Adam Shankman and contemporary choreographer Mia Michaels. Guest judge positions are typically filled by choreographers who work regularly on the show—though choreographers will never develop routines for an episode on which they judge—who in rare cases may also be former contestants themselves, and by iconic names from the entertainment industry. [...] Guest judges for the show have included: Debbie Allen, Christina Applegate, Robin Antin, Toni Basil, Cicely Bradley, Kristin Chenoweth, Alex Da Silva, Ellen DeGeneres, Tyce Diorio, Joey Dowling, Napoleon and Tabitha D'umo, Carmen Electra, Brian Friedman, Jean-Marc Généreux, Jason Gilkison, Neil Patrick Harris, Hi-Hat, Katie Holmes, Dan Karaty, Lady Gaga, Carly Rae Jepsen, Lil' C, Rob Marshall, Mandy Moore, Megan Mullally, Kenny Ortega, Toni Redpath, Debbie Reynolds, Wade Robson, Doriana Sanchez, Shane Sparks, Sonya Tayeh, Olisa Thompson, Stacey Tookey, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Travis Wall. [...] In earlier seasons, the judges decided on eliminations until around week five of the competitive phase of the show, but in seasons seven through nine the judges decided the eliminations until week seven. Beginning with the twelfth season, Paula Abdul and Jason Derulo joined Lythgoe as permanent judges. For the thirteenth season, 13-year-old dancer Maddie Ziegler joined the panel as a fourth judge. Season Fourteen has seen the departure of Abdul, Derulo, and Ziegler from their season-long positions of the judges panel, but introduction of Vanessa Hudgens and the return of Mary Murphy to her seat.|$|E
