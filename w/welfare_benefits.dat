In 1966 and again in 1968, activists within the ACLU encouraged the organization to adopt a policy overhauling the welfare system, and guaranteeing low-income families a baseline income; but the ACLU board did not approve the proposals. The ACLU {{played a key role}} in the 1968 King v. Smith decision, where the Supreme Court ruled that <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> for children could not be denied by a state simply because the mother cohabited with a boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Alex Wiens (Russian: Алекс Винс, {{also known}} as Alexander Wiens) was born in 1980 in Perm, Russia. After leaving school, he {{completed}} a vocational training programme as a warehouseman. In 1999, after a medical examination for conscription, Wiens was exempted from compulsory military service in the Russian armed forces; it was stated that Wiens probably had suffered from a severe and chronic psychosis. In 2003, he immigrated to Germany and gained German citizenship {{as a result of}} his ethnic origin. In Germany, he worked as a builder and caretaker, but had been living on <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> for the long-term unemployed at the time of the murder. In November 2009, at the time of sentencing, Wiens was 28 years old, unmarried and without children.|$|E
30|$|The <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> {{is paid to}} needy {{households}} {{with at least one}} member between 15 and 64  years of age who is capable of working and whose income is insufficient to maintain the legally defined minimum income level of the household. Hence, eligibility does not depend on unemployment and a significant number of persons receive the benefits in addition to their wage income. We, therefore, focus in our empirical analysis on transitions between four different labour market states: <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt, <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt while having a job, inactivity and employment.|$|R

5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Carmen Velazquez lost <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> {{from the}} {{government}} under {{the provisions of the}} Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Act (TANF). An attorney from an LSC grantee, Bronx Legal Services, litigated her claim. Bronx Legal Services, on behalf of Velazquez, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking a declaration that the provision of the act prohibiting challenges to existing welfare law was unconstitutional under the First Amendment. It argued {{that there was no way}} to help Velazquez without challenging the welfare system itself, and sought to challenge the provisions of TANF under which Velazquez lost her benefits; a challenge they could not make due to the 1996 restrictions. The district court denied an injunction.|$|E
5|$|In August 2005, Glover {{was sentenced}} to 240 hours {{community}} service by St Helens magistrates after admitting claiming £14,831 in <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> between August 2002 and November 2004 while posing for newspapers and magazines. She stated {{that she did not}} know the small and irregular earnings would make a difference to her benefits, and that she had been sometimes too depressed to leave her flat. While performing the community service in 2006, she was assaulted twice by a group of girls, one attack leaving her with a broken nose. This cost her a month of modelling work, and contributed to her depression, but also to her taking kickboxing classes to learn to defend herself.|$|E
30|$|Being {{inactive}} in t− 1 {{compared to}} being employed is, on average, associated with a one percentage points higher probability to move into <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt (11.6 vs. 10.2 percentage points), when using the self-reported welfare measure from the PASS survey data. State dependence in inactivity {{is estimated to be}} approximately 3 percentage points smaller (27.5 vs 30.9 percentage points), and the probability to exit from inactivity into employment is approximately 2 percentage points (39.4 vs 41.8 percentage points) lower when using the PASS survey data. The major explanation for this finding is that <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients without employment are coded as inactive when they do not report that their household receives benefits. Since some of these underreporting <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients state in the next period that they do receive benefits, we see a slightly higher probability to move into <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt and a lower probability to stay in inactivity.|$|R

Kouao was attending her brother's funeral in the Ivory Coast when she visited the Climbié family in October 1998.

Victoria Climbié was apparently happy to be chosen, and although her parents had met Kouao only a few times, they were satisfied with the arrangements.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules {{for oil and gas}} pipelines, because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked a bill that would provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explores the welfare recipients' experiences of {{and attitudes toward}} the <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> system in Hong Kong. A sample of 19 welfare recipients from six main recipient groups was interviewed, some twice. This study finds that the recipients have strong aspirations to exit the <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> system. The <b>welfare</b> application process is painful; they are strongly stigmatized; {{they do not have}} sufficient resources to meet many of their expected needs; and, after all, they have strong ethos for self-reliance.

25|$|Most {{tertiary}} education students rely on {{some form of}} state funding {{to pay for their}} tuition and living expenses. Mostly, students rely on state provided student loans and allowances. Secondary school students sitting the state run examinations are awarded scholarships, depending on their results, that assist in paying some tuition fees. Universities and other funders also provide scholarships or funding grants to promising students, though mostly at a postgraduate level. Some employers will also assist their employees to study (full-time or part-time) towards a qualification that is relevant to their work. People who receive state <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits</b> and are retraining, or returning to the workforce after raising children, may be eligible for supplementary assistance, however students already in full or part-time study are not eligible for most state <b>welfare</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E

30|$|To measure under- and overreporting, {{we use the}} {{information}} on benefit receipt available in the administrative welfare records collected in the “Leistungshistorik Grundsicherung (LHG)” and the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB) respectively. The records contain daily information on the <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt until 31 December 2014. In the administrative data, {{all members of the}} core family are registered as benefit recipient. While misreporting is an issue in survey data, administrative data on welfare receipt can be regarded as highly reliable since it is based on actual <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> payments that local welfare offices make to welfare recipients (Eggs 2016). We define underreporting as not reporting <b>welfare</b> <b>benefit</b> receipt at the interview date in the household interview although the administrative data contains individual benefit receipt for at least 1  day in the month of the interview. Underreporting is defined for the month of the interview because the benefit is granted on a monthly basis. Correspondingly, overreporting occurs if we find no benefit receipt during the whole month of the interview in the administrative data, while in the household survey current benefit receipt was reported.|$|R
