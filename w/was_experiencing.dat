5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency. In the most basic sense, this <b>is</b> the <b>experience</b> of the other's body and, in this sense, it <b>is</b> an <b>experience</b> of [...] "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> modified so that what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> as being the other's experience; in <b>experiencing</b> empathy, what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "my" [...] experience, even though I <b>experience</b> it. Empathy <b>is</b> also {{considered to be the}} condition of intersubjectivity and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.|$|R

5|$|A similar {{situation}} occurred in New Zealand, where the song hit {{number one in}} the early winter of 2007 as the country <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> some of the worst storms in its history. During the weather conditions, Taranaki, Tauranga, and Auckland had experienced tornadoes and flooding in the Far North of the country. Once the single was replaced on the top spot, weather conditions throughout New Zealand pacified, although Hawke's Bay was still stormy.|$|E
5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp {{reported}} to The New York Times that he was taken out of the lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E
30|$|For {{the second}} experiment, having already {{established}} that OT {{can serve as}} a reliable online proxy in healthy participants, we focused more directly on the categorical denials that disownership experiences occur. This time participants were advised as regards the phenomena under investigation and instructed to indicate OT for both ownership and disownership experiences. Again, ownership and disownership <b>were</b> <b>experienced</b> more quickly when stroking was synchronous than when it was not, and the more quickly ownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced</b> the more quickly disownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced.</b> Furthermore, rapidity of onset for both correlated with the experienced strength of the illusions. Thus, consistent with our conjecture, it seems that for standard versions of the RHI ownership and disownership might be intrinsically related: the degree to which ownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the rubber hand, disownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the biological hand. When the OT and the questionnaire data were conjoined, they augmented support for the view that disownership experiences do occur.|$|R

If the coefficient of output elasticity is greater than 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> increasing returns to scale. If the coefficient is less than 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> decreasing returns to scale. If the coefficient is 1, then production <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> constant returns to scale. Note that returns to scale may change as the level of production changes.|$|R

5|$|The monastery {{was founded}} by Merek Lama Lodre Gyamsto in 1680-81 {{at the behest of}} the 5th Dalai Lama, who was his contemporary. When Merek Lama <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> {{difficulties}} in building the monastery at the chosen location of Tsosum, the ancient name for Tawang, the 5th Dalai Lama issued directives to the people of the area to provide him all help. To fix the perimeter of the Dzong, the Dalai Lama had also given a ball of yarn, the length of which was to form the limit of the monastery.|$|E

5|$|With {{the army}} revitalized, Saint-Just {{returned}} briefly to Paris where his success was applauded. However, {{there was little}} time to celebrate. He was quickly {{sent back to the}} frontlines, this time in Belgium where the Army of the North <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> the same problems of discipline and organization. Again he delivered results ruthlessly and effectively, but after less than a month the mission was cut short. As Paris convulsed in political violence, his assistance was required by Robespierre.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would {{be turned over to the}} Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong had {{recovered}} from severe heart {{problems in the}} late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> rapidly declining health. By 1985 this was common knowledge among church members as the 93-year-old preacher had not been seen in public for several months. According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him {{in the event of}} his death. It was also announced by Armstrong in a letter to members of the church. Armstrong died on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming his successor.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1990s, Philadelphia <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> a {{condominium}} boom, with more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings being converted into rental and condominium apartments between 1998 and 2004. With the residential market in Center City growing, P Associates found financing by going into a partnership with real estate firm Boston Financial to fund its planned residential tower. Around the same time, the Barton Group ended its intentions with the site and sold its interest in the property to P Associates and Boston Financial. The tower announced by P Associates and Boston Financial would be a 300-unit luxury rental tower called St. James Court, named after an adjacent street. The high-rise would still incorporate the preservation efforts for the 19th-century buildings it agreed to in 1995.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1975 season, Pryce's future was subject to much speculation. Rumour linked him with a drive at Lotus, the team run by Colin Chapman, who had been keeping an eye on Pryce's {{progress}} throughout 1973 and 1974. At the time, Lotus <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> financial difficulties and reports suggested that Shadow and Lotus would swap Pryce and Swede Ronnie Peterson. The trade was viewed as a good acquisition for both teams, as Pryce was considered a driver of the same ability as Peterson, but would cost Lotus less, while Peterson could attract sponsorship to the relatively new Shadow team. The deal never materialised, although Shadow team manager Alan Rees claims that it came very close to being completed.|$|E

Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete {{effectively}} in the calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E
5|$|During their {{dealings}} with the Nausets over the release of John Billington, the Pilgrims learned of troubles that Massasoit <b>was</b> <b>experiencing.</b> Massasoit, Squanto, and several other Wampanoags had been captured by Corbitant, sachem of the Narragansett tribe. A party of ten men {{under the leadership of}} Myles Standish set out to find and execute Corbitant. While hunting for Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging their loyalty to King James.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{began working}} on The Dry Salvages during World War II {{at a time when}} London <b>was</b> <b>experiencing</b> air-raids near the end of 1940. During the time, he moved around often and spent his time writing mostly lectures or tiny poems. However, he was able to find time to work on the third poem that would become part of the Four Quartets: Eliot envisioned that Burnt Norton, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and a fourth, yet uncreated poem would be united in a set. Eliot wrote the poem quickly and sent the first draft off on 1 January 1941 to John Hayward. After Hayward {{received}} the draft, the two began corresponding about corrections and alterations to the poem. Geoffrey Faber joined in and then the poem was soon finished. It was published in the February 1941 issue of the New English Weekly.|$|E
