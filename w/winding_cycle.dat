At the start of the <b>winding</b> <b>cycle,</b> power applied to winding motor is gradually increased and mechanical brake released. The cages accelerate then maintain a speed of 6 m/s until the cages approach the ends of the shaft. During deceleration, generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a mechanical brake.|$|E
40|$|At Uppsala {{university}} {{scientists have}} {{during the last}} years developed and built wave energy converters. This project is called "Lysekilsprojektet". The development has come so far that they are currently investigating how to gain profit in a mass production. For that reason they want to automate as many steps in the production as possible. The winding of the stator is one part that is being automated using industry robots. The stator is cable wound unlike many other generators. The stator consists of many thin stator sheets that have been stacked. These stator sheets have cable slots where the cables pass through. This {{can lead to the}} cable getting stuck during winding. To avoid this the shape of the cable end has to be changed. This report investigates methods to automate the process of preparing the cable end. Experiments show how the cable insulation acts when heated and cooled. Different methods are tested to see how the insulation can be pulled out and reshaped. The methods presented have showed good results and are worth to continue to develop. The results have achieved the set requirements. The project leader has shown interest to build the presented concept tools. This report also shows {{that it is possible to}} save three hours and 40 minutes per complete stator winding by using a separate robot to carry out the preparation instead of the winding robots. This could reduce about 20 % of the total <b>winding</b> <b>cycle.</b> If this preparation were to be carried out manually it would take about five hours and ten minutes for each stator...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} model is presented which investigates the dynamic response {{of a deep}} mine hoisting cable system during a <b>winding</b> <b>cycle.</b> The response, namely the lateral motions of the catenary cable and the longitudinal motion of the vertical rope with conveyance is observed on the fast time scale, and the slow time scale is introduced to monitor the variation of slowly varying parameters of the system. The cable equivalent proportional damping parameters, and periodic excitation functions resulting from the cross-over cable motion on the winder drum are identified. Subsequently, the model is solved numerically using parameters of a double-drum multi-rope system. Since the system eigenvalues are widely spread {{and the problem is}} of stiff nature, the numerical simulation is conducted using a stiff solver. The results of the simulation demonstrate various transient non-linear resonance phenomena arising in the system during the wind. The nominal ascending cycle simulation results reveal adverse dynamic behaviour of the catenary largely due to the autoparametric interactions between the in- and out-of-plane modes. Principal parametric resonances of the lateral modes also occur, and conditions for autoparametric interactions between the lateral and longitudinal modes arise. Additionally, a transition through a number of primary longitudinal resonances takes place during the wind. The adverse dynamic motions in the system promote large oscillations in the cable tension which must be considered significant with respect to fatigue of the cable. It is noted that a small change in the winding velocity may cause large changes in the dynamic response due to the resonance region shifts. Consequently, the resonance modal interactions can be avoided, to a large extent, if the winding velocity is increased to an appropriate level. ...|$|E

40|$|Cable winding is an {{alternative}} technology to create stator windings in large electrical machines. Today such cable winding is performed manually, which is very repetitive, time-consuming and therefore also expensive. This paper presents the design, function and control system of a developed cable feeder tool for robotized stator cable winding. The presented tool was able to catch a cable inside a cable guiding system and to grab the cable between two wheels. One of these wheels was used to feed cable through the feeder. A control system was integrated in the tool to detect feeding slippage and to supervise the feeding force on the cable. Functions to calculate the cable feed length, to release the cable from the tool and for positional calibration of the stator to be wound were also integrated in the tool. In validating {{the function of the}} cable feeder tool, the stator of the linear generator used in the Wave Energy Converter generator developed at Uppsala University was used as an example. Through these experiments, it was shown that the developed robot tool design could be used to achieve automated robotized cable winding. These results also complied with the cycle time assumptions for automated cable winding from earlier research. Hence, it was theoretically indicated that the total <b>winding</b> <b>cycle</b> time for one Uppsala University Wave Energy Converter stator could be reduced from about 80 h for manual winding with four personnel to less than 20 h in a fully developed cable winding robot cell. The same robot tool and winding automation could also be used, with minor adjustments, for other stator designs...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{theories}} of the solar cycle and of coronal heating strongly suggest that solar cycle variations of different quantities (i. e., sunspots, coronal green line, etc.) {{ought not to be}} expected to be in phase with one another. In agreement with this notion it is noted that the shape of the corona typical of a 'maximum' eclipse occurs 1. 5 yr before sunspot maximum, compared with 2 yr as might be expected from Leighton's 'standard' model. Further, it is argued that the phase of the solar <b>wind</b> <b>cycle</b> can be determined from geomagnetic observations. Using this phase, a solar cycle variation of 100 km/sec in the solar wind velocity and 1 gamma in the magnetic field intensity becomes apparent. In general, the solar <b>wind</b> <b>cycle</b> lags behind the coronal-eclipse-form cycle by 3 yr, compared with the 2 yr that might be expected from model calculations...|$|R

50|$|Normally moving counter-clockwise, in {{the winter}} the Indian Ocean gyre reverses {{direction}} due to the seasonal winds of the South Asian Monsoon. In the summer, the land is warmer than the ocean, so surface winds blow from the ocean to the land. However, during the winter, these temperatures reverse, making the winds blow from the land to the ocean. Because most of the air pressure gradient is retained behind the Tibetan plateau, air pressure gradients over the Indian Ocean and the gyre are small. This results in winds of moderate strength, due to the protection from the full force winds blowing off the Mongolian high pressure region. Because of these moderate, dry winds, the Winter Monsoon season in the Indian Ocean region is the dry season for most of Southern Asia. Due to this seasonal <b>wind</b> <b>cycle,</b> the currents of the Indian Ocean, which make up the Indian Ocean gyre, are directly affected, causing reversal.|$|R

40|$|The South American Low-level jet (SALLJ) is a wind maximum {{within the}} lower {{troposphere}} {{just east of}} the Andes. It often produces a large transport of atmospheric water vapor from tropical to extratropical latitudes and consequently modulates the spring and summer rainfall events over the La Plata river basin. The SALLJEX Field Experiment, conducted under VAMOS/CLIVAR was an internationally coordinated effort aimed to monitor, quantify and analyze the low-level circulation over a region enclosing the SALLJ domain. This field experiment featured an enhanced sounding network within which pibals and radiosondes were launched during the Austral summer of 2002 - 2003, and about 100 hours of research flight missions from the NOAAWP- 3 D aircraft.

40|$|Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the {{southern}} Benguela are usually attributed to dinoflagellate species, which constitute a regular component of normal phytoplankton populations. Fundamental {{to the success of}} HAB predictive systems is a sound knowledge of their variability. Although the Benguela remains poorly explored in terms of phytoplankton distribution, important biogeographic differences between the northern and southern Benguela, and the West Coast and Western Agulhas Bank have been reported and are reflected in the composition of HABs. The southern Benguela is characterized by clear seasonal trends, and high phytoplankton biomass and productivity during the latter months of the upwelling season can be attributed largely to dinoflagellate populations. Superimposed on the seasonal trend of increasing dinoflagellates and phytoplankton biomass are shorter successional patterns associated with spatial and temporal transitions in water column stratification driven by <b>wind</b> <b>cycles</b> and coastal topography. Understanding the mechanisms that control the transport, concentration and dissipation of dinoflagellate blooms is critical in predicting their coastal impact. For this purpose models of coastal wind-driven upwelling are required to reproduce both across-shelf and alongshore dynamics.

Coastal conditions were determined shipboard during {{two sets of}} five cross-shelf transects conducted 4 d apart, and instrument moorings simultaneously recorded wind velocity in the nearshore zone and biophysical water properties within Willapa Bay. The results demonstrate that estuarine {{physical oceanography}} and chlorophyll concentrations were determined by processes occurring in the nearshore ocean, and these in turn were forced by variation in wind stress.

This water was relatively low in chlorophyll (, 2 mg m 23). As the winds switched to an equatorward direction, coastal upwelling ensued and the Columbia plume was replaced by cold, salty water nearshore. A phytoplankton bloom exceeding 10 mg m 23 was generated on the shelf with its core located 10 to 40 km from the estuarine mouth. The upwelling-favorable winds then relaxed, and the bloom was apparently advected across the shelf to the coast and subsequently into Willapa Bay, where instruments recorded pulses of chlorophyll entering the estuary on flood tides.
