5|$|William's elder brother, the Prince of Wales, {{had been}} Prince Regent since 1811 {{because of the}} mental illness of their father, George III. In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now second {{in the line of}} succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate {{relatively}} frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered {{only a matter of time}} before he became king. When the Duke of York died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> and remaining away for ten days. The King, through the Prime Minister, by now Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, requested his resignation; he complied.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the primary}} reason that {{prompted}} the President of the Republic Dr. Manuel Enrique Araujo, to create the National Guard. A corps made up of specially trained men with modern equipment and uniformed appropriately {{for the type of}} coffee plantations <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to act was needed. Furthermore, it was legally constituted to support its actions and proceedings against the offenders to extend the scope of justice to the most remote areas.|$|E
25|$|His father Waglula {{took him}} to what today is Sylvan Lake, South Dakota, where they both sat to do a hemblecha or vision quest. A red-tailed hawk led them to their {{respective}} spots in the hills; as the trees are tall in the Black Hills, they could not always see <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> Crazy Horse sat between two humps {{at the top of}} a hill north and to the east of the lake. Waglula sat south of Black Elk Peak but north of his son.|$|E

25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he knew <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to put their penalty {{in order to get}} in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
25|$|The path the Ottoman army took is not known. Kritoboulos {{states that}} Mehmed crossed the Taurus Mountains, {{becoming}} one of only four generals to have crossed them. (The others being Alexander the Great, Pompey, and Tamburlane.) However, as his translator Charles Riggs points out, to Kritoboulos all of the mountain systems of Asia Minor {{were part of the}} Taurus. Doukas states that Mehmed led his soldiers across Armenia and the Phasis River, then ascended the Caucasus Mountains before reaching Trebizond. This makes no sense when one examines a map, for both the Phasis River and the Caucasus are far to the east of their destination. However, Mihailović wrote in his memoirs that the army marched into Georgia, so it is possible that Mehmed did make a show of force to intimidate the kings of Georgia from aiding their ally. Or this is further proof that the soldiers in the Sultan's army had as little idea <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> as the hairs in the Sultan's beard.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the quake, the Metro stopped {{service and}} {{completely}} shut down for fear of electrocution. This caused people {{to get out of the}} tunnels from wherever they were and onto the street to try to get <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> At the time, the Metro had 101 stations, with 32 closed to the public in the weeks after the event. On Line 1, there was no service in stations Merced, Pino Suárez, Isabel la Católica, Salto del Agua, Balderas or Cuauhtémoc. On Line 2, there was no service between stations Bellas Artes and Taxqueña. On Line 3 only Juárez and Balderas were closed. Line 4 continued to operate normally. All of the closed stations were in the historic center area, with the exception of the stations of Line 2 south of Pino Suárez. These stations were located above ground. The reason these stations were closed was not due to damage to the Metro proper, but rather because of surface rescue work and clearing of debris.|$|E

25|$|A charismatic monk and {{powerful}} orator named Peter the Hermit of Amiens was the {{spiritual leader of}} the movement. He was known for riding a donkey and dressing in simple clothing. He had vigorously preached the crusade throughout northern France and Flanders. He {{claimed to have been}} appointed to preach by Christ himself (and supposedly had a divine letter to prove it), and it is likely that some of his followers thought he, not Urban, was the true originator of the crusading idea. It is often believed that Peter's army was a band of illiterate, incompetent peasants who had no idea <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> and who believed that every city of any size they encountered on their way was Jerusalem itself; this may have been true for some, but the long tradition for pilgrimages to Jerusalem ensured that the location and distance of the city were well known. While the majority were unskilled in fighting, there were some well-trained minor knights leading them, such as Walter Sans-Avoir (also mistakenly known as Walter the Penniless), who was experienced in warfare. A list of known members of Peter's army can be found in Riley-Smith, et al, A Database of Crusaders to the Holy Land.|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 1832, the British Band entered Illinois once again. Numbering about 500 {{warriors and}} 600 non-combatants, they crossed {{near the mouth}} of the Iowa River over to Yellow Banks (present-day Oquawka, Illinois), and then headed north. Black Hawk's {{intentions}} upon reentering Illinois are not entirely clear, since reports from both white and Indian sources are conflicting. Some said that the British Band intended to reoccupy Saukenuk, while others said that the destination was Prophetstown. According to historian Kerry Trask, [...] "even Black Hawk may not have been sure <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> and what they intended to do".|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{disliked the}} lack of story or its {{presentation}} within Limbo. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com was critical of the lacking narrative, feeling that the game failed to explain {{the purpose of the}} constructed traps or rationale for how the game's world worked, and that the final act left him [...] "more confused than when [...] began". Haywald had contrasted Limbo to Braid, a similar platform game with minimalistic elements which communicates its metaphorical story to the player through in-game text. Roger Hargreaves of Metro stated that the game has [...] "very little evidence that [...] really knew <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> with the game", citing the second half, when the player is traveling through a factory-type setting and where he felt the game became more like a typical two-dimensional platform game, and led to an anticlimactic ending; Hargreaves contrasted this to more gruesome elements of the first half, such as encountering corpses of children and having to use those as part of the puzzle-solving aspects.|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 1999, Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown, Jr. were {{traveling}} on a Greyhound bus bound for Detroit, Michigan. When the bus made a planned stop in Tallahassee, Florida, passengers {{were told to}} get off the bus so it could be cleaned and refueled. After the passengers re-boarded, the driver allowed Officers Blackburn, Hoover, and Lang of the Tallahassee Police Department to enter the bus [...] "as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction effort". Although the officers displayed visible badges, they carried concealed weapons and were not in uniform. Upon entering the bus, Officer Hoover knelt on the driver's seat, Officer Blackburn stood {{at the back of the}} bus, and Officer Lang walked along the aisle of the bus to talk to passengers. He asked passengers which luggage was theirs and <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> None of the officers blocked the aisle or otherwise obstructed the exit, and passengers were free to leave while the officers conducted their investigation. However, the officers did not inform passengers of their right to refuse to cooperate with the investigation.|$|E
500|$|The {{organisation}} {{and recruitment}} of German volunteers was also kept secret; by 27 July {{the call for}} pilots {{had been made in}} major German cities. The first contingent of 86 men left on 1 August in civilian clothes, unaware of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going.</b> They were accompanied with six biplane fighters, anti-aircraft guns and about 100 tons of other supplies. They were placed at Tablada airfield near Seville, and accompanied by German air transport, they began the airlift of Franco's troops to Spain. Germany's involvement grew in September to encompass the Wehrmacht's other branches; Operation Magic Fire was renamed Operation Guido in November. A wide belief was that the soldiers would train Spanish Nationalists, and not engage the Republicans. [...] In August, 155 tons of bombs were transferred from Germany through Portugal. Other military aid was provided. The head of the Kriegsmarine initially refused to provide submarines, but this changed after 24 October, upon the signing of the Rome-Berlin Axis, when it became clear to Mussolini's Italy would do the same. The Kriegsmarine also provided various surface ships and coordinated the movement of German supplies to Spain. German U-Boats were dispatched to Spanish waters under the codename Ursula.|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going...</b> ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The whole idea is that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the game, it was {{revealed}} that the Oilers coaching staff was able to figure out the Chargers' coaches' signs as they signaled the play call from the sideline; this was one reason their defensive backs seemed to always be {{in the right place at}} the right time. [...] "We pretty much knew ahead of time when they were going to pass, and <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to pass it." [...] said Oilers defensive coordinator Ed Biles.
