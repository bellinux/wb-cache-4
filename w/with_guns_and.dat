5|$|Brazil ordered six Jurua-class {{ships from}} Britain in 1938. These ships were {{purchased}} by Britain on {{the outbreak of}} war in 1939 and are described above. The Brazilians decided to produce indigenous destroyers, the , at the Ilha das Cobras shipyard, Rio de Janeiro. The design {{was based on the}} H-class plans supplied by Britain, but <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> machinery supplied by the United States. Although laid down in 1940, the ships were not completed until 1949–51.|$|E
5|$|The {{last big}} {{battle between the}} Colorado-Gila River alliances took place in August 1857, when about 100 Yavapai, Quechan, and Mohave warriors {{attacked}} a settlement of Maricopa near Pima Butte. After overwhelming the Maricopa, the Yavapai left. A group of Pima, supplied <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> horses from US troops, arrived and routed the remaining Mohave and Quechans.|$|E
5|$|An early-war Army {{anti-aircraft}} company (Flugabwehr-Kompanie) {{was organized}} in three platoons {{with a total}} of eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/4s, twelve <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> six carrying ammunition. When the four-barrel 2 cm Flakvierling 38 was fielded in 1941 each platoon had four Sd.Kfz. 10/4s towing the guns and another for ammunition. Later these companies were reorganized {{with a total of}} eight Sd.Kfz. 10/4s carrying guns, two towing Flakvierlings and three carrying ammunition. These are just examples of some of the Army organizations which differed depending on the unit and the period. Sd.Kfz. 10/5s were substituted for 10/4s on a one for one basis. Detailed records do not survive for the Luftwaffe light anti-aircraft units, but they appear to have been organized into batteries of nine or twelve guns.|$|E

He {{said he had been}} at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> has three gunports; the need to support cannon leaves it much heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows {{on the west side of}} the gate are the original medieval designs. Along the south side of the walls one of the twin towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E
5|$|Prior to , {{a flourishing}} trade route for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. However, {{after the war}} began, an embargo was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from exportation. Other than an {{exception}} in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this embargo remained in place {{until the end of}} the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after the embargo was lifted France did not have the quality or quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. The embargo created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way– from the US to Europe– to supply those needed in the war. The lack of feathering on the Percheron's lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> in forward units due to their calm temperaments.|$|E

5|$|The Machias {{community}} expected retaliation by the British Empire, {{and immediately}} petitioned to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for guidance, supplies, and assistance. The Provincial Congress organized {{the defense of}} Machias and remained vigilant. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted {{one of the three}} captured vessels with breastwork, and armed it <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> swivels that were taken from the Margaretta, and changed its name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, the Diligent and the Tatamagouche. The ships' officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbor. The Provincial Congress formally recognized O'Brien and Foster's efforts by commissioning both the Machias Liberty and the Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy with O'Brien as their commander in August 1775. Retaliation from the British did not occur until October 18, 1775, with the Burning of Falmouth.|$|E
5|$|The SSG {{entered the}} complex, which {{also served as}} Abdul Rasid Ghazi's living quarters, and engaged in a firefight in the main courtyard. Militants fired on them from {{makeshift}} bunkers beneath the stairwell. Army spokesman Arshad later stated that the militants must have been fortifying the bunkers for several months. Once the courtyard was cleared, the SSG entered the labyrinth of the Jamia Hafsa building. Militants inside were armed <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> rockets, and some areas were booby-trapped. Some militants had bullet- and explosion-proof vests and other sophisticated weapons. The SSG suffered most of their casualties during {{this phase of the}} operation. In close-quarter combat, the SSG were attacked with smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, and fragmentation grenades. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three SSG commandos who were injured in the operation received injuries from fragmentation grenades. As the fight continued, the SSG came upon a room in which half a dozen militants were present. One of the militants detonated a suicide jacket, killing everyone in the room.. It took several hours of intense fighting before the SSG gained control of Jamia Hafsa, with only the basement remaining to be secured.|$|E
5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the lorry, while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the gatehouse. Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the gatehouse, where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the gatehouse due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the gatehouse from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the gatehouse towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E

5|$|James V {{entered his}} {{majority}} in 1524. He {{did not share}} his father's interest in building a navy, relying on French gifts such as the Salamander, or captured ships like the English Mary Willoughby. Scotland's shipbuilding remained largely {{at the level of}} boat building and ship repairs and fell behind the Low Countries which led the way into semi-industrialised ship building. Despite truces between England and Scotland there were periodic outbreaks of commerce raiding in the 1530s with at least four of a known six men-at-war were royal naval vessels on the Scottish side. James V built a new harbour at Burntisland in 1542, called 'Our Lady Port' or 'New Haven,' described in 1544 as having three blockhouses <b>with</b> <b>guns</b> <b>and</b> a pier for great ships to lie in a dock. The chief use of naval power in his reign were a series of expeditions to the Isles and France. In 1536 the king circumnavigated the Isles, embarking at Pittenween in Fife and landing Whithorn in Galloway. Later in the year he sailed from Kirkcaldy with six ships including the 600ton Mary Willoughby, and arrived at Dieppe to begin his courtship of his first wife Madeleine of Valois. After his marriage he sailed from Le Havre in the Mary Willoughby to Leith with four great Scottish ships and ten French. After the death of Queen Madeleine, John Barton, in the Salamander returned to France in 1538 to pick up the new prospective queen, Mary of Guise, with the Moriset and Mary Willoughby. In 1538 James V embarked on the newly equipped Salamander at Leith and accompanied by the Mary Willoughby, the Great Unicorn, the Little Unicorn, the Lion and twelve other ships sailed to Kirkwall on Orkney. Then he went to Lewis on the West, perhaps using the newly compiled charts from his first voyage known as Alexander Lindsay's Rutter.|$|E
