Selah has as many devils in her as the Gergesene who dwelt among the tombs, I'll be sworn to it; and if she's provoked, she'll let them all loose in a legion to crush me.

40|$|Background: In {{recent years}} great {{efforts have been}} made to clarify <b>what</b> factors <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>more</b> likely that a child will develop mental health problems, and what {{elements}} increase the resilience of vulnerable children, and hence protect them from becoming disturbed. With the increase in understanding about the nature of such resilience comes the possibility of developing preventative packages for at-risk groups. Method: Children whose parents have significant depressive illness have been offered a supportive package that seeks to increase their resilience. This focuses on the child's resources, family education and interaction, and community resources and supports for the family to access. Results: Initial results show the package increases social activity, reduces emotionality and helps families become more flexible. Conclusion: Helping children reduce their risk of developing mental health problems is rightly an area of growing importance. This package is a potentially successful way of achieving this by promoting their resilience...|$|R

40|$|Chromium dioxide (CrO 2) {{offers a}} rare example of {{metallic}} ferromagnetism among stoichiometric transition-metal oxides. <b>What</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> even <b>more</b> remarkable is the half-metallic electronic structure. Today, CrO 2 {{is widely used}} in magnetorecording and regarded as a promising spintronic material. Nevertheless, the key question "Why is it ferromagnetic?" remains largely unanswered, despite general interest to the problem and practical importance of CrO 2. In the present work we challenge this question by combining first-principles electronic structure calculations with the model Hamiltonian approach and modern many-body methods for treating electron correlations. Our analysis demonstrates {{that the problem is}} indeed highly nontrivial: at the first glance, the ferromagnetism in CrO 2 can be easily explained by Hund's rule related exchange processes in the narrow t 2 g band. However, the electron correlations, rigorously treated in the frameworks of dynamical mean-field theory, tend to destabilize this state. The ferromagnetism reemerges if, besides conventional kinetic energy changes in the t 2 g band, to consider other mechanism, involving direct exchange and magnetic polarization of the oxygen band. We show how all these contributions can be evaluated using first-principles electronic structure calculations. Our results explain the overall stability of the ferromagnetic state and provide the firm microscopic basis for understanding the magnetism of CrO 2. Comment: 37 pages, 11 figure, 5 table...|$|R
