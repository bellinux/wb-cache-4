25|$|Worf avoided Ezri at first, {{confused}} {{about what to do}} about this new situation. Her quick posting to DS9 led to a number of awkward moments between her and Worf, since the new host carried all the memories of their former hosts but had its own distinct personality, despite their shared past. Also, it was considered taboo on Trill for new hosts to fraternize with former lovers. After a brief rekindling of their feelings for one another, they decided that things <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> different and, eventually, the two settled into a comfortable friendship, with Ezri eventually becoming romantically involved with Julian Bashir (who previously had feelings for Jadzia). This allowed Worf to accept 'his' Jadzia to have her place into Sto-Vo-Kor.|$|E

500|$|As Prime Minister, Thatcher met weekly with Queen Elizabeth II, who {{was just}} six months Thatcher's junior, to discuss {{government}} business, and their relationship came under close scrutiny. Biographer John Campbell wrote that their relations were [...] "punctiliously correct {{but there was little}} love lost on either side". The Queen's press secretary Michael Shea reportedly leaked anonymous rumours of a rift, which were officially denied by William Heseltine, the Private Secretary to the Sovereign. Campbell concludes that Thatcher had [...] "an almost mystical reverence for the institution of the monarchy" [...] despite [...] "trying to modernise the country and sweep away many of the values and practices which the monarchy perpetuated". Thatcher later wrote: [...] "I always found the Queen's attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct... stories of clashes between 'two powerful women' <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> good not to make up." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said some other things (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
500|$|Tao {{made her}} Olympic début for Singapore at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, {{arriving}} ranked 26th out of 49 butterfly swimmers. On 9 August, {{the second day}} of the swimming competition, she qualified fourth fastest for the semifinals of the 100metres butterfly after winning her heat with a personal best time of 57.77seconds. The following day she made it to the finals, shaving off 0.23seconds for another personal best time and new Asian record of 57.54seconds. She came in fourth behind her role model, Australian swimmer Lisbeth Trickett, and the USA's Christine Magnuson and Australia's Jessicah Schipper. She thus set two Asian records and the national record for the event, and became the eighth fastest butterfly swimmer in the world and first Singaporean swimmer to qualify for an Olympic Final. On 11 August, she came fifth at the 100metres butterfly finals with a time of 57.99seconds. The top three spots were taken by Trickett (56.73seconds), Magnuson (57.10seconds) and Schipper (57.25seconds). Asked by The Straits Times about her performance, Tao said, [...] "If I have given another personal best, it would not have gotten me a medal. The top three winners <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> good. I wanted to do my best and I pushed all the way and hoped for the best." [...] Given Tao's age compared to those of the medallists, there were hopes that she would be able to improve on [...] her performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.|$|E

2500|$|The {{counter that}} Geiger and Rutherford built proved {{unreliable}} because the alpha particles were being too strongly deflected by their collisions with the molecules of air within the detection chamber.

2500|$|Evan Dickens of Adventure Gamers stated, [...] "The Dig is a {{lot more}} {{reminiscent}} of Myst than any other LucasArts adventure." [...] He said the game was a bit too difficult, with very challenging puzzles. A Next Generation similarly said that the puzzles were generally more frustrating than in other LucasArts games, citing as an example a door puzzle for which the clues [...] "are so confusingly drawn" [...] that the player ultimately must use trial and error. GameSpot's Jeffrey Adam Young agreed, saying of the puzzles, [...] "some follow logic, others just call for trial and error, and yet others will leave you clueless". A reviewer for Maximum disagreed, saying that [...] "with the exception of one or two that <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> obscure, [...] set at just the right level to keep a serious adventure freak riveted (and not too hacked off)." [...] Joshua Roberts of Allgame praised the puzzles, saying there were [...] "only a few real brain twisters" [...] and that most could be solved with patience and consideration. [...] Bernard H. Yee of PC Magazine said that some of the puzzles were [...] "a bit more frustrating than others".|$|E
2500|$|This {{slump in}} {{popularity}} led many publishers and developers to see adventure games as financially unfeasible in comparison. Notably, Sierra {{was sold to}} CUC International in 1998, and while still a separate studio, attempted to recreate an adventure game using 3D graphics, , as well as Gabriel Knight 3, both of which fared poorly; the studio was subsequently closed in 1999. Similarly, LucasArts released Grim Fandango to many positive reviews but poor sales; it released one more title, Escape from Monkey Island in 2000, but subsequently stopped development of Sam & Max: Freelance Police and had no further plans for adventure games. Many of those developers for LucasArts, including Grossman and Schafer, left the company during this time. Sierra developer Lori Ann Cole stated in 2003 her belief that {{the high cost of}} development hurt adventure games: [...] "They are just too art intensive, and art is expensive to produce and to show. Some of the best of the Adventure Games were criticized they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> short. Action-adventure or Adventure Role-playing games can get away with re-using a lot of the art, and stretching the game play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many boxing pundits {{felt that}} an aging Morales, {{fighting}} {{a couple of}} divisions above his best weight, stood little chance against the hard hitting Maidana. However, Morales turned back the clock and gave his best performance since beating Pacquiao. The opening bell saw Maidana jump on the older Morales. Morales' eye was badly swollen {{in the first round}} by a series of hard shots, especially a devastating uppercut, and it looked like the rout was on. However, Morales held his own through the next few rounds before rallying in the 8th–10th rounds. Although Maidana was using combos to hurt [...] "El Terrible," [...] Morales started turning the tide mid-fight, throwing very heavy counter-punches and almost knocking Maidana down. However, just when the fight seemed within Morales' grasp, Maidana took over by throwing combos, giving him the final rounds of the fight. Morales put up a valiant effort, performed better than anyone thought possible, won the crowd over and gave the boxing public another [...] "Fight of the Year" [...] candidate. However, it just wasn't enough. In the end, Maidana's youth and Morales' age and mileage <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>too</b> much to overcome, and Maidana eked out a majority decision victory with scores of 114–114 and 116–112 twice.|$|E

Pacheco had studied for the priesthood, then worked as a crew member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's first ship. He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and {{they fell in love}} and began living together, although as Kathy Snow Guillermo writes, they were very different—Newkirk was older and more practical, whereas Pacheco could barely look after himself. Newkirk read Peter Singer's influential book, Animal Liberation (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just [...] "five people in a basement", as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the U.K., Kim Stallwood, a British activist who {{went on to become the}} national organizer of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.
