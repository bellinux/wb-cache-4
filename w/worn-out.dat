5|$|By {{the end of}} 1944 the HZL {{squadron}} {{had handed}} in its remaining <b>worn-out</b> Macchis for brand new German Messerschmitt Bf 109G & K fighters. A total of 21 Bf 109s had been delivered to the ZNDH by year's end.|$|E
5|$|One {{ship was}} sent to the Mediterranean in 1944 while three others were {{transferred}} to the UK in preparation for Operation Overlord. Between them they sank five German submarines in 1944 with another in 1945. <b>Worn-out</b> and obsolete, the survivors were either broken up for scrap or sold off after the war.|$|E
5|$|We're {{not doing}} stories about a fouled-up hospital. These things really happen. Every story we've told is true. They're {{the results of}} untrained people, {{inadequate}} staff, horrendous costs, <b>worn-out</b> equipment, the demands of doctors. The doctors, not the patients, are the customers; they're the ones the hospitals have to please...|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, <b>worn-out</b> suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after the accident that caused his death.|$|E
5|$|The silver frame {{around the}} Black Stone {{and the black}} kiswah or cloth {{enveloping}} the Kaaba were for centuries maintained by the Ottoman Sultans in their role as Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The frames wore out over time due to the constant handling by pilgrims and were periodically replaced. <b>Worn-out</b> frames were brought back to Istanbul, where they are still kept {{as part of the}} sacred relics in the Topkapı Palace.|$|E
5|$|Varese and Giuseppe Garibaldi were in Tobruk in January 1912 {{while the}} bulk of the fleet was {{refitting}} in Italy. Varese is sometimes credited with participating in the bombardment of Beirut on 24 February 1912, but it seems most probable that this was done by her sisters Francesco Ferruccio and Giuseppe Garibaldi. On 18 April Varese and Giuseppe Garibaldi bombarded the fortifications {{at the entrance to the}} Dardanelles, heavily damaging them. After returning to Italy later that month, Varese began a refit that included replacing her <b>worn-out</b> guns and lasted through mid-June.|$|E
5|$|Her oft <b>worn-out</b> {{and poor}} {{condition}} contributed to her being wrecked when in June 1809 she grounded on an uncharted shoal {{in the mouth}} of the River Plate, whilst seeking shelter with the rest of her squadron from a storm. All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. Recently, the wreck of Agamemnon has been located, and several artefacts have been recovered, including one of her cannons.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 1877 she was accidentally rammed by Thétis {{and had to}} be run ashore {{to prevent}} her from sinking. Reine Blanche was placed back into reserve in 1878. She was recommissioned on 15 April 1879 for service with the Levant Squadron. From 5–16 July 1881 Reine Blanche bombarded the Tunisian port of Sfax as part of the French {{occupation}} of Tunisia. The ship was named as the flagship of the Pacific Squadron on 20 January 1884 under command of Rear Admiral Franquet, but she returned to Cherbourg on 22 May 1884 with <b>worn-out</b> boilers and her hull in poor shape. Reine Blanche was paid off and condemned on 12 November 1884.|$|E
5|$|The {{general idea}} for the {{restoration}} {{was to make the}} locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated boilers of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller boilers built by Dixon Boiler Works. Their <b>worn-out</b> wood and steel cabs were replaced with new ones made of fiberglass, and they were given new tenders, which used the trucks from the originals. Many of the smaller original parts on the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the boilers, the wheels, and the side rods were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' fireboxes were also reconfigured to burn diesel oil. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace the originals.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served {{extensively}} on foreign stations; Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron from her commissioning, and Dresden was sent to Caribbean waters in 1913. Dresden was due to return to Germany for periodic maintenance shortly before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but this became impossible with the onset of hostilities. She therefore operated as a commerce raider, before linking up with Vizeadmiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron. Dresden thereafter participated in the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 and the Battle of the Falkland Islands the following December. She was the only German vessel to escape destruction at the latter engagement, and she remained at large for several more months. Dresden finally put into the Chilean island of Más a Tierra in March 1915 owing to <b>worn-out</b> engines. A pair of British cruisers violated Chilean neutrality and attacked Dresden while she lay at anchor; the Germans scuttled their ship to prevent her capture.|$|E
5|$|In early February 1945, Admiral Scheer stood off Samland {{with several}} torpedo boats {{in support of}} German forces {{fighting}} Soviet advances. On 9 February, the ships began shelling Soviet positions. Between 18 and 24 February, German forces launched a local counterattack; Admiral Scheer and the torpedo boats provided artillery support, targeting Soviet positions near Peyse and Gross-Heydekrug. The German attack temporarily restored the land connection to Königsberg. The ship's guns were badly worn out by March {{and in need of}} repair. On 8 March, Admiral Scheer departed the eastern Baltic to have her guns relined in Kiel; she carried 800 civilian refugees and 200 wounded soldiers. An uncleared minefield prevented her from reaching Kiel, and so she unloaded her passengers in Swinemünde. Despite her <b>worn-out</b> gun barrels, the ship then shelled Soviet forces outside Kolberg until she used up her remaining ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes {{that travel}} {{throughout}} the body in pursuit of invading pathogens. Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, normally representing 50% to 60% of the total circulating leukocytes. During the acute phase of inflammation, particularly {{as a result of}} bacterial infection, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis, and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and: (i) produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines, while they can also (ii) act as scavengers that rid the body of <b>worn-out</b> cells and other debris, and as antigen-presenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1912, Benedetto Brin and {{the rest}} of the Squadron sailed from Tobruk to the Aegean Sea to {{rendezvous}} with the 1st Squadron. The two squadrons met off Stampalia on 17 April. The next day, the fleet steamed into the northern Aegean and cut several Turkish submarine telegraph cables. Most of the ships of the Italian fleet then bombarded the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles in an unsuccessful attempt to lure out the Turkish fleet. While they were doing this, Regina Margherita, Benedetto Brin, and two torpedo boats were detached to cut additional cables between Rhodes and Marmaris. In July, Benedetto Brin {{and the rest}} of the division had withdrawn to Italy to replace <b>worn-out</b> gun barrels, along with other repairs. Also in 1912, the ship had four 3-inch guns added, increasing her battery from 20 to 24 pieces.|$|E
5|$|There were {{changes for}} the 1st Armoured Regiment, and for the Australian Army, with the {{abolition}} of National Service {{after the end of}} Australian involvement in Vietnam depleting its strength to the point where training was severely restricted until it was reinforced during 1974. Meanwhile, the reserve 1st/15th RNSWL and 8th/13th VMR had both continued to operate a small number of Centurions in the early 1970s; however, they were both later re-roled and equipped with M113s, while the later was eventually disbanded. The last CMF armoured regiment gave up its tanks in 1971, leaving the regular 1st Armoured Regiment as the only tank unit in the Australian Army. Meanwhile, the Centurions were mechanically <b>worn-out,</b> and although additional vehicles had been acquired from New Zealand and British Army stocks, by 1972 the fleet was in need of replacement.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{thousands}} of settlers, attracted {{in part by}} the lure of free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, <b>worn-out</b> farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley {{in the western part of}} the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1911, Italy {{declared}} war on the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Libya. During the Italo-Turkish War Regina Mergherita {{was assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron, along with her sister and the two s. She joined the squadron on 5 October, a week after the war started. On 13 April 1912, Regina Margherita {{and the rest of the}} Squadron sailed from Tobruk to the Aegean Sea to rendezvous with the 1st Squadron. The two squadrons met off Stampalia on 17 April. The next day, the fleet steamed into the northern Aegean and cut several Turkish submarine cables. Most of the ships of the Italian fleet then bombarded the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles in an unsuccessful attempt to lure out the Turkish fleet. While they were doing this, Regina Margherita, Benedetto Brin, and two torpedo boats were detached to cut additional cables between Rhodes and Marmaris. On 18 May, Regina Margherita bombarded Marmaris. While debarking troops on the island of Scarpanto in the Aegean, the ship's anchor chain accidentally slipped loose and killed the ship's executive officer, Captain Proli; five other men were injured in the accident. In July, Regina Margherita and the rest of the division had withdrawn to Italy to replace <b>worn-out</b> gun barrels, along with other repairs. In 1912, the ship had four 3-inch guns added, increasing her battery from 20 to 24 pieces.|$|E
5|$|Parizhskaya Kommuna was in Sevastopol and {{remained}} until 30 October 1941 {{when she was}} evacuated to Novorossiysk after the Germans had breached Soviet defensive lines near the Perekop Isthmus. The ship fired her first shots {{of the war on}} 28–29 November when she bombarded German and Romanian troops south of Sevastopol. Parizhskaya Kommuna made one evacuation run to Sevastopol on 29 December, bombarding German troops on her arrival, but spent most of her time supporting troops during the Kerch Offensive in January–March 1942. She fired her last shots of the war at targets near Feodosiya during the nights of 20–22 March 1942 before returning to Poti to have her <b>worn-out</b> 12-inch guns relined. By the time this was finished the Soviets were unwilling to expose such a prominent ship to German air attacks, which had already sunk a number of cruisers and destroyers. She returned to her original name on 31 May 1943, but remained in Poti until late 1944 when she led the surviving major units of the Black Sea Fleet back to Sevastopol on 5 November. British Type 290 and 291 air-warning radars were fitted during the war. Sevastopol was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 8 July 1945.|$|E
5|$|The 1894-S Barber dime {{is one of}} {{the great}} numismatic rarities, with a {{published}} mintage of 24 proof pieces. Various stories attend the question of how so few came to be coined. According to Nancy Oliver and Richard Kelly in their 2011 article for The Numismatist, the San Francisco Mint in June 1894 needed to coin $2.40 in silver left over from the melting of <b>worn-out</b> coins, just enough to coin 24 dimes. More ten-cent pieces were expected to be struck there later in the year, but this did not occur. Breen, on the other hand, related that San Francisco Mint Superintendent John Daggett had the dimes struck for a group of banker friends, giving three to each. He also gave three to his young daughter Hallie, telling her to retain them until she was as old as he was, and she would be able to sell them for a good price. According to the story, she spent one on a dish of ice cream, but kept the other two until 1954. One of the approximately nine known dimes was retrieved from circulation in 1957, and Breen speculated this may have been the ice cream specimen. One sold for $1,552,500 at auction in 2007.|$|E
5|$|For the offensive, {{the corps}} was {{reinforced}} by the 368th Fighter Anti-Tank Artillery Regiment, the 71st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, and the 47th Engineer Battalion, and {{was to make a}} breakthrough on the first day in the area between the advance of the 48th Guards and 184th Rifle Divisions, seizing Yekaterinovka and advancing on Varvarovka and Alexeyevka {{by the end of the}} day. The attack was originally scheduled to begin on 12 January, but was moved back two days to account for railroad delays. By 13 January there were 122 tanks from the army still delayed by maintenance issues, mostly from the corps' 113th and 195th Brigades. This resulted from the Voronezh Front's initial offensive planning mandating that only the 12th Tank Corps would fight in the first attack, which transferred the new tanks of the 15th to the 12th and the 12th's <b>worn-out</b> tanks to the 15th, although it was later decided that the entire army would fight in the operation. As a result, the 15th had much less time to reorganize in preparation for the assault, and as a result of the 113th and 195th Brigades arriving in the concentration areas on 13 January with only between 10 and 12 tanks due to the delays, all of the serviceable tanks were transferred to the 88th Tank Brigade, which was brought up to a strength of 74 tanks. This single brigade constituted the entirety of the corps' armored troops involved in the first day's attack, as the 113th and 195th were placed in army reserve until their tanks arrived.|$|E
25|$|By {{this time}} the M-class destroyers were <b>worn-out,</b> and by May 1919, Murray was in reserve at Portsmouth. She was sold to Ward for {{breaking}} up at their Briton Ferry works on 9 May 1921.|$|E
25|$|The <b>worn-out</b> {{fabric of}} old {{clothing}} {{was used for}} baby clothes because soft cloth {{was good for the}} skin of babies and <b>worn-out</b> material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, he/she was given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as attush, until coming of age.|$|E
25|$|The NTSB {{report says}} that <b>worn-out</b> seals were {{to blame for}} the malfunction, and that the BSCU system contributed to the problem. The NTSB {{reported}} that Airbus had since upgraded the system {{to take care of the}} problem.|$|E
25|$|On lap 24 Narain Karthikeyan was {{the first}} {{retirement}} after spinning on turn 1 and pulling over shortly afterwards. Shortly afterwards, his HRT teammate Pedro de la Rosa stopped in the pits with <b>worn-out</b> brakes and didn't re-emerge.|$|E
25|$|After being {{betrayed by}} Blondie, {{surviving}} the desert {{on his way}} to civilization and assembling a good revolver from the parts of <b>worn-out</b> guns being sold at a general store, Tuco meets with members of his gang in a distant cave, where he conspires with them to hunt and kill Blondie.|$|E
25|$|Lysosomes and Peroxisomes: Lysosomes contain {{digestive}} enzymes (acid hydrolases). They digest excess or <b>worn-out</b> organelles, food particles, and engulfed viruses or bacteria. Peroxisomes have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic peroxides. The cell could not house these destructive enzymes {{if they were}} not contained in a membrane-bound system.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{government}} {{established a}} five-year rearmament program in 1989 to replace <b>worn-out</b> weaponry from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran spent $10 billion between 1989 and 1992 on arms. Iran ordered weapons {{designed to prevent}} other states' naval vessels from accessing the sea, including marines and long-range Soviet planes capable of attacking aircraft carriers.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Snyder began openly {{exploring}} retirement. He {{said that}} he hadn't had a vacation in 18 years and was tired and completely <b>worn-out</b> {{and that it was}} time to go fishing. On July 1, 1923, Snyder officially retired. He was succeeded by another noted school architect Snyder helped train: William H. Gompert.|$|E
25|$|The October 1981 {{timetable}} {{required a}} handful of the older railmotors to stay in service, with two of the unreliable Tulloch DRC and four of the <b>worn-out</b> DERM types. These were run with one of the ex-W-type MT trailers, or if the railmotor failed then it would be replaced with a loco-hauled train using one of each type of the railmotor trailers, i.e. one MT-ex-W and one MT-ex-DERM fleet.|$|E
25|$|In June 1943 the by now <b>worn-out</b> Whirlwinds were {{replaced}} with Hurricane Mk.IV fighter-bombers and in July the squadron flew operationally with them again until February 1944 when the Hurricane was exchanged {{for the more}} modern and higher performance Hawker Typhoon. 137 flew this new fighter-bomber operationally from 8 February 1944 until 25 August 1945, when it was disbanded at RAF Warmwell by being renumbered to 174 Squadron.|$|E
25|$|The Dead Sea Scrolls were {{discovered}} {{in a series of}} twelve caves around the site known as Wadi Qumran near the Dead Sea in the West Bank (of the Jordan River) between 1946 and 1956 by Bedouin shepherds and a team of archeologists. The practice of storing <b>worn-out</b> sacred manuscripts in earthenware vessels buried in the earth or within caves is related to the ancient Jewish custom of Genizah.|$|E
25|$|Tsetse flies are {{regarded}} as {{a major cause of}} rural poverty in sub-Saharan Africa because they prevent mixed farming. The land infested with tsetse flies is often cultivated by people using hoes rather than more efficient draught animals because nagana, the disease transmitted by tsetse, weakens and often kills these animals. Those cattle that survive produce little milk, pregnant cows often abort their calves, and manure is not available to fertilize the <b>worn-out</b> soils.|$|E
25|$|Coil spring {{independent}} suspension features {{by way of}} a MacPherson strut type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel lower arms. Steering uses a rack and pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double proportioning valve to suppress lock-up. Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect <b>worn-out</b> brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday nights Perkins {{would listen}} to the Grand Ole Opry on his father's radio. Roy Acuff's {{broadcasts}} inspired him to ask his parents for a guitar. Since {{they could not afford}} one, his father made one from a cigar box and a broomstick. Finally, a neighbor in hard times offered to sell his dented and scratched Gene Autry model guitar with <b>worn-out</b> strings. Buck Perkins bought it for his son for a couple of dollars.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{impressive}} {{array of}} defenses, Washington was in truth rather lacking in its defensive capabilities. General John G. Barnard, Grant's engineering officer, noted {{that many of the}} troops were not actually fit for duty as many were new recruits, untried reserves, men recovering from injury, or <b>worn-out</b> veterans. Bernard estimated that instead of 31,000, the actual number of usable troops was around 9,600. The Capital was more vulnerable to Confederate attack than it seemed: with around 10,000 troops, the Confederacy's strength was almost matched by that of the Union.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} common rules {{on how to}} treat the flag respectfully. The flag must not be dirty or damaged. The flag must never touch the ground. When the flag is washed, it must be dried indoors. A <b>worn-out</b> flag must be {{disposed}} of by burning (though not {{with the intent to}} disgrace it), or alternatively by cutting it to pieces small enough not to be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including not throwing it into the garbage).|$|E
25|$|Allied {{bombing in}} April 1944 {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} Macchi and Fiat facilities bringing fighter production to an end. With the interruption of production, the Italians were forced to re-equip their three groups almost fully with Bf 109s, largely because the Germans were quick to offer some of their best models, including Bf 109G-6s and Bf 109K-4s. The Allies were less generous with the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (ICAF), and Veltros, including some upgraded C.202s, were slowly replaced with <b>worn-out</b> P-39s and Spitfires, but not before summer 1944.|$|E
