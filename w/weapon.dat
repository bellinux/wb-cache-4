5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear <b>weapon</b> and the plutonium gun-type fission <b>weapon,</b> the uranium gun-type <b>weapon</b> was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler <b>weapon</b> could be substituted. The simplified <b>weapon</b> was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost <b>weapon</b> power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current <b>weapon.</b> Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that <b>weapon</b> type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the <b>weapon</b> is reduced by one. Each <b>weapon</b> has advantages and disadvantages. The player starts with the red <b>weapon,</b> which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the <b>weapon</b> fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E
5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final <b>weapon.</b> A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial <b>weapon</b> but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Directed energy <b>weapons</b> are <b>weapons</b> that emit {{energy in}} an aimed {{direction}} without {{the means of}} a projectile. They are non-lethal and can immobilize {{people as well as}} machines (e.g. vehicles). Directed energy <b>weapons</b> include electromagnetic <b>weapons,</b> (including laser <b>weapons)</b> and microwave <b>weapons,</b> particle beam <b>weapons,</b> sonic <b>weapons</b> and plasma <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} classes of weapons: melee <b>weapons,</b> {{short-range}} <b>weapons,</b> long-range <b>weapons,</b> and support fire <b>weapons.</b> Melee <b>weapons</b> are <b>weapons</b> used at melee range {{and have a}} tendency to strike the body part of its target. Tonfas and rods are examples of melee <b>weapons.</b> Short-range <b>weapons</b> are <b>weapons</b> used at close range and deal damage to all parts of a target. Machine guns and shotguns are examples of short-range <b>weapons.</b> Long-range <b>weapons</b> are <b>weapons</b> that have long firing ranges and are ideal for avoiding counterattacks. Bazookas are examples of long-range <b>weapons.</b> Support fire <b>weapons</b> are indirect fire weapons; they can never be counterattacked, but have limited ammunition supply and minimum firing ranges. Missile launchers are examples of support fire <b>weapons.</b> Lastly, shields can be equipped on wanzers to absorb some of the damage taken from incoming attacks.|$|R
50|$|Non-lethal <b>weapons,</b> {{also called}} less-lethal <b>weapons,</b> less-than-lethal <b>weapons,</b> non-deadly <b>weapons,</b> {{compliance}} <b>weapons,</b> or pain-inducing <b>weapons</b> are <b>weapons</b> {{intended to be}} less likely to kill a living target than conventional <b>weapons</b> such as knives and firearms. It is often understood that unintended or incidental casualties are risked wherever force is applied, but non-lethal <b>weapons</b> try to minimise the risk as much as possible. Non-lethal <b>weapons</b> are used in policing and combat situations to limit the escalation of conflict where employment of lethal force is prohibited or undesirable, where rules of engagement require minimum casualties, or where policy restricts the use of conventional force.|$|R
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of}} the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a <b>weapon</b> causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a <b>weapon</b> increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with <b>Weapon</b> Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} {{an arsenal of}} Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition consumption and effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with a}} hand phaser, a low-damage <b>weapon</b> that automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, a more powerful <b>weapon</b> with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense <b>weapon</b> energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{full-scale}} tests and signing of the test ban treaty, the Air Force <b>Weapons</b> Laboratory (AFWL) was created from elements of the Special <b>Weapons</b> Center. The AFWL was responsible for researching nuclear <b>weapons</b> and the vulnerability of U.S. <b>weapons</b> systems to nuclear attack. Because atmospheric testing had been prohibited in 1963, <b>weapons</b> vulnerability testing now focused on nuclear <b>weapons</b> effects simulations. AFWL’s original mission was to explore the military uses of nuclear power, <b>weapons,</b> andsupport equipment, and to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. systems to nuclear <b>weapons</b> effects. This involved studying nuclear <b>weapons</b> effects through testing, ensuring the compatibility of nuclear <b>weapons</b> with USAF delivery systems, providing advanced nuclear <b>weapons</b> delivery techniques, and investigating nuclear power concepts.|$|R
5|$|Given these shortcomings, any modern {{weapons that}} were {{available}} were allocated to the British Army, and the Home Guard was forced to supplement the meagre amount of outdated weapons and ammunition they had with ad hoc weapons. One such <b>weapon</b> was the Northover Projector, the invention of Major Robert Harry Northover. Northover, {{an officer in the}} Home Guard, designed it to be an easily manufactured and cheap anti-tank <b>weapon,</b> costing just under £10 to produce, excluding the required tripod. The Major wrote directly to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, with his design and arranged for Churchill to attend a demonstration of the Northover Projector. The Prime Minister approved of the <b>weapon</b> and gave it his personal endorsement, ordering in October 1940 that the <b>weapon</b> be mass-produced {{on a scale of one}} for every Home Guard platoon.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, {{almost all}} {{research}} at Los Alamos was redirected to the implosion-type plutonium <b>weapon.</b> Overall {{responsibility for the}} uranium gun-type <b>weapon</b> was assigned to Captain William S. Parsons's Ordnance (O) Division. All the design, development, and technical work at Los Alamos was consolidated under Lieutenant Commander Francis Birch's group.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Maori {{have raised}} the martial art {{associated}} with the taiaha and mere {{to the level of}} a <b>weapon</b> dance. The haka could also be considered as a <b>weapon</b> dance, as it includes elements of warlike challenge to chanting and musical (sung) accompaniment.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>weapons,</b> {{there are four}} classes of weapons: melee <b>weapons,</b> {{short-range}} <b>weapons,</b> long-range <b>weapons,</b> and support fire <b>weapons.</b> Melee <b>weapons</b> are hand-to-hand <b>weapons</b> with a tendency to strike the body part of its target. Knuckles, pile bunkers, and rods are examples of melee <b>weapons.</b> Short-range <b>weapons,</b> such as machine guns, shotguns, and flamethrowers are used at close range and deal damage to all parts of a target. Long-range <b>weapons</b> have a long reach and are ideal for avoiding counterattacks. Sniper rifles, bazookas, and Gatling guns are examples of long-range <b>weapons.</b> Support-fire <b>weapons,</b> such as missiles, grenades, and rockets are indirect fire weapons; they can never be counterattacked and almost always hit their target, but have limited ammunition supply. Lastly, shields can be equipped on wanzers to absorb some of the damage taken from incoming attacks.|$|R
50|$|Native American Weaponry {{was used}} by Native Americans to hunt and {{to do battle with}} other Native American tribes. Native American {{weaponry}} can be grouped into 5 classifications: Striking <b>Weapons,</b> Cutting <b>Weapons,</b> Piercing <b>Weapons,</b> Defensive <b>Weapons,</b> and Symbolic <b>Weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Chemical <b>weapons</b> are {{classified}} as <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction (WMDs), though they are distinct from nuclear <b>weapons,</b> biological <b>weapons,</b> and radiological <b>weapons.</b> All {{may be used in}} warfare and are known by the military acronym NBC (for nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare). <b>Weapons</b> of mass destruction are distinct from conventional <b>weapons,</b> which are primarily effective due to their explosive, kinetic, or incendiary potential. Chemical <b>weapons</b> can be widely dispersed in gas, liquid and solid forms, and may easily afflict others than the intended targets. Nerve gas, tear gas and pepper spray are three modern examples of chemical <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
5|$|In some cases, the <b>weapon</b> may be {{depicted}} as in both anthropomorphic and their true form. While the central icon of Vishnu {{may hold the}} weapons, the ayudhapurushas of the same <b>weapon</b> may stand {{at the feet of}} the central icon.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's <b>weapon</b> was a sword. The axe was the murder <b>weapon</b> of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive <b>weapon</b> like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E
5|$|Jetman's only usable <b>weapon</b> in his laser. <b>Weapon</b> {{upgrades}} {{may also}} spawn around a map, which once picked up will give Jetman various upgrades to his <b>weapon.</b> Upgrades include as a wider fire spread, faster projectiles or higher damage. The player starts {{the game with}} three nuclear devices, which once used will eliminate all enemies from the screen. Jetman also {{has the ability to}} boost, which will temporarily make him move at a much faster speed, although boosts will need to recharge once they are depleted.|$|E
5000|$|The United States Military Specification {{referred}} to as MIL-L-63460, [...] "Military Specification, Lubricant, Cleaner and Preservative for <b>Weapons</b> and <b>Weapons</b> Systems" [...] (superseded by [...] "MIL-PRF-63460, Performance Specification Lubricant, Cleaner And Preservative For <b>Weapons</b> And <b>Weapons</b> Systems" [...] on August 5, 1985) covers a type of cleaner, lubricant, and preservative used for <b>weapons</b> and <b>weapons</b> systems.|$|R
25|$|Hunting <b>weapons</b> are <b>weapons</b> {{designed}} or {{used primarily}} for hunting game animals for food or sport, {{as distinct from}} defensive <b>weapons</b> or <b>weapons</b> used primarily in warfare.|$|R
50|$|Melee <b>weapons</b> are {{typically}} fake stabbing <b>weapons.</b> Melee <b>weapons</b> {{are more easily}} concealed than ranged <b>weapons</b> but require more stealth to employ effectively. Melee <b>weapons</b> must touch a player's body to eliminate them. Common examples of melee <b>weapons</b> are cardboard and plastic knives, plastic lightsabers, spoons, and toothbrushes. Plastic spoons are commonly used to prevent injury from aggressive players. Sharpie markers {{can be used as}} melee <b>weapons</b> by marking on a player's exposed skin.|$|R
5|$|Many of the cannons {{and other}} weapons from the Mary Rose have {{provided}} invaluable physical evidence about 16th-century <b>weapon</b> technology.

5|$|Meanwhile Captain Archer, {{accompanied}} by Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Sato, {{and a team}} of MACOs, enters the vortex created by the Xindi <b>weapon.</b> During the pursuit, a recovering Sato is pushed by Archer to decipher Degra's schematics. Again Archer is suddenly pulled into the future by Temporal Agent Daniels, this time to the founding of the United Federation of Planets, but Archer is again uninterested. Arriving near Earth, Archer receives an unexpected transmission from Commander Shran, who engages and then destroys the Reptilian ship. In the chaos, Archer and his team are able to beam aboard the <b>weapon.</b> A fierce fire-fight ensues, and as Archer and Sato try to disable the <b>weapon,</b> Commander Dolim attempts to stop them. He fails and the <b>weapon</b> is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Production B.1 Victors were {{powered by}} the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 {{turbojets}} rated at , and was initially deployed with the Blue Danube nuclear <b>weapon,</b> re-deploying with the more powerful Yellow Sun <b>weapon</b> when it became available. Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear <b>weapon.</b> A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard {{by the addition of}} Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tail-cone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures (ECM) from 1958 to 1960.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Weapons</b> Division is {{responsible}} for providing less-lethal <b>weapons</b> testing for the US Coast Guard. The <b>Weapons</b> Division identifies, tests, evaluates and develops tactics, techniques and procedures for maritime delivered <b>weapons</b> technologies. Additionally, the <b>Weapons</b> Division provides <b>weapons</b> training and support to both Fast Boat and Port Security Divisions. Training includes various service small arms, such as the M240B, M2 Browning machine gun and the Mk 19 grenade launcher crew-served <b>weapons</b> system. JMTC also operates Fire Arms Training Simulator IV (FATS), which supports crew served <b>weapons</b> training and tactics development.|$|R
5|$|The Army {{wanted the}} vehicle to feature a commander’s weapons station, autocannon, coaxial <b>weapon,</b> and an {{anti-tank}} guided missile system. The weapons suite had to be manually operable when damaged and the commander's <b>weapon</b> station had to incorporate a shield. Additionally, a dismountable anti-armor <b>weapon</b> would be carried on board. The Army also stated that the <b>weapon</b> suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments.|$|E
5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated <b>weapon</b> with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The <b>weapon</b> is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The <b>weapon</b> is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the <b>weapon</b> is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
5|$|The Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank (PIAT) Mk I was a British man-portable {{anti-tank}} <b>weapon</b> {{developed during}} the Second World War. The PIAT was designed in 1942 {{in response to the}} British Army's need for a more effective infantry anti-tank <b>weapon,</b> and entered service in 1943.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{conventional}} <b>weapons</b> or conventional arms generally {{refer to}} <b>weapons</b> {{that are in}} relatively wide use that are not <b>weapons</b> of mass destruction (e.g. nuclear, biological, and chemical <b>weapons).</b> Any armament used in crimes, conflicts or wars are categorized as conventional <b>weapons</b> and includes small arms and light <b>weapons,</b> sea and land mines, as well as (non-weapons of mass destruction) bombs, shells, rockets, missiles, cluster munitions, SALW fuel intrastate conflicts, human rights violations, domestic and transnational crime etc.These <b>weapons</b> use explosive material based on chemical energy, as opposed to nuclear energy in nuclear <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1963, a <b>weapons</b> {{training}} center {{was established to}} support NAS Lemoore's light attack fleet training syllabus. Part of this command was VFA-122 and VFA-125, and it evolved into a graduate level <b>weapons</b> school. The growth and sophistication in <b>weapons</b> delivery established Light Attack <b>Weapons</b> School, Pacific as a parallel {{training center}} within <b>Weapons</b> Training Center, devoted to train <b>weapons</b> training officers of fleet squadrons. The Chief of Naval Operations recognized the need for postgraduate <b>weapons</b> training and {{expressed a desire to}} create a new command and the <b>Weapons</b> Training Center was transferred to the program and it was redesignated to Strike Fighter <b>Weapons</b> School Pacific on July 1, 1988.|$|R
