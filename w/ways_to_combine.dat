25|$|In 2007 Brown {{introduced}} his 10-year , which articulates BU's core values {{in a set}} of institutional commitments and defines goals to be met to establish BU as one of the largest private research universities. Brown committed the University to investing $1.8 billion in the completion of this ten-year strategic plan, allocating new resources to inter-college opportunities for undergraduates, improving the campus's academic and residential facilities, and recruiting new faculty. One overriding goal has been to break down the barriers between the University's 17 school's and colleges that had evolved over the decades and find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> different fields and researchers within interdisciplinary research centers. This philosophy of creating new knowledge from a variety of corners of the University extends to undergraduate education, as well, which has been overhauled to expose students to new fields and ways of thinking and problem solving. This includes requiring course work outside their majors, development of personal communications skills, and cross-school collaborations. That new curriculum, called the BU Hub, goes into effect in 2018.|$|E

During development of his attacks, the developers devised several options for his fighting style, considering different <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> it with his appearance. After considering his design, they decided to allow his movements to be quick and strengthened by the inertia of his body fat, accompanied by martial artist yells and shouts.|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{believed}} {{that the number of}} releases of Guitar Hero games was [...] "milking" [...] the brand name and oversaturating the market. PaRappa the Rapper creator Masaya Matsuura stated that the video game market was growing stale and needed to move beyond games that simply challenge the player to mimic the playing of licensed music. Ryan Geddes of IGN stated that he [...] "hit the wall with play-along music games", and challenged the game makers to explore other <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> music and video games. Analysts stated that such games must continue to innovate instead of just providing more songs in order to prevent [...] "genre fatigue". Jesse Divnich of Electronic Entertainment and Design Research commented that, much like Dance Dance Revolution, Guitar Hero and other music games explosively grew initially due to significant new features from other games but have become stagnant due to focusing on content over features, and suggested that for the genre to continue to grow, they must look to incremental changes as done with the first-person shooter genre. Former CEO for RedOctane, Kelly Sumner, {{believed that}} Activision [...] "abused" [...] the series, as [...] "they tried to get too much out of the franchise too quickly".|$|E
2500|$|Work can {{contribute}} to the well-being of children in a variety of ways; [...] children often choose to work to improve their lives, both in the short- and long-term. At the material level, children’s work often contributes to producing food or earning income that benefits themselves and their families; and such income is especially important when the families are poor. Work can provide an escape from debilitating poverty, sometimes by allowing a young person to move away from an impoverished environment. Young people often enjoy their work, especially paid work, or when work involves the company of peers. Even when work is intensive and enforced, children often find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> their work with play.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{assessment}} can {{be characterized}} as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are {{made on the basis of}} what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., psychological test results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an algorithmic, or [...] "mechanical" [...] fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., treatment response). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm. The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.|$|E

It is denoted that the combination of quantum theory and general relativity requires the existence of discrete space-time. The physical meaning of discrete space-time is analyzed. We further argue that the discreteness of space-time may naturally result in the quantum collapse of wave function. A possible collapse model in the discrete space-time is briefly introduced. A natural <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>combine</b> quantum and gravity is finally proposed based on the discrete space-time and quantum collapse. We argue that it may provide a consistent framework for a fundamental theory of quantum theory...|$|R
