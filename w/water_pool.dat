25|$|However the {{dynamics}} of the movement of corium in and outside the reactor vessel is highly complex, and the number of possible scenarios is wide; slow drip of melt into an underlying <b>water</b> <b>pool</b> can result in complete quenching, while the fast contact of a large mass of corium with water may result in a destructive steam explosion. Corium may be completely retained by the reactor vessel, or the reactor floor or some of the instrument penetration holes can be melted through.|$|E

25|$|Sport is catered for in Dunedin by the {{floodlit}} rugby and cricket venues of Forsyth Barr Stadium and University Oval, Dunedin respectively, the new Caledonian Ground {{football and}} athletics stadium near the University at Logan Park, the large Edgar Centre indoor sports centre, the Dunedin Ice Stadium, and numerous {{golf courses and}} parks. There are also the Forbury Park horseracing circuit {{in the south of}} the city and several others within a few kilometres. St Clair Beach is a well-known surfing venue, and the harbour basin is popular with windsurfers and kitesurfers. Dunedin has four public swimming pools: Moana Pool, Port Chalmers Pool, Mosgiel, and St Clair Salt <b>Water</b> <b>Pool.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with water. Flooding of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a <b>water</b> <b>pool,</b> may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact. Subsequent pressure spikes can be caused by combustion of the released hydrogen. Detonation risks can be reduced by the use of catalytic hydrogen recombiners.|$|E
500|$|The {{state of}} California has further {{proposed}} that between 20 and 60percent of the unimpaired, or natural {{flow of the}} Stanislaus River be allowed to run downstream during the spring to support ailing fish populations. In addition, the minimum level of New Melones Lake would be set at [...] (29percent capacity) at all times {{in order to preserve}} the cold <b>water</b> <b>pool.</b> This would essentially limit the usable storage in the reservoir to the [...] between the cold <b>water</b> <b>pool</b> and the flood-control pool, further handicapping the ability of the reservoir to manage water. This plan has been met with outcry from local cities and irrigation districts, which contend that it would heavily damage the farming economy and cause thousands of seasonal jobs to disappear. Furthermore, it does not address other major problems including introduced striped bass in the San Joaquin River, which eat many if not most of the juvenile salmon and steelhead before they even reach the sea.|$|E

50|$|Weeks {{later they}} {{encounter}} a floating island of interconnected trees. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, fresh <b>water</b> <b>pools</b> {{and a large}} population of meerkats, enabling Pi and Richard Parker {{to eat and drink}} freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the <b>water</b> <b>pools</b> turn acidic, digesting the fish in them. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.|$|R
500|$|A further {{constraint}} is {{that water}} released in autumn must be cold enough for anadromous fish to survive, and thus {{must be made}} from the lower level outlets at New Melones Dam. However, the old Melones Dam was not demolished during {{the construction of the}} new dam (the original dam remains submerged far below the reservoir surface, only rarely re-emerging when the water level is low). The old dam partially blocks the movement of cold water from the deepest parts of the reservoir, causing warmer surface water to be drawn out instead. As a result, in certain years the amount of irrigation water has been reduced in order to maintain enough depth in New Melones Lake in the fall to preserve the cold <b>water</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
500|$|The station also {{received}} an engine shed in natural stone brick. Built from {{mid to late}} 1924, it cost [...] The classic style brick buildings on the station stuck out from the other station buildings on the Rauma Line. [...] To secure a sufficient water supply for the steam locomotives, a new <b>water</b> <b>pool</b> needed to be built at Bjørmosen. By damming up a pool, {{it was possible to}} supply [...] of water per day to the station. This was built by NSB, but was then given free of charge to the municipality who operated it, in exchange for the railway receiving the allocated amount of water free for all eternity. Because of delayed delivery of parts from Germany, the water system was not opened until 10 February 1925. On 29 November 1924, Norsk Spisevognselskap established a restaurant in the station. As one of the larger railway station restaurants in the country, it included an outdoor patio. Åndalsnes Station was opened on 30 November 1924, when the Rauma Line was extended from Verma Station.|$|E

60|$|He seized his scull. Even at {{that moment}} there was a terrific explosion. A stream of lurid fire seemed to leap {{from the corner of}} the house, the wall split and fell outwards. And then there came another sound, hideous, sickly, a sound Granet had heard before, the sound of a rifle bullet cutting its way through flesh, {{followed}} by an inhuman cry. For a moment Collins' arms whirled around him. Then, with no other sound save that one cry, he fell forward and disappeared. For a single second Granet leaned {{over the side of the}} boat as though to dive after him. Then came another roar. The sand flew up in a blinding storm, the whole of the creek was suddenly a raging torrent. The boat was swung on a precipitous mountain of salt water and as quickly capsized. Granet, breathless for a moment and half stunned, found his way somehow to the side of the marshland, and from there stumbled his way towards the road. The house behind him was on fire, the air seemed filled with hoarse shoutings. He turned and ran for the spot where he had left the car. Once he fell into a salt <b>water</b> <b>pool</b> and came out wet through to the waist. In the end, however, he reached the bank, clambered over it and slipped down into the road. Then a light was flashed into his eyes and a bayonet was rattled at his feet. There were a couple of soldiers in charge of his car.|$|E

60|$|A {{question}} of considerable difficulty and some anxiety now arose. It was {{learned from the}} prisoners that the Khalifa, with about 5,000 fighting men, was moving northwards towards the wells of Gedid, of which we have already heard in the Shirkela reconnaissance, and which were some twenty-five miles {{from the scene of}} the fight. The troops were already fatigued by their severe exertions. The <b>water</b> <b>pool</b> was so foul that even the thirsty camels refused to drink of it, and moreover scarcely any water remained in the tanks. It was therefore of vital importance to reach the wells of Gedid. But supposing exhausted troops famishing for water reached them only to be confronted by a powerful Dervish force already in possession! Sir Reginald Wingate decided, however, to face the risk, and at a few minutes before midnight the column set out again on its road. The ground was broken; the night was sultry: and as the hours passed by the sufferings of the infantry began to be most acute. Many piteous appeals were made for water. All had perforce to be refused by the commander, who dared not diminish by a mouthful his slender store until he knew the true situation at Gedid. In these circumstances the infantry, in spite of their admirable patience, became very restive. Many men fell exhausted to the ground; and it was with a feeling of immense relief that at nine o'clock {{on the morning of the}} 24th news was received from the cavalry that the wells had been occupied by them without opposition. All the water in the tanks was at once distributed, and thus refreshed the infantry struggled on and settled down at midday around a fine pool of comparatively pure water.|$|E
