He did not vote on the automobile industry bailout, though {{he said he would}} have voted for cloture if he had been present. Wyden added, [...] "While I continue to have concerns about ensuring that taxpayers are protected if this loan is to occur, I believe that if the President can unwisely provide $750 billion of taxpayer money for the investment banks who took horribly unacceptable risks and helped trigger an economic collapse, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> a duty to attempt to preserve a cornerstone domestic industry and the jobs {{of hundreds of thousands of}} working people whose personal actions are in no way responsible for the current economic crisis." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> no shyness about theology.

Britten's father had delighted his family by reading aloud from Dr. Richard Garnett's TWILIGHT OF THE GODS, and Britten conveyed the precious volume to me. That and the BAB BALLADS were the inspiration {{of some of our}} earliest lucubrations.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} time {{it would be a mistake}} to think that we have any desire to adopt any of their methods or ceremonials.

60|$|When Hannibal {{appeared}} {{upon the}} stage, {{he found his}} country engaged peacefully and prosperously in exchanging the productions of the various countries of the then known world, and promoting every where the comfort and happiness of mankind. He contrived to turn all these energies into the new current of military aggression, conquest, and war. He perfectly succeeded. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> in his person and history all the marks and characteristics of a great military hero. He gained the most splendid victories, devastated many lands, embarrassed and stopped the commercial intercourse which was carrying the comforts of life to so many thousand homes, and spread, instead of them, every where, privation, want, and terror, with pestilence and famine in their train. He kept the country of his enemies {{in a state of}} incessant anxiety, suffering, and alarm for many years, and overwhelmed his own native land, in the end, in absolute and irresistible ruin. In a word, {{he was one of the}} greatest military heroes that the world has ever known.|$|E
6000|$|In Paris, {{there is}} no Cattle Market. Cows and calves are sold within the city, but, the Cattle Markets are at Poissy, about {{thirteen}} miles off, on a line of railway; and at Sceaux, about five miles off. The Poissy market is held every Thursday; the Sceaux market, every Monday. In Paris, there are no slaughter-houses, in our acceptation of the term. There are five public Abattoirs - within the walls, though in the suburbs - and in these all the slaughtering for the city must be performed. They are managed by a Syndicat or Guild of Butchers, who confer with the Minister of the Interior on all matters affecting the trade, and who are consulted when any new regulations are contemplated for its government. They are, likewise, under the vigilant superintendence of the police. Every butcher must be licensed: which proves him at once to be a slave, for we don't license butchers in England - we only license apothecaries, attorneys, post-masters, publicans, hawkers, retailers of tobacco, snuff, pepper, and vinegar - {{and one or two}} other little trades, not worth mentioning. Every arrangement in connexion with the slaughtering and sale of meat, is matter of strict police regulation. (Slavery again, though <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> a general sort of Police Act here.) ...|$|E
60|$|Now, my Lords, this criminal, {{through his}} counsel, chooses, with their usual flippancy, {{to say that}} the Commons have been {{cautious}} in stating this part of the charge, knowing that they were on tender ground, and therefore did not venture to say entitled, but possessed of only. A notable discovery indeed! We are as far from being taken in by such miserable distinctions as we are incapable of making them. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> not said that the Begums were entitled to, but only that they were possessed of, certain property. And we have so said because we were not competent to decide upon their title, because your Lordships are not competent to decide upon their title, because no part of this tribunal is competent to decide upon their title. You have not the parties before you; you have not the cause before you,--but are getting it by oblique, improper, and indecent means. You are not a court of justice to try that question. The parties are at a distance from you; they are neither present themselves, nor represented by any counsel, advocate, or attorney: and I hope no House of Lords will ever judge and decide upon the title of any human being, much less upon the title of the first women in Asia, sequestered, shut up from you, at nine thousand miles' distance.|$|E

6000|$|There is {{the root}} and {{beginning}} of all Christianity,--of all true religion. We are the sons of God, and the infinite, absolute, eternal Being who made this world, and all worlds, is our Father. We are the children of God. It is not {{for us to say}} who are not God's children. [...] That is God's concern, not ours. All {{that we have to do}} with, is the awful and blessed fact that we are. We were baptised into God's kingdom, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Let us believe the Gospel and good news which baptism brings us, and say each of us;--Not for our own goodness and deserving; not for our own faith or assurance; not for anything which we have thought, felt, or done, but simply out of the free grace and love of God, seeking out us unconscious infants, we are children of God. [...] "Beloved now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be." [...] It doth not yet appear what the next life will be like, or what we shall be like in it. That there will be a next life,--that death does not end all for us, the New Testament tells us. Yea, our own hearts and reasons tell us. That sentiment of immortality, that instinct that the death of our body will not, cannot destroy our souls, or ourselves--all men have had that, except a few; and it is a question whether they had it not once, and have only lost it by giving way to their brute animal nature. But be that as it may, it concerns us, I think, very little. For we at least believe that we shall live again. That we shall live again in some state or other, is as certain to our minds as it was to the minds of our forefathers, even while they were heathens; as certain to us as it is that we are alive now. But in that future state, what we shall be like, we know not. St. John says that he did not know; and <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> no more means of knowing than St. John.|$|E
6000|$|May 30, 1885.â€”I {{am sorry}} but not {{surprised}} that your rather [...] remarkable strength should have given way {{under the pressure of}} [...] labour or anxiety or both. Almost the whole period of this [...] ministry, particularly the year and a half since the defeat of [...] Hicks, and most particularly of all, the four months since the [...] morning when you deciphered the Khartoum telegram at Holker, have [...] been without example in my experience, as to the gravity and [...] diversity of difficulties which they have presented. What I hope [...] is that they will not discourage you, or any of our colleagues, in [...] your anticipations of the future. It appears to me that there is [...] not one of them, viewed in the gross, which has been due to our [...] own action. By viewing in the gross, I mean taking the Egyptian [...] question as one. When we subdivide between Egypt proper and the [...] Soudan, I find what seem to me two grave errors in our management [...] of the Soudan business: the first our landing at Suakin, the [...] second the mission of Gordon, or rather the choice of Gordon for [...] that mission. But it sometimes happens that the errors gravest in [...] their consequences are also the most pardonable. And these errors [...] were surely pardonable enough in themselves, without relying on [...] {{the fact that they were}} approved by the public opinion of the day [...] and by the opposition. Plenty of other and worse errors have been [...] urged upon us which we have refused or avoided. I do not remember [...] a single good measure recommended by opponents, which we have [...] declined to adopt (or indeed any good measure which they have [...] recommended at all). <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> worked hard. I believe that [...] according to the measure of human infirmity, we have done fairly [...] well, but the duties we have had to discharge have been duties, I [...] mean in Egypt and the Soudan, which it was impossible to discharge [...] with the ordinary measure of credit and satisfaction, which were [...] beyond human strength, and which it was very unwise of our [...] predecessors to saddle upon the country.|$|E
60|$|But the {{ostensible}} {{object of}} this indecent orgy {{seems to us}} almost as discreditable as the purpose it veiled so thinly. Who was Stephen A. Douglas, that the President, with his Cabinet and the two highest officers {{of the army and}} navy, should add their official dignity to the raising of his monument, and make the whole country an accomplice in consecrating his memory? His name is not associated with a single measure of national importance, unless upon the wrong side. So far was he from being a statesman that, even on the lower ground of politics, both his principles and his expression of them were tainted with the reek of vulgar associations. A man of naturally great abilities he certainly was, but wholly without that instinct for the higher atmosphere of thought or ethics which alone makes them of value to any but their possessor, and without which they are more often dangerous than serviceable to the commonwealth. He habitually courted those weaknesses in the people which tend to degrade them into a populace, instead of appealing to the virtues that grow by use, and whose mere acknowledgment in a man in some sort ennobles him. And by doing this he proved that he despised the very masses whose sweet breaths he wooed, and had no faith in the system under which alone such a one as he could have been able to climb so high. He never deserted the South to take side with the country till the South had both betrayed and deserted him. If such a man were the fairest outcome of Democracy, then is it indeed a wretched failure. But for the factitious importance given to his name by the necessity of furnishing the President with a pretext for stumping the West in the interest of Congress, Mr. Douglas would be wellnigh as utterly forgotten as Cass or Tyler, or Buchanan or Fillmore; nor should we have alluded to him now but that the recent pilgrimage has made his name once more public property, and because we think it a common misfortune when such men are made into saints, though for any one's advantage but their own. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> no wish to play the part of advocatus diaboli on such an occasion, even were it necessary at a canonization where the office of Pontifex Maximus is so appropriately filled by Mr. Johnson.|$|E

Side by side for seven years we had mined, ranched, sold patent churns, herded sheep, took photographs and other things, built wire fences, and picked prunes. Thinks I, neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and Paisley Fish. We was friends an amount you could hardly guess at. We was friends in business, and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> days of Damon and nights of Pythias.|$|R
60|$|A foolish plan, my friends, and {{for this}} one reason, that it is driving out one evil by a still greater one. It destroys the root to get the fruit; by {{destroying}} family life, and love, and obedience, {{to get at the}} communion of saints, or rather at some ghost of it. The real communion of saints is founded on the Fifth Commandment--'Thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother;' and grows out of it, not by destroying it, but by fulfilling it, as the tree grows out of the root, without taking away from the life of the root, but rather by nourishing and increasing it. Now, the ancient institution of godfathers and godmothers would, it seems to me, if it were carried out honestly and really, do for us what <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> not done for ourselves as yet, and bind us all together as one family. It would do all the good which those fanciful philosophers of whom I first spoke, have dreamt, without any of the evil; and it would do it because it goes simply on the belief that the foundation is already laid, and that that foundation is Christ. It says, because this child is not merely the child of his father and mother, but the child of God, the universal Father, therefore other people besides his parents have an interest in him: all who are children of God as well as he have an interest in him; for they are all his brothers, and have a brother's interest in his welfare. Because this child is not merely {{a member of the family}} whose surname he bears, but a member of Christ, a member of God's great adopted family, in the hearts of every one of whom His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is working; therefore this child ought to be an object of awe, and of interest, and love, and care to every other member of Christ's Church. Moreover, the child is an inheritor of a heavenly kingdom--a kingdom of grace--a kingdom of God,--which is love and justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit--all personal, spiritual, heavenly, God-given graces;--and he cannot have them without being a blessing to all around him; and he cannot be without them, without being a curse to all around him. If, in after life, when he comes to be confirmed, he claims his inheritance in this heavenly kingdom, he will be full of love, justice, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit. If he refuses to claim his inheritance, and despises his heavenly birthright, and lives as if he were a mere earthly creature, only to please himself, and help himself, he will not be full of those graces. And what then? That he will be full of their opposites, of course. If he has not love, he will be unloving, selfish, hard, cold--to you and yours. If he has not justice he will be unjust--to you and yours. If he is not at peace he will be at war, quarrelling, grudging, envying, backbiting--you and yours. If he has not joy in the Holy Spirit, he will have joy in an unholy spirit, for he must have joy in some spirit; he must take pleasure in some sort of way of thinking and feeling, and some sort of life--in short, in some sort of spirit; and whatsoever is not holy is unholy, whatsoever is not good is bad, whatsoever is not of God's Holy Spirit is of the Devil;--and therefore, if the child as he grows up has not joy in the Holy Spirit, and does not enjoy doing right and pleasing God, and being like the Lord Jesus Christ, then he will enjoy doing wrong, and pleasing himself, and being unlike the Lord Jesus Christ; and so he will set a bad example, and be a temptation to all young people of his own age, ready to lead them into sin, and draw them away to those sinful and unholy pleasures in which he takes delight,--whether it be to rioting and drinking, or to uncleanness and unchastity, or to sneering and laughing at godliness, and at good people. And that, as you know by experience, may be the worse for you and the worse for your children. Is that the sort of young person with whom you would wish to see your children keeping company? Is that the sort of young person next door to whom you would wish to live? Is not such a person a curse, just because he is a person, a spiritual being with an evil spirit in him, which can harm you, and tempt you, and act on you for evil; just as if he had been a righteous person, with the holy and good Spirit in him, he would have helped you, and taught you, and worked on you for good? But so it is: we are members one of another, and if one member goes wrong, and gets diseased, and suffers, all the other members are sure to suffer more or less with it, sooner or later: you feel it so in your bodies--be sure it is so in God's church. But if one member is sound and healthy, all the other members must and will be the better for its health, and rejoice with it, and be able to do their own work the more freely, and strongly, and heartily.|$|E
