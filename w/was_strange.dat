5|$|Strange Journey {{released}} on October 8, 2009 in Japan, and March 23, 2010 in North America. The first {{information on a}} new title in the series appeared {{in the form of}} a teaser site created on July 16, 2009 for the Japanese Atlus website, depicting Earth with a large hole in the bottom. Using the page's source code and locating an unused graphic, it was deciphered the game's title <b>was</b> <b>Strange</b> Journey and confirmed it to be a Megami Tensei title. A week later, Atlus officially announced the game for the DS, clearing up a rumor among fans that the title was an entry in the Persona series.|$|E
5|$|While {{the idea}} of {{national}} symbols <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> to the Japanese, the Meiji Government needed them {{to communicate with the}} outside world. This became especially important after the landing of U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry in Yokohama Bay. Further Meiji Government implementations gave more identifications to Japan, including the anthem Kimigayo and the imperial seal. In 1885, all previous laws not published in the Official Gazette of Japan were abolished. Because of this ruling by the new cabinet of Japan, the Hinomaru was the de facto national flag since no law was in place after the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
25|$|This {{race was}} held June 24 at The Milwaukee Mile. Aric Almirola won the pole {{in the car}} {{normally}} driven by Denny Hamlin who actually drove the race {{in the car and}} started from the back. As a result, Paul Menard started the race from the pole position. He then went on to capture his first Busch series victory. This race <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> for the fact that only 41 cars started the race, instead of the usual 43.|$|E

25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} to kill me. I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It <b>was</b> <b>strange.</b> I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
25|$|He {{finished}} {{the year with}} just one title, the NEC Cup. An average record of 29 wins and 29 losses. It <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that Cho started a year without any big titles, that it even led to him being entitled the 25th Honinbo. He came close to becoming the challenger {{in all of the}} three big titles this year. He defended the NEC Cup and won the 34th Hayago Championship along with the Oza. Another tiring year for Cho, ending with 47 wins and 20 losses.|$|E
25|$|Laurence Hyde {{had some}} {{learning}} and {{a share of}} his father's literary genius. The main employment of his old age was the preparation for the press of his father's History of the Rebellion, to which he wrote a preface in which he expounded his Tory philosophy. The work was dedicated to his niece Queen Anne: the Queen, whose poor eyesight made reading something of an ordeal, was not especially pleased, particularly since the preface {{could be interpreted as}} an attack on her own policies. She remarked drily that it <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that a man who did not lack sense in other ways should be made ridiculous by his vanity.|$|E

25|$|Racism {{rests on}} two basic assumptions: that a {{correlation}} exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, {{is a modern}} conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the West that {{can be described as}} racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and ethnocentrism... The Ancient Hebrews, in referring to all who were not Hebrews as Gentiles, were indulging in ethnocentrism, not in racism.... So it was with the Hellenes who denominated all non-Hellenes—whether the wild Scythians or the Egyptians whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts of civilization—Barbarians, the term denoting that which <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> or foreign.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the successes}} of his career, McNichol had regrets. He {{described}} Chelsea's decision not to accept their invitation {{to participate in the}} inaugural season of the European Cup as his [...] "one big disappointment", and [...] "thought it <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> at the time", despite the national team selectors' preference for players plying their trade for Scottish clubs, that he was never chosen to represent his country.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the episode}} was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} {{in the first half of}} the series, many of the reviewers mentioned that it <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that Amy and Rory did not comment upon what had happened previously, such as what had happened to their child. McPherson noted the [...] "tacked-on" [...] nursery rhyme foreshadowing the Doctor's death was included, though he thought it was [...] "unintelligible" [...] and did not count.|$|E

500|$|Kristine Sutherland (Joyce) was {{informed}} {{during the third}} season that her character would be killed off, which she accepted because she intended {{to spend time in}} Europe. She is absent from most of the fourth season because she was traveling. She reported that the atmosphere on the set of [...] "The Body" [...] <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> and tense because she had been a regular character through the series and she was suddenly playing a corpse. She found the part difficult to play, not only for the stillness, but getting into the make-up, and lying on the morgue table with other bodies.|$|E
500|$|Like many his {{age in the}} Shamokin area, Coveleski {{began work}} as a [...] "breaker boy" [...] at a local {{colliery}} {{at the age of}} 12. In return for 72 hours of labor per week, Coveleski received $3.75, or about five cents an hour. [...] "There was nothing strange in those days about a twelve-year-old Polish kid working in the mines for 72 hours a week at a nickel an hour", he later recalled. [...] "What <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> is that I ever got out of there". Coveleski was rarely able to play baseball as a child due to his work schedule.|$|E
500|$|Following his record-breaking {{victory at}} the Kentucky Derby, Secretariat was the favorite. In the days between the Derby and the Preakness, groom Eddie Sweat noted that it <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> not having any rumors {{circulating}} about Secretariat's health. Sham and Secretariat were ridden by the same jockeys as in the Derby, Laffit Pincay, Jr. and Ron Turcotte, respectively. Sham was believed {{to have the best}} chance of beating Secretariat. Aside from Sham and Secretariat, Our Native was selected by Joe Nichols, a writer for The New York Times, as an outside contender for victory. In pre-race interviews, Deadly Dream's trainer Buddy Delp believed he could challenge for third place as he had no [...] "illusions about beating Secretariat and Sham." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Virgin/EMI label {{executives}} asked European {{radio stations}} to remove [...] "Who's That Chick?" [...] from their playlists because Rihanna had multiple {{songs on the}} chart. Due to how Rihanna's Loud was released {{at the same time}} as Guetta's album, label executives asked radio stations to favor her work instead. In an interview for the Daily Star, Guetta addressed the song being removed from European radio stations playlists, saying [...] "My record label sent letters to all the radio stations asking them to stop playing Who's That Chick as Rihanna's album was out at the same time. It <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> because normally record labels ask radio stations to play your music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{full title}} <b>was</b> <b>Strange</b> Tales of Mystery and Terror, and the {{magazine}} is sometimes indexed under this title. Each issue was 144 pages long and priced at [...] [...] The seven issues {{were divided into two}} volumes of three and a final volume of a single issue. A reprint anthology in facsimile format, also titled Strange Tales, appeared in 1976 from Odyssey Press, edited by Diane Howard, William H. Desmond, John Howard, and Robert K. Wiener. [...] In addition, all stories from the first four issues, and most from the next two, were reprinted in four magazines edited by Robert A.W. Lowndes from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s: Magazine of Horror, Startling Mystery Stories, Weird Terror Tales, and Bizarre Fantasy Tales.|$|E
500|$|Debbie Rowe met Michael Jackson in the mid-1980s, {{while working}} as an {{assistant}} for the pop star's dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe treated Jackson's vitiligo, {{which he had been}} diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life. Rowe supported Jackson, providing answers to the questions Jackson asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman, who hung it on the walls of her office. According to Rowe's friend Tanya Boyd, the dermatologist's assistant would obsess over Jackson, gushing over him and his traits. She would say to her friend, [...] "If people knew him like I knew him, they would not think he <b>was</b> <b>strange.</b> He's unique, kinky, actually." ...|$|E

Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies, while Queen Latifah read [...] "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by Maya Angelou. The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." [...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ... I just wanted to say I love him ... so much." [...] Reverend Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.|$|E
500|$|During the {{development}} of the series' pilot chapter, Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin's speech patterns, settling for a [...] "slangy" [...] one. For {{the final version of the}} first Romantic Story, Watsuki adjusted the dialogue; in his view, he made Kenshin sound [...] "more as I prefer him now". Nevertheless, Kenshin was concerned about how Kenshin's manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent. Watsuki added Kenshin's trademark [...] as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency [...] "huh". Watsuki notes that he was surprised at how well it caught on, and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series. Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin more 30 years old; his editor commented that it <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that the main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age, so he instead made him 28 years old.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Milan players {{who had played}} in the 2005 final were delighted with the victory after they lost two years previous.
