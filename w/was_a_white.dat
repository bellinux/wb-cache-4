5|$|In 1840, {{in order}} to {{differentiate}} the military colors from the war flag, Ghica adopted a new design for the former: a red-yellow-blue tricolor, with red on top and stripes of equal width. In the center <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> shield bordered with gold and decorated with the Wallachian eagle, wearing the princely crown and with a cross in its beak.|$|E
5|$|The Mingo Oak (also {{known as}} the Mingo White Oak) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> oak (Quercus alba) in the U.S. state of West Virginia.

5|$|The alleged {{motive for}} the {{attempted}} assassination <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> supremacist belief that an African American should not be elected President of the United States. Gartrell was arrested August 24, 2008, and found to be in possession of rifles and other weaponry; Adolf and Johnson were arrested shortly thereafter. In a televised interview after his arrest, Johnson identified Adolf {{as the man who}} allegedly hatched the assassination plot and planned to be the shooter.|$|E
5|$|A long-standing {{problem in}} {{astronomy}} {{has been the}} identification of supernova progenitors. Direct observation of a progenitor would provide useful constraints on supernova models. As of 2006, the search for such a progenitor had been ongoing for longer than a century. Observation of the supernova SN 2011fe has provided useful constraints. Previous observations with the Hubble Space Telescope did not show a star at {{the position of the}} event, thereby excluding a red giant as the source. The expanding plasma from the explosion was found to contain carbon and oxygen, making it likely the progenitor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf primarily composed of these elements.|$|E
5|$|Croatia's initial jersey was {{designed}} in 1990 by painter Miroslav Šutej, who also designed the nation's {{coat of arms}} (though the chequered pattern has been a symbol of Croatia for hundreds of years). Although slightly altered by manufacturer Lotto (the 1998 jersey <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> jersey with the chequers on the right side, like a flying flag) and Nike since its original release, the chequered motif was adopted {{as a symbol of}} national identity and similar designs are used by all Croatian national sports teams.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a 60-inch (1.5m) {{reflector}} at Mount Wilson Observatory, {{observed the}} spectrum of Sirius B and determined {{that it was a}} faint whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> dwarf, the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun's.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, a {{traveling}} salesman named Jack Eaton {{was arrested for}} allegedly assaulting several young girls. The girls' parents refused to press charges, and Eaton was released. Later, he was captured by a mob, who cut him several times and poured turpentine into his wounds. An investigation found that the Scott County sheriff had willfully delivered Eaton to the mob, and Morrow removed him from office. Though Eaton <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> man, blacks were elated with the removal because they hoped it would encourage other jailers to step up efforts to protect against lynchings and mob violence.|$|E

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>white</b> panther <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>white</b> {{specimen}} {{of any of}} several species of larger cat.
