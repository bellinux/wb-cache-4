Following the death of his grandfather in 1928 the <b>winery</b> was run by his father alone. When his father unexpectedly died in 1940, his mother ran the business until the children took over the <b>winery</b> after World War II. The company then expanded the business and in addition to the <b>winery</b> offered wine imports, sparkling wines, and a distillery for wine and liqueur.

5|$|While the {{cultivation}} of grapes and fruit trees supported a flourishing wine industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the effects of Prohibition and a legacy of restrictive laws after its repeal devastated the industry. For 50 years, New Jersey was limited by law to one <b>winery</b> license for every 1,000,000 state residents, which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries. The growth of the state's <b>winery</b> industry has been bolstered by the 1981 New Jersey Farm <b>Winery</b> Act, which repealed many Prohibition-era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries.|$|E

5|$|Irrigation made it {{possible}} to grow grapes for wine. The first grapes were planted at Hanwood in the spring of 1913 by John James McWilliam and his eldest son Jack who had come to the district from their <b>winery</b> in Junee. Irrigation was by carting of water until the irrigation channels were opened a few months later. The first grapes were picked in 1916 and sent to Junee for processing.

5|$|Oregon {{produces}} wine on a {{much smaller}} scale than the California wine industry. Oregon's leading producer, King Estate, ships only 401,400 cases per year and most produce under 35,000cases. The state features many small wineries that produce less than 5,000cases per year. In contrast, E & J Gallo, the United States' largest <b>winery</b> with more than 50 different brands including Washington's Columbia <b>Winery</b> and Covey Run holds 22.8% share of the US market. The majority of wineries in the state operate their own vineyards, although some purchase grapes on the market. Oregon contains {{a significant number of}} independent vineyards.|$|E

5|$|Special permits {{exist to}} allow for the sale of {{alcoholic}} beverages at golf courses, government-owned facilities, and at social events run by non-profit organizations (for example, church carnivals). A restaurant in New Jersey without a liquor license can sell wine from a New Jersey <b>winery</b> by becoming an offsite retail sales outlet of the <b>winery.</b> Since the early 1990s, there have been a handful of unsuccessful proposals to create a separate restaurant license allowing eating establishments to sell beer and wine. Such proposals have been strongly opposed by current retail license holders who believe that it would decrease their income, and thus the value of their liquor license.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not working. The {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the <b>winery</b> to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the <b>winery</b> Greystone Cellars.|$|E
