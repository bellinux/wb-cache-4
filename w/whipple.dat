The Mowry Tavern was allegedly one of only five buildings not burned by the Indians during King Philip's War. It is believed that it was spared because Roger Williams, a friend of the Indians, held Christian worship services in the building. The house was located on Abbott Street adjacent to the North Burial Ground. The entire structure was demolished in 1900 to construct a triple decker tenement house.

The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto the collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern <b>Whipple</b> truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern abutment, so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Whipple's</b> {{endocarditis}} is {{an uncommon}} disease, with approximately 100 cases reported to date. Case series suggest that <b>Whipple's</b> endocarditis usually presents without extracardiac manifestations of <b>Whipple's</b> disease. METHODS: We report 4 consecutive cases of <b>Whipple's</b> endocarditis associated with brain lesions. All patients fulfilled Duke Criteria for definite endocarditis. <b>Whipple's</b> disease was diagnosed through 16 S rRNA {{polymerase chain reaction}} assays on valves excised from patients with culture-negative endocarditis (n= 3) or through polymerase chain reaction and periodic acid staining-positive foamy macrophages on duodenal biopsy (n= 1). RESULTS: All patients were male, aged 56 to 72 years. They presented with mitral (n= 1), aortic (n= 1), mitral and aortic (n= 1), and tricuspid (n= 1) endocarditis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed because of mild-to-moderate cognitive disorders (n= 3) or ataxia (n= 1) and revealed multiple (n= 3) or solitary (n= 1) contrast-enhancing lesions. Cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed meningitis in 1 case. Polymerase chain reaction assays on cerebrospinal fluid were negative for all patients. All patients received intravenous ceftriaxone (2 - 4 weeks) associated with gentamicin (2 weeks), followed by 1 year of oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with favorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: <b>Whipple's</b> associated central nervous system disease may be common but frequently undiagnosed, in patients with <b>Whipple's</b> endocarditis. Because treatment is different when neurologic disease is present (ie, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs doxycycline/hydroxychloroquine), clinicians should consider brain imaging in patients diagnosed with <b>Whipple's</b> endocarditis...|$|R
5|$|The {{technological}} design advances made by <b>Whipple</b> and Murphy, {{in addition}} to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States. The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge, since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords. At {{the time of the}} bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance. These entities provided the desired width, length, and other specifications, and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams. Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible, could span longer distances, and were simpler to construct than stone bridges, and they were more durable than wooden bridges. They were also marketed as detachable and transportable structures that could be dismantled and reassembled. The technology used in the Capon Lake <b>Whipple</b> Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the <b>Whipple</b> truss bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, {{as was the case with}} the Capon Lake <b>Whipple</b> Truss Bridge in 1938.|$|E

5|$|The bridge's <b>Whipple</b> truss {{technology}} {{was developed in}} 1847 by civil engineer Squire <b>Whipple,</b> who received a patent from the U.S. Patent Office the same year. <b>Whipple</b> {{was one of the}} first structural engineers to use scientific and mathematical methods analyzing the forces and stresses in framed structures to design the bridge, and his groundbreaking 1847 book, A Work on Bridge Building, had a significant influence on bridge engineering. Whipple's truss bridge design incorporated double-intersection diagonals into the standard Pratt truss, thus allowing the diagonals to extend across two truss bays. Engineer J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's truss design in 1859 when he designed the first truss bridge with pinned eyebar connections, which utilized pins instead of trunnions. Murphy's design removed the need for riveted connections and allowed for easier and more widespread construction of truss bridges. In 1863, Murphy designed the first pin-connected truss bridge with both wrought iron tension and compression components and cast iron joint blocks and pedestals. Murphy's truss design consisted of double-intersection counter-diagonals, and along with the eyebar and pin connections, permitted longer iron bridge spans.|$|E

The biopsy specimen contained periodic acid-Schiff stain-positive macrophages which did not, however, resemble the sickleform-particle-containing cells characteristic of <b>Whipple's</b> disease. This observation raises two possibilities: either the patient had a coincidence of AIDS and <b>Whipple's</b> disease or Tropheryma whippelii acted as an opportunistic pathogen in this immunodeficient patient.

40|$|<b>Whipple’s</b> {{disease is}} a chronic {{multisystemic}} infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei (T. whipplei). Despite the ubiquitous presence of the pathogen, <b>Whipple’s</b> disease is very rare. <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients seem to be immunologically predisposed for the infection, since they are for example not able to induce a T. whipple-specific Th 1 response. However it is not known, if antigen presenting cells from <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients are able to induce an adequate T. whipplei-specific T cell reactivity or if deficient recognition of T. whipplei antigens by T cells {{is responsible for the}} reduced antigen-specific T cell reactivity. The pathophysiological hallmark of <b>Whipple’s</b> disease is the massive accumulation of T. whipplei in macrophages of the lamina propria of the duodenum that tolerate the presence of the pathogen. To elucidate dysfunction of macrophages that might trigger the pathogenesis of <b>Whipple’s</b> disease, monocytes and macrophages were analysed in situ, ex vivo, and in vitro regarding their phenotype and functionality. Furthermore the influence of T. whipplei and immunogenetic proteins of T. whipplei on macrophage differentiation was defined. For that purpose, blood, serum, and duodenal specimens from <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients and healthy controls were analysed using immunhistochemical and immunological methods. In duodenal biopsies from <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients phenotypically and functionally alterna-tively activated macrophages (M 2 macrophages) were detected, which are characterized by an enhanced expression of IL- 10. Thus, these macrophages can induce tolerance and weaken Th 1 polarisation of T-cells and inhibit the development of classically activated macrophages (M 1 macrophages). The enhanced numbers of CD 163 + monocytes and the reduced expression of HLA-DR on peripheral blood monocytes from <b>Whipple’s</b> disease pa-tients demonstrated that the alternative macrophage activation is not only a local phenom-enon in the duodenum but can also be detected systemically. Functionally this manifested in the absence of specific T cell reactivity and altered production on immunoglobulins in <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients. T. whipplei hsp 70 was defined as an immunogenic protein but was not able to influence macrophage differentiation. Furthermore it was shown in this work that monocytes from <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients exhibited a reduced production of IL- 1 , IL- 6 and TNF and an enhanced expression of IL- 10 after stimulation with LPS or T. whipplei. In vitro macrophages of <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients and healthy controls differentiated similarly and were able to induce antigen-specific T cell reactions. A regulatory cytokine milieu in the serum and the duodenum seems to inhibit the inflammatory activation of macrophages. Obviously, in <b>Whipple’s</b> disease a regulatory cytokine milieu results in deficient antigen presenting cells that participate in the reduced immune activation of Th 1 cells. M 2 macrophages, which favour a Th 2 response, have a reduced capacity to digest affiliated material. An efficient antigen presentation cannot occur without the proper processing of the bacterial components into single peptides. Therefore, the M 2 macrophage polarisation in <b>Whipple’s</b> disease patients and the weak induction of an efficient immune response favour the persistence of T. whipplei...|$|R
