5|$|The liger is a {{cross between}} a male lion and a tigress. Because the lion sire passes on a growth-promoting gene, but the {{corresponding}} growth-inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent, ligers grow far larger than either parent species. They share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species (spots and stripes on a sandy background). Male ligers are sterile, but female ligers are often fertile. Males have about a 50% chance of having a mane, but, even if they do, their manes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> around half the size of that of a pure lion. Ligers are typically between 10 and 12feet in length, and can weigh between 800 and 1,000pounds or more.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} superactinides, the {{oxidation}} states should become lower. By element 132, the predominant most stable oxidation state <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> +6; this is further reduced to +3 and +4 by element 144, {{and at the}} end of the superactinide series it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> +2 (and possibly even 0) because the 6f shell, which is being filled at that point, is deep inside the electron cloud and the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are bound too strongly to be chemically active. The 5g shell should be filled at element 144 and the 6f shell at around element 154, and at this region of the superactinides the 8p1/2 electrons are bound so strongly that they are no longer active chemically, so that only a few electrons can participate in chemical reactions. Calculations by Fricke et al. predict that at element 154, the 6f shell is full and there are no d- or other electron wave functions outside the chemically inactive 8s and 8p1/2 shells. This would cause element 154 to be very unreactive, so that it may exhibit properties similar to those of the noble gases.|$|E

25|$|A wind {{ensemble}} {{will usually}} also include two bassoons and sometimes contrabassoon, each with independent parts; {{other types of}} concert wind ensembles will often have larger sections, with many players on each of first or second parts; in simpler arrangements there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> one bassoon part and no contrabassoon. The bassoon's role in the concert band is similar to {{its role in the}} orchestra, though when scoring is thick it often cannot be heard above the brass instruments also in its range. La Fiesta Mexicana, by H. Owen Reed, features the instrument prominently, as does the transcription of Malcolm Arnold's Four Scottish Dances, which has become a staple of the concert band repertoire.|$|E

25|$|Secondly, {{one must}} {{determine}} the number of days between the starting Tishrei molad (TM1) and the Tishrei molad of the next year (TM2). For calendar descriptions in general the day begins at 6 p.m., but for the purpose of determining Rosh Hashanah, a molad occurring on or after noon is treated as belonging to the next day (the first deḥiyyah). All months are calculated as 29d, 12h, 44m, 3s long (MonLen). Therefore, in an ordinary year TM2 occurs 12 × MonLen days after TM1. This is usually 354 calendar days after TM1, but if TM1 is on or after 3:11:20a.m. and before noon, it will be 355 days. Similarly, in a leap year, TM2 occurs 13 × MonLen days after TM1. This is usually 384 days after TM1, but if TM1 is on or after noon and before 2:27:16 p.m., TM2 <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> 383 days after TM1. In the same way, from TM2 one calculates TM3. Thus the four natural year lengths are 354, 355, 383, and 384 days.|$|E

500|$|On 2 March 1714 Bach was {{appointed}} concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the [...] (palace church), {{on a monthly}} schedule. [...] is the second cantata in this series, composed for the third Sunday after Easter, Jubilate, after , for Palm Sunday and Annunciation, and before , for Pentecost. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, [...] "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of John, Jesus announcing his second coming in the so-called Farewell Discourse, saying [...] "your sorrow shall be turned into joy" [...] (...) [...] The text, depicting the affliction that Christians have to pass, is assumed to {{have been written by}} Salomon Franck, the Weimar court poet who wrote most texts for Bach cantatas of the Weimar period. It follows details of the Gospel and the idea from the epistle reading: [...] "For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfull." [...] (verse 19). The text of the opening chorus corresponds to , the text of the first recitative is taken from , [...] "we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God". Franck contends that this is true not only for the disciples who were addressed directly, but for every Christian. Movement 4 sees the suffering of Jesus as a consolation for the afflicted Christian, movement 5 voices a decision to follow Jesus even in suffering, movement 6 offers the consolation that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> a short time until all sadness is overcome, alluding to (as in movement 4) [...] The cantata is closed by the sixth and final stanza of the hymn [...] "" [...] (1674) by Samuel Rodigast.
