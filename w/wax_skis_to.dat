40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} {{methodology}} for the glide testing of <b>waxed</b> <b>skis</b> at an indoor ski centre, using artificial snow. Two skiers, one acting as a control with unwaxed skis, undertook the test runs over a 50 -m course. Timing gates allowed split times to be measured for a selection of waxes, as well as unwaxed skis. Five runs were conducted for each ski preparation, interlaced with control runs. Unwaxed skis produced similar run times <b>to</b> <b>waxed</b> <b>skis</b> for the complete course, with measurements showing their probable superiority over the first 10 m. A tentative interpretation involves the delay in forming a lubricating meltwater film under <b>waxed</b> <b>skis</b> by comparison with unwaxed skis. Recommendations are made for future measurements, including a longer course, close matching of skiers’ masses and ski sizes, all timing systems accurate to 0. 001 s, a start 3 m above the first timing gate and more effective methods of wax removal...|$|R

40|$|Per- and polyfluorinated {{substances}} (PFAS) {{are used}} in the production of <b>ski</b> <b>wax</b> <b>to</b> reduce the friction between the snow and the ski. In this occupational study of <b>ski</b> <b>wax</b> technicians’ exposure <b>to</b> PFAS and particulate aerosol we have collected whole blood (wb) (n = 94), air (n = 84) and aerosol (n = 159) samples at World Cup events from 2007 - 2011. We have analysed the blood, air and aerosol with respect to 13 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), 4 perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), 3 fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), 3 fluorotelomer acids (FTCAs) and 3 unsaturated fluorotelomer acids (FTUCAs). Further, we assessed the exposure to 3 particulate aerosol fractions (inhalable, respirable and total aerosol) in air. In comparison to a general population, several of the PFCA blood levels are elevated in the technicians’, primarily  erfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorononate (PFNA) with concentrations up to 628 and 163 ng/mL wb, respectively. Further,  we detected FTUCAs and FTCAs in the blood, suggesting biotransformation of FTOHs to PFCAs. The metabolites 5 : 3 and 7 : 3 FTCA were detected in all blood samples at levels up to 6. 1 and 3. 9 ng/mL wb. Levels of perfluorohexadecanoic acid PFHxDA) and perfluorooctadecanoic acid (PFOcDA) were detected in the technician’s blood at mean concentration up to 4. 22 ng/mL wb and 4. 25 ng/mL wb. The FTOH levels in air of the wax cabin during work ranged up to 997 000 ng/m 3 (average= 114 000 ng/m 3) and PFOA up to 4 890 ng/m 3 (average= 526 ng/m 3. FTOHs were not detected in aerosols but PFOA showed average levels of 12 000 ng/m 3 (range= 1 230 - 46 900 ng/m 3). The occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 2 mg/m 3 was exceeded in 37 % of the personal measurements with aerosol  concentrations up to 15 mg/m 3.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the gliding {{properties}} of <b>ski</b> <b>waxes</b> are often discussed and many speculations and assumptions are made. However {{there are not many}} studies and documented results in this field. This project is carried out in cooperation with Olympiatoppen and the Norwegian <b>ski</b> team <b>to</b> research and document the effects and benefits of gliding <b>waxes.</b> <b>Ski</b> base material consists of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) in semicrystalline state. The focus will be on the material changes caused by the waxing process. This project examines two different types of ski base material with three different gliding waxes. Essential factors of the friction and the effects of gliding <b>wax</b> on <b>skis</b> were studied. The Fluor content, both in the base material and in the wax, and the Gallium content in one of the gliding waxes, was, given special attention. Experiments on the ski base materials, with and without waxes, were conducted. Material characterisation has been evaluated by using XPS, ICP and contact angle measurement of water droplets on the ski base materials. The friction properties have been tested with outdoor gliding field tests where the two ski bases have been compared with each other and also a reference ski. A tribometer was used in the lab to measure the coefficient of friction. The content of the ski base material were unknown, there is found that both type of bases tested contains Fluor. It was also found that the Fluor content on the top surface is not directly comparable with the surface energy and the contact angle. </p...|$|R

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFAS) {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of products of all day life. Due to their toxicological potential, an emerging focus is directed towards their exposure to humans. This study investigated the PFAS load of consumer products in a broad perspective. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (C 4, C 6 -C 8, C 10 -PFSA), carboxylic acids (C 4 -C 14 -PFCA) and fluorotelomer alcohols (4 : 2, 6 : 2; 8 : 2 and 10 : 2 FTOH) were analysed in 115 random samples of consumer products including textiles (outdoor materials), carpets, cleaning and impregnating agents, leather samples, baking and sandwich papers, paper baking forms and <b>ski</b> <b>waxes.</b> PFCA and PFSA were analysed by HPLC-MS/MS, whereas FTOH were detected by GC/CI-MS. Consumer products such as cleaning agents or some baking and sandwich papers show low or negligible PFSA and PFCA contents. On the other hand, high PFAS levels were identified in <b>ski</b> <b>waxes</b> (up <b>to</b> about 2000 mikrog/kg PFOA), leather samples (up to about 200 mikrog/kg PFBA and 120 mikrog/kg PFBS), outdoor textiles (up to 19 mikrog/m 2 PFOA) and some other baking papers (up to 15 mikrog/m 2 PFOA). Moreover, some test samples like carpet and leather samples and outdoor materials exceeded the EU regulatory threshold value for PFOS (1 mikrog/m 2). A diverse mixture of PFASs can be found in consumer products for all fields of daily use in varying concentrations. This study proves the importance of screening and monitoring of consumer products for PFAS loads and the necessity for an action to regulate the use of PFASs, especially PFOA, in consumer products...|$|R
