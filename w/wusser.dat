"No, massa," [...] {{said the}} negro, {{with more of}} sulkiness--or less of amiability--than he had {{exhibited}} since they first met {{on the western side}} of the Andes, [...] "breakin' our legs would be wuss--smashin' our necks would be <b>wusser</b> still. But de hosses is not lost. Dey's on'y spunkerblued." ...|$|E

The biddle who kips watch at the Halbany wodn keep misfortn out of my chambers; and Mrs. Twiddler, of Pall Mall, and Mr. Hunx, of Long Acre, put egsicution into my apartmince, and swep off every stick of my {{furniture}}. 'Wardrobe & furniture of a man of fashion.' What an adwertisement George Robins DID make of it; and what a crowd was collected to laff at the prospick of my ruing! My chice plait; my seller of wine; my picturs--that of myself included (it was Maryhann, bless her! that bought it, unbeknown to me); all--all went to the ammer. That brootle Fitzwarren, my ex-vally, womb I met, fimilliarly slapt me on the sholder, and said, 'Jeames, my boy, you'd best go into suvvis aginn.' ...|$|E

Don't ever tackle the desert, 'specially with them Mormons. They've got water on the brain, <b>wusser</b> 'n religion. It's two hundred an' fifty miles from Flagstaff to Jones range, an' only two drinks on the trail. I know this hyar Buffalo Jones. I knowed him {{way back in the}} seventies, when he was doin' them ropin' stunts thet made him famous as the {{preserver}} of the American bison. I know about that crazy trip of his'n to the Barren Lands, after musk-ox. An' I reckon I kin guess what he'll do over there in the Siwash. He'll rope cougars--sure he will--an' watch 'em jump. Jones would rope the devil, an' tie him down if the lasso didn't burn. Oh! he's hell on ropin' things. An' he's <b>wusser</b> 'n hell on men, an' hosses, an' dogs." ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor Pop is {{not very}} high in the scale of created beings; but, if you fancy there is none lower, you are in egregious error. There was once {{a man who had}} a mysterious {{exhibition}} of an animal, quite unknown to naturalists, called [...] "the wusser." [...] Those curious individuals who desired to see the <b>wusser</b> were introduced into an apartment where appeared before them nothing more than a little lean shrivelled hideous blear-eyed mangy pig. Everyone cried out [...] "Swindle!" [...] and [...] "Shame!" [...] "Patience, gentlemen, be heasy," [...] said the showman: [...] "look at that there hanimal; it's a perfect phenomaly of hugliness: I engage you never see such a pig." [...] Nobody ever had seen. [...] "Now, gentlemen," [...] said he, [...] "I'll keep my promise, has per bill; and bad as that there pig is, look at this here" [...] (he showed another). [...] "Look at this here, and you'll see at once that it's A WUSSER." [...] In like manner the Popjoy breed is bad enough, but it serves only to show off the Galgenstein race; which is <b>WUSSER.</b>|$|E

Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I {{certainly}} am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no <b>wusser</b> scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear.

"Aw! {{good for}} the big folks to make money out on," [...] said old Timothy Cooper, who had stayed behind turning his hay while the others had been gone on their spree;--"I'n seen lots o' things turn up sin' I war a young un--the war an' the peace, and the canells, an' the oald King George, an' the Regen', an' the new King George, an' the new un as has got a new ne-ame--an' it's been all aloike to the poor mon. What's the canells been t' him? They'n brought him neyther me-at nor be-acon, nor wage to lay by, if he didn't save it wi' clemmin' his own inside. Times ha' got <b>wusser</b> for him sin' I war a young un. An' so it'll be wi' the railroads. They'll on'y leave the poor mon furder behind. But them are fools as meddle, and so I told the chaps here. This is the big folks's world, this is. But yo're for the big folks, Muster Garth, yo are." ...|$|E
