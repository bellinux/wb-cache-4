500|$|To further {{promote the}} album, Rihanna {{embarked}} on her third worldwide and fourth overall tour entitled Loud Tour (2011). The tour was officially announced on February 9, 2011, when North American dates were revealed. Critics gave the tour a positive response, with Jon Brean of the Star Tribune noting, [...] "The Barbadian singer is more visually and vocally dynamic than {{she has ever}} been before." [...] During an interview with Ryan Seacrest after Rihanna performed [...] "California King Bed" [...] on American Idol, April 14, 2011, the singer spoke about the tour's development. Rihanna addressed rumors about a special performance to be included on the setlist in order to fully incorporate her fans into the experience. When asked by Seacrest about the fan experience, she explained, [...] "Right now, we just designed the stage. I'm really not supposed to say this, but I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> excited... We're building two sections on the stage [...] closer than they've ever been. It's real VIP." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be damned and blasted {{to women}} and all their importances," [...] cried Aaron. [...] "They <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> under, and {{children}} is their chief weapon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, {{you don't}} think it's too risky, do you? I mean, you always are {{breaking}} out at night, aren't you? I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> into a row." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know Ellen rather well," [...] said Cartwright dryly. [...] "However, when <b>you</b> saw she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> alone, {{why did you}} indulge her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't either, Dora. Perhaps Crabtree only <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{away from}} the house so that he can come here and see your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the reason}} I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> down here, Austen," [...] he cried; [...] "that's what I've been telling {{the old man}} all along--perhaps he'll believe you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{should be}} very glad to learn what he means to do while he lives. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> into sympathy with me in this matter;--but it is so difficult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me you don't suspect why we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of our place here?" [...] said the man, looking in distrustfully at me through the window.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{talk about}} those things later, Dad. First, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> away from here, and in a safe place. Then we'll attend to Crabtree, Pelter and Japson," [...] added Dick, grimly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you fight}} him, Tom," [...] said Sam, in alarm. [...] "He only <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> into trouble. He'd like {{nothing better than}} to see you lose your {{position}} as lieutenant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, {{having taken}} away your French bonbons with the {{poisonous}} color on them, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> something better. Here it is, all pure sugar, {{the sort that}} sweetens the heart {{as well as the}} tongue and leaves no bad taste behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so glad {{it was she}} {{who asked}} me," [...] Grizel said to him when he told her. [...] "Don't you see what it means? It means that she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of the way! You are not {{everything}} to her now as you used to be. Are you glad, glad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must tear {{ourselves}} away, Rose, because I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{home before}} sunset. Will you {{come for a}} drive, Jessie?" [...] said Dr. Alec, as the music died away in the distance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Adrian," [...] he said, [...] "I am much {{pleased with}} you. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> into a row, but I should be much obliged {{if you would}} tell me how all this happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{in under}} false pretences, Kid," [...] said Billy. [...] "Of course, {{they may not}} come {{anywhere}} near the office. But still, if they did, there would be something doing. What {{do you feel about}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must do as I ask," [...] he {{declared}} hoarsely. [...] "It doesn't matter about prices being better. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away. <b>You</b> must help me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Boston Globe {{reviewer}} Ty Burr wrote [...] "Unlike many agit-docs, Defamation <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> thinking, and {{it knows}} the epithet “self-hating Jew’’ {{can be used}} as a club by those who don’t <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> think at all." [...] His review was positive, highlighting how the film argues that raising [...] "Israelis to define themselves as a nation of victims...is a disservice to modern complexities — and, not coincidentally, makes it almost impossible to see any other people as victims." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wait a little," [...] said Amelius, {{wiping her}} eyes with his own handkerchief; [...] "and we will go away together. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> some better clothes; and I don't exactly know how to set about it. Don't cry, my dear--don't cry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jill!" [...] he cried. [...] "It's no good. I {{must say}} it! I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{out of all}} this. I {{want to take care}} of you. Why should you go on living this sort of life, when.... Why won't you let me...?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} find it cold there by the sea-side. To tell you the truth, Lizzie, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of this house. I don't mean {{to say a word}} against Mrs. Carbuncle; but after all that has occurred, it would be better that you should be away. People talk about you and Lord George." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. But with you.... Have we, after all, got out {{of things}} at all? I said coming up, perhaps we were leaving our own problem behind. In {{exchange}} for other problems--old problems men have had before. We've got nearer necessity; that's all. Things press on us just as much. There's nothing more fundamental in wild nature, nothing profounder--only something earlier. One doesn't get out of life by going here or there.... But I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> away--from all things that had such a hold on you....|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{there you}} are!" [...] Strether exclaimed. [...] "That's just what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at. <b>You</b> speak of your {{familiar}} volume altered out of recognition. Well, who's the editor?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This way {{is blocked}} for the present, sir," [...] {{he said to}} Sabatini. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past, <b>you</b> had better {{take one of the}} {{turnings}} to the left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is between}} you and Prissy, Emmeline," [...] I struck in, [...] "and I'm not going to interfere. But I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{to come over and}} show me how to tuft my comfort that new pattern you learned in Avonlea, and as it had better be done before dark I wish you'd come right away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Hewson," [...] St. John said, {{with his}} {{habitual}} lack of manners. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> in for this thing at St. Johnswort. I {{know why you}} offered to buy the place, and though {{of course you are}} the original cause of the trouble, I don't feel that it's quite fair to let you shoulder the consequences altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{stared at}} him and her spirit was a {{luminous}} mist of tears. [...] "You old coward," [...] she said in his ear, and kissed the little patch of rough and bloody cheek beneath his eye. Then she knelt up beside him. [...] "I'm boss now, old man," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> to that place there under the rock. If I drag, can you help?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Warn't it queer {{that none}} on 'em know'd you!" [...] she whispered; then {{commanding}} silence by a hasty gesture. [...] "Don't speak; for they're s'archin' still, cluss by, and some on 'em may follow me here. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> {{out of the}} cellar, {{as some of the}} young-uns will be rummagin' there soon for pork for supper; and their eyes are as sharp as needles. Don't you think you could crawl into the mill? It's stopped now, and wun't be goin' ag'in till this stir's over." ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{was after}} seven o'clock, and Walter was {{wondering}} if anything unusual had delayed his employer, when Phil Newell hove into appearance. [...] "It's all right, my lad, don't worry," [...] he said at once. [...] "You don't leave until to-morrow noon. You are to meet Caleb Walton at the New York and New England railroad depot at exactly eleven o'clock, {{and all of the}} others of the crowd are to be there too. The government <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> down <b>to</b> Norfolk as soon as it can, and will, consequently, send you by rail instead of by water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{might be}} better if no one had it on a Sunday,' she could not help sighing out as she looked anxiously along the lane ere turning in, and then said, 'My good lad, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> to be telling tales, but it would set my heart at rest, and his poor brother's up there, if you could tell me he is not gone to Briar Alley.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are only}} wasting your breath, Monty," [...] he said. [...] "I couldn't touch money won {{in such a}} way, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> out of this alive. There's fever in the air all around us, and if either of us got a touch of it that drop of brandy might stand between us and death. Don't worry me like a spoilt child. Roll {{yourself}} up and get to sleep! I'll keep watch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I did!" [...] replied Toby, quickly; [...] "but you {{see that}} was a real one, an' this of ours is only a little make-believe for three cents. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> to let us have the lot between the barn an' the road to put our tent on, an' then lend us old Whitey. We're goin' to have Jack Douglass's hoss that's blind, an' we've got a three-legged cat, an' one without any tail, an' lots of things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those {{two young}} men, Merwell and Jasniff. They were angry at {{you because of}} {{something}} of which I know nothing. They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>you</b> in their power for a lark--that was the story they first told. They promised me twenty dollars if I would aid them--and I never got a cent--not a cent!" [...] added Hooker Montgomery, almost tearfully. [...] "Oh, don't prosecute me! I am down and out! My practice has been ruined--some folks even want me arrested for practicing without a state certificate--and those rascals never came to my aid! And after all I did for them!" ...|$|R
