He declared, [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> Washington {{is someone who}} understands that {{the wave of the}} future is not big government, but self-government". He played with his rock band at the event. Upon his entrance, Charlie Cook of The Cook Political Report rated McCotter's chances of nomination as [...] "virtually impossible". CBS News and other outlets commented on McCotter's lack of name recognition and described him as a [...] "little-known" [...] candidate. Nevertheless, the Free Press noted he had about $480,000 available in his congressional account to transfer to his presidential campaign account. Political communications operative Mark Corallo was hired along with a core group of advisers that included former Senator Bill Frist's chief of staff Eric Uelind, and former Iowa representative Christopher Rants.|$|E

[...] A writer of OK! said that Beyoncé [...] "don an unbelievable amount of cool oufits, all of which <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> our lives." [...] Rap-Up commented [...] "Summer may be over, but Beyoncé gives us another reason to celebrate with the vibrant video" [...] adding [...] "This is one party you won't want to miss." [...] Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine described [...] "Party"'s video as a [...] "fittingly shindig-centric affair." [...] Jessica Misener of The Huffington Post praised the fashion used in the video saying that Beyoncé had a lot of [...] "chic looks". Another writer of the same publication praised the decision to make a simple party set. He further described the video as [...] "a gorgeous boast of her beauty as well as a helpful reminder that, even in these down economic times, one can party like a rock star."

2500|$|Acknowledging the audience's emotions, Kennedy {{referred}} to his own grief at {{the murder of his}} brother, President John F. Kennedy and, quoting a passage from the play Agamemnon (in translation), said: [...] "My favorite poet was Aeschylus.

What <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> the United States is not division; what <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> the United States is not hatred; what <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> the United States is not violence and lawlessness; but is love and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black... Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world." [...] The quotation from Aeschylus was later inscribed on a memorial at the gravesite of Robert Kennedy following his own assassination.|$|E

[...] However, she reversed her position and appeared in a campaign ad for him. Beginning in February 2016, she was reported to begin campaigning for him in New Hampshire, an early voting state. Jeb Bush joked that {{a town hall meeting}} attended by his mother featured a larger gathering than town halls prior to her involvement. Concerning her son, she believes Jeb is nearly too well-mannered, but also is confident that he is [...] "decent and honest, and everything <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> a president." [...] Bush weighed in on Jeb's rival for the nomination, Donald Trump, by her own admission not understanding how women [...] "can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly". She also indicated that she had tired of Trump {{over the course of the}} campaign and due to her gender, she was [...] "not crazy about what he says about women." [...] During the CBS Republican debate in February 2016, Jeb defended his mother by saying she [...] "is the strongest woman I know", to which Trump replied that Barbara Bush [...] "should be running." ...|$|E

60|$|Must a woman {{come into}} our house and {{discover}} that I was not such a dreary dog as I had the reputation of being? Was I to be seen at last with the veil of dourness lifted? My company voice is so low and unimpressive that my first remark is merely an intimation that I am about to speak (like the whir of the clock before it strikes): must it be revealed that I had another voice, that there was one door I never opened without leaving my reserve on the mat? Ah, that room, must its secrets be disclosed? So joyous they were {{when my mother was}} well, no wonder we were merry. Again and again she had been given back to us; it was for the glorious to-day we thanked God; in our hearts we knew and in our prayers confessed that the fill of delight had been given us, whatever might befall. We had not to wait till all was over to know its value; my mother used to say, ‘We never understand how little <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>in</b> this world until we know the loss of it,’ and there can be few truer sayings, but during her last years we exulted daily in the possession of her {{as much as we can}} exult in her memory. No wonder, I say, that we were merry, but we liked to show it to God alone, and to Him only our agony during those many night-alarms, when lights flickered in the house and white faces were round my mother’s bedside. Not for other eyes those long vigils when, night about, we sat watching, nor the awful nights when we stood together, teeth clenched—waiting—it must be now. And it was not then; her hand became cooler, her breathing more easy; she smiled to us. Once more I could work by snatches, and was glad, but what was the result to me compared to the joy of hearing that voice from the other room? There lay all the work I was ever proud of, the rest is but honest craftsmanship done to give her coal and food and softer pillows. My thousand letters that she so carefully preserved, always sleeping with the last beneath the sheet, where one was found when she died—they are the only writing of mine of which I shall ever boast. I would not there had been one less though I could have written an immortal book for it.|$|E
6000|$|Basil Ransom {{lived in}} New York, rather {{far to the}} eastward, and in {{the upper reaches of}} the town; he {{occupied}} two small shabby rooms in a somewhat decayed mansion which stood next to the corner of the Second Avenue. The corner itself was formed by a considerable grocer's shop, the near neighbourhood of which was fatal to any pretensions Ransom and his fellow-lodgers might have had in regard to gentility of situation. The house had a red, rusty face, and faded green shutters, of which the slats were limp and at variance with each other. In one of the lower windows was suspended a fly-blown card, with the words [...] "Table Board" [...] affixed in letters cut (not very neatly) out of coloured paper, of graduated tints, and surrounded with a small band of stamped gilt. The two sides of the shop were protected by an immense pent-house shed, which projected over a greasy pavement and was supported by wooden posts fixed in the curbstone. Beneath it, on the dislocated flags, barrels and baskets were freely and picturesquely grouped; an open cellarway yawned beneath the feet of those who might pause to gaze too fondly on the savoury wares displayed in the window; a strong odour of smoked fish, combined with a fragrance of molasses, hung about the spot; the pavement, toward the gutters, was fringed with dirty panniers, heaped with potatoes, carrots, and onions; and a smart, bright waggon, with the horse detached from the shafts, drawn up on the edge of the abominable road (it contained holes and ruts a foot deep, and immemorial accumulations of stagnant mud), imparted an idle, rural, pastoral air to a scene otherwise perhaps expressive of a rank civilisation. The establishment was of the kind known to New Yorkers as a Dutch grocery; and red-faced, yellow-haired, bare-armed vendors might have been observed to lounge in the doorway. I mention it not on account of any particular influence it may have had on the life or the thoughts of Basil Ransom, but for old acquaintance sake and that of local colour; besides which, a figure is nothing without a setting, and our young man came and went every day, with rather an indifferent, unperceiving step, it is true, among the objects I have briefly designated. One of his rooms was directly above the street-door of the house; such a dormitory, when it is so exiguous, is called in the nomenclature of New York a [...] "hall bedroom." [...] The sitting-room, beside it, was slightly larger, and they both commanded a row of tenements no less degenerate than Ransom's own habitation--houses built forty years before, and already sere and superannuated. These were also painted red, and the bricks were accentuated by a white line; they were garnished, on the first floor, with balconies covered with small tin roofs, striped in different colours, and with an elaborate iron lattice-work, which gave them a repressive, cage-like appearance, and caused them slightly to resemble the little boxes for peeping unseen into the street, which are a feature of oriental towns. Such posts of observation commanded a view of the grocery on the corner, of the relaxed and disjointed roadway, enlivened at the curbstone with an occasional ash-barrel or with gas-lamps drooping from the perpendicular, and westward, at the end of the truncated vista, of the fantastic skeleton of the Elevated Railway, overhanging the transverse longitudinal street, which it darkened and smothered with the immeasurable spinal column and myriad clutching paws of an antediluvian monster. If the opportunity were not denied me here, I should like to give some account of Basil Ransom's interior, of certain curious persons of both sexes, for the most part not favourites of fortune, who had found an obscure asylum there; some picture of the crumpled little table d'hôte, at two dollars and a half a week, where everything felt sticky, which went forward in the low-ceiled basement, under the conduct of a couple of shuffling negresses, who mingled in the conversation and indulged in low, mysterious chuckles when it took a facetious turn. But <b>we</b> <b>need,</b> <b>in</b> strictness, concern ourselves with it no further than to gather the implication that the young Mississippian, even a year and a half after that momentous visit of his to Boston, had not made his profession very lucrative.|$|E
