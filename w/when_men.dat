5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that <b>when</b> <b>men</b> control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|In 15–16th-century French and English {{depictions of}} {{relationships}} between women (Lives of Gallant Ladies by Brantôme in 1665, John Cleland's 1749 erotica Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, L'Espion Anglais by various authors in 1778), writers' attitudes spanned from amused tolerance to arousal, whereupon a male character would participate to complete the act. Physical relationships between women were often encouraged; men felt no threat as they viewed sexual acts between women to be accepted <b>when</b> <b>men</b> were not available, and not comparable to fulfillment that could be achieved by sexual acts between men and women. At worst, if a woman became enamored of another woman, she became a tragic figure. Physical and therefore emotional satisfaction was considered impossible without a natural phallus. Male intervention into relationships between women was necessary only when women acted as men and demanded the same social privileges.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} FBI {{headquarters}} and types out a resignation letter that he hands into Skinner. Skinner visits his office as Mulder is packing his things, and relates an out-of-body experience {{he had in}} Vietnam. Skinner refuses to accept Mulder's resignation and Mulder realizes {{that he was the}} one who provided him with the Cigarette Smoking Man's location. Heading to the parking garage, Mulder is met by X, telling him that he'll have a chance for revenge that night <b>when</b> <b>men,</b> believing him to have information on Scully, will search his apartment at a specific time. Mulder is waiting with his gun at his apartment when Melissa arrives. Although he initially refuses to leave, Melissa is able to convince Mulder to see Scully. While being with Scully, Mulder holds Scully's left hand and talks to her. Returning home to find his apartment trashed, Mulder sits on the floor and cries.|$|E

25|$|Fear in {{my opinion}} {{is a state of}} drunkenness. And <b>when</b> <b>men</b> are in that state when the fear impulse takes a hold...he loses all reason, sense of values, and is not liable, or at least should not be held {{accountable}} for acts perpetrated when thus possessed.|$|E
25|$|The Men from Snowy River {{recruitment}} {{march was}} relived during the Second World War <b>when</b> <b>men</b> retraced the original {{path of the}} 'Snowies', albeit diverting to Canberra. Both recruitment marches were commemorated by a reenactment of the march and a civil reception at the hall at Delegate in January 2006, on the 90th anniversary of the original Men from Snowy River march.|$|E

25|$|Gunnhild, the Queen, {{loved him}} {{so much that she}} held there was not his equal within the guard, either in talking or in {{anything}} else. Even <b>when</b> <b>men</b> were compared, and noblemen therein were pointed to, all men easily saw that Gunnhild thought that at the bottom there must be sheer thoughtlessness, or else envy, if any man was said to be Hrut's equal.|$|E
25|$|The RCWU {{organized}} {{its first}} strike in December 1934. Hundreds of camp workers went to Vancouver to protest {{conditions in the}} relief camps. That strike was short-lived, however, and the strikers returned to the camps with just a promise of a government commission to investigate their complaints. The next walkout was more successful. It began April 4, 1935 <b>when</b> <b>men</b> from relief camps all over Western Canada rode boxcars into Vancouver, where they remained for almost two months.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>men</b> {{experience}} vulnerable {{feelings and}} other feelings {{that are associated}} with women, men can become frightened. According to Kierski (2007), the fear of the feminine then acts in two ways: a) Like an internal monitor to ensure that men stay within the boundaries of what is regarded as masculine, i.e. being action orientated, self-reliant, guarded, and seemingly independent; b) if a man fails to experience this and feels out of control, vulnerable or dependent, the fear of the feminine can act like a defence, leading to splitting off, repressing, or projecting those feelings.|$|E

25|$|Custer had {{initially}} {{wanted to take}} a day and scout the village before attacking; however, <b>when</b> <b>men</b> went back after supplies dropped by the pack train, they discovered they were being back-trailed by Indians. Reports from his scouts also revealed fresh pony tracks from ridges overlooking his formation. It became apparent that the warriors in the village were either aware of or would soon be aware of his approach. Fearing that the village would break up into small bands {{that he would have to}} chase, Custer began to prepare for an immediate attack.|$|E
25|$|Daniel 1 {{serves as}} an {{introduction}} to the book, showing how God continues to move throughout history <b>when</b> <b>men</b> seem to have failed (i.e., how God stands for his people when they are in a foreign land and subject to an alien power). An interesting feature of the book is that the accounts of chapters 2-6 and the visions in chapter 7 are in Aramaic (after the first few lines of chapter 2 in Hebrew). However, the visions of chapters 8-12 are in Hebrew, as is the introduction, chapter 1.|$|E
25|$|Each {{day during}} the middle of summer in July, the dust grew deeper and finer, the heat more intense and the {{stagnant}} air heavier and sickness and sheer exhaustion became more pronounced, and it was noticed that the older men were better able to resist the distressing conditions. Shell-fire and snipers caused casualties which were, if not heavy, a steady drain on the Australian and New Zealand forces, and <b>when</b> <b>men</b> were invalided, the shortage of reinforcements necessitated bringing them back to the valley before their recovery was complete.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{production}} {{was not the}} only economic value of Alaska's land, however. In {{the second half of the}} 20th century, Alaska discovered tourism as an important source of revenue. Tourism became popular after World War I, <b>when</b> <b>men</b> stationed in the region returned home praising its natural splendor. The Alcan Highway, built during the war, and the Alaska Marine Highway System, completed in 1963, made the state more accessible than before. Tourism became increasingly important in Alaska, and today over 1.4 million people visit the state each year.|$|E
25|$|Fans of chivalry {{have assumed}} {{since the late}} medieval period {{that there was a}} time in the past when chivalry was a living institution, <b>when</b> <b>men</b> acted chivalrically, when chivalry was alive and not dead, the {{imitation}} of which period would much improve the present. This is the mad mission of Don Quixote, protagonist of the most chivalric novel of all time and inspirer of the chivalry of Sir Walter Scott and of the U.S. South: to restore the age of chivalry, and thereby improve his country. It is a version of the myth of the Golden Age.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, after {{roles in}} three other silent films, <b>When</b> <b>Men</b> Betray (1918), Thirty a Week (1918), and The Trap (1919), Bankhead made her stage debut in The Squab Farm at the Bijou Theatre in New York. She soon {{realized}} her place was on stage rather than screen, and had roles in 39 East (1919), Footloose (1919), Nice People (1921), Everyday (1921), Danger (1922), Her Temporary Husband (1922), and The Exciters (1922). Though her acting was praised, the plays were commercially and critically unsuccessful. Bankhead {{had been in}} New York for five years, but had yet to score a significant hit. Restless, Bankhead moved to London.|$|E
