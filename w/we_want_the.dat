25|$|The {{state of}} the art in sensory {{intelligence}} for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably {{be a long time before}} robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
500|$|Leicester Square is commemorated in {{the lyrics}} of the music hall song [...] "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" [...] along with nearby Piccadilly, which became popular with {{soldiers}} during World War I. During the war, British inmates of Ruhleben Prisoner of War camp mentioned the square in a song: [...] "Shout this chorus all you can. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> people there, to hear in Leicester Square, That we're the boys that never get downhearted." ...|$|E
30|$|The main {{practical}} {{restrictions were}} that <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> questions {{to allow for}} administering interviews by telephone (CATI), which meant that item formulations should not be too complex, and that response scales should feature a somewhat restricted number of response categories. In addition, since the instrument will be implemented in a multi-topic survey, we could allow for {{only a limited number}} of items (48 items maximum). Last but not least <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> items to be arranged in subgroups so that the instrument would allow for the calculation of subindices (e.g. for analytic or interactive tasks), which in turn could be combined to represent an occupation’s task profile.|$|R

He wanted to avoid violence, stating that [...] "if at all possible, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> revolution to be peaceful and reconciliatory". He noted that views on violence differed widely within the BCM—which contained both pacifists and believers in violent revolution—although the group had agreed to operate peacefully, and unlike the PAC and ANC, had no armed wing.|$|E
500|$|Edmondson's casting in {{the role}} {{followed}} a trend remarked upon by television critic Jim Shelley, who noted a tendency of Holby City producers toward hiring already well established actors, including Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell and actress Patsy Kensit. [...] When asked in November 2007 whether she actively sought out well-known names to fill new roles in the show, series producer Diana Kyle responded: [...] "It's lovely {{when we have a}} new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - which is why we go for them!" ...|$|E
500|$|In debut {{footage of}} Street Fighter V, Mika is seen {{slapping}} her buttocks {{as part of}} her Critical Art attack. The decision not to show the animation in the North American version of the game was a subject of controversy, leading to a petition to restore it. According to producer Yoshinori Ono regarding not showing her butt slap, [...] "Those changes came up internally. We decided to remove that because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> biggest possible number of people to play, and we don’t want to have something in the game that might make someone uncomfortable." [...] Some other shots, including the entrance animation for Cammy, were also replaced.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} promote the album, Madonna's {{recording}} company Warner Bros. spent £1 million (£ million in [...] pounds) on its promotion, to generate excitement in the album {{without the support of}} media interviews or TV performances, as Madonna was in Malta filming Swept Away. A company executive said, [...] "There will be no Top of the Pops appearance or interview on Radio One or in Q magazine this time so <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> unusual name to get people thinking about the association between Madonna and GHV2" [...] and to generate extra media interest to compensate for the artist's unavailability to promote the release at the time. However, in December, Madonna made an appearance at the 2001 Turner Prize award ceremony and mentioned that she [...] "had a new record in stores called GHV2".|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} Moon's death, Townshend issued the statement: [...] "We are more {{determined}} {{than ever to}} carry on, and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the group to which Keith contributed so much to go on, although no human being can ever take his place." [...] Drummer Phil Collins, having a temporary break from Genesis after his first marriage had failed, was at a loose end and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked Jones, who had previously played with the Small Faces and the Faces. Jones officially joined the band in November 1978. John [...] "Rabbit" [...] Bundrick joined the live band as an unofficial keyboardist. On 2 May 1979, the Who returned to the stage with a concert at the Rainbow Theatre, followed by the Cannes Film Festival in France and dates at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E
500|$|After Heppner {{introduced}} his bandmates to progressive rock, the band integrated minor influences from the genre in their songwriting and compositions, including touches of keyboards, while {{trying not to}} deviate too much {{from the sound of}} Hello Master. The change in style was largely adopted so they could challenge themselves musically, but not specifically to be heavier: [...] "I don't think we go in wanting to write a heavier record," [...] guitarist Dan Watchorn stated. [...] "I don't think we have a preconceived notion of what <b>we</b> <b>want,</b> <b>the</b> riffs and melodies just kind of come. The fact that Hello Master was a bit more on the poppy side and Prior to the Fire has a bit more edge to it is just where we're at right now with music." [...] Of the end result, drummer Vince Nudo said, [...] "Our individual tastes came out more [...] [...] It's more organic. We're not holding back so much." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 1940, Corbett and her {{assistant}} {{were charged with}} violations of the Medical Practice Act of California for treating eyes without a licence. At the trial, many of her students testified on her behalf, describing in detail how she had enabled them to discard their glasses. One witness testified {{that he had been}} almost blind from cataracts, but that, after working with Corbett, his vision had improved {{to such an extent that}} for the first time he could read for eight hours at a stretch without glasses. Corbett explained in court that she was practicing neither optometry nor ophthalmology and represented herself not as a doctor but only as an [...] "instructor of eye training". Describing her method she said [...] "We turn vision on by teaching the eyes to shift. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> sense of motion to relieve staring, to end the fixed look. We use light to relax the eyes and to accustom them to the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|Scott {{defined the}} objects of the {{expedition}} in his initial public appeal: [...] "The main objective of this expedition is to reach the South Pole, and to secure for The British Empire the honour of this achievement." [...] There were other objectives, both scientific and geographical; the scientific work was considered by chief scientist Wilson as {{the main work of}} the expedition: [...] "No one can say that it will have only been a Pole-hunt... <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> scientific work to make the bagging of the Pole merely an item in the results." [...] Wilson hoped to continue investigations, begun during the Discovery expedition, of the penguin colony at Cape Crozier, and to fulfil a programme of geological, magnetic and meteorology studies on an [...] "unprecedented" [...] scale. There were further plans to explore King EdwardVII Land, a venture described by Campbell, who was to lead it, as [...] "the thing of the whole expedition", and Victoria Land.|$|E
500|$|There {{were four}} main {{individual}} classifications contested in the 2015 Tour de France, {{as well as}} a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses returned to the Tour {{for the first time since}} the 2008 edition. For all stage finishes, excluding the two time trial stages, the three first finishers of stages earned bonuses of 10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively. Of the reintroduction, race director Christian Prudhomme said: [...] "We want to open up the race, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> race to be decided on any day of the Tour." [...] If a crash had happened within the final [...] of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey. Rain on the final stage forced the final times of the general classification to be taken on the first crossing of the finish line before the ten laps of the cobbled Champs-Élysées. Riders were required to cross the finish line on the final lap to receive their times.|$|E
5000|$|On the album, {{band member}} Glenn Mercer has said [...] "The sound we were after was a {{reaction}} against the punk scene ...

500|$|In {{casting the}} first series of Holby City, Young—who had {{previously}} {{worked on the}} soap operas Brookside and Family Affairs—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background. French had starred in the BBC's EastEnders, while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in Brookside. Griffin had also appeared in ITV's Coronation Street. Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen {{have come out of}} soaps in the past few years. There is a fantastic amount of talent on those shows." [...] This propensity for hiring established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former Brookside actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, Star Wars actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and Family Affairs star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later roles were awarded to comedian Adrian Edmondson, former film actress Patsy Kensit, and Jesus of Nazareth star Powell. When Jane Asher was cast in the recurring role of Lady Byrne in 2007, Inside Soap magazine asked Kyle whether the production team intentionally sought out [...] "well-known-names". She responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best – which is why we go for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father think she is [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
