500|$|... "Everytime" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} songs {{finished}} for In the Zone, previewed on May 30, 2003, to Quddus Philippe of MTV at Battery Studios in New York City. It was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 26, 2003 under the title of [...] "Everytime I Try" [...] and SRU000530591 registration number with a given recording year of 2002. Spears named it the most personal song of the album along with [...] "Touch of My Hand", explaining, [...] "It's one of the songs that when you hear, it's like the kind of song <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> heaven. It kind of takes you away. You know, it takes you in to a very cool consciousness I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Hendrix was 19 years old, law {{enforcement}} authorities had twice caught him riding in stolen cars. When given a choice between spending time in prison or joining the Army, he chose the latter and enlisted on May 31, 1961. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, {{he was assigned to}} the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He arrived there on November 8, and soon afterward he wrote to his father: [...] "There's nothing but physical training and harassment here for two weeks, then <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jump school... you get hell. They work you to death, fussing and fighting." [...] In his next letter home, Hendrix, who had left his guitar at his girlfriend Betty Jean Morgan's house in Seattle, asked his father to send it to him as soon as possible, stating: [...] "I really need it now." [...] His father obliged and sent the red Silvertone Danelectro on which Hendrix had hand-painted the words [...] "Betty Jean" [...] to Fort Campbell. His apparent obsession with the instrument contributed to his neglect of his duties, which led to verbal taunting and physical abuse from his peers, who at least once hid the guitar from him until he had begged for its return.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{only hours}} after the Virginia Tech {{shooting}} (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter-Strike. According to Thompson, the game [...] "drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [...] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower." [...] He says that Seung-Hui [...] "was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality." [...] Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four {{years prior to the}} shooting, Thompson asserts that [...] "you don't drop it <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college, typically." [...] Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that [...] "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people." [...] Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the [...] "flat effect on [...] face" [...] and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that [...] "this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator, he's a video gamer." [...] Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, [...] "Mr. Gates, your company is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that {{used to be in the}} Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." [...] However, Microsoft did not create Counter-Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game. The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui [...] "played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog," [...] and that [...] "none of the video games [...] were war games or had violent themes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{opposition}} to the present-day Chabad movement, someone mentioned to Shach that, [...] "After 120 years, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Heaven, you will merit a warm handshake from the Vilna Gaon." [...] Shach responded, [...] "The Vilna Gaon will shake my hand!? The Baal HaTanya will be the one to shake my hand!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, Reznor and TopSpin Media founder Ian Rogers {{were chosen}} to head Beats Electronics' new music {{subscription}} service, Project Daisy, described by Beats co-founder Jimmy Iovine as having [...] "hardware, brand, distribution partnerships, and artist relations to differentiate Daisy from the competition". There was some speculation as to what Reznor's role would be within the company, but he was later named chief creative officer. He promised {{that he and the}} other members would strive to create a music subscription service that will be like [...] "having your own guy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the record store, who knows what you like but can also point you down some paths you wouldn't have necessarily encountered". The service was officially launched in the United States on January 21, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|While at university, {{he became}} {{involved}} with the Union News newspaper (the Leeds Student from 1970), rising {{to the position of}} editor. At this time he identified with the liberal end of the political spectrum on issues including gay rights and drug use, and wrote editorials in support of a student sit-in at Leeds organised by Straw. He introduced a pin-up feature in the newspaper called [...] "Leeds Lovelies". He told the British Journalism Review in 2002: [...] "If you don’t have a left-wing period <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> university, you should be shot" [...] and said of his early experience of editing in November 2008 that it taught him [...] "dull [...] doesn’t sell newspapers. Boring doesn’t pay the mortgage", but also that [...] "sensation sells papers".|$|E

2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means {{you have to take the}} time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{specific}} crossovers with Daredevil, {{which had}} completed its first season {{by the time}} Jessica Jones began casting, Loeb said [...] "they’re in the same area. In some cases {{they are in the}} same neighborhood. One {{of the things that is}} important to us is, when you enter the police station, it’s the same police station. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the hospital, you start to see the same people. [...] we don’t want people suddenly going, [...] "Wait, is that Matt Murdock that’s walking down the street?" [...] Because that’s going to feel odd, and in a weird way feel false." [...] On existing in the MCU, specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, [...] "Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil. We exist in a cinematic universe, [...] the mythology of the universe is connected, but they look very different, tonally they’re very different… That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what’s come before? And the answer is no." ...|$|E
2500|$|Trudi is Jody's {{friend who}} does little but smoke {{out of a}} bong during the scene where Vincent has to put a needle in Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke. It was the only time I didn't feel like the odd one out over there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll try {{and tell}} <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> {{remember}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the inn to see Miss Silvester? Well, being there privately at the time, of course I {{was obliged to}} keep out of your way." ...|$|R

2500|$|Prominent Republican {{politicians}} {{reacted to}} the speech as well. Former Arkansas governor and 2008 candidate for president Mike Huckabee praised Obama's speech on the MSNBC program Morning Joe, while also commenting on the Rev. Wright controversy. Huckabee argued that Obama [...] "handled this {{about as well as}} anybody could" [...] and suggested that it was [...] "a very historic speech." [...] While he decried the remarks made by Wright, Huckabee, a former pastor himself, also noted that [...] "sermons...are rarely written word-for-word" [...] and that pastors often get [...] "caught up in the emotion of the moment." [...] Referencing his experience growing up in the segregated South and the legacy of Jim Crow, the former Arkansas governor noted that [...] "we've got to cut some slack to people who grew up being called names, being told, 'You have to sit in the balcony <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> [...] movie'...Sometimes people do have a chip on their shoulder and resentment. And you have to just say, I probably would too." [...] Huckabee suggested that he was [...] "probably the only conservative in America who's going to say something like this." ...|$|E
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted {{to become one of}} those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E

6000|$|Accustomed {{to these}} regular Barmecide suggestions, Barker made no direct reply.
