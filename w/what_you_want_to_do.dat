The Wii version scored a bit higher, with a 53% at GameRankings and 53 out of 100 at Metacritic. The PS2 and Wii versions of Revenge of the Fallen were panned for having awful controls. Specifically, IGN stated that [...] "the game will often ignore <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and instead does something different", giving the game 4.2 out of 10. GameZone panned the controls of the Wii version, saying that [...] "control problems – among other missteps – ruined this game".|$|E

His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

[...] The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: [...] "Based around a points system and six-sided dice, GURPS succeeds better than most 'generic' games. The rules are flexible and its well supported - regardless of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it, you'll probably find a supplement with some advice and background. The game suffers from being a little too detailed at times, and can get bogged down in numbers. Still, it's an adaptable system with some superb supplements." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a College for engineering, or technical university, was quite a difficult project, as the entire subject of engineering education was obscure. A small number of colleges had commenced this, such as Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey and Harvard, Yale, and RPI in New York; MIT and Cornell were just being founded. The University of Pennsylvania opened a small school in 1852, for mining and materials, but which had closed {{at the onset of}} the Civil War. As W. Ross Yates notes: [...] "No one knew with certainty how many years a course [...] in engineering should take, or even what branches of engineering should be included within a university. The relationship between theory and practice was hazy." [...] A statement made years later by industrialist and Lehigh Trustee Eckley B. Coxe summarizes the problem succinctly: [...] "Not knowing exactly <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> or the material you have to do it with, what is the best way of doing it?" ...|$|E

He also grew up with two younger brothers, Ross and Brett. Hunter remembered, [...] "We got guitars for Christmas one year, I broke mine but Todd played his. He was {{two years older than}} me and always more interested in music. I only saw it as a way of wagging school." [...] He described his home town, [...] " [...] was a great place to grow up in, and a great place to run away from, because you always knew you could go back to it and nothing much would have changed. It was the place where our parents always told us to 'Do <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> just try and be happy doing it.'" ...|$|E

[...] Sebastian said it was a turning point for him, adding, [...] "From that Memphis thing a few years ago it's always going to start with me being true to who I want to be and what I enjoy singing." [...] Sebastian feels his soul roots remained even when he delved into electro dance music with the single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] from his previous album, explaining it was an old school Sam Cooke type of melody, with modern lyrics, over a dance track. He said, [...] "I had that melody, and I could have gone so many ways with it. I could have produced an old-school soul song, but I went towards what you hear on the radio." ...|$|E
