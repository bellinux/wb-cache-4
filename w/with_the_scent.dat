25|$|Nathan of Gaza’s prophecy about Shabbetai Zevi was not {{his only}} mental visualization. On the contrary, as the years passed, he would have many other visions, all of which would aid his {{movement}} and promote the belief in Shabbetai Zevi. His second vision in fact came {{on the evening of}} the Shavu’ot festival in the spring of 1665. Unlike his prophetic awakening, here, Nathan of Gaza was said to have undergone a spiritual possession by a maggid, or a divine spirit. At the moment of this spiritual takeover, he was described as dancing wildly and emitting a special kind of odor. This smell is described in the Zohar and is believed to be associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> of the Garden of Eden {{as well as of the}} prophet Elisha and Rabbi Isaac Luria.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, it was {{reported}} that the TDSB was ending {{the use of the word}} [...] "chief" [...] in job titles out of respect for Indigenous communities. [...] The decision was inspired by the final report of Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, though the final report [...] "did not explicitly call for the removal of titles such as chief from non-Indigenous applications". [...] Marcus Gee commented in The Globe and Mail: [...] "The idea was so ridiculous that it had to be in jest... It does nothing for the Indigenous community. It does nothing for the cause of Indigenous rights. In fact, by making something out of nothing, it discredits that cause, tainting it <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> of wild-eyed zealotry." ...|$|E

2500|$|A major {{claim to}} fame for Edelbrock was beating all the Offenhauser-powered midget cars that had {{dominated}} midget car racing for several years; this feat was remarkable because Offenhausers had a significant power advantage over all the other motors. Using his Kurtis Kraft V8-60 [...] "shaker" [...] midget car powered by a secret blend of 20% nitromethane (disguised <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> of orange oil), Rodger Ward made history on August 10, 1950, when his Edelbrock-powered #27 car broke the winning streak of the [...] "Offy"-equipped midget cars at Gilmore Stadium, the track that originated midget car racing. This was the only V8-60 to ever beat the Offys in the Gilmore 386-Race history. The same car raced at the Orange Show Stadium in San Bernardino the following night, again beating the Offenhauser cars. This feat was never duplicated {{in the history of}} midget racing. Edelbrock was not the only racer in the period to experiment with nitromethane; fellow racers Joaquin Arnett and Tony Capanna had tried it in their hot rods, as well. Edelbrock, however, is generally considered {{to be the one who}} pulled it all together and made it work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{assembly}} of the gods has been a popular subject for both visual and performing arts, with the wedding banquet of Cupid and Psyche a particularly rich occasion. With the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, {{this is the most}} common setting for a [...] "Feast of the Gods" [...] scene in art. Apuleius describes the scene in terms of a festive Roman dinner party (cena). Cupid, now a husband, reclines in the place of honor (the [...] "top" [...] couch) and embraces Psyche in his lap. Jupiter and Juno situate themselves likewise, and all the other gods are arranged in order. The cupbearer of Jove (Jupiter's other name) serves him with nectar, the [...] "wine of the gods"; Apuleius refers to the cupbearer only as ille rusticus puer, [...] "that country boy," [...] and not as Ganymede. Liber, the Roman god of wine, serves the rest of the company. Vulcan, the god of fire, cooks the food; the Horae ("Seasons" [...] or [...] "Hours") adorn, or more literally [...] "empurple," [...] everything with roses and other flowers; the Graces suffuse the setting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> of balsam, and the Muses with melodic singing. Apollo sings to his lyre, and Venus takes the starring role in dancing at the wedding, with the Muses as her chorus girls, a satyr blowing the aulos (tibia in Latin), and a young Pan expressing himself through the pan pipes (fistula).|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes {{this formula}} is varied. In his initial cartoon, Odor-able Kitty, Pepé (going {{by the name}} Henry in this short) unwittingly pursues a male cat who has {{deliberately}} disguised himself as a skunk (complete <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> of Limburger cheese) in order to scare off a bunch of characters who have mistreated him. Scent-imental Over You has Pepé pursuing a female dog who has donned a skunk pelt (mistaking it for a fur coat). In the end, she removes her pelt, revealing that she's a dog. Pepé then [...] "reveals" [...] himself as another dog and the two embrace. However, he then reveals to the audience that he's still a skunk. In Wild Over You, Pepé attempts to seduce a wild cat that has escaped a zoo (during what is called [...] "Le grande tour du Zoo" [...] at a 1900 exhibition), and painted herself {{to look like a}} skunk to escape her keepers. This cartoon is notable for not only diverging from the Pepé/female-black-cat dynamic, but also rather cheekily showing that Pepé likes to be beaten up, considering the wild cat thrashes him numerous times. Really Scent is also a subversion with Penelope (here called [...] "Fabrette") attracted to him from the beginning, removing the need for Pepé to chase her as she goes to him. But Pepé's scent still causes a problem for her as they try to build a relationship.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the basis of initial training {{is to make the}} experience enjoyable for the puppy or young hound, to keep its enthusiasm high. Whitney preferred waiting till the hound is 18 months old, to start training, but others start as young as possible, say three months. Training can be started by running short trails on a family member whom the puppy sees walk away, at first remaining visible, and later going out of sight. Even though familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scent</b> of the ‘runner’, it can be given a scent-article to sniff, and given the command to follow. It can also be introduced to the tracking harness, which is put on just before the trail starts, and removed as soon as it is finished. On reaching the runner the puppy is given lavish praise and perhaps a reward. Generally in training the handler must know exactly where the runner went, so that he does not encourage the hound when it is wrong, or ‘correct’ it when it is on the scent, but he should not be too ready with his corrections if the hound goes astray, or it may come to rely on him. He should give the hound time to realise its mistake and put itself right, if possible. As training progresses the handler learns to ‘read’ his hound’s behaviour. The hound must trust its nose and the handler must trust the hound. From early hot trails on a familiar person, the young hound progresses to colder trails on the scents of strangers. Later training can be designed to teach particular lessons: crossing trails with false scents, having the runner start out with a companion, who leaves him somewhere along the trail, laying a trail on ground frequented by wild animals. This will teach the hound not to change on to other humans, or riot on animal scents (known as ‘staying clean’ , or ‘freedom from change’ [...] ). It also needs to work over a variety of ground and learn to cope with distractions of many kinds, as well as being introduced to 'negative trails': given a scent article which has not been handled by anyone in the area, so that it will learn to indicate to a handler that the required scent is not there. If it is becoming discouraged it can revert to simpler tasks to recover enthusiasm.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{fluctuating}} asymmetry (FA) -mediated {{sexual selection}} has focused {{almost exclusively on}} visual signals and ignored chemical communication {{despite the fact that}} many species rely on chemical signals for attracting mates. Female mate choice based on visual traits appears to be rare in lizards. However, the femoral glands of male lizards produce pheromones which might transmit chemical information about an individual's developmental stability. Therefore, we hypothesized that mate choice may be based on chemical cues. We analysed the effect of the developmental stability levels of males on the attractiveness of males' scents to females in a laboratory experiment <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lizard Lacerta monticola. When we offered two males of similar body size, females preferentially associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scents</b> of males <b>with</b> low FA in their femoral pores and also <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>scents</b> of males <b>with</b> a higher number of femoral pores. This suggested that the females were able to discriminate the FA of the males by chemical signals alone and that the females preferred to be in areas marked by males of high quality, thus increasing their opportunities of mating with males of high quality. We suggest that the quality and/or amount of male pheromones could communicate the heritable genetic quality of a male to the female and thereby {{serve as the basis for}} adaptive female choice in lizards...|$|R
