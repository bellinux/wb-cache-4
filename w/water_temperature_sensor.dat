5000|$|Tankless {{water heaters}} {{can be further}} divided into two {{categories}} according to their heating capability: [...] "full on/full off" [...] versus [...] "modulated". Full on/full off units {{do not have a}} variable power output level; the unit is either fully on or completely off. This can cause an annoying and possibly hazardous variation of hot water temperature as the flow of water through the heater varies. Modulated tankless water heaters change their heat output in response to the flow rate of water running through the unit. This is usually done by using a flow sensor, a modulating gas valve, an inlet <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor,</b> and an outlet water temperature sensor-choke valve. A properly configured modulating heater can supply the same output temperature of water at differing water flow rates within their rated capacity, usually maintaining a close range of ±2 °C.|$|E

The photonic crystal consists of rods in a hexagonal lattice and a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) background. By using the plane wave expansion (PWE) method, the lattice constant and radius of rods are obtained, 520 nm and 80.6 nm, respectively. With a nanocavity placed in the waveguide, a resonance peak is observed at the 1.55 -μm wavelength window. Any change of the water temperature inside the nanocavity results in the shift of the resonance wavelength. Our simulations show a shift of about 11 nm for a temperature change of 22.5 ℃. The resonance wavelength has a linear relation with the water temperature.|$|E

One {{of the important}} goals was {{the establishment of the}} air-sea temperature difference (ASTD) homogeneity along the main propagation link atmospheric path since it is a basic assumption for most of the atmospheric turbulence models (caused by refractive index variations). The ASTD was measured from a small scientific work boat (called Sea Lab) moving along a straight in- and outbound track along the main propagation link path. The air temperature on-board was measured using standard weather sensors, while the sea surface temperature was measured using a long wavelength infrared radiometer, which was compared to the bulk sea temperature half a meter below the sea surface. This was obtained by an under <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> mounted on a â€surfboard' that was towed alongside Sea Lab.

Analysis of field temperatures suggests that vertical thermal stratification may have caused a systematic difference between instream gage temperatures and corrected image temperatures.

In this study, a new sensor is proposed to determine <b>water</b> <b>temperature.</b> This <b>sensor</b> utilizes the difference in measurement length between two laser beams. Both are the test beams, and there is no reference beam. The two beams pass mostly through equal or closely arranged paths; therefore, the effect of mechanical vibration on the two test beams is expected to be very small. The laser beam was introduced through a selfoc micro lens (SML) into a polarization-maintaining fiber connected with a sensor part. The beam emitted from another SML was divided into two. Both beams enter a quartz block and are reflected at the corner to change direction by an angle of π/ 4. They then pass through the test section although the lengths of the two beams are different in the measurement region. This sensor was installed on a side wall of a vessel.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if it was feasible to collect information regarding energy use and hot water delivery from tankless gas water heaters using the sensors and controls built into the water heaters. This could then be used to determine the water heater efficiency ? the ratio of energy out (hot water delivered) to energy in (energy in the gas) in actual residential installations. The goal was to be as unobtrusive as possible, and to avoid invalidating warranties or exposing researchers to liability issues. If feasible this approach would reduce the costs of instrumentation. This paper describes the limited field and laboratory investigations to determine if using the sensors and controls built into tankless water heaters is feasible for field monitoring. It was more complicated to use the existing gas flow, <b>water</b> and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors</b> than was anticipated. To get the signals from the existing sensors and controls is difficult and may involve making changes that would invalidate manufacturer warrantees.
