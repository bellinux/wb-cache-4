Before the city of Lawrence was even incorporated, the Essex Company laid plans for turning an area of {{farmland}} on the Merrimack River into the country’s first planned industrial city. The Essex Company built the Stone Mill, then known as the Lawrence Machine Shop from 1846-1848. It {{is one of the}} two oldest mill buildings in the city of Lawrence {{and one of the few}} mills ever built out of stone. It originally housed a forge and a foundry and its purpose was to manufacture and repair the machinery that would be used by the new mill buildings. In the loft of the building, an experimental full set of <b>worsted</b> <b>wool</b> machinery was put together and tested – <b>worsted</b> <b>wool</b> would become one of the signature products of the Lawrence manufacturing industry.|$|E

Similar patterns worked in 2-ply <b>worsted</b> <b>wool</b> called crewel on heavy linen for furnishings are characteristic of Jacobean embroidery.|$|E
500|$|Cloth {{has been}} used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century. The {{predecessor}} company of the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of baize that is dyed green, and is made from 100% <b>worsted</b> <b>wool,</b> which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table [...] The green color of cloth was originally chosen to emulate the look of grass, and has been so colored since the 16th century. However, as in green eyeshades, the color also serves a useful function: Humans have a higher light sensitivity to green than to any other color, so green cloth permits play {{for longer periods of time}} without eye strain.|$|E

Weiler, writing in The New York Times, praised Grant's performance, remarking that the actor [...] "was never more at home than in this role of the advertising-man-on-the-lam" [...] and handled the role [...] "with professional aplomb and grace". Grant wore one of his most iconic suits in the film which became very popular, a fourteen-gauge, mid-gray, <b>worsted</b> <b>wool</b> one custom-made on Savile Row. Grant finished the year playing a U. S. Navy Rear Admiral aboard a submarine opposite Tony Curtis in the comedy Operation Petticoat. The reviewer from Daily Variety saw Grant's comic portrayal as a classic example of how to attract the laughter of the audience without lines, remarking that [...] "In this film, most of the gags play off him. It is his reaction, blank, startled, etc., always underplayed, that creates or releases the humor". The film was major box office success, and in 1973, Deschner ranked the film as the highest earning film of Grant's career at the US box office, with takings of $9.5 million.|$|E

50|$|Its elevation, poor soils, {{isolation}} from major transport routes, and rainfall of over 34 inches a year limited farm production. Resources such as coal, iron and sandstone, {{the development of}} turnpike roads, and {{the coming of the}} railways enabled Thornton to share in the prosperity generated by the 19th-century <b>wool</b> <b>worsted</b> trade. The increasing use of steam-powered mills (at the expense of the former cottage-industry production methods) concentrated production in the valleys of the city centre. Foreign imports, the Second World War, and closure of the railways, all contributed to the decline in manufacturing. Today Thornton is a residential suburb of Bradford.|$|R

5000|$|Although Koch arguably {{made the}} {{greatest}} theoretical contribution {{to our understanding}} of anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain, where anthrax affected workers in the <b>wool,</b> <b>worsted,</b> hides and tanning industries, it was viewed with fear. John Henry Bell, a doctor based in Bradford, first made the link between the mysterious and deadly [...] "woolsorter's disease" [...] and anthrax, showing in 1878 that they were one and the same. In the early twentieth century, Friederich Wilhelm Eurich, the German bacteriologist who settled in Bradford with his family as a child, carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board. Eurich also made valuable contributions to a Home Office Departmental Committee of Inquiry, established in 1913 to address the continuing problem of industrial anthrax. His work in this capacity, much of it collaboration with the factory inspector G. Elmhirst Duckering, led directly to the Anthrax Prevention Act (1919).|$|R
40|$|Over many millennia, mankind has laboured {{to consume}} and satisfy three very {{necessary}} material wants or needs: food (including drink), shelter, and clothing. Each of these, however, {{has also been}} a major object of luxury consumption in most European societies. Textiles were necessities in providing almost all people with protection from the elements: from winter and evening cold, from summer heat, and from precipitation (rain, sleet, snow, hale); and also protection, in terms of modesty, from public shame and humiliation. For many people, however, clothing has also served and still serves other or supplementary wants, in terms of luxury consumption: for decoration, the assertion of personal values, and also for assertions or symbols of social status. The subject of this particular study, woollen textiles, is arguably the one that best permits a statistical comparison of market values of both luxury and ‘every-day’ textiles, because of the abundance and continuity of price data that have survived in two economically linked regions, the southern Low Countries and England, over two centuries: from the mid-fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries. Luxury- quality textiles from this region played a very major role in European international trade during this long period, for reasons also examined in this study. The core of this study is a comparison of the prices and relative values of the purchases of two luxury woollen textiles and of two relatively cheap textiles in Ghent, Mechelen, and Antwerp in the years 1538 to 1544 : the first category consists of the Ghent dickedinnen and the Mechelen zwart rooslaken broadcloths; the second (latter) consists of single and double says from Hondschoote, sold on the Antwerp market. The prices are given in the Flemish pond groot (live gros). But such prices are meaningless unless proper relative comparisons be made, to indicate the ‘real’ values of these textiles. This study utilizes two such techniques: (1) an estimate of the number of days’ wages that an Antwerp master mason would have required to buy one of these textiles (or 12 square metres of each); (2) the number of ‘baskets of consumables’, the measure used to construct the annual Consumer Price Index, whose aggregate value in pounds groot equalled the value of one of each of these textiles. The differences in relative values for these years are most vividly revealed by the first technique: For 1538 - 44, the average number of days’ wages required to purchase 12 square metres of cloth (enough to make up a man’s full suit of clothing) would have been: 13. 725 days for a Hondschoote single say; 16. 958 days for a Hondschoote double say; and 5. 4 times as many days, 91. 413 for a Ghent dickedinnen and 74. 144 days for a Mechelen rooslaken. To make that comparison all the more clear – the differences between a heavy-weight luxury woollen broadcloth and a lighter-weight semi-worsted fabric (says) used for every-day wear, the next section analyses the physical composition of these various textiles, from the weavers’ guild ordinances: in terms of the wools used, the dimensions on the loom, the final dimensions after finishing, the weight of the cloths, and their gram weights per square metre. A snap-shot comparison of these textile values for just these few years, near the mid-sixteenth century, will not prove convincing, however, unless the ‘real’ values of these and other woollen textiles can be presented over much longer periods of time. The following tables presents the values of woollen broadcloths from Ghent, Mechelen, Bruges, Ypres (Ieper), Leuven, and England, for various periods from the 1330 s to the 1570 s – more than two and half centuries. Those values are again presented in four forms: (1) in Flemish pounds (£) groot; (2) In terms of nominal and ‘real’ price-indexes (base 1451 - 75 = 100); (3) the number of days’ wages that a Flemish (Bruges-Ghent), or English (Oxford-Cambridge), or Brabantine (Antwerp) master mason would have had to spend to purchase just one of each of these woollen cloths; and (4) the number of annual ‘baskets of consumables’ (Flemish, Brabantine, English) whose aggregate money-of-account value equalled the value of just one of these textiles. Of all the woollen textiles produced in medieval Europe by far the most luxurious, rivalling silks in value, were the scarlets, whose nature, composition, dyestuffs, finishing costs, and market values are considered – in the same fashion – for Mechelen from 1361 to 1415 (the only period of continuous data available). Finally, tables (14 and 15) are presented on the prices of the finer English wools used in manufacturing all these fine woollens. luxury consumption, woollen broadcloths, <b>worsteds,</b> English <b>wools,</b> scarlets, kermes, medieval Flanders, Brabant, England; real incomes...|$|R
