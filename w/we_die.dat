25|$|Measuring consumers' {{conscious}} and subconscious through studying their biological sensorimotor, {{cognitive and affective}} response to marketing stimuli, called neuromarketing, is of increasing interest to marketers {{in order to gain}} insight into how they consume. Dawkins (1989) explained that when <b>we</b> <b>die</b> we leave behind genes and memes; genes being the unit of genetic information, and memes the units of cultural information. Neuromarketing aims to examine the memory of these memes in order to manipulate them.|$|E

25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until <b>we</b> <b>die.</b> What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?'

[...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless <b>we</b> <b>die</b> or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration.

500|$|Alice in Chains {{was formed}} in 1987 by guitarist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who then {{recruited}} bassist Mike Starr and singer Layne Staley. The band signed to Columbia Records in 1989, and released its first EP, <b>We</b> <b>Die</b> Young, in July 1990. Later that year, the band released its debut studio album, Facelift. The single [...] "Man in the Box", which reached number 18 on the mainstream rock chart, helped Facelift achieve double Platinum status. The band toured {{in support of the}} album for two years before releasing the acoustic EP Sap in early 1992. In September 1992, Alice in Chains released Dirt. The critically acclaimed album, also the band's most successful, debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and was certified quadruple Platinum. The band did not tour in support of Dirt for very long, due to Staley's drug addiction. While touring, Starr left the band due to personal reasons and was replaced by Mike Inez. 1994 saw the release of Alice in Chains' second acoustic EP, Jar of Flies. It entered the charts in the top slot, making it the first Alice in Chains release—and the first EP in history—to debut at number one. In 1995, the band released a self-titled album, which debuted {{at the top of the}} Billboard 200, and has since been awarded—along with Facelift—double Platinum status while Jar of Flies maintains Quadruple Platinum status. Alice in Chains entered a hiatus after not touring since the release of Dirt.|$|E
500|$|By 1993, their {{relationship}} had thawed again, and Simon invited Garfunkel {{on an international}} tour with him. Following a 21-date, sold-out run at the Paramount Theater in New York and an appearance at that year's Bridge School Benefit in California, the duo toured the Far East. The duo had a falling out {{over the course of}} the rest of the decade, the details of which have never been disclosed. Simon thanked Garfunkel at his 2001 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist: [...] "I regret the ending of our friendship. I hope that some day before <b>we</b> <b>die</b> we will make peace with each other," [...] resuming after a pause, [...] "No rush." [...] They were awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards in 2003, for which the promoters convinced them to reconcile and open the show with a performance of [...] "The Sound of Silence." [...] The performance was satisfying for both musicians, and they planned out a full-scale reunion tour over the summer. The Old Friends tour began in October 2003 and played to sold-out audiences across the United States for 30 dates until mid-December. The tour earned an estimated $123 million. Following a twelve-city run in Europe in 2004, they ended their nine-month tour with a free concert along Via dei Fori Imperiali, in front of the Colosseum in Rome. It attracted 600,000 fans, even more than their The Concert in Central Park. In 2005, Simon and Garfunkel performed three songs for a Hurrican Katrina benefit concert in Madison Square Garden. The duo performed Mrs. Robinson, and Homeward Bound. Bridge Over Troubled Water was then performed by the duo with singer Aaron Neville.|$|E
