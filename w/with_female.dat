5|$|The female is mildly {{aggressive}} to her suitors during estrus, {{and will}} often lunge at males, usually {{after a long}} period of being approached and followed. Vocalizations during mating include a whistling sound, most commonly by the female, usually during June and August, coinciding <b>with</b> <b>female</b> estrus. Other vocalizations recorded during estrus include chittering and growling. The testosterone levels of the males are seasonal, with peaks coinciding <b>with</b> <b>female</b> estrogen peaks.|$|E
5|$|A lesbian is {{a female}} homosexual: a female who {{experiences}} romantic love or sexual attraction to other females. The term lesbian {{is also used}} to express sexual identity or sexual behavior regardless of sexual orientation, or as an adjective to characterize or associate nouns <b>with</b> <b>female</b> homosexuality or same-sex attraction.|$|E
5|$|Ardhanarishvara is {{referred}} to by the Greek author Stobaeus (c. 500 AD) while quoting Bardasanes (c. 154–222 AD), who learnt from an Indian embassy's visit to Syria {{during the reign of}} Elagabalus (Antoninus of Emesa) (218–22 AD). A terracotta androgynous bust, excavated at Taxila and dated to the Saka-Parthian era, pictures a bearded man <b>with</b> <b>female</b> breasts.|$|E
40|$|Six {{weeks of}} {{observation}} on eight groups of wild mantled howler monkeys {{revealed that the}} presence of a dependent infant alters the frequency of social interactions between a <b>female</b> <b>with</b> an infant and other adult monkeys. Males preferred to spend time <b>with</b> <b>females</b> without infants but still spent more time <b>with</b> <b>females</b> <b>with</b> infants than <b>with</b> males. <b>Females</b> without infants spent significantly less time <b>with</b> <b>females</b> <b>with</b> infants than with males or other females without infants and <b>females</b> <b>with</b> infants decreased their frequency of social interaction overall without preference for males, females or other <b>females</b> <b>with</b> infants...|$|R
50|$|Also, either {{females of}} the last common {{ancestor}} of S. puellus and the S. punctatus interbred <b>with</b> <b>females</b> ancestral to the main non-foxface lineage, or males of the former hybridized <b>with</b> <b>females</b> {{of the last}} common ancestor of S. punctatissimus and the foxfaces, while males of the latter mated <b>with</b> <b>females</b> of the original foxface species.|$|R
40|$|Locating {{potential}} mates {{is critical}} to mating. We studied males’ association <b>with</b> <b>females</b> and mate-searching patterns in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a promiscuous live-bearer. In the field, we examined whether male guppies respond differently to a shoal of conspecific fish based on {{the members of the}} shoal. We found that more males were attracted to shoals that contained receptive females than to shoals of nonreceptive females or males. We also conducted laboratory experiments to investigate how males use olfactory cues of nonreceptive and receptive females to search for and associate <b>with</b> <b>females.</b> We gave males the option to associate <b>with</b> nonreceptive <b>females</b> when olfactory cues of receptive or nonreceptive females were present and absent, and when olfactory cues were presented alone. Males associated <b>with</b> <b>females</b> most strongly when both cues were presented simultaneously, but when cues were presented separately males’ association <b>with</b> <b>females</b> differed <b>with</b> respect to the olfactory cues that were added. Males associated <b>with</b> <b>females</b> equally <b>with</b> visual and olfactory cues presented separately when the odour cues were from receptive females. However, when the odour cues were from nonreceptive <b>females,</b> males associated <b>with</b> <b>females</b> less <b>with</b> olfactory than visual cues. Searching activity increased when males had access only to olfactory cues. Taken together these results suggest that olfactory cues influence males’ association <b>with</b> <b>females</b> and searching behaviour, and these changes in behaviour are likely to maximize a male’s opportunity to encounter receptive females. <br /...|$|R
5|$|The wolf head crest {{also appears}} in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in this room is {{decorated}} <b>with</b> <b>female</b> caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.|$|E
5|$|A given flower is {{open only}} for a single day, opening before dawn and closing in the afternoon. Flowers are self-fecundating and protogynous (<b>with</b> <b>female</b> parts {{maturing}} first), and will self-pollinate if {{they have not been}} pollinated by insects during the day. While many insects visit the flowers, only some bees actually accomplish pollination. V.thapsus flowering period lasts from June to August in most of its range, extending to September or October in warmer climates. Visitors include halictid bees and hoverflies. The hair on lower stamens may serve to provide footholds for visitors.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity <b>with</b> <b>female</b> reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact <b>with</b> <b>female</b> urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E
5|$|Crowley had {{his first}} {{significant}} mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896. Several biographers, including Lawrence Sutin, Richard Kaczynski, and Tobias Churton, believed {{that this was the}} result of Crowley's first same-sex sexual experience, which enabled him to recognise his bisexuality. At Cambridge, Crowley maintained a vigorous sex life with women—largely <b>with</b> <b>female</b> prostitutes, from one of whom he caught syphilis—but eventually he took part in same-sex activities, despite their illegality. In October 1897, Crowley met Herbert Charles Pollitt, president of the Cambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, and the two entered into a relationship. They broke apart because Pollitt did not share Crowley's increasing interest in Western esotericism, a break-up that Crowley would regret for many years.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, {{three years}} after the first performance, Rossini discreetly orchestrated the Petite messe solennelle, partly for fear that others would do it anyway after his death. As he disliked the sound of cathedral boys' choirs, he {{requested}} permission from the pope to perform the work <b>with</b> <b>female</b> voices at a church. When his request was rejected, he demanded that the orchestral version would only be performed after his death. The composer preferred the chamber music version anyway.|$|E

5|$|In combat, a quick time event (QTE) feature, {{also called}} context {{sensitive}} attacks, is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs {{a sequence of}} actions on the game controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist. Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game {{in the form of}} an encounter <b>with</b> <b>female</b> twins, which has become a regular feature throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|Kyo's appears {{repeatedly}} in the series {{at the insistence of}} the marketers and the main planners. Iori, and other SNK regulars also appear in every game, making it a challenge to decide the storyline for each title. Along with his rival Iori, it has been noted by several of the series' designers that Kyo {{is one of the most}} difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity among fans. Originally, Kyo's girlfriend, Yuki, was not meant to be conceptualized, since her first mention ever in the story was in Kyo's profile as one of his most cherished possessions. Her addition to his profile was done by one of the programmers mostly as a joke since Kyo was more popular <b>with</b> <b>female</b> gamers.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs. <b>With</b> <b>female</b> preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E

5|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} estates were managed by single families. The father acted {{as the head}} manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked <b>with</b> <b>female</b> servants to weave cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a sharecropping system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands. Under this system, peasants would receive land, tools, oxen, and a house {{in exchange for a}} third or a half of their crop yield.|$|E
5|$|The first skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{occupied}} by male workers, but this changed during the 1890s, <b>with</b> <b>female</b> employees becoming more common. The percentage of female clerical workers in Chicago, for example, increased from 11 percent in 1880 to 21 percent by 1890, reaching 30 percent by 1900. Various moral concerns were raised about {{men and women}} mixing in such offices, which were characterized as being masculine spaces, full of tobacco smoke and profanity and therefore unsuitable for women. The new female workers typically worked as typists or stenographers, using the recently invented typewriter, which grew in number in U.S. offices from 146 in 1879 to 65,000 by 1890.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{starts with}} a {{narration}} by its protagonist, Cal (his masculine identity), also known as Calliope (feminine): He recounts how 5-alpha-reductase deficiency, a recessive condition, caused him to be born <b>with</b> <b>female</b> characteristics. The book continues with accounts of his family's history, starting with his paternal grandparents in their home village and ending with his father's funeral. These accounts cover the conception of Cal, his teenage years, and the discovery of his intersex condition. Throughout the book, Cal weaves his opinion of the events in hindsight and of his life after his father's funeral. Eugenides sets Middlesex in the 20th century and interjects historical elements, such as the Balkan Wars, the Nation of Islam, the 1967 Detroit riot, and the Watergate scandal in the story.|$|E

Sexual dimorphism {{of the skull}} is more pronounced than in corsac foxes, <b>with</b> <b>female</b> red foxes tending to have smaller skulls than males, with wider nasal regions and hard palates, as well as having larger canines. Their skulls are distinguished from those of dogs by their narrower muzzles, less crowded premolars, more slender canine teeth, and concave rather than convex profiles.|$|E
5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations <b>with</b> <b>female</b> writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E
