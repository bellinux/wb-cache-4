5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not.

5|$|Patrice {{decides to}} perform the final scene of a {{vaudeville}} play he has written called La Pendule (The Clock). He explains the complex plot and characters: set in 1929 in a townhouse in Provence, the play involves the Duke of Ponfouy and his family, associates and household servants. He performs the scene, playing all the characters himself and exaggerating their voices and mannerisms. For Patrice's final act, he plays a recording of Rémi and himself from 1985, then sings a song he has written about Rémi and the accident. When the audience applauds the song, he criticises them as he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> famous comedian. After imitating a marionette, he performs his curtain call with a toy dragon; he dances with it and a sparkler, and flaps its wings to Johann Strauss I's Radetzky March.|$|E

5|$|According to Haga, the story's main {{theme was}} saving Elena from the curse and then {{returning}} to a normal life. The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was {{kept to a minimum}} so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive. The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest. Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|After Charles's death, {{the former}} Austrian {{imperial}} family were soon to move again. Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and {{they agreed to}} allow Zita and her seven (soon to be eight) children to relocate to Spain. Alfonso duly sent the warship Infanta Isabel to Funchal and this took them to Cadiz. They were then escorted to the Pardo Palace in Madrid, where shortly after her arrival Zita {{gave birth to a}} posthumous child, Archduchess Elisabeth. Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay. This appealed to Zita, who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> heavy burden to the state that harboured her. For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where she got on with the job of raising and educating her children. They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg, and voluntary collections. Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much of this money, and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials.|$|E
5|$|At {{daylight}} on {{the morning}} of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill, were alive. As the day passed, with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight, McDoniel decided to abandon the position that night. When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines. That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position. At 22:00, McDoniel and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four. Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, still alive in his paralyzed condition, refused efforts of evacuation, saying that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> burden to those who {{had a chance to get}} away. He asked only that his carbine be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin. Like Oullette, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions. Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4, 22 escaped to friendly lines, many of them following the Naktong downstream, hiding by day and traveling by night, until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division.|$|E

5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying that Indians never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Hsu was {{reportedly}} born on 7 July 1898, in Shantou prefecture of China, {{during the reign}} of the Manchu Qing dynasty, although this has never been independently verified. When Hsu was young, her father walked out on the family for another woman. Her mother, who was illiterate, had to fend for the three girls and one brother singlehandedly. At 16, her family moved to Penang in Malaya, where they worked as cleaners in a convent. As she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cleaner all her life, Hsu asked the nuns there to allow her to study with the children, and they agreed. Combining study with work, she passed her Senior Cambridge examinations four years later. Equipped with a basic education, she ventured to Hong Kong to work and, later, to Chongqing, China, where she became a secretary and bookkeeper at a German news agency in the 1930s. She quit her job to become a volunteer, helping the injured during the Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk bucket, and censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would grow up to be successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E

25|$|Clearly, Wittgenstein did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> behaviorist, {{nor did he}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> cognitivist or a phenomenologist.

However, some argue that Wittgenstein is basically a behaviorist because he considers facts about language use as all there is. Such a claim is controversial, since it is not explicitly endorsed in the Investigations.|$|E
