2500|$|Often sites hosting torrent files {{claim that}} they are not {{breaking}} any laws because they are not offering the actual data, rather only a link to other places or peers that contain the infringing material. However, many prosecution cases and convictions argue to the contrary. For instance, Dimitri Mader, the French national who operates a movie distribution <b>warez</b> <b>site,</b> Wawa-Mania, was fined 20,000 € and sentenced, in absentia, to a year in jail by a European court (after fleeing France for the Philippines), for his role in managing the site. In the U.S., through 2004, more than 80 individuals had been prosecuted and convicted for trade in warez products (under the NET Act and other statutes), for movie and software pirating in particular, with a number of individuals being imprisoned, including some enthusiast traders.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2003, {{over twenty}} search {{warrants}} were simultaneously executed, {{resulting in the}} seizure of dozens of computers and file servers, including what the United States government reported as [...] "the largest <b>warez</b> <b>site</b> ever seized in the United States to date." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a common}} {{perception}} that <b>warez</b> <b>sites</b> represent high risk in terms of malware. In addition, there are several papers showing there is indeed correlation between warez/file sharing sites and malware. In particular, one study shows that out of all domains the study classified as pirate, 7.1% are infected (while out of random domains only 0.4% were infected); another study maintains that '"maliciousness" [...] of the content for sites they classified as pirate (which specifically included <b>warez</b> <b>sites)</b> is the highest among all the researched site categories. Domains related to anti-copy protection tools {{are among the most}} malicious sites. Another study specifically targeted anti-copy protection tools such as cracks and key generators. They conclude that the majority of these programs aim to infect the user's computer with one or more types of malware. The chance of the end-user being exposed to malicious code when dealing with cracked applications or games is more than 50%.|$|R
5|$|A demo of The Age of Kings was {{released}} on October 16, 1999. It featured the learning campaign, a sample of a random map game, {{and the ability to}} play via the MSN Gaming Zone. Much to Ensemble Studios' disappointment, numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked. These were picked up by <b>warez</b> <b>sites,</b> and sold illegally throughout the Pacific Rim; warez versions of the game were even sold outside Microsoft's offices in South Korea.|$|R
50|$|The program {{became popular}} {{thanks to the}} warez scene. The first warez group to bring WinPlay3 to {{attention}} of a wider audience was Compress Da Audio. They released CDs, with WinPlay3 included, on several <b>warez</b> FTP <b>sites.</b> Rabid Neurosis emerged shortly afterwards, after which the scene exploded.|$|R
50|$|Topsite is a {{term used}} by the warez scene to refer to underground, highly secretive, {{high-speed}} FTP servers used by release groups and couriers for distribution, storage and archiving of warez releases.Topsites have very high-bandwidth Internet connections, commonly supporting transfer speeds of hundreds to thousands of megabits per second; enough to transfer a full Blu-ray in seconds. Topsites also have very high storage capacity; a total of many terabytes is typical. Early on these <b>warez</b> <b>sites</b> were mainly distributing software such as games and applications after the release groups removed any protections. Now they are also a source of other copyright protected works such as movies and music. It {{is not uncommon for}} sites to charge for access to the content, although this is frowned upon by the scene itself due to the decreased security.|$|R
5000|$|Initially GOTD used {{relatively}} {{a simple}} technique {{to protect the}} installation package which {{eventually led to the}} situation when a lot of titles previously featured on Giveaway of the Day became available on numerous <b>warez</b> <b>sites.</b> On top of that some websites provided step-by-step protection circumvention guides. Thus GOTD started losing trust of its vendors and had to take potentially unpopular measures. In July 2012 the team announced a new release of the wrapper, informing the users about integration of Themida software developed by Oreans Technologies [...] into the wrapper as an additional protection mechanism. Some users were outraged by these measures and went as far as call Themida a [...] "spyware". Also the new wrapper caused issues due to false positive alerts from several security software products at first.|$|R
25|$|While few arrests {{had been}} made {{by the time of the}} first press releases, repercussions ran deep in the <b>warez</b> scene. Countless <b>sites</b> closed as a direct {{response}} to the busts, and many active scene members went into hiding.|$|R
25|$|This {{functionality}} {{still exists}} and {{can still be}} found on IRC warez channels, {{as an alternative to}} the modern and streamlined P2P distribution systems. The opportunity to find and compromise poorly secured systems on which to create an illicit <b>warez</b> distribution <b>site</b> has only increased with the popular use of broadband service by home users who may not fully understand the security implications of having their home computer always turned on and connected to the Internet.|$|R
50|$|From being {{a release}} <b>site</b> for the <b>warez</b> community, the <b>site</b> {{has evolved into}} a broader message board, concentrating mostly on PC gaming. The PC games forum on the site {{contains}} everything from rumors, latest news, hints, tips and tweaks to various games.|$|R
5000|$|Lai (a.k.a. [...] "doplgnger") {{pleaded guilty}} to one count of {{conspiracy}} to commit criminal copyright infringement on January 6, 2006 related to his administering several <b>warez</b> FTP <b>sites.</b> He was sentenced on June 18, 2007 to three years of probation, {{the first six months}} of which he must serve confined to his home. He was also ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $7200 and to perform 120 hours of community service. The case is 3:06-cr-00004 from the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{laws and}} their {{application}} to warez activities may vary greatly {{from country to}} country; for instance, while Wawa-Mania is under sanction in France, it remains in operation via a host in Moldova, and through use of an Ecuadorian top-level domain. Hence, while high-profile web hosts and domain providers generally do not permit the hosting of <b>warez,</b> and delete <b>sites</b> found to be hosting them, private endeavours and small commercial entities continue to allow the trade in warez to continue. And, in some countries, and at some times, software [...] "piracy" [...] has been encouraged, and international and usual national legal protections ignored. A dispute between Iran and United States over membership in WTO and subsequent U.S. block of Iran's attempts at full-membership has led Iran to encourage the copying of U.S. software; hence, {{there has been a}} subsequent surge in Iranian [...] "warez" [...] and [...] "crackz" [...] websites (as Iranian laws do not forbid hosting them inside Iran. The same policy has been adopted by Antigua, and others.|$|R
40|$|Utilization of Internet {{services}} to the hotspot network raises particular problems in traffic control and web filtering. Linux as an operating system that is open (open source), {{offers a variety of}} internet firewall systems to assist in the management of traffic, bandwidth, web filtering and one using Smoothwall Express to Linux which can convert a personal computer (PC) to the Internet firewall reliable and stable. Smoothwall allows to integrated with the add-ons extends like AdvProxy and URL Filter to improve the performance of Smoohtwall and simplify configuration of the traffic control and web filtering. The research was conducted by collecting data from various sources related, then experiment with implementing Smoohtwall by adding add-ons extends to help administrators manage and regulate the bandwidth allocation of each client, block websites (URLs) that are not needed. Based on these results bandwidth management can be divided equally and can block websites (URLs) that are not needed like porn <b>sites,</b> <b>warez,</b> bad word, and also the quality of the network connection updatesites more stable. </em...|$|R
