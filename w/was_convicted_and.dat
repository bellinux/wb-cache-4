5|$|After the election, the Conservatives {{were accused}} of {{cheating}} in the Robocall scandal, mainly suppressing votes by directing voters to bogus polling stations.

5|$|At {{the end of}} a six-day trial, she <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> {{sentenced to}} death after a jury of matrons {{rejected}} her last-minute attempt to avoid the death penalty by pleading pregnancy. She finally confessed to the murder the night before she was hanged, on 29 July at Wandsworth Prison. The case attracted huge public interest and was widely covered by the press in Great Britain and Ireland. Webster's behaviour after the crime and during the trial further increased the notoriety of the murder.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Croatian {{authorities}} tried Đuro Đurić, {{a former}} SAO Krajina policeman, in absentia {{on charges of}} war crimes committed in Struga, Zamlača and Kozibrod.

5|$|On 17 May 2010, Oliver Fricker trespassed and vandalised car 1048 (trainset 047/048) with {{graffiti}} at Changi Depot. The graffiti {{was initially}} mistaken for an advertisement {{and was not}} spotted until the car was filmed and the video was uploaded to YouTube by a trainspotter. Fricker <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to seven months' imprisonment and caning. The public perceived this incident to have serious security implications, as the depot was considered a sensitive installation.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} of Cristina Kirchner continued {{the trials of}} military personnel involved in the Dirty War, started by her husband.

5|$|While {{serving as}} dean in 1850, Holmes became a witness {{for both the}} defense and {{prosecution}} during the notorious Parkman-Webster murder case. Both George Parkman (the victim), a local physician and wealthy benefactor, and John Webster (the assailant) were graduates of Harvard, and Webster was professor of chemistry at the Medical School {{during the time of}} the highly publicized murder.

5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of}} a confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
5|$|After his April 2000 release, Bell {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997–2000 criminal case, {{and that he was}} going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E

The siege of Kijevo was the first instance of application of the strategy of ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. The events at Kijevo {{were not included in the}} indictment at the trial of Ratko Mladić, but the Croatian judiciary tried Mladić in absentia for war crimes committed in Kijevo. He <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing no music or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{opposition}} to the Exclusion Bill angered some Protestants. Protestant conspirators formulated the Rye House Plot, a plan to murder him and the Duke of York as they returned to London after horse races in Newmarket. A great fire, however, destroyed Charles's lodgings at Newmarket, which forced {{him to leave the}} races early, thus, inadvertently, avoiding the planned attack. News of the failed plot was leaked. Protestant politicians such as Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, Algernon Sydney, Lord William Russell and the Duke of Monmouth were implicated in the plot. Lord Essex slit his own throat while imprisoned in the Tower of London; Sydney and Russell were executed for high treason on very flimsy evidence; and the Duke of Monmouth went into exile at the court of William of Orange. Lord Danby and the surviving Catholic lords held in the Tower were released and the king's Catholic brother, James, acquired greater influence at court. Titus Oates <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> imprisoned for defamation.|$|E

5|$|In February 1943, the West Nohno {{completed}} her nine-month journey {{when she arrived}} at Mobile, Alabama, after sailing via Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and Key West. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported that during this voyage, seaman James Orville Couchois had incited subordination and disloyalty among the crew. The head of the Naval Armed Guard detachment aboard West Nohno reported Couchois' activities, as well as comments from other crew members on the ship. After the ship had docked at Mobile, Couchois {{was removed from the}} ship and ultimately faced a trial for sedition. Couchois, who was the deck manager for the National Maritime Union of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> sentenced to a prison term of five years.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls for wearing the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to public schools. Contrary to police advice, {{he chose not}} to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E
5|$|The first NCMP {{to take up}} a seat in Parliament, Dr. Lee Siew-Choh of the WP, did so {{following}} the 1988 general election at which Chiam See Tong was the only opposition MP elected. The WP's Lee and Francis Seow were declared elected as NCMPs on 16 December 1988. However, on 9 January 1989 the Speaker of Parliament Tan Soo Khoon announced that Seow had lost his seat with effect from 17 December 1988 under Article 45 of the Constitution after he <b>was</b> <b>convicted</b> <b>and</b> fined for tax evasion. In the general election that followed in 1991, no NCMP seats were offered because four opposition members were successful in their respective electoral divisions, and thus the number of opposition MPs exceeded the three allotted NCMP seats.|$|E
