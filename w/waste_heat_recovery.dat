40|$|AbstractCement {{industry}} plays a {{vital role}} in the process of urbanization and industrialization in China. This paper disaggregates cement consumptions into five large subsectors: building, railway, highway, rural infrastructure and others. We suggest that cement demand will reach the peak of 2. 5 billion tons in 2017, followed by a slowly reduction in the next 10 years and a gradually decrease from 2. 3 billion tons in 2030 to 1. 5 billion tons in 2050. Based on the scenarios analysis of China TIMES model, this paper shows that carbon tax doesn’t work significantly on the technology choice and CO 2 emission reduction in the short term. However, in a long run, high carbon tax may increase the application of production with CCS or <b>wasted</b> <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> and cut down the small- and medium-sized plants.

40|$|This paper proposes and {{implements}} a thermoelectric <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> energy <b>recovery</b> {{system for}} {{internal combustion engine}} automobiles, including gasoline vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. The key is to directly convert the heat energy from automotive <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> to electrical energy using a thermoelectric generator, which is then regulated by a DC-DC Ćuk converter to charge a battery using maximum power point tracking. Hence, the electrical power stored in the battery can be maximized. Both analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system can work well under different working conditions, and is promising for automotive industry. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>waste</b> <b>heat</b> {{and water}} <b>recovery</b> {{technology}} {{based on a}} nanoporous ceramic membrane water vapor separation mechanism was developed, to extract the water vapor and its latent heat from low temperature high moisture content waste gas streams. For the water reclamation process, water vapor condenses inside the membrane pores and passes through to the permeate side which is {{in direct contact with}} a low-temperature water stream. Contaminants such as CO 2, O 2, NOx, and SO 2 are inhibited from passing through the membrane by its high selectivity. The recovered water is of high quality and mineral free, therefore can be used as supplemental makeup water for almost all industrial processes. The membrane based technology has been first developed and demonstrated for industrial boiler flue gas <b>heat</b> and water <b>recovery.</b> Now it is being developed for wider applications, from residential humidification, commercial laundry, biomass production to utility boilers.
