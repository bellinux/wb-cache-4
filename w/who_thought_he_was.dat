On 31 March 2008, {{two days after the}} initial attack, Lynch persuaded Piper to go to an internet cafe to read an email he had sent to her Facebook account.

25|$|An earlier {{franchisee}} of Burger King, the Guptas, {{on their}} visit to London, realised that fast food could also work in India.

The outlet was initially named Chaat Factory (Snack Factory), and vada pav was sold at 5, despite street vendors selling the same product for 2. The name was later changed to Jumbo King. Gupta faced opposition from his family, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wasting his MBA by selling vada pavs.|$|E
500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{studies and}} his change in {{attitude}} regarding music education brought him the scorn of his fellow nationalists, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> throwing away his Russian heritage to compose fugues and sonatas. After he strove [...] "to crowd in as much counterpoint as possible" [...] into his Third Symphony, he wrote chamber works adhering strictly to classical models, including a string sextet, a string quartet in F minor and a quintet for flute, clarinet, horn, bassoon and piano. About the quartet and the symphony, Tchaikovsky wrote to his patroness, Nadezhda von Meck, that they [...] "were filled {{with a host of}} clever things but... imbued with a dryly pedantic character". Borodin commented that when he heard the symphony, he kept [...] "feeling that this is the work of a German Herr Professor who has put on his glasses and is about to write Eine grosse Symphonie in C".|$|E
500|$|Hextall {{returned}} to Brandon for the 1981–82 season, {{playing for the}} Brandon Wheat Kings in the Western Hockey League (WHL). He played 30 regular season games for the Wheat Kings, during which he recorded a GAA of 5.71. The Wheat Kings reached the playoffs but were swept four games to none (4–0) in the first-round by the Regina Pats. Hextall played {{in three of the}} games, but completed only two and had a GAA of 9.32. His team was regarded as a poor one at the time by critics and Hextall had to battle in each game. Flyers' scout Gerry Melnyk said he could understand why many teams did not rate Hextall: [...] "There were teams <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> loony." [...] Melnyk claimed it was these attributes which he was attracted by, and he felt that Hextall could fit in well with the Flyers. Subsequently, the Flyers chose Hextall in the sixth round of the 1982 NHL Draft, 119th overall.|$|E

500|$|Feller started Game One of the 1948 World Series {{against the}} NL-champion Boston Braves. In the eighth inning, Feller and Boudreau {{appeared}} to have picked off the Braves' Phil Masi as he attempted to steal a base, but umpire Bill Stewart ruled he was safe. Masi scored the only run of the game on a Braves single. Despite surrendering just two hits on 85 pitches for the game, Feller and the Indians lost 1–0. Later, photographs showed that Boudreau had tagged Masi out by two feet. Feller said, [...] "Stewart was the only guy in the park <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> safe." [...] Feller was again named the starter in Game Five, which set an attendance record; the 86,288 fans in Cleveland was the then-largest attendance at a baseball game. The Braves put up three runs {{in the top of}} the first inning. The Indians came back to tie the game, but by the seventh inning the Braves regained the lead for good and Feller was removed from the game. He finished having allowed eight hits and seven earned runs. Lemon won Game Six and gave the Indians their second World Series championship. After the Indians returned to Cleveland and were given a victory parade, Feller said, [...] "This is as good as being President." ...|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{committed}} {{human rights}} abuses in Anbar Province, often involving civilians {{caught in the middle}} of the conflict. [...] By late 2005, abuses had gotten so common that one American officer nonchalantly referred to [...] "discovering... 20 bodies here, 20 bodies there" [...] and the head of MNF-W referred to them as [...] "a cost of doing business." [...] During Operation Steel Curtain, insurgents forced their way into peoples' houses and held them hostage while engaging in gun battles with American forces, who often destroyed the homes. One Sunni Iraqi family described how in 2006 they fled the sectarian violence in Baghdad to Hīt. During their yearlong stay in Hīt, they watched AQI fighters kidnap a man for talking back to them; the fighters later dumped the man's body on his doorstep. The family also watched an American patrol hit a mine in front of their house, and worried that the Americans would conduct reprisal killings on the family. [...] An Iraqi sheikh spoke about how he was accidentally shot and arrested by the Americans and thrown in Abu Ghraib prison where he was tortured. [...] After his release he was targeted by insurgents in Fallujah <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an American spy.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, Đurić {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the newly formed Bosnian Olympic Committee to compete for Bosnia and Herzegovina in the C-1 500 m canoeing event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Despite not having trained {{for two years and}} the ongoing conflict between the Serbs and the Bosniaks, he accepted the request as he ultimately decided he was first and foremost a sportsman. As the Bosnian Olympic Committee could not afford to pay for his travel, he had to hitch-hike his way over [...] to Barcelona. With only a letter from the Olympic Committee and no valid passport, he managed to get a truck ride to the Austrian border but was initially refused passage by a disbelieving immigration officer <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a refugee seeking asylum. After convincing them of his credentials with a phone call to the Olympic Committee, the border guards helped him persuade someone to take him half-way to Slovenia, where he managed to get another ride to the airport and flew to Barcelona. A two-day trek later, he made it to the Summer Olympics where he was one of Bosnia's ten debuting competitors. He had to borrow equipment from the Italian and Spanish teams to complete in the event and was eliminated in the repechages. After the Olympics, he resumed his football career with Szeged LC.|$|E

2500|$|In 1958 Burton {{appeared}} with Yvonne Furneaux in DuPont Show of the Month's 90-minute television adaptation of Emily Brontë's classic novel Wuthering Heights as Heathcliff. The film, directed by Daniel Petrie, aired on 9 May 1958 on CBS with Burton garnering plaudits {{from both the}} critics and Philip, <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "magnificent" [...] in it.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the FBI {{had more}} than 200 leads in the case. The {{majority}} of leads were outside Arizona and dozens were outside the United States, including possible sightings in Canada. Due to his [...] "California surfer dude" [...] appearance {{and his ability to}} blend into crowds, the FBI has had more leads on Brown than anyone else on the Ten Most Wanted list, with most of the leads unhelpful. Reporters have noted he bears a close resemblance to actor Sean Penn, and one of Penn's body doubles was once mistakenly arrested by authorities <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> Brown. Authorities believe that he may be hiding among the Mormon community under an assumed identity, living with a woman who may not know his real identity, or that he has fled the country and could be living in France or Thailand.|$|E
2500|$|All {{this was}} a radical {{departure}} from the laws and the lawmaking of European monarchs and elites. Over twenty drafts, Penn laboured to create his [...] "Framework of Government". He borrowed liberally from John Locke who later had a similar influence on Thomas Jefferson, but added his own revolutionary idea—the use of amendments—to enable a written framework that could evolve with the changing times. He stated, [...] "Governments, like clocks, go from the motion men give them." [...] Penn hoped that an amendable constitution would accommodate dissent and new ideas and also allow meaningful societal change without resorting to violent uprisings or revolution. Remarkably, though the Crown reserved the right to override any law it wished, Penn's skillful stewardship did not provoke any government reaction while Penn remained in his province. Despite criticism by some Quaker friends that Penn was setting himself above them by taking on this powerful position, and by his enemies <b>who</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a fraud and [...] "falsest villain upon earth", Penn was ready to begin the [...] "Holy Experiment". Bidding goodbye to his wife and children, he reminded them to [...] "avoid pride, avarice, and luxury".|$|E
