5|$|On the Faroe Islands mainly Pilot Whales {{are killed}} by drive hunts for their meat and blubber. Other species are also killed on rare {{occasion}} such as the Northern bottlenose whale and Atlantic <b>White-sided</b> <b>Dolphin.</b> The Northern bottlenose whale is mainly killed when it accidentally swims {{too close to the}} beach and cannot return to the water. When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the program date back to 1960, when a Pacific <b>White-sided</b> <b>Dolphin</b> was {{acquired}} for hydrodynamic studies seeking to improve torpedo performance.

25|$|An {{experiment}} on the California drift gill net fishery demonstrated how acoustic pingers reduce marine mammal bycatch. It was shown that bycatch was significantly reduced for common dolphins and sea lions. Bycatch rates were also lower for other cetacean species like the Northern right whale dolphin, Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphin,</b> Rissoâ€™s dolphin and Dall's Porpoise.

2500|$|... 26 {{species of}} marine mammals, {{including}} whales, dolphins, seals, and sea lions, {{are known to}} frequent {{the waters of the}} sanctuary. In addition, Cordell Bank {{is one of the most}} important feeding grounds in the world for the endangered blue and humpback whales; these species travel all the way from their breeding grounds in coastal Mexico and Central America to feed on the krill that aggregate near the bank. Another unique species is the Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphin</b> (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), which can be seen in large numbers. Other visitors include California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), northern elephant seals [...] (Mirounga angustirostris), northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), all of which are attracted to the abundance in krill, squid, and juvenile fish. Leatherback sea turtles also inhabit sanctuary waters.|$|E

40|$|<b>White-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are found}} in {{temperate}} and sub-polar waters of the North Atlantic, primarily on continental shelf waters to the 100 m depth contour. The species occurs from central west Greenland to the Chesapeake Bay (about 37 EN) and perhaps as far east as 55 o W (Evans 1987). There is no information concerning stock structure within this range. <b>White-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> are most common in continental shelf waters from Hudson Canyon (approximately 39 EN) north through Georges Bank, in the Gulf of Maine to the lower Bay of Fundy. Low numbers of <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> occur from Chesapeake Bay to Jeffreys Ledge (off New Hampshire) during winter and early spring (January to April). From May through June, large aggregations are found from Georges Bank to the southwest Gulf of Maine, while some animals have been seen from the southern Grand Banks, along Newfoundland and into the Labrador Sea. From July to December, the distribution of sightings extends from Georges Bank to the lower Bay of Fundy (Payne and Heinemann 1990) and along Nova Scotia all the way along the coasts to the Labrador Sea and west Greenland (Gaskin 1992). Before the 1960 's, <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> in U. S. waters were usually found offshore on the continental slope.

50|$|Studies {{conducted}} on Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins,</b> {{as well as}} Risso's Dolphin have revealed a multitude of things about how they communicate as a species, which was revealed to be vastly different from bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins. The studies have revealed that their notches and spectral peaks happen to be more low pitched when juxtaposed with the bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins as mentioned earlier. Other studies have revealed some very similar behaviors. From on two studies conducted back in 2010 and 2011, {{it was revealed that}} the vocalizations of Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> can range differently only from their behavioral states, indicated strong similarities between the acoustic and surface behavior for various foraging behaviors, including the possibility of an undescribed subspecies. The oceanographical data in the area can also effect the behavioral patterns of the dolphins. The studies also revealed that the different types of echolocations do vary based on the geographical locations; the first population of Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> that were observed, inhabiting the waters near the Pacific United States seemed to more activity during the night while the second population of Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins,</b> that were also observed, inhabiting areas near Baja California, were observed to be more active during the day. Some argue there are two major factors which are the cause of this sort of behavior: the seasons and the dolphins search for prey.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} an average-sized oceanic dolphin. Females weigh up to 150 kg and males 200 kg with males {{reaching}} 2.5 m and females 2.3 m in length. Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> usually {{tend to be}} larger than dusky dolphins. Females reach maturity at seven years. From 1990 to 1991, {{a study conducted by}} Richard C. Ferrero and William A. Walker revealed the vast majority of Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> that fell victim to the drift nets were between the ages of 8.3 to 11 when they sexually matured. The gestation period usually last for one year. Individuals are believed to live up 40 years or more.|$|R

40|$|<b>White-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> {{are found}} in {{temperate}} and sub-polar waters of the North Atlantic, primarily in continental shelf waters to the 100 m depth contour. The species inhabits waters from central West Greenland to North Carolina (about 35 ÂºN) and perhaps as far east as 43 ÂºW (Evans 1987). Distribution of sightings, strandings and incidental takes suggest the possible existence of three stocks units: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence and Labrador Sea stocks (Palka et al. 1997). Evidence for a separation between the well-documented unit in the southern Gulf of Maine and a Gulf of St. Lawrence population comes from a hiatus of summer sightings along the Atlantic side of Nova Scotia. This {{has been reported in}} Gaskin (1992), is evident in Smithsonian stranding records, and was seen during abundance surveys conducted in the summers of 1995 and 1999 that covered waters from Virginia to the entrance of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. <b>White-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> were seen frequently in Gulf of Maine waters and in waters {{at the mouth of the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence, but only a few sightings were recorded between these two regions. The Gulf of Maine stock of <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> is most common in continental shelf waters from Hudson Canyon (approximately 39 ÂºN) north through Georges Bank, and in the Gulf of Maine to the lower Bay of Fundy. Sightings data indicate seasonal shifts in distribution (Northridge et al. 1997). During January to May, low numbers of <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> are found from Georges Bank to Jeffreys Ledge (off New Hampshire), and even lower numbers are south of Georges Bank, as documented by a few strandings collected on beaches of Virginia and North Carolina. From June through September, large numbers of <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> are found from Georges Bank to the lower Bay of Fundy. From October to December, whitesided dolphins occur at intermediate densities from southern Georges Bank to southern Gulf of Maine (Payne and Heinemann 1990). Sightings south o...|$|R

50|$|These {{groups have}} been {{observed}} socializing with common bottlenose <b>dolphins,</b> Atlantic <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins</b> and Risso's dolphins.

5000|$|In addition, a {{reversed}} {{version of}} the [...] "group edge effect" [...] has been observed in pods of Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins.</b> Dolphins swimming {{on the left side}} of the pod have their right eyes open while dolphins swimming on the right side of the pod have their left eyes open. Unlike in some species of birds, the open eyes of these cetaceans are facing the inside of the group, not the outside. The dangers of possible predation do not play a significant role during USWS in Pacific <b>white-sided</b> <b>dolphins.</b> It has been suggested that this species utilizes this reversed {{version of the}} [...] "group edge effect" [...] in order to maintain pod formation and cohesion while maintaining unihemispheric slow-wave sleep.|$|R
