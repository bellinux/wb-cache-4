50|$|In June 1987, Mr. Rieber was {{succeeded by}} Mr. David Winkler. Mr. Winkler {{had served as}} a teacher and {{administrator}} at DeSales for twelve years prior to his appointment as principal. His primary goals were to promote the vitality of DeSales and to work toward its long-term financial security. Under his guidance an IBM networked computer lab was created to permit each student to have his own <b>work</b> <b>file</b> for word processing and tutorial programs. Joint programs with CARITAS Hospital and the Jefferson County Police Department permitted each DeSales student to gain first-hand information about careers in health services and police and law enforcement. With regard to financial security, DeSales joined with the Archdiocese of Louisville to set four-year tuition rates and provide in excess of $75,000 per year in financial aid to deserving families.|$|E
50|$|UUCP can use several {{different}} types of physical connections and link layer protocols, but was most commonly used over dial-up connections. Before the widespread availability of Internet access, computers were only connected by smaller private networks within a company or organization. They were also often equipped with modems {{so they could be}} used remotely from character-mode terminals via dial-up telephone lines. UUCP used the computers' modems to dial out to other computers, establishing temporary, point-to-point links between them. Each system in a UUCP network has a list of neighbor systems, with phone numbers, login names and passwords, etc. When <b>work</b> (<b>file</b> transfer or command execution requests) is queued for a neighbor system, the uucico program typically calls that system to process the work. The uucico program can also poll its neighbors periodically to check for work queued on their side; this permits neighbors without dial-out capability to participate.|$|E

One day, Sean meets [...] "Duke" [...] Wayne (George Wendt), who introduces Sean to his boss, a shady developer named Ray Matthews (Daniel Baldwin). Ray hires Sean as a spy, and orders him to follow Eric Gatley (Ron Livingston), an accountant who has been investigating Ray's company. Problems start when Ray, while drunk, offers Sean $13,000 to kill Eric. Sean accepts his offer and, although ambivalent, ends up killing Gatley by breaking into his house and beating him to death. When Sean goes to collect his pay, however, he is double-crossed and when he insists that they pay him, he is kidnapped and taken to Ray's secluded farm. It emerges that Matthews never had any intention of paying Sean for the killing, for he only wanted to use and eliminate him. But Sean survives from having a bullet put in his head then reveals that he had taken Gatley's <b>work</b> <b>file</b> of evidence and hidden it along with his documentation of events leading to the murder.|$|E
50|$|Rachel {{arrived in}} Beckindale in 1988 {{with her mother}} Kate and brother Mark after her parents divorced. Her mother began a feud with Joe Sugden in late 1988 after he shot and killed her dog because it was bothering his sheep. However, in early 1989, Joe and Kate fell in love and were married in April that year and Rachel was more {{accepting}} of her mother's new relationship unlike her brother Mark who wanted their parents to reconcile. Rachel began an affair with married man Pete Whiteley on her 18th birthday. He ended it when his wife, Lynn, became pregnant and they {{moved away from the}} village. Pete later returned and began seeing Rachel again until he was accidentally run over and killed by Rachel's mother, Kate. Lynn later got her revenge on Rachel by embarking on a relationship with Rachel's former stepfather, Joe. On 30 December 1993, a plane exploded over Beckindale, killing Rachel's brother, Mark. The disaster also left Chris Tate in a wheelchair. Rachel then began giving Chris swimming lessons and they embarked an affair. Chris's wife Kathy saw them kissing on their third wedding anniversary and attacked Rachel, banging her head against a wall. In December 1994, Rachel discovered that she was two months pregnant with Chris's baby and in June 1995, she gave birth to their son, Joseph Mark Tate, on the same day her former stepfather Joe Sugden died, naming her son in his honour. Kathy was present when Rachel went into labour and stayed with her on the journey to the hospital as Chris was nowhere to be found. This led to the two women becoming best friends and Rachel named Kathy as Joseph's godmother. On 7 December 1995, Rachel and Chris got married with Jack Sugden and his wife, Sarah, as witnesses. Chris wanted them to have another child and went for fertility treatment but Rachel secretly went on the pill. Chris and Rachel split up after Chris betrayed Rachel by stealing private information from her <b>work</b> <b>file</b> and Rachel was granted custody of Joseph. In July 1997, Rachel received news that her mother Kate had died of a brain haemorrhage. Rachel then embarked on an affair with Jack Sugden after he comforted her and attended the funeral with her for support. This was her third affair with a married man. However, Jack had no intention of breaking up his marriage and returned to his wife, Sarah.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The rapid {{expansion}} of the Internet means that users increasingly want to interact with each other. Due to the openness and unsecure nature of the Net, users often {{have to rely on}} firewalls to protect their connections. Firewalls, however, make real-time interaction and collaboration more difficult. Firewalls are also complicated to configure and expensive to install and maintain, and they are inaccessible to small home offices and mobile users. The Enclaves approach is to transform user machines into “enclaves, ” which are protected from outside interference and attacks. Using Enclaves, a group of collaborators can dynamically form a secure virtual subnet within which to conduct their joint business. This paper describes the design and implementation of the Enclaves toolkit and some applications we have built using the toolkit. Index Terms—Authentication, co-editing, collaborative <b>work,</b> <b>file</b> sharing, secure group communication, security. I...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 178 - 181. In {{this study}} the writer {{assumed that the}} psycho-social {{characteristics}} of physically disabled patients would influence the role and task of the medical social worker at the Rehabilitation Clinic. Therefore {{an attempt was made}} to determine the psycho-social characteristics of patients referred to the Rehabilitation Clinic. Furthermore an attempt was made to determine the role and task of the medical social worker in relation to these psycho-social characteristics. The research method was a descriptive one, using archival data; the latter being social work records of interviews with patients. Prior to the research a literature study was done on various aspects of physical disability and vocational rehabilitation. A sample group of 45 subjects was compiled by a random sampling technique. Two structured schedules were used to extract data from both the social <b>work</b> <b>file</b> and the Rehabilitation Clinic patient file. The research and processing of the information was done manually. The findings revealed the following 1. The majority of the physically disabled patients were Coloured males in the age category of 31 - 50 years. 2. These patients had poor educational qualifications and were previously unskilled or semi-skilled labourers. 3. The patients were unemployed and had no income. 4. These patients had a passive lifestyle with no hobbies or little religious involvement. They also habitually abused liquor and/or cannabis. 5. The housing conditions of these patients were inadequate and primitive. 6. The various roles of the medical social worker included those of rehabilitation counsellor, team member, co-ordinator/resource manager and teacher, whereas the tasks included assessment, dissemination of information, referrals, co-ordinating of services and education. The final conclusion in this study was that the role and task of medical social worker was influenced by both the psycho-social characteristics of referred patients as well as the expectations of the rehabilitation team of the Rehabilitation Clinic...|$|E
40|$|The {{previous}} chapter {{focused on}} data display, {{with very little}} or no attention paid to DataView’s analysis capabilities. However, as noted before, in practice {{there is not a}} hard-and-fast separation between display and analysis. DataView lets you combine and transform variables just by typing the formula, even in the context of what is ostensibly a display command; for example the expressions: 100 *(CONS+GOVP) /GNP exp(0. 2 *ln(WPAGR) + 0. 2 *ln(WPEN)) can be displayed as plots or a tabular transformation display as easily as can a single series. Moreover, the commands can be captured from one context and pasted into another in less time than it has taken for you to read this. DataView has been specifically designed to foster this type of coordinated processing whenever possible, with the aim of permitting you to do your work without having to worry about the details. Nevertheless, there are times when it is helpful to know something about {{the way in which the}} program does its processing. In particular, the provision DataView makes for automatic data storage in a Memory File is an important issue and the subject makes a good background introduction to data analysis. In a nutshell, the issue in the abstract is that when transformations of existing data series are made and stored, they need to be put somewhere. 86 Managing and Analyzing Data The Memory File Whenever data series are created explicitly, or as a by-product of some operation, if they need to be stored longer than a few seconds DataView will usually put them into a temporary <b>work</b> <b>file</b> known as a “Memory File. ” If this file already contains other data series, the new series are simply added to the file. However, if the file does not exist, then it will be created automatically as needed. Consider a simple example: In order to perform a calculation, DataView usually needs to know something about the data to be used, generally the observation frequency and the date range. Thus it is good practice to begin by setting the frequency and dates, either by clicking on the status bar or using the Settings menu. Alternatively, from the Central Control screen you can issue the commands...|$|E
