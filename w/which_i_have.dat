25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> described eight groups in , has {{enabled me to}} conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism. This discovery brought with it the need {{to rise above the}} opposition and to create a theory which would do justice not merely to one or the other side, but to both equally (Jung, 1966: pars. 65-66).|$|E
6000|$|Still, those horrible {{memories}} <b>had,</b> <b>I</b> am {{bound to}} say, a useful part in my {{preparation for the}} ordeal.

With such experiences behind me, could there be aught before me more dreadful? [...] .|$|R
60|$|Thus far the {{information}} <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> received from Mrs. Clements--though it established facts of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not previously been aware--was of a preliminary character only.|$|R
60|$|Her face brightened; {{she came}} a step nearer to me. Her fingers trifled nervously with a flower <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> picked in the garden, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{put into the}} button-hole of my coat.|$|R
25|$|Hear ye!

25|$|My servant draws near to Me through nothing I love {{more than}} that <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made {{obligatory}} for him. My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.|$|E
25|$|At {{three o'clock}} p.m. on Monday at St. George's Mortuary, Dr. Blackwell and I made a post mortem examination. Rigor mortis was still {{thoroughly}} marked. There was mud {{on the left}} side of the face and it was matted in the head. The body was fairly nourished. Over both shoulders, especially the right, and under the collarbone and in front of the chest there was a bluish discoloration, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> watched and have seen on two occasions since.|$|E
60|$|In {{the spring}} of the year {{eighteen}} hundred and forty-nine I was wandering in the East, and had then recently altered the travelling plans <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> laid out some months before, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> communicated to my lawyer and my banker in London.|$|R
60|$|I {{handed him}} the typewritten {{communication}} <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> received.|$|R
60|$|Her Will! I {{thought of}} the drops <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen in her work-box. I {{thought of the}} bluish tinge <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> noticed in her complexion. A light which was not of this world--a light shining prophetically from an unmade grave--dawned on my mind. My aunt's secret was a secret no longer.|$|R
25|$|The {{government}} accepted most {{of these}} recommendations, but also kept {{the status quo in}} Somerset ("after taking account of the number and strength of the representations which I received opposing the recommendations"), and in North Yorkshire retained a rump two-tier North Yorkshire without York ("in the light of the strong representations <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> received opposing the Commission's recommendations for North and West Riding")â€“ both reportedly the subject of strong lobbying by local Conservative MPs. The government did not accept the recommendations of the Commission on Gloucestershire, and announced its intention to refer the county back. These changes were implemented in 1996.|$|E
25|$|From the minuteness with <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> traced Waverley's pursuits, and {{the bias}} which they unavoidably communicated to his imagination, the reader may perhaps anticipate, in the {{following}} tale, an imitation of Cervantes. But he will do my prudence injustice in the supposition. My intention is not to follow the steps of that inimitable author, in describing such total perversion of intellect as misconstrues the objects actually presented to the senses, but that more common aberration from sound judgment, which apprehends occurrences indeed in their reality, but communicates to them a tincture of its own romantic tone and colouring.|$|E
25|$|During the 13 months (in the) almost continual and {{sustained}} combat in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever participated, there were moments, and rare ones, I am sure; but they lose {{none of their}} terror or horror for which fear laid a relentless and a powerful hold on me, that the pull of cowardice was almost more than I could ward off. There were terrible moments that encompassed a lifetime, an endlessness, when terror was so strong in me, that I could feel idiocy replace reason. (Yet,) I have never left my position, nor have I shirked hazardous duty. Fear {{did not make a}} coward out of me.|$|E

25|$|Now, Six {{of these}} works were {{illustrated}} entirely by me, and one-Windsor Castle-partly so, numbering altogether ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FOUR {{of the very best}} designs and etchings <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever produced; and yet, in this Biographical Sketch, my name is not mentioned in any way as connected with these works-which omission, I thought, was not only very ungenerous, but also very unjust... And, when it was announced that Mr. Andrew Halliday had dramatized Ainsworth's 'Miser's Daughter,' I went to see the performance; and when I saw represented on the stage scenes and characters which had emanated from me, I then publicly claimed to be the originator of that romance, and to have suggested the original idea and characters to Mr. Ainsworth.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimate}} aim {{for those}} 11 years during <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been the Reichsfuehrer SS has been invariably the same: {{to create an}} order of good blood which is able to serve Germany; which unfailingly and without sparing itself can be made use of because the greatest losses can do no harm to the vitality of this order, the vitality of these men, because they will always be replaced; to create an order which will spread the idea of Nordic blood so far that we will attract all Nordic blood in the world, take away the blood from our adversaries, absorb it so that never again, {{looking at it from}} the viewpoint of grand policy, Nordic blood, in great quantities and to an extent worth mentioning, will fight against us.|$|E
25|$|I am {{forced to}} the appalling {{conclusion}} that I {{would never have}} become a writer but for Joan's death, and to a realization {{of the extent to}} which this event has motivated and formulated my writing. I live with the constant threat of possession, and a constant need to escape from possession, from control. So the death of Joan brought me in contact with the invader, the Ugly Spirit, and maneuvered me into a life long struggle, in <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had no choice except to write my way out. The 25th anniversary edition of Queer published in 2010, edited by Oliver Harris, called into question Burroughs's claim, and clarified the importance for Queer of Burroughs's traumatic relationship with the boyfriend fictionalized in the story as Eugene Allerton, rather than the shooting of Vollmer.|$|E

25|$|Near the {{southern}} border of Shandong one finds a kind of wheelbarrow much larger than that <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been describing, and drawn by a horse or a mule. But judge by my surprise when today I saw a whole fleet of wheelbarrows of the same size. I say, with deliberation, a fleet, {{for each of them}} had a sail, mounted on a small mast exactly fixed in a socket arranged at the forward end of the barrow. The sail, made of matting, or more often of cloth, is five or six feet high, and three or four feet broad, with stays, sheets, and halyards, just as on a Chinese ship. The sheets join the shafts of the wheelbarrow and can thus be manipulated by the man in charge.|$|E
25|$|If {{the reader}} has also {{received}} {{the benefit of}} the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.|$|E
25|$|I John Audubon, {{having this}} day mutual consent with Ferdinand Rozier, {{dissolved}} and forever closed the partnership and firm of Audubon and Rozier, and having Received from said Ferdinand Rozier payment and notes {{to the full}} amount of my part of the goods and debts of the late firm of Audubon and Rozier, I the said John Audubon one of the firm aforesaid do hereby release and forever quit claim to all and any interest <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> or may have in the stock on hand and debts due to the late firm of Audubon and Rozier assign, transfer and set over to said Ferdinand Rozier, all my rights, titles, claims and interest in the goods, merchandise and debts due to the late firm of Audubon and Rozier, and do hereby authorize and empower him for my part, to collect the same in any manner what ever either privately or by suit or suits in law or equity hereby declaring him sole and absolute proprietor and rightful owner of all goods, merchandise and debts of this firm aforesaid, as completely as they were the goods and property of the late firm Audubon and Rozier.|$|E
60|$|I {{need not}} say how punctually my new agent acted; but, which was more, she brought {{the old man and}} his wife, and my other daughter, several times to her house, by <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> an opportunity, being there only as a lodger, and a stranger, to see my other girl, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never done before, since she was a little child.|$|R
60|$|Then Mrs. Makely {{would put}} me forward, and I would {{be obliged to}} give such account of him as I could, and to explain just how and why he came to be my guest; with the {{cumulative}} effect of bringing back all the misgivings <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> myself felt at the outset concerning him, and <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> dismissed as too fantastic.|$|R

25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E
