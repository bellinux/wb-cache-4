5|$|Blatty was a Roman Catholic. In 2012, {{he filed}} a canon law {{petition}} against {{his alma mater}} Georgetown University. According to Blatty, the school for decades has been at variance with Catholic church teaching by inviting speakers <b>who</b> <b>support</b> abortion rights, and disobeying Pope John Paul II's instructions issued to church-affiliated {{colleges and universities in}} 1990.|$|E

5|$|In the ONA's terminology, {{the terms}} Drecc and Niner refer to folk-based or gang-based culture or {{individuals}} <b>who</b> <b>support</b> the Order's aims by practical (including criminal) means rather than esoteric ones.

5|$|Opinions on the sex {{industry}} are diverse. Feminists critical of the {{sex industry}} generally {{see it as the}} exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists <b>who</b> <b>support</b> at least part of {{the sex industry}} argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|After Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery, which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's Cato. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> it.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} {{is the fact}} that both Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, <b>who</b> <b>support</b> Olimpija. The two groups are the largest in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E

50|$|The Conservative Party's origins {{go back to}} {{the fall}} of Bernardo O'Higgins' {{government}} on January 28, 1823. The Chilean political situation during those years was divided into six main groups: the pelucones, conservatives <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> authority and stability over personal freedoms; the pipiolos, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> personal freedoms even over stability; the liberales, moderates <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> personal freedoms; the federalistas, mainly liberales and pipiolos <b>who</b> also <b>supported</b> a federalist system {{similar to that of the}} United States; the o'higginistas, supporters of O'Higgins, who had gone into exile; and the carrerinos, supported of O'Higgins' old enemy José Miguel Carrera, who had been executed in Argentina.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{constant}} power struggle between the Orangists, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> the stadtholders and specifically the princes of Orange, and the Republicans, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> the States General and hoped to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the stadtholdership with a true republican structure.|$|R
5|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Lebrón {{was hospitalized}} {{multiple}} times, the first being {{due to a}} fall that fractured her hip and an arm, requiring surgery. On September 18, 2009, she suffered a notable relapse due to a cardio respiratory affection. Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory manner and issued a press release in appreciation for the public's support. Complications from this episode of bronchitis, however, persisted throughout 2010, leading to her death on August 1, 2010. Multiple public figures, <b>who</b> <b>support</b> independence or free association for Puerto Rico, immediately lamented Lebrón's death, praising her activism. Her life was eulogized even in European papers.|$|E
5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in immortality. While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists <b>who</b> <b>support</b> evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E
5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic canard, {{originally}} published in Russian in 1903, alleging a Judeo-Masonic conspiracy to achieve world domination. The text purports to be the minutes of the secret meetings of a cabal of Jewish masterminds, which has co-opted Freemasonry and is plotting to rule the world {{on behalf of all}} Jews because they believe themselves to be the chosen people of God. The Protocols incorporate many of the core conspiracist themes outlined in the Robison and Barruel attacks on the Freemasons, and overlay them with antisemitic allegations about anti-Tsarist movements in Russia. The Protocols reflect themes similar to more general critiques of Enlightenment liberalism by conservative aristocrats <b>who</b> <b>support</b> monarchies and state religions. The interpretation intended by the publication of The Protocols is that if one peels away the layers of the Masonic conspiracy, past the Illuminati, one finds the rotten Jewish core.|$|E
50|$|A {{cavalier}} was traditionally a mounted soldier or knight, {{but when}} the term was applied to those <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> Charles {{it was meant to}} portray them as roistering gallants. The term was thus meant to belittle and insult. However, it became the term applied to those <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> Charles. The previous three sentences are cyclical and self-referencing, thus are meaningless. They were separate in their lifestyle and divided on religion from the Roundheads, <b>who</b> <b>supported</b> Parliament, consisting often of Puritans (either Presbyterians or Independents).|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the pay-per-view, Punk {{cashed in}} his Money in the Bank {{contract}} to defeat Jeff Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship. Punk retained his title in a Triple Threat match against both Edge and Hardy eight days later on the June 15 episode of Raw. At The Bash, Punk lost to Hardy by disqualification after kicking the referee; in the storyline Punk injured his eye and said that he could not see the referee. Because titles do not change hands on a disqualification, Punk retained the championship. Hardy called Punk's eye injury into question, believing it to be feigned. Punk turned heel, claiming to be the moral superior of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> Hardy due to his drug-free lifestyle. At Night of Champions, Punk lost the championship to Hardy. Their feud continued through SummerSlam, where Punk regained the title in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match; afterward, Punk was attacked by The Undertaker. On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk concluded his program with Hardy and achieved his booked goal of excising him from WWE, defeating Hardy in a steel cage match wherein the loser agreed to leave the company.|$|E
