2500|$|Spinoza {{argued that}} God exists and is {{abstract}} and impersonal. Spinoza's view of God is what Charles Hartshorne describes as Classical Pantheism. Spinoza {{has also been}} described as an [...] "Epicurean materialist," [...] specifically in reference to his opposition to Cartesian mind-body dualism. This view was held by Epicureans before him, as they believed that atoms with their probabilistic paths were the only substance that existed fundamentally. Spinoza, however, deviated significantly from Epicureans by adhering to strict determinism, much like the Stoics before him, {{in contrast to the}} Epicurean belief in the probabilistic path of atoms, which is more in line with contemporary thought on quantum mechanics. Spinoza's system imparted order and unity to the tradition of radical thought, offering powerful weapons for prevailing against [...] "received authority." [...] He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality which surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality, namely a single, fundamental substance (meaning [...] "that which stands beneath" [...] rather than [...] "matter") that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser [...] "entities" [...] are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause and effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published Ethics. Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then {{it is not clear how}} they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have free will, he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> and act as they do.|$|E

There are few better men than my brother, but his thoughts, and the traditions he is bound by, {{are those of}} fifty years ago, while the restless life of the prairie {{is a thing of}} to-day. We have fallen too far behind it at Silverdale, and a crisis is coming that none of us are {{prepared}} for. Even Dane is scarcely fitted to help my brother to face it, and the rest are either over-fond of their pleasure or untrained boys. Brave lads they are, but none of them have been taught that it is only by mental strain, or the ceaseless toil of his body, the man without an inheritance can win himself a competence now.

That's the {{question}} I've been propounding to myself for many a day--not concerning you merely, but concerning everybody. You see I have not changed, though my sudden apparent appreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that point. I've got the same flesh on my bones, the same ten fingers and toes. I am the same. I have not developed any new strength nor virtue. My brain is the same old brain. I haven't made even one new generalization on literature or philosophy. I am personally of the same value that I was when nobody wanted me. And what is puzzling me is <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> me now. Surely they don't want me for myself, for myself is the same old self they did not want. Then they must want me for something else, for something that is outside of me, for {{something that is not}} I! Shall I tell you what that something is? It is for the recognition I have received. That recognition is not I. It resides in the minds of others. Then again for the money I have earned and am earning. But that money is not I.

30|$|We created two {{questions}} in our semi-structured interviews {{to gauge the}} levels and traits of respondents’ choice of avoidance clothing and styles.

They were also asked <b>why</b> <b>they</b> avoided such clothing. Second, respondents were asked if they avoided any styles of clothing, and if so, <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to avoid being associated with those styles.|$|R
6000|$|October 4.--Slept till nigh ten--fatigued by our toils of yesterday, and the unwonted late hours. Still {{too early}} for this Castle of Indolence, for I found few of last night's party yet appearing. I had an {{opportunity}} of some talk with the Duke. He does not consider Foy's book[50] as written by himself, but as a thing got up perhaps from notes. Says he knew Foy very well in Spain. Mentioned that he was, like other French officers, very desirous of seeing the English papers, through which alone they could collect any idea {{of what was going}} on without their own cantonments, for Napoleon permitted no communication of that kind with France. The Duke, growing tired of this, at length told Baron Tripp, whose services he chiefly used in communication with the outposts, that he was not to give them the newspapers. [...] "What reason shall I allege for withholding them?" [...] said Baron Tripp. [...] "None," [...] replied the Duke. [...] "Let them allege some reason <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> them." [...] Foy was not at a loss to assign a reason. He said he had considerable sums of money in the English funds and wanted to see how Stocks fell and rose. The excuse did not, however, go down[51]. I remember Baron Tripp, a Dutch nobleman, and a dandy of the first water, and yet with an energy in his dandyism which made it respectable. He drove a gig as far as Dunrobin Castle, and back again, without a whip. He looked after his own horse, for he had no servant, and after all his little establishment of clothes and necessaries, with all the accuracy of a petit-maître. He was one of the best-dressed men, and his horse was in equally fine condition as if he had had a dozen of grooms. I met him at Lord Somerville's, and liked him much. But there was something exaggerated, as appeared from the conclusion of his life. Baron Tripp shot himself in Italy for no assignable cause.|$|E
60|$|All convictions, conversions, illuminations, favours, tastes, revelations, knowledge, and mercies, will {{do nothing}} if the soul abides without desires. All, I say, is but like rain upon stones, or favours {{bestowed}} upon a dead dog. O! but a poor man with desires, a man that sees but little, that knows but little, that finds in himself but little, if he has but strong desires, they will supply all. His desires take him up from his sins, from his companions, from his pleasures, and carry him away to God. Suppose thou wast a minister, and wast sent from God with a whip, whose cords were made of the flames of hell, thou mightest lash long enough before thou couldest so much as drive one man that abides without desires to God, or to his kingdom, by that thy so sore a whip. Suppose again that thou wast a minister, and wast sent from God to sinners with a crown of glory in thy hand, to offer to him that first comes to thee for it; yet none can come without desires: but desire takes the man upon its back, and so brings him to thee.[16] What {{is the reason that}} men will with mouth commend God, and commend Christ, and commend and praise both heaven and glory, and yet all the while fly from him, and from his mercy, as from the worst of enemies? <b>Why,</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> good desires; their desires being mischievous, carry them another way. Thou entreatest thy wife, thy husband, and the son of thy womb, to fall in with thy Lord and thy Christ, but they will not. Ask them the reason why they will not, and they know none, only they have no desires. 'When we shall see him, there is no beauty in him that we should desire him' (Isa 53:1-3). And I am sure if they do not desire him, they can by no means be made to come to him.|$|E

First, we examined mentors’ reports of <b>why</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to mentor undergraduates in science (RQ 2). Next, we analyzed the types of difficult experiences reported by mentors, how mentors appraised responsibility for the difficulty, and how these appraisals mapped onto their undergraduates’ scientist identity (RQ 3). It {{is important to note}} that we generally did not find differences in the qualitative responses based on the gender and ethnicity of the mentors.|$|R
