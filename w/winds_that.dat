5|$|After {{affecting}} Guam, Halong quickly strengthened {{and reached}} its peak winds on July12. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (155mph), while the Japan Meteorological Agency estimated 10‑minute winds of 155km/h (100mph). Subsequently, the typhoon weakened greatly while curving to the northeast, although it still passed near Okinawa with strong <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> left widespread power outages. Halong struck southeastern Japan, dropping heavy rainfall and producing strong <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> left $89.8million (¥10.3billion 2002JPY) in damage. There was one death {{in the country and}} nine injuries. Halong became extratropical on July16 and dissipated the next day. The typhoon influenced the monsoon trough in the Philippines, contributing to flooding and deaths in the country.|$|E
5|$|Kickers {{experience}} further disadvantages when attempting {{field goals}} at CenturyLink Field.

5|$|The {{category}} {{listed for}} each state indicates the maximum category of sustained <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> was recorded or analyzed {{to have occurred}} in that state.

5|$|The {{longitudinal}} (or linear) dunes {{were initially}} {{presumed to be}} formed by moderately variable <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes {{may be the result}} of rare storm <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E

5|$|For several days, Gert {{threatened}} to strike Bermuda, prompting {{the evacuation of}} tourists. Although Gert's center did not make landfall, it passed a short distance east of the island, producing hurricane-force <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> left 11,000people without power. High waves swept two people out to sea at Acadia National Park in Maine. Later, strong waves struck Newfoundland and left heavy marine damage.|$|E
5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking of the atmosphere slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane in coastal Florida, it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings. Buildings with well-constructed frames, and those made of steel, concrete, brick, or stone were largely immune to the winds, and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings. Coming {{on the heels of the}} 1926 Miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed, one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codes.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two months}} after Katrina struck south Florida, Hurricane Rita brushed the region in late September with {{tropical}} storm-force winds and flooding rains. In late October, Hurricane Wilma struck southwestern Florida as a major hurricane, affecting the Miami area with hurricane-force <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> left 98% of south Florida without power. Including Hurricane Dennis in July, FEMA provided $1billion in public assistance to Florida residents {{in association with the}} four hurricanes in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Initially exhibiting {{characteristics}} of a monsoonal low, a mid-level ridge {{to the south of}} Graham caused strong westerly <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> moved the storm slowly east-southeastward. However, a deep trough eroded the ridge, allowing the cyclone to move more towards the south. According to the JTWC, the storm had intensified late on 28 February, though {{at the same time the}} BoM noted the slight weakening of the storm. Graham reached its peak intensity that day while nearing the coast.|$|E

5|$|Interacting {{with the}} monsoon, Linfa brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{across much of}} the Philippines for several days, causing flooding and landslides that resulted in traffic accidents and power outages. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven, causing ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD) in damage. The storm briefly threatened Taiwan, prompting warnings and restricted ferry travel. Over China, Linfa produced heavy rainfall and gusty <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> wrecked 288homes. Damage in the country totaled ¥1.7billion ($284million USD), and there was one death.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} {{refers to the}} {{construction}} of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electric power. These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects. However, the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher.|$|E
5|$|Polar deserts such as McMurdo Dry Valleys remain {{ice-free}} {{because of}} the dry katabatic <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> flow downhill from the surrounding mountains. Former desert areas presently in non-arid environments, such as the Sandhills in Nebraska, are known as paleodeserts. In the Köppen climate classification system, deserts are classed as BWh (hot desert) or BWk (temperate desert). In the Thornthwaite climate classification system, deserts would be classified as arid megathermal climates.|$|E

5|$|The Indian {{climate is}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping {{the bulk of the}} Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon <b>winds</b> <b>that,</b> between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} inflicted {{extensive damage}} across central Nova Scotia and into Prince Edward Island, with lesser damage {{east and west}} of the storm centre. Most of the damage occurred {{as a result of}} the intense <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> buffeted the region. Juan's passage resulted in eight fatalities and over CA $300 million (US $200 million) in damage. It was described as the worst storm to hit Halifax since 1893.|$|E
5|$|The polar easterlies, {{also known}} as Polar Hadley cells, are dry, cold {{prevailing}} <b>winds</b> <b>that</b> blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at {{the north and south}} poles towards the low-pressure areas within the Westerlies at high latitudes. Unlike the Westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular. Because of the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an equatorward outflow of air; that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.|$|E
