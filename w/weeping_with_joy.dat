6000|$|The {{instant the}} first-mentioned {{horseman}} perceived Eustace and Arthur, he sprang {{to the ground}} and hurried to meet them with rapid affectionate greetings and inquiries. In another moment Dame Eleanor appeared on the drawbridge, and, <b>weeping</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> was clasped in her husband's arms. Behind her stood the venerable chaplain, Father Cyril, and a step or two further off, Ralph Penrose, both of whom in turn received the kindly greetings of Sir Reginald Lynwood, as, with his wife hanging on his arm and his boy holding his hand, he passed under the gateway of his ancestral castle. Turning the next moment, he addressed his tall companion: [...] "Friend Gaston, I bid you welcome! Dame Eleanor, and you, brother Eustace, I present to you my trusty Esquire, Master Gaston d'Aubricour." ...|$|E

60|$|The bowling had {{now become}} almost unbelievably bad. Lobs were being tried, and Stone, nearly <b>weeping</b> <b>with</b> pure <b>joy,</b> was playing an innings of the How-to-brighten-cricket type. He had an unorthodox style, but an {{excellent}} eye, {{and the road}} at this period of the game became absolutely unsafe for pedestrians and traffic.|$|R
60|$|It {{was rough}} but hearty dancing. Each dancer {{composed}} his own {{steps on the}} spur of the moment, but executed them with a degree of precision and violence that would have caused civilised dancing masters to blush with shame and envy. Mrs Gore and Nelly danced too, <b>weeping</b> the while <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> and so did the White Swan, but her performances were peculiar. She danced with a slowness of manner and a rigidity of person that are utterly indescribable. She looked as if all her joints had become inflexible, except those of her knees, and her arms hung straight down at her sides, while she pendulated about the floor and gazed at the rafters in deep solemnity.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{the next}} three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so far from my being the first {{discoverer}} of the Martian overthrow, several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the previous night. One man--the first--had gone to St. Martin's-le-Grand, and, while I sheltered in the cabmen's hut, had contrived to telegraph to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the pit. Already men, <b>weeping</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy,</b> as I have heard, shouting and staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making up trains, even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across the Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and meat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed going Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I drifted--a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through the streets of St. John's Wood. They have told me since that I was singing some insane doggerel about [...] "The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah! The Last Man Left Alive!" [...] Troubled as they were with their own affairs, these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves with me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.|$|E
6000|$|After {{dinner the}} ball began, {{and it was}} the strangest ball that ever was seen. The trumpeter Gadfly and a number of his relations, besides several Grasshoppers and Bees, were the chief musicians. They wanted a bass very much at first, but the Bull-frog offered his services, {{although}} he confessed that he was accustomed to sing alone. Then the gentlemen drew on their gloves, flattened their wings, pulled up their collars, and coiled away their tails; while the ladies tightened their garters, ruffled their feathers, and put out their feelers. Oh how they did dance! reels were nothing to it. The greatest difficulty was to keep the Grasshoppers in order. They became so excited that they sprang quite out of sight every moment, and so lost their partners, and ran against everybody in searching for them. Then the Bull-frog, who sang bass, got a little too much of the dew, and sang so loudly, that he quite drowned all the other players. So Mrs Butterfly put her claws in her ears, and running up to him, said, [...] "Oh! dear Mr Bull-frog, pray do not sing quite so loudly." [...] The poor Bull-frog was almost <b>weeping</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> at the merry scene before him, but he blushed very green on hearing this, and said he had forgotten what he was doing, but would try to be more careful. However, in five minutes more he was worse than ever, so they sent a few hundred bees to sing treble beside him, and try to keep him in order. In the middle of all this there was a sudden stop, and a Snail, stepping forward, offered to dance a minuet. This was received with such a roar of laughter that the poor snail, half frightened, half angry, drew in his horns and went to bed on the spot, and the dance was begun anew. By this time the Gnats and Midges, {{and some of the other}} flies, had left the ground and retired to enjoy a cool dance in the air. Two or three Spiders mounted up into the oak, and fastened threads to some of the branches, by which they dropped suddenly down among the dancers, and, seizing their partners round the waist, carried them screaming in among the leaves. So the fun and the noise became louder and louder. On the ground, under the bushes, among the branches of the trees, and in the air, the dancers bounded, skipped, laughed, sang, shouted, and flew in a way that had never been seen or heard of before. The merry old Bull-frog became quite absurd. He sang and roared like a lion; took up all the young insects in his arms and hugged them; tumbled over the other musicians, and, in short, did so many wild things that they were at length obliged to tie him to a paddock-stool, where they left him to enjoy himself.|$|E
50|$|The film depicts an {{unconventional}} opera director, Walter (Etienne Glaser), who is directing {{a production of}} Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Stockholm Opera. He attempts to overthrow many of the conventions of opera; he gives certain solo numbers to the opera chorus, he involves the orchestra in the acting, {{and he wants to}} fill the stage with damp earth to simulate a graveyard. The singers, the members of the orchestra, and the staff at the opera house are initially very antagonistic to his plans, especially his appeal to their eroticism as individuals. However, they reluctantly agree to do things Walter's way, and gradually come over to his point of view. Throughout the film, Mozart's ghost is glimpsed more and more frequently, at one point seen <b>weeping</b> <b>with</b> <b>joy</b> at the effect his work has had. The film ends with the premiere of the production being a resounding success, and the actors taking the credit for this, with the director largely forgotten.|$|E

The court, {{on the advice of}} Melina, met after so many years his brother Tonio and set off for Sicily. The meeting with Don Calogero and his men takes place in an abandoned quarry in Sirenuse, a Sicilian town, in the rain. The boss tells Tonio that it was he who put the bomb under the car of Don Rosario and that home movie that has no value because Galimberti has resigned and became associate justice because of pressure from the prosecutor Donelli, who had received Saints from some parts of the pornographic film. So Don Calogero sends Saruzzo forward to take the Saints without the exchange. Hearing, however, the screams of the little Antonia in the car and the fears of Saints, the good Tonio chooses his real family instead of Don Calogero. He shoots to the head and kills Saruzzo, takes hostage Don Calogero throat forcing his minions not to shoot and sends Saints to take the child. But Calogero hits Tonio with a knife hidden in his jacket, so the young man is shot repeatedly by picciotti and falls to the ground.
