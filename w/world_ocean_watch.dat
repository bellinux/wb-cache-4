5000|$|The {{theme for}} <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day 2016 was [...] "Healthy Oceans, Healthy Planet." [...] <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day 2016 was celebrated in over 100 {{countries}} with over 700 registered events. <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day trended second on Twitter. Instagram posts about <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day reached over 290 million people, and over 65 {{million people were}} reached on Twitter. Celebrities like Richard Branson, Ellie Goulding, Pharrell Williams, Adrian Grenier, Nelson Mandela and more shared photos and tweeted their support for our oceans. Notable {{organizations such as the}} United Nations, CNN, National Geographic, LIFE, the White House and more joined in spreading messages of ocean conservation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>World</b> <b>Ocean</b> Atlas (WOA) is a data {{product of}} the Ocean Climate Laboratory of the National Oceanographic Data Center (U.S.). The WOA {{consists}} of a climatology of fields of in situ ocean properties for the <b>World</b> <b>Ocean.</b> It was first produced in 1994 (based on the earlier Climatological Atlas of the <b>World</b> <b>Ocean),</b> with later editions at roughly four year intervals in 1998, 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2013.|$|R
5000|$|The {{theme for}} <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day 2017 is [...] "Our Oceans, Our Future", and the {{conservation}} action {{focus is on}} encouraging solutions to plastic pollution and preventing marine litter for a healthier ocean and a better future. For <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day 2017, hundreds of events are planned around the world, including the first United Nations Ocean Conference being held in New York City {{during the week of}} <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day.|$|R
50|$|<b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day {{was officially}} {{recognized}} by the United Nations in late 2008. The Ocean Project, working {{in partnership with the}} <b>World</b> <b>Ocean</b> Network, Association of Zoos and Aquariums, and many other partners in its network of 2,000 organizations, has been promoting <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day since 2002 and led a three-year global petition movement to secure official UN recognition. <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day events are celebrated on June 8, the closest weekend, the week, and the month of June. The day is marked in a variety of ways, including launching new campaigns and initiatives, special events at aquariums and zoos, outdoor explorations, aquatic and beach cleanups, educational and conservation action programs, art contests, film festivals, and sustainable seafood events. Youth have been playing an increasingly important role since 2015, including the development in 2016 of a <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day Youth Advisory Council.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{coordination}} of <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day, The Ocean Project continued to place a strong focus on youth engagement in 2016. The Ocean Project recognizes the impact youth can have in ocean conservation, and provides youth with the resources and networks needed to have their voices heard. For <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day 2016, the <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day Youth Advisory Council was established. There are 11 members on the council all coming from different countries around the world. The new advisory council will help expand the reach and impact of <b>World</b> <b>Oceans</b> Day, on June 8, and year-round. The Ocean Project plans to focus increasing attention on youth engagement and -leadership.|$|R
