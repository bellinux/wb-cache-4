40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of number of washings, curing time and heat treatment on the breaking strength of no-bake chromite sand-furan resin cores. The Hevi chromite sand produced by a <b>single</b> stage <b>washing</b> of chromite sand was found to exhibit lower breaking strength in service. Forty five samples of no-bake chromite sand mixes were prepared with furan resin at room temperature and 39 % humidity from chromite sand <b>washed</b> in <b>single</b> and two stages and cured at 2, 4 and 24 hours. Eighteen of the samples <b>washed</b> in <b>single</b> and two stages were tested for breaking strength without heat treatment, while the 27 obtained from <b>single</b> stage <b>washing</b> sand mix were heated to 900 oC and held at 12, 14 and 16 minutes before cooling. Re-washing gave an appreciable increase in breaking strength only for samples cured for 24 hours. The results obtained showed that highest breaking strength occurred in heat treated and cured samples with the highest occurring at curing period of 24 hours and 900 oC with holding time of 16 minutes. For re-washed samples held in room atmosphere, there was a decrease in breaking strength compared to the <b>single</b> stage <b>washed</b> samples. The implication of this work is that Hevi chromite sand has better breaking strength when heat treated at 900 °C and held in the temperature for 16 minutes.

40|$|A {{sensitive}} ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (UHPLC-MS/MS) method {{has been developed}} and validated for simultaneous quantification of zinc pyrithione (ZPT) and climbazole (CBZ) deposited onto human scalp from anti-dandruff (AD) shampoos. Scrubbing with a buffer solution {{was used as the}} sampling method for the extraction of ZPT and CBZ from scalp. Derivatization of ZPT was carried out prior to UHPLC-MS/MS analysis, The identification of ZPT and CBZ was performed by examining ratios of selected multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions in combination with UHPLC retention times. The limit of detection for ZPT and CBZ was established to be 1 and 2 ng/mL, respectively. This sensitivity enables the quantification of ZPT and CBZ at deposition levels in the low ng/cm(2) range. The method was successfully applied for the analysis of scalp buffer scrub samples from an in vivo study. The levels of ZPT and CBZ deposited on the scalp at different time points after application of the AD shampoo were measured. The results revealed that dual-active AD shampoo delivered more ZPT onto the scalp in a <b>single</b> <b>wash</b> than <b>single</b> active shampoo did. The amount of ZPT and CBZ retained on the scalp after AD shampoo application declined over 72 h...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{following}} {{methods were}} evaluated {{for their ability}} to separate motile cryopreserved sperm from semen after thawing: <b>single</b> <b>washing,</b> Percoll separation followed by a <b>single</b> <b>washing,</b> and Sephadex column separation. For Sephadex sep-aration, washing, and Percoll separation, percent recovery of motile sperm was 65 %, 76 %, and 28 %, and motility was 81 %, 39 %, and 60 %, respectively. Percoll separation and washing were the best methods for removing seminal constituents, but sperm velocity and linearity were lower after Percoll separation and washing than after Sephadex separation. During 3 hours of incubation, there was an additional decrease in the motility, vi-ability (exclusion of supravital dye), velocity, linearity, and intact acrosomes of Percoll-separated sperm, indicating that Percoll separation may not be suitable for cryopreserved sperm. Motile, washed sperm also had lower velocities and higher spontane-ous acrosome reactions than Sephadex-separated sperm, but velocity and linearity were maintained during incubation. When semen was separated with Sephadex followed by washing, mo-tility was well maintained (84 %). The Sephadex method is a promising technique for selecting and concentrating motile cry-opreserved sperm...|$|R

40|$|An {{atrazine}} molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) {{has been}} successfully produced via a cooling-heating method with repeated washing process. A template (atrazine) was incorporated into a pre-polymerization solution containing a functional monomer (methacrylic acid), a cross-linker (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate), and an initiator (benzoyl peroxide). The pre-polymerization solution was cooled in a refrigerator at- 5 °C for 60 min. and heated in an oven at 70 °C for 150 min. The template removal process was conducted through a repeated washing process to increase {{the effectiveness of the}} cavities formation. The FTIR spectrum of the MIP showed that the peaks of amine group decrease significantly, indicating that the concentration of atrazine decreases drastically. HPLC was used to determine accurately the concentration of atrazine and the chromatogram of the MIP confirmed that there is no atrazine left. The repeated washing process was therefore better than the <b>single</b> <b>washing</b> process with 3 % of atrazine left. In addition, the MIP obtained by the repeated washing process had the number of cavities of 780, which is higher than that produced by the <b>single</b> <b>washing</b> process as analyzed from SEM images.
