60|$|Dan Mavering {{came out}} into the bright winter morning knowing that his {{engagement}} was broken, but feeling it so little {{that he could not}} believe it. He failed to realise it, to seize it for a fact, and he could not let it remain that dumb and formless wretchedness, <b>without</b> <b>proportion</b> or dimensions, which it now seemed to be, weighing his life down. To verify it, to begin to outlive it, he must instantly impart it, he must tell it, he must see it with others' eyes. This was the necessity of his youth and of his sympathy, which included himself as well {{as the rest of the}} race in its activity. He had the usual environment of a young man who has money. He belonged to clubs, and he had a large acquaintance among men of his own age, who lived a life of greater leisure; or were more absorbed in business, but whom he met constantly in society. For one reason or another, or for no other reason than that he was Dan Mavering and liked every one, he liked them all. He thought himself great friends with them; he dined and lunched with them; and they knew the Pasmers, and all about his engagement. But he did not go to any of them now, with the need he felt to impart his calamity, to get the support of come other's credence and opinion of it. He went to a friend whom, in the way of his world, he met very seldom, but whom he always found, as he said, just where he had left him.|$|E
6000|$|XXVI. Of {{which the}} first is, that {{wherever}} Proportion exists at all, {{one member of the}} composition must be either larger than, or in some way supreme over, the rest. There is no proportion between equal things. They can have symmetry only, and symmetry <b>without</b> <b>proportion</b> is not composition. It is necessary to perfect beauty, but it is the least necessary of its elements, nor of course is there any difficulty in obtaining it. Any succession of equal things is agreeable; but to compose is to arrange unequal things, and the first thing to be done in beginning a composition is to determine which is to be the principal thing. I believe that all that has been written and taught about proportion, put together, is not to the architect worth the single rule, well enforced, [...] "Have one large thing and several smaller things, or one principal thing and several inferior things, and bind them well together." [...] Sometimes there may be a regular gradation, as between the heights of stories in good designs for houses; sometimes a monarch with a lowly train, as in the spire with its pinnacles: the varieties of arrangement are infinite, but the law is universal--have one thing above the rest, either by size, or office, or interest. Don't put the pinnacles without the spire. What a host of ugly church towers have we in England, with pinnacles at the corners, and none in the middle! How many buildings like King's College Chapel at Cambridge, looking like tables upside down, with their four legs in the air! What! it will be said, have not beasts four legs? Yes, but legs of different shapes, and with a head between them. So they have a pair of ears: and perhaps a pair of horns: but not at both ends. Knock down a couple of pinnacles at either end in King's College Chapel, and you will have a kind of proportion instantly. So in a cathedral you may have one tower in the centre, and two at the west end; or two at the west end only, though a worse arrangement: but you must not have two at the west and two at the east end, unless you have some central member to connect them; and even then, buildings are generally bad which have large balancing features at the extremities, and small connecting ones in the centre, because it is not easy then to make the centre dominant. The bird or moth may indeed have wide wings, because the size of the wing does not give supremacy to the wing. The head and life are the mighty things, and the plumes, however wide, are subordinate. In fine west fronts with a pediment and two towers, the centre is always the principal mass, both in bulk and interest (as having the main gateway), and the towers are subordinated to it, as an animal's horns are to its head. The moment the towers rise so high as to overpower the body and centre, and become themselves the principal masses, they will destroy the proportion, unless they are made unequal, and one of them the leading feature of the cathedral, as at Antwerp and Strasburg. But the purer method is to keep them down in due relation to the centre, and to throw up the pediment into a steep connecting mass, drawing the eye to it by rich tracery. This is nobly done in St. Wulfran of Abbeville, and attempted partly at Rouen, though that west front is made up of so many unfinished and supervening designs {{that it is impossible to}} guess the real intention of any one of its builders.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the reign}} of Napoleon III in the 1850s and 60s Paris {{experienced}} a dramatic transformation {{under the direction of}} Georges-Eugène Haussmann. Haussmann cut many boulevards through the crowded, medieval city placing prominent public buildings at the boulevard ends to provide impressive vistas. The boulevard Malesherbes was laid out cutting northwest from La Madeleine. Saint-Augustin, close to the spot where Haussmann was born, was built to provide a counterpoint to the famous columns of La Madeleine {{at the other end of}} the boulevard. It was also designed to be visible from the Arc de Triomphe down the avenue de Friedland. The chosen site, an odd shaped lot at the intersection of four streets, and the need for a dome of 200 ft so as to be visible from the Arc de Triomphe, dictated unusual proportions for the building. The church was designed by Haussmann's fellow Protestant, architect Victor Baltard who also famously designed Les Halles markets. While Baltard's use of iron in Saint-Augustin's structure is praised for its inventiveness, at least one critic has described the church as, [...] "an eyesore: ridiculously sited, <b>without</b> <b>proportion,</b> crushed beneath an outsized dome." [...] The neighborhood around the church is now one of the most expensive in Paris.|$|E

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2016 Inter-Domain Traffic engineering in the Internet faces serious limitations {{because of the}} current IP routing and addressing architecture. This coupled with Border Gateway Protocol’s (BGP’s) way of selecting performance-blind paths forces ISPs to de-aggregate IP prefixes to control the flow of packets between ASes. Advertising such de-aggregated, surplus prefixes for local benefits is causing the routing table of the Default Free Zone (DFZ) to grow rapidly, which contribute to routing scalability problems. Recently, {{in order to address}} this scalability issue, LISP (Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol) has been proposed, which separates an address space into a non-routable End-Point Identifiers (EIDs) and a routable Routing Locators (RLOCs), where each EIDs can be associated to more than one (multiple) RLOCs. In this work, we discuss two optimization models for traffic engineering in LISP-enabled network which exploits the route diversity or the path diversity the LISP inherently provides by introducing the concept of grouping multiple RLOCs with traffic proportioning or load-balancing as the optimization criterion. We compare the models to the base case that identifies with the current routing architecture (i. e. no proportioning). Through our study, we observe that LISP-based traffic engineering with multiple RLOCs offers noticeable benefits compared to when we do traffic engineering <b>without</b> <b>proportioning</b> demands to multiple RLOCs, except when the network is uniform in terms of load and capacity.

40|$|Objective: The Vancouver Area Neighbourhood Deprivation Index (VANDIX) is a census-based {{measure of}} {{socio-economic}} status (SES). It {{was designed to}} serve as an accessible and representative proxy marker of population health status without requiring more extensive health data. This paper describes the structure and previous applications of the VANDIX for measuring relative variations in health outcomes in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: The VANDIX was constructed from a 2005 survey of provincial medical health officers asking them to comment on the best census markers of health status in British Columbia. The VANDIX is based on the weighted summation of seven socio-economic variables from the census, including in order of weighted importance: <b>proportion</b> <b>without</b> high school completion; <b>proportion</b> <b>without</b> university completion; unemployment rate; proportion of lone-parent families; average income; proportion of home owners; and employment ratio. Results: The VANDIX has been applied in numerous research and policy settings across the province against several distributions of health status, including self-rated health, injury and access to health care services. In each assessment, the VANDIX has shown that socio-economic inequities parallel health inequities. Conclusion: SES {{is one of the most}} influential factors that shape population patterns of health outcomes. Census-based indicators of SES such as the VANDIX can serve as easily accessible and representative markers of population health status, and have application for policy, research and public health promotion.

The aim of the current study was to examine the association of LOC to functional outcomes in patients with good-grade SAH. METHODS We searched the Subarachnoid Hemorrhage International Trialists Repository for patients that presented with LOC at ictus of SAH. A propensity score analysis was performed on good-grade patients (defined as World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grades 1 - 3) to balance selected covariates between those with and without LOC. Primary outcome was Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 3 months (with poor outcome defined as GOS of 1 - 3). Secondary outcomes were delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), rebleed, length of hospital stay, and time to death. RESULTS A propensity score-matching algorithm identified 337 patients (168 with LOC at ictus, and 168 <b>without).</b> The <b>proportion</b> of patients with poor functional outcome at 3 -months was significantly higher in those who had LOC at ictus compared to the matched cohort without LOC (30...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{related to}} the low {{survival}} of cucumber plants grafted onto pumpkin rootstocks using a newly developed grafting robot were determined. Horizontal-cut grafting (HCG), whereby hypocotyls of the scion and rootstock are cut at right angles and the cut surfaces are spliced, is used with a robot. The proportion of surviving grafted plants using HCG were compared with those using slant-cut grafting (SCG). <b>Without</b> cotyledons, <b>proportion</b> of surviving grafted plants was lower using HCG than using SCG, whereas the cut level at the hypocotyls had no effect. The proportion of surviving grafted plants was highest at a splicing pressure of 830 g/cm^ 2. Pressed cut surface areas at more than 5. 5 cm^ 2 increased the proportion of surviving grafted plants compared with 0 cm^ 2 (HCG) The proportion of surviving grafted plants and plant growth after transplanting increased with increasing area of cotyledons. These results suggest that low survival of cucumber plants grafted by horizontal-cut grafting is attributed to low pressure on the spliced cut surfaces and loss of cotyledons on the rootstock...|$|R
