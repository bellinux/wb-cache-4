25|$|Common sails {{consist of}} a lattice {{framework}} on which a sailcloth is spread. The miller can adjust the amount of cloth spread according {{to the amount of}} wind available and power needed. In medieval mills, the sailcloth was wound {{in and out of a}} ladder type arrangement of sails. Postmedieval mill sails had a lattice framework over which the sailcloth was spread, while in colder climates, the cloth was replaced by <b>wooden</b> <b>slats,</b> which were easier to handle in freezing conditions. The jib sail is commonly found in Mediterranean countries, and consists of a simple triangle of cloth wound round a spar.|$|E

500|$|The tunnel {{was about}} 3feet (1m) high by 3feet (1m) wide. Lighting {{in the tunnel}} was {{provided}} by makeshift candles. The prisoners used improvised digging tools and shovels that were constructed from British biscuit cans and their handles made from the <b>wooden</b> <b>slats</b> of their beds. The tins were also {{used to create a}} pipe for fresh air to funnel through the tunnel with the assistance of a hand-cranked fan at the entrance of the tunnel. A sled, made of <b>wooden</b> <b>slats</b> with a tine base to make it slide easily over the earthen tunnel floor, was used to haul the sandbags. Juskalian described the method that was used to dispose the sand: [...] "The method used to conceal the sand was ingenious. The sand was poured into burlap bags made surreptitiously from Red Cross parcel wrappings then passed rapidly along a makeshift fire brigade line through the building and up into the attic. There it was dumped between the outer and inner walls where there was a wide space for insulation. Literally tons of sand could be disposed of there before the space would be filled." ...|$|E
500|$|Lange {{had several}} notable moments during the [...] season. [...] On July 4, he stole five bases {{in one game}} against the Louisville Colonels, {{although}} it was two stolen bases short of the record of seven set by George Gore and Billy Hamilton. [...] During a game on August 31, he entered baseball lore with a feat that he never actually performed. [...] The game was scoreless {{in the bottom of}} the 10th inning when Lange made a diving catch in center field to keep the game scoreless. [...] Later in the inning, Chicago's first baseman, George Decker attempted to field a thrown ball from third baseman Barry McCormick, but it bounced off and broke his wrist instead. [...] In an effort to get Decker to the hospital adjacent the ballpark, his teammates knocked down several <b>wooden</b> <b>slats</b> of the outfield fence to expedite his journey. [...] However, the two events were confused and it became legend that Lange had crashed through the fence making that acrobatic catch in tenth. [...] Lange finished the season with a [...]326batting average, while also stealing 84bases, second in the league, and finished eighth in league with 16triples.|$|E

2500|$|Horrie, an Egyptian terrier, was befriended as a puppy by Australian soldier Private Jim Moody {{when he was}} {{stationed}} in the Ikingi Maryut area of Egypt in 1941.The dog became the unofficial mascot of Moody's unit, the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion, and followed them as they moved around the Middle East and Greece during their various campaigns. According to the Australian War Memorial, Horrie was described by his owner as being [...] "intelligent and easily trained", and he was employed as an air sentry, alerting troops to approaching enemy aircraft. He was promoted {{to the rank of}} corporal, and during the evacuation of Greece, Horrie was aboard the troopship Costa Rica when it was sunk. He managed to survive, though, and later made it to Crete when he was subsequently wounded by a bomb blast. In 1942, after further service in Syria as part of the Allied garrison, Horrie was brought back to Australia when Moody was repatriated. In order to get around stringent quarantine laws which would have prevented him from bringing Horrie back, Moody smuggled the dog home in a canvas bag, which was reinforced with <b>wooden</b> <b>slats</b> so that the dog could breathe.|$|E

The Albanian government went to great lengths in order to prevent people from defecting by fleeing the country:An electrically-wired metal fence stands 600 meters to one kilometer from the actual border. Anyone touching the fence not only risks electrocution, but also sets off alarm bells and lights which alert guards stationed at approximately one-kilometer intervals along the fence. Two meters of soil {{on either side of the}} fence are cleared in order to check for footprints of escapees and infiltrators. The area between the fence and the actual border is seeded with booby traps such as coils of wire, noise makers consisting of thin pieces of metal strips on top of two <b>wooden</b> <b>slats</b> with stones in a tin container which rattle if stepped on, and flares that are triggered by contact, thus illuminating would-be escapees during the night.|$|E

6000|$|Thus far, I {{was so much}} to be sympathised with {{as never}} to have heard of the names of Dunbuie and of Mr. Donnelly. In this ignorance I {{remained}} till late in October or early in November 1898. On an afternoon of that date I was reading the proof sheets, kindly lent to me by Messrs. Macmillan, of The Native Tribes of Central Australia by Messrs. Spencer and Gillen, a work, now justly celebrated, which was published early in 1899. I was much interested on finding, in this book, that certain tribes of Central Australia,--the Arunta [...] "nation" [...] and the Kaitish,--paint on sacred and other rocks the very same sorts of archaic designs as Mr. Donnelly found incised at Auchentorlie (of which I had not then heard). These designs are familiar in many other parts of Scotland and of the world. They play a great part in the initiations and magic of Central Australia. Designs of the same class are incised, by the same Australian tribes, on stones of various shapes and sizes, usually portable, and variously shaped which are styled churinga nanja. (Churinga merely means anything [...] "sacred," [...] that is, with a superstitious sense attached to it). They also occur on <b>wooden</b> <b>slats,</b> (churinga irula,) commonly styled [...] "Bull roarers" [...] by Europeans. The tribes are now in a [...] "siderolithic" [...] stage, using steel when they can get it, stone when they cannot. If ever they come to abandon stone implements, while retaining their magic or religion, they will keep on using their stone churinga nanja.|$|E
