5|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension {{that had previously been}} granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult task of not only disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake. John Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith's radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> followed the new thinking such as Hugh Latimer. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome.|$|E
5|$|With Japan's {{entry into}} the war {{following}} the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, it became {{more likely that the}} division would be called upon to undertake active service overseas, and the division was mobilised for war. In early January 1942, Major General Stanley Savige, an experienced officer who had commanded the 17th Brigade in combat against the Germans in the Middle East earlier in the war, took over command of the division. Savige set about the task of preparing the division for combat and he began by removing officers that he did not think were physically fit enough or competent to lead in battle and replacing them <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had gained experience in AIF units. A comprehensive training program was established and in April 1942 the division was assigned to the Australian I Corps, and in order to enable divisional exercises to begin, the 3rd Division moved to Bonegilla, Victoria. In order to toughen the men up, Savige decided that they would march on foot to the new camp.|$|E

25|$|Pashtun {{women often}} have their legal rights curtailed {{in favour of}} their husbands or male relatives. For example, though women are officially allowed to vote in Afghanistan and Pakistan, some have been kept away from ballot boxes by males.

Substantial work remains for Pashtun women to gain equal rights <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> remain disproportionately dominant in most aspects of Pashtun society. Human rights organisations continue to struggle for greater women's rights, such as the Afghan Women's Network and the Aurat Foundation in Pakistan which aims to protect women from domestic violence.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} was created {{at the end}} of August 1914, as the 2nd East Lancashire Division, a second-line formation of the East Lancashire Division. Territorial Force soldiers could not be deployed overseas without their consent and the Territorial units were accordingly split into a [...] "first line", <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had volunteered for overseas service and a [...] "second line", which was intended for home service, by the ten percent who refused to volunteer on 12 August. The second line units also served to absorb the large number of recruits who had joined the Territorial Force following the outbreak of war. The first commander was Brigadier-General Charles Beckett, a 65-year-old retired officer, who had commanded a Yeomanry brigade some years earlier.|$|E
500|$|Circumcision in Sub-Saharan Africa [...] "reduces the {{acquisition}} of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38% and 66% over 24 months". Due to these studies, both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision {{as a method of}} preventing female-to-male HIV transmission in 2007 in areas with a high rates of HIV. However, whether it protects against male-to-female transmission is disputed, and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among {{men who have sex with}} men is undetermined. The International Antiviral Society, however, does recommend for all sexually active heterosexual males and that it be discussed as an option <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men. Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risk-taking behavior, thus negating its preventive effects.|$|E

This became permanent on 20 January 1944. Major General Frank Berryman became {{commander of}} II Corps. Because of some sensitivities concerning the relative seniority of Berryman and Major General George Alan Vasey, Blamey placed Vasey's 7th Division directly under Morshead's command. Vasey soon chafed under Morshead's command, feeling that [...] "he has too many favourites both individually and collectively", <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had served at El Alamein receiving preferential treatment. Morshead was in overall charge of the forces in New Guinea in the battles of Sattelberg, Jivevaneng, Sio and Shaggy Ridge. His perseverance was rewarded with the capture of Madang in April 1944.|$|E

[...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party.

500|$|In the November 1982 {{issue of}} Siecus Report, {{published}} by the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States, Bell wrote that he was astonished by his finding that [...] "parent-child relationships" [...] are less influential {{in the development of}} sexual orientation than has often been thought. Bell argued that in order to understand adult sexual behavior it is necessary to understand early sexual feelings, which involve [...] "romantic attachments", <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> do not see themselves as [...] "typically masculine" [...] being more likely to experience such attachments toward other men. Bell argued that falling in love is a more important criterion of sexual orientation than sexual behavior, and that it can be understood as [...] "the anticipation of self-completion through merger with the love object" [...] and a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] through the [...] "integration of the masculine and feminine components of ourselves through the psychological incorporation of the greater preponderance of masculine or feminine characteristics one supposes are possessed by the object of our romantic feelings." [...] Bell suggested that early romantic and subsequent erotic attachments tend to be focused on people [...] "perceived as essentially different".|$|E
500|$|Sylvester was openly gay, with Gamson {{noting that}} he tended to enter into {{relationships}} <b>with</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were [...] "white, self-doubting and effeminate." [...] In 1978, he entered into {{a relationship with a}} young white model named John Maley; Sylvester later devoted the song [...] "Can't Forget the Love" [...] from his Too Hot to Sleep album to his young lover. Maley ended the relationship to move to Los Angeles, later recollecting that Sylvester [...] "was a lovely man, and I owe him a lot." [...] In 1981, Sylvester entered into a relationship with a slim brunette from Deep River, Connecticut named Michael Rayner, but unlike his predecessors, he did not move into Sylvester's house; their partnership ended when Rayner admitted that he had not fallen completely in love with Sylvester. Sylvester's next major relationship was with Tom Daniels, a hairdresser whom he met in 1982, but their romance ended after six months when Daniels discovered that Sylvester had been having sex with other men while on tour. The singer's final partner, the architect Rick Cranmer, was a six-foot two blonde, and the duo moved into a house together in the hills. Cranmer died of AIDS-related complications in 1987, the year before Sylvester succumbed to the virus.|$|E
