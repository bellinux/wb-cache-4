5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> into the bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of}} the seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which is judged to be minimal.|$|E

5|$|In {{geographic}} information systems, flow networks (such as the networks showing how <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> {{in a system}} of streams and rivers) are dual to cellular networks describing drainage divides. This duality can be explained by modeling the flow network as a spanning tree on a grid graph of an appropriate scale, and modeling the drainage divide as the complementary spanning tree of ridgelines on the dual grid graph.|$|E

In {{the presence of}} indomethacin or meclofenamic acid, inhibitors of prostaglandin and thromboxane A 2 synthesis, thromboxane B 2 stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in a dose-dependent manner. U 44069 (1 μM) stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> from 3. 6 ± 0. 8 to 12. 4 ± 1. 2 mg/min per 10 cm 2 hemibladder surface area, while U 46619 (1 μM) stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> from 2. 8 ± 1. 0 to 21. 8 ± 2. 0 mg/min per 10 cm 2. The prostaglandin endoperoxide/thromboxane A 2 antagonist trans- 13 -azaprostanoic acid, an inhibitor of vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> inhibited thromboxane B 2 - and U 46619 -stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in a dose-dependent manner. The inactive cis- 13 -azaprostanoic acid did not inhibit vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in untreated hemibladders and {{had no effect on}} U 46619 -stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in indomethacin or meclofenamic acid pretreated hemibladders. U 46619 (1 μM) enhanced vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in indomethacin pretreated hemibladders, producing a significant parallel shift (P < 0. 001) in the dose-response relationship to submaximal concentrations of vasopressin (0. 1 - 0. 6 mU/ml), while not affecting <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> stimulated by supramaximal concentrations of vasopressin (10 mU/ml). trans- 13 -Azaprostanoic acid abolished the potentiating effects of U 46619 on vasopressin-stimulated <b>water</b> <b>flow.</b> These results show that thromboxane A 2 -like compounds stimulate <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in the toad urinary bladder...|$|R
30|$|In {{traditional}} {{analysis of}} slope stability, overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is not taken into account. As is well known, {{the depth of}} overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is only several centimeters or millimeters, which may have little effect on a stable slope with a large safety factor; however, for a slope in the limiting equilibrium condition, the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> should not be ignored. This is because the overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> with only several centimeters or millimeters may cause the so-called stable slope to become an unstable slope. Especially, in landslide hazard assessment, not considering the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> may result in an incorrect assessment and lead to serious damage in the so-called safety area, which is obtained by landslide hazard assessment without consideration {{of the effect of}} overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> on the stability. Thus, {{in order to avoid the}} aforementioned accidents, the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> should be taken into account in slope stability analysis.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} analyse the {{relationship}} of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> depth with rainfall intensity, the overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in Figure  3 is scaled up in Figure  2.

In Figure  3, the time for overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> to begin to generate t* is given for different rainfall intensities. The figure shows that the larger the rainfall intensity, the higher the overland flow depth. The depth of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> increases with increase rainfall duration time and then becomes nearly constant. Here, the depth of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is quite small, several centimeters or millimeters, and the result is in accordance with the actual case.|$|R
5|$|The thin {{skin of the}} octopus absorbs {{additional}} oxygen. When resting, around 41% of an octopus's oxygen absorption {{is through}} the skin. This decreases to 33% when it swims, as more <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> over the gills; skin oxygen uptake also increases. When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which enables them to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> through.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often <b>water,</b> <b>flows</b> around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop increases as helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E

5|$|The {{report also}} noted {{concerns}} about the District's conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects. This conclusion {{was based on the}} model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in impervious areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water withdrawals on <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E
5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west side where new fresh <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> in.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Conventional fault {{detection}} and diagnosis in water chillers needs <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> measurements to calculate system load. However, {{the measurement of}} <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> meters usually fluctuates greatly, and high accuracy flow meters are very expensive. In this paper, a novel modelling method using a new reference model for {{fault detection}} and diagnosis in water chillers was developed, and the real evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{was replaced by a}} pseudo evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate that was equal to the designed evaporator <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> rate or the average evaporator flow rate under stable operation conditions. The new-developed reference model was validated by the data sets from ASHRAE 1043 -RP. The validation results showed that the new developed reference model has good prediction accuracy and clear diagnosis rules, which can be used for fault detection and diagnosis in water chillers in the absence of <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> measurements.

A copious stream of <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately flowed from it water enough to suffice for the supply {{of the people of the}} town, and also to water their lands.

5|$|The bucket bong is {{made out}} of two {{container}}s, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong.|$|E
5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris behind the other on each side. As the fish swims, <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E

5|$|Mangrove trees {{cover the}} coastlines of South Florida, {{sometimes}} growing inland {{depending on the}} amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa)—can be found in the Everglades. Due to their high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida's first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.|$|E
5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed.

Moreover, it includes an additional the equation to describe overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> to improve the hillslope hydrology model and considers the effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> on the slope stability to better analyse the slope stability. Here, the equation of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> was derived by the assumption that overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> is uniform flow. The effect of overland <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> on slope stability is accounted for by the additional pore pressure that results the shear stress acting on the slope.
