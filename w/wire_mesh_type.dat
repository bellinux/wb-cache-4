A grid loss model was established and evaluated using pressure drop database. Drift flux model evaluation was also conducted in this study using the 1 -D void fraction database. Local two-phase flow parameters were measured at different axial locations {{in order to understand the}} detailed flow structure in a rod bundle geometry. ^ Air-water two-phase flow experiments were performed in an 8 X 8 rod bundle test section. Area-averaged void fraction was measured by <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>type</b> impedance meters. Different drift flux model were evaluated using this measured void fraction database, while the cumulative probability distribution functions of the signals from the impedance meter were used to identify flow regimes with a self organizing neural network. ^ Pressure drop was measured by a differential pressure measurement cell. The pressure drop database was further analyzed and utilized to evaluate the grid loss model. ^ Local parameters were measured at different gas and liquid velocities. The analysis focused on both radial and axial development of the two-phase flow structure. Investigation on the effect of spacer grid is also conducted. ...|$|E

3000|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>mesh,</b> vane <b>type</b> and {{cyclonic}} separators {{are standard}} as mist extractors {{for the small}} liquid droplets that are not separated by gravity in {{the main body of}} the separator (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004). These cyclones are used for water and condensate removal but have not been applied for removing condensed contaminants, such as CO_ 2 or H_ 2 S. [...] This is because cyclones can only handle condensing droplet sizes above 10  μm (Gas Processors Suppliers Association 2004; Clift 1997; Svarovsky 1984). To achieve such droplet, sizes requires unrealistically large droplet growth pipes. It is well known in laboratory chemical applications that microcyclones can separate micron-sized droplets having diameters as small as 1 μm, but then the flow is very small and orders of magnitude less than the flow in gas well applications. Alternatively, one can improve separation efficiency by increasing swirl velocity to supersonic velocity but at the costs of large pressure drops (Schinkelshoek et al. 2008).|$|R

As a newly introduced appendix to the International Residential Code (IRC), the strawbale construction requirements may benefit from further evaluation and possible refinement. Such evaluation and refinement may lead towards code change proposals that will improve the provisions and make strawbale construction safer and more accessible to the general public. This seismic test series addressed the effect of <b>mesh</b> <b>wire</b> <b>type</b> on ductility and {{the validity of the}} existing wall slenderness limits. The tests focused on slender walls dominated by flexural deformations.

40|$|Wire mesh {{reinforced}} concrete wall panel {{is the new}} method currently used to replace the conventional wall. It is currently used {{in the construction of}} high rise building in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The formwork used for the construction of the wall is by using tunnel form system. It is fast and cost effective compared to the conventional method. This is an experimental work involving three wall panel reinforced with double layer of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>type</b> B 385 (B 7) with a dimension of 75 x 1000 x 1500 mm (Width:Length:Height). The aspect ratio (h/L) and slenderness ratio (h/t) of the wall panel are 1. 5 and 20 respectively. The wall panels were constructed using concrete Grade 30 Normal Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with a water cement ratio of 0. 58. These wall panel are tested under direct axial line load (without eccentricity) to monitored the structural performance of the wall. Experimental result shows that all wall panels failed in compression shear based on the cracking propagation of the entire wall. The wall panel split into two sections at the middle width of the wall panel. It was found that all the crack lines occur {{at the side of the}} wall panel. There are no cracks which occurred at both front and rear surfaces of the wall panel. Maximum deflection recorded at ultimate load was located at the top of the wall. The wall panels swayed to the front of the wall panel. The reinforcement strain was measured by two vertical strain gauges and two horizontal strain gauges. It was found that as the crack progresses the strain experienced by the longitudinal bars at both sides also increased in both wall panels. However, there are no major changes in the strain measurement by the cross bars for both wall panels. The structural performances of the {{reinforced concrete}} wall panel have been observed and understood. It had provided useful information to design wall panel when reinforced with wire fabric. Since there is no proper standard and design procedure, this understanding could provide sustainable development in promoting fast and economical construction. hus for future study, it is recommended that the experimental procedure and method of study being varied to gain a better understanding of the structural performance of the reinforced concrete wall panels...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of intersecting load-bearing walls subjected to axial loading can occur by force transfer through their common interface. In conventional building construction method, wall is less use as the load-bearing elements {{rather than the}} space divider. But today the use of clay brick or sand brick wall has been changed by the concrete wall panels because the wall is not only design as the space divider but also as the structural elements for the building as well as beams, columns and slabs. Wire mesh reinforced concrete wall panel is the new method currently used to replace the conventional wall. However since this current practice is still new in Malaysia, {{there is a need}} to conduct a study to ensure the reliability and safety of the wall panel. Besides that, there is insufficient research conducted to study this new construction practice. Thus this research will focus on the understanding of the structural behavoiur of the wall panel and also the deflection and maximum strength that occur at the wire fabric reinforced concrete wall panel under axial loading. This research used Finite Element Method computer program LUSAS 14. 0 as a tool to analyze the wall panel. This finite element analysis design the 3 -D model of wire mesh reinforced concrete wall panel of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>type</b> BIO with a size of 150 x 3000 x 3000 mm (Width:Length:Height). The wall panel will be analyzing under axial loading (without eccentricity). The wall panel is constructed in full scale. Besides that, the boundary condition is assumed as pinned at both top and bottom of the wall panel. This model assigned assigning concrete Grade C 30 (BS 8110 : 1997) and strength characteristic, fy= 485 N/mm" for the wire fabric reinforcement. The ultimate load acquired from the analysis is equal to 1187. 81 kN and the maximum lateral displacement equal to 1. 000 mm. Referring to the theoretical value of the ultimate load for the wall panel taken from BS 8110 using the equation is equal to 1700 kN. The comparison value between the ultimate load from BS 8110 and the analysis seems that the result obtained from the analysis less than theoretical about 30. 13 %. The result show that the maximum lateral deflection is lies at the middle height of the wall panel. Through this research, the structural behavior of wire fabric reinforced concrete wall under axial loading (without eccentricity) was successful to analyze using finite element analysis and the result obtained from the analysis can explain the structural behavior of the wall panel...|$|E

40|$|The use of cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{very popular}} in the {{construction}} of steel truss system. The research in CFS is also getting more attention in wall panel and column structure. However, an assemblage of CFS with lipped C-channel section into a column alone does not provide significant increase in the compression capacity. Therefore, the purpose of this research study was to enhance the compressive capacity of composite column of CFS with lipped C-channel assembled with ferro-cement jacket by means of shear connectors. Tests were carried out to evaluate the behavior of shear connectors of the proposed composite column assembled together as precast member. Eight push-out test specimens of CFS with lipped C-channel sections assembled with ferro-cement jacket were prepared and tested. In addition, three types of shear connectors namely, bolts (10 mm and 12 mm in diameters), bar angle bolts (10 mm in diameter), and self-drilling screw (6. 3 mm in diameter × 12 mm long) were evaluated. Their behavior was analyzed in terms of load-slip relationship and failure mode. The results and discussion are presented by varying the number of <b>wire</b> <b>meshes</b> used and <b>types</b> of installed shear connector. The results showed that as the number of layers of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> and the diameter of bolts increased the ultimate load carrying capacity of composite section also increased.

40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers {{are under}} {{investigation}} {{because they are}} seen as replacements for squeeze film dampers {{as a source of}} direct stiffness and damping at bearing locations. There are several advantages of <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> dampers over squeeze film dampers, including: temperature insensitivity, oil-free operation, and the ability to contain large amplitude vibrations. Furthermore, due to their direct damping and lack of cross-coupled stiffness, the <b>wire</b> <b>mesh</b> reduces the response to imbalance and increases the stability of the system.
