50|$|Bryonia dioica, {{known by}} the common names red bryony and <b>white</b> <b>bryony,</b> also English {{mandrake}} or ladies' seal, is a perennial climbing vine indigenous to Central and Southern Europe. It is a flowering plant in the cucumber family Cucurbitaceae with five-pointed leaves and blue or white flowers. The vine produces a red berry fruit.|$|E
50|$|An herbaceous, {{perennial}} vine of the cucumber family, <b>white</b> <b>bryony</b> is monoecious but diclinous (separate {{male and}} female flowers found on the same plant) with a tuberous yellow root. Greenish-white flowers are 1 cm across. Long curling tendrils, flowers, and fruit all stem from axils of palmately lobed leaves. The fruit is a 1.5 cm berry which blackens as it ripens.|$|E
50|$|Bryonia alba (<b>white</b> <b>bryony,</b> wild hop) is a {{vigorous}} vine {{in the family}} Cucurbitaceae (squashes and melons) from Europe and Northern Iran. It has a growth habit similar to kudzu, which gives it a highly destructive potential outside its native range as a noxious weed. Other common names include false mandrake, English mandrake, wild vine, and wild hops, wild nep, tamus, ladies' seal, and tetterbury.|$|E
50|$|Control of <b>white</b> <b>bryony</b> usually {{involves}} manual pulling and very frequent removal of new growth; diligence being {{the key to}} success. Plants may be killed manually by severing the roots 7 - 10 cm below ground surface to remove the crown and prevent re-sprouting. Tillage is often ineffective and can harm host plant roots, but broadleaf herbicides such as glyphosate can be useful when care is taken not to spray host plant leaves. Multiple applications are necessary to eventually move herbicide to the root and block production of new shoots. The dispersed seeds are viable for many years, so manually removing B. alba before seed production is important.|$|E
50|$|Moreover, none of HeadOn's {{ingredients}} {{have any}} scientifically supported effectiveness in {{treatment of a}} headache. One of the ingredients, <b>white</b> <b>bryony</b> (bryonia alba), is a highly toxic berry that is lethal if 40 such berries are ingested; however, dilution leaves virtually none of this ingredient in the product, which is why its makers can claim the treatment has no side effects (or any effects at all). Another ingredient, goldenseal (hydrastis canadensis), has no known effectiveness {{in the treatment of}} any condition. The efficacy of the HeadOn product is supported by a few questionable testimonials found on the Miralus Healthcare website. Miralus also markets many other questionable healthcare products containing low, if any, levels of any active ingredients.|$|E
50|$|Spanning 1.2 {{hectares}} (approx 3 acres), {{the limestone}} grassland {{of the reserve}} provides a rich array of wildflowers, such as common bird's-foot-trefoil, horseshoe vetch, kidney vetch, ivy broomrape, Alexanders, large bindweed, <b>white</b> <b>bryony,</b> wild madder and charlock. These flowers make suitable conditions for butterflies and other insects such as the grey bush cricket. The sheltering copse of sycamores, {{as well as the}} scrub-covered slopes down to Portland's disused railway track, are both important features for migrating birds arriving or leaving via Portland, while the sheltered tall grass {{has become one of the}} best sites on island for glow-worms. A conservation team operates on the site, and stops the scrub from encroaching onto the grassland, particularly non-native plants like Cotoneaster horizontalis, as well as dealing with tree regeneration.|$|E
5000|$|As of September 2000, {{there were}} two {{versions}} of HeadOn available in makets/stores: [...] "ExtraStrength and Migraine". Chemical analysis of the Migraine formulation {{has shown that the}} product consists almost entirely of wax. The three [...] "active ingredients" [...] are iris versicolor 12&times; (a toxic flower), <b>white</b> <b>bryony</b> 12&times; (a type of toxic vine), and potassium dichromate 6&times; (a known carcinogen). The [...] "&times;" [...] notation indicates that the three chemicals have been diluted to 1 part per trillion, 1 part per trillion, and 1 part per million respectively. This amount of dilution is so great that the product {{has been described as a}} placebo; with skeptic James Randi calling it a [...] "major medical swindle". [...] The formula for the Extra Strength version of the product is the same as the Migraine except that it excludes the iris versicolor.|$|E
40|$|Bryodin is a {{strongly}} basic (pI {{greater than or}} equal to 9. 5) glycoprotein (neutral sugar content 6. 3 %) with Mr 30, 000, purified from the roots of Bryonia dioica (<b>white</b> <b>bryony).</b> This protein inhibits protein synthesis by a rabbit reticulocyte lysate with and ID 50 (concentration causing 50 % inhibition) of 0. 12 nM (3. 6 ng/ml) and has much less effect on protein synthesis by whole cells, with ID 50 values ranging from 46 nM to 2. 27 microM (1. 4 - 67 micrograms/ml). Bryodin acts by inactivating ribosomes, with a less-than-equimolar ratio, which suggests a catalytic action. Bryodin decreases the number of local lesions induced by tobacco mosaic virus in the leaves of Nicotiana glutinosa. From all its properties, bryodin can be considered to be a ribosome-inactivating protein, similar to those already known [reviews: Barbieri & Stirpe (1982) Cancer Surveys 1, 489 - 520; Stirpe & Barbieri (1986) FEBS Lett. 195, 1 - 8]...|$|E
40|$|Samples {{of first}} to fourth century date were {{analysed}} representing the phases and zones {{of the extensive}} village settlement. The most abundant cereal was spelt with a trace of emmer and a few bread wheat type grains, and hulled barley including six-row barley, as a second cereal. Samples interpreted as fine sieved cereal cleaning waste were found throughout the periods of occupation and included some samples with abundant wheat glumes and arable weeds. Some evidence of larger scale cereal cleaning was found from the late 1 st-early 2 nd century onwards including waste from malting spelt from rubbish deposits. Cereal waste was widely spread on the site until the Later Roman phases when remains were more abundant at the periphery. Other crops included flax/linseed and indeterminate legume, while hazel nut, sloe, wild/sour cherry, blackberry, hawthorn and elder were possibly gathered for consumption. Weeds increased in variety in the later phases to include, for example <b>white</b> <b>bryony</b> and henbane, possibly as weeds of the settlement. The results were compared with other sites {{in the region and}} nearby sites in the Lower Blackwater valley. University of Leiceste...|$|E
