Anthropogenically-induced {{climate change}} has the {{potential}} to have serious implications on aquatic ecosystems and may ultimately affect the supply and quality of freshwater lakes and rivers throughout the world. As a class of ecosystems, inland waters are vulnerable to climatic change and other pressures, due to their small size and their position in the landscape. There is therefore a need {{to assess the impact of}} projected climatic change on aquatic ecosystems. Owing to this need, ecological indicators have been developed as a method of quantifying, identifying, monitoring and managing the ecological integrity of aquatic environments. The aim of this research was to develop techniques in order to conceptualise the higher order impacts of projected climate change on environmentally related streamflows and water temperature in South Africa, and to simulate these using an appropriate hydrological model. For this dissertation the downscaled daily climate output from the ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM General Circulation Model (GCM) was used as an input into the daily time step conceptualphysical ACRU Agrohydrological Modelling System in order to simulate the impacts of projected climate change on selected eco-hydrological indicators at the Quinary Catchment spatial scale. In this research these indicators were grouped into two broad categories: 1. Ecological Flow Indicators and 2. Water Temperature Indicators. The results of this research took the form of maps and time series graphs. The ecological flow indicator results investigate the magnitude and duration of flow events and were analysed spatially for the 5 838 hydrologically interlinked and cascading Quinary Catchments constituting the southern Africa study region. The ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM GCM projects the magnitude and duration of both annual subcatchment runoff and accumulated streamflows to increase in the eastern parts of southern Africa for the intermediate future climate scenario (2046 - 2065), with this trend strengthening in the distant future climate scenario (2081 - 2100). The computationally intensive <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> results were analysed spatially at the scale of the Thukela Catchment. The Thukela catchment was selected as a case study area because of its diversity - in altitude, rainfall, soils and ecological regions, as well as in its population geography and levels of education and employment. This diversity presents a challenge to studies of impacts of projected climate change, including its potential impacts on water temperatures. The spatial analyses indicate that subcatchment runoff, accumulated streamflows and mixed maximum water temperature are all likely to increase under projected future climate conditions. A temporal investigation, in the form of time series analyses, focused on four water temperature indicators and was performed for 15 selected Quinary Catchments, located within the Thukela Catchment. These temporal analyses indicate that the absolute variability (i. e. standard deviation) of both individual subcatchment runoff and accumulated catchment streamflows, are projected to increase in the future, while the relative variability (i. e. coefficient of variation) is likely to remain much the same or even decrease slightly over time period. These temporal analyses also indicate that there is a noticeable difference in the mixed maximum water temperature within a single Quaternary Catchment due to hydrological flow routing, with an increase in water temperatures as the water cascades downstream from the upper Quinaries to the Quinaries at lower altitudes. The techniques developed and used in this research could aid decision makers involved in ecological and water management planning...|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} quantitative calcareous nannofossil {{analysis has}} been performed on 138 {{samples from the}} astronomically dated Monte del Casino section with the aim to identify and precisely date the most important calcareous nannofossil events across the Tortonian=Messinian boundary in the Mediterranean, and to unravel paleoceanographic conditions at times of sapropel formation during the Late Miocene. From the biostratigraphic perspective, the genus Amaurolithus provides three successive first occurrences (FOs) : A. primus, A. cf. amplificus and A. delicatus, dated at 7. 446, 7. 434 and 7. 226 Ma, respectively. Other bioevents include the base and top of the 'small reticulofenestrids' Acme, dated at 7. 644 and 6. 697 Ma, and the FO, FCO and LO of R. rotaria, dated at 7. 405, 7. 226 and 6. 771 Ma. These events appear to be useful in improving biostratigraphic resolution in the Tortonian-Messinian boundary interval, {{at least for the}} Mediterranean. Quantitative analysis revealed changes in the calcareous nannofossil assemblage associated with the sapropels. The observed fluctuations suggest a single mechanism for sapropel formation in the Mediterranean during the late Neogene. Sapropels are characterized by a decrease in the total number of coccoliths, interpreted mainly as a reduction in calcareous nannofossil production due to increased siliceous plankton production during spring blooms; and an increase in reworked specimens, interpreted to reflect enhanced continental input via river run-off. An increase in abundance of the genus Rhabdosphaera can be explained by opportunistic behavior {{at the end of the}} spring bloom when nutrient levels start to become impoverished. As far as sea surface <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> are concerned, warm water D. pentaradiatus shows positive fluctuations in sapropels while cooler water D. intercalaris and C. pelagicus show negative fluctuations.

Although both acute and chronic oxidative stress have been well demonstrated to induce HSP responses, little evidence is available whether increased HSP levels provide enhanced protection against oxidative stress under elevated yet sublethal temperatures. We studied relationships between oxidative stress and HSPs in a physiological model by using Garra rufa (doctor fish), a fish species naturally acclimatized to different thermal conditions. We compared fish naturally living in a hot spring with relatively high <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> (34. 4 ± 0. 6 °C) to those living in normal river <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> (25. 4 ± 4. 7 °C), and found that levels of all the studied HSPs (HSP 70, HSP 60, HSP 90, HSC 70 and GRP 75) were higher in fish living in elevated <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> compared with normal river <b>water</b> <b>temperature.</b> In contrast, <b>indicators</b> of oxidative stress, including protein carbonyls and lipid hydroperoxides, were decreased in fish living in the elevated temperature, indicating that HSP levels are inversely associated with oxidative stress.

It is a phenomenon resulting from water environmental deterioration and eutrophication caused by accumulation of pollutants in the lake, according to research on the water quality, pollutants of BWA, and occurrence mechanisms of BWA. Dead algae are the material base of BWA, the polluted sediment is an important factor for the formation of BWA, and hydrological and meteorological conditions such as sun light, air temperature, wind speed, and water flow are the other factors that may lead to the formation of BWA.

Though evidence of spatial and temporal variability in the macroinvertebrate communities of vernal pools has been found in previous studies, it has not been studied extensively. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the extent of variability in the macroinvertebrate communities within vernal pools closely situated in a forested landscape. An effort was made to explain this variability with respect to certain physiochemical environmental variables of the pools. Significant variability was observed in the macroinvertebrate communities within the vernal pools both spatially and temporally. <b>Water</b> <b>temperature,</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of seasonal changes, was strongly correlated with the observed variations. Higher species richness and diversity were observed in the pools in winter than in spring 2007. Chironomidae was the most diverse family (8 genera) occurring in these vernal pools.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations between various <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> and different mortality categories in Brisbane, Australia during 1996 - 2004. METHODS: We applied two methods to assess the threshold and <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> for each age and death groups: mean temperature and the threshold assessed from all cause mortality was used for all mortality categories; the specific <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> and the threshold for each mortality category were identified separately according to the minimisation of AIC. We conducted polynomial distributed lag non-linear model to identify effect estimates in mortality with one degree of temperature increase (or decrease) above (or below) the threshold on current days and lagged effects using both methods. RESULTS: Akaike's Information Criterion was minimized when mean temperature was used for all non-external deaths and deaths from 75 to 84 years; when minimum temperature was used for deaths from 0 to 64 years, 65 - 74 years, ≥ 85 years, and from the respiratory diseases; when maximum temperature was used for deaths from cardiovascular diseases. The effect estimates using certain <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> were similar as mean temperature both for current day and lag effects.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distributions of the epiphytic diatom flora on Thalassia testudinum was described within the Florida Bay estuary and at one Atlantic site east of the Florida Keys over a 1 -year period. Species of the genus Mastogloia dominated the epiphytic diatom flora (82 out of 332 total species). Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) revealed four distinct spatial assemblages and two temporal assemblages. Eastern and western Florida Bay assemblages were identified within the estuary. The eastern diatom assemblage was characterized by high relative abundances of Brachysira aponina and Nitzschia liebetruthii, while the western assemblage was characterized by the abundance of Reimerothrix floridensis, particularly during summer. Two diverse and distinct marine assemblages, one located in the Gulf of Mexico along {{the western edge of}} Florida Bay and the other behind the Florida reef tract in the Atlantic Ocean, were also identified. Analysis of the spatial distribution of diatoms and water quality characteristics within Florida Bay suggest that these assemblages may be structured by salinity and nutrient availability, particularly P.

40|$|River <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> is an {{important}} ecological measure and a complex phenomenon. A significant number of influencing factors with different levels of impact on the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> profile, and dynamic <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> behaviour of rivers, must be considered. Critical factors represent air temperature, shade caused by riparian vegetation, flow velocity and solar radiation. In order to obtain exact <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> values, on-site measurements have to be performed, however, {{it is not possible}} to equip every segment of the river with measuring stations. Therefore, the main goal of this project is the development of a GIS-based <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> interpolation model that estimates the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> in rivers. Essential for this GIS-based model is the detailed definition of influencing factors and its spatial representation for developing an analysis model.

During this 17 [*]year period, on average, mean <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> increased by 0. 03 [*]°C per year (± 0. 002 [*]°C) and positive changes in <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> were observed at 2, 385 (86 %) sites. Examination of catchments, where there has been limited human influence on hydrological response, shows that changes in river flow have had little influence on these <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> trends. In the absence of other systematic influences on <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> it is inferred that anthropogenically-driven climate change is driving some of this trend in <b>water</b> <b>temperature...</b>|$|R
