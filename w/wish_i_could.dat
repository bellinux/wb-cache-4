5|$|I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> dissent {{from the}} general, though not universal, chorus of dispraise that has greeted this long-awaited and fairly long-delayed opera; but unless it has secrets to yield up – {{and one of}} the main reasons for feeling so dispirited as it went on was the sense that one might be even more bored, if possible, during a {{subsequent}} hearing than during the first – the majority verdict is all too depressingly right.|$|E

[...] "It's a nostalgic song about my childhood and <b>wishing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stop growing.

25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E
25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Drummond was unrepentant, telling The Observer in 2000 that he couldn't imagine ever feeling regret unless {{his child}} was ill and only [...] "an {{expensive}} clinic" [...] could cure him. [...] By 2004, however, he had {{admitted to the}} BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. [...] "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier.

One of Mary's grandchildren noted that she was very serious; Graves once said, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> cry but I cannot. If I could forget the tragedy, perhaps I would know how to cry again." [...] Mary's brother William did not settle down for any significant time.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Song began {{appearing}} {{in the role of}} spoiled heiress London Tipton in the Disney Channel Original Series, The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. The role was named [...] "Paris" [...] in an early script and alludes to Paris Hilton (London spoofing Paris, and Tipton {{is the name of the}} hotel her father owns in the show). She got the role without an audition and was surprised to find her friend Ashley Tisdale working in the show. Song says, [...] "London is my fantasy person, I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be her. I wish I had her closet." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1941, Chadwick {{was chosen}} to write the final draft of the MAUD Report, which, when {{presented}} by Vannevar Bush to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour {{millions of dollars into}} the pursuit of an atomic bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] speak of heartbreak and are direct, {{referring}} to the subject by his first name, Drew. The song describes fancying someone who already interested in someone else and, therefore, maintaining the sentiments a secret. To him, Swift acted {{as though she was}} happy about his relationship, while crying and lamenting at home. Dave Heaton of PopMatters interpreted the lines [...] "And there she goes, so perfectly / The kind of flawless I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be" [...] to address Swift's ideal of perfection and her attempting to meet it, but not succeeding, a predominant theme on Fearless.|$|E
500|$|While touring rigorously {{in support}} of Happiness... in mid-2000, Mike Turner came across The Age of Spiritual Machines, a 1999 book by {{inventor}} and futurist Ray Kurzweil. [...] "I happened to be lucky enough to discover a really shiny book cover in a book store." [...] Turner stated, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say it was like, 'Well, I've been on this intellectual quest.' I picked it up, read it and went mental."

500|$|The critic from The Sunday Times {{considered}} Fleming to have [...] "a sensational imagination, but {{informed by}} style, zest and—above all—knowledge". Anthony Boucher wrote that [...] "As usual, Ian Fleming has less {{story to tell}} in 90,000 words than Buchan managed in 40,000; but Thunderball is still an extravagant adventure". The critic for the Daily Herald implored [...] "Hey!—that man is taking his clothes off again. So is the girl... Can anybody stop this? Unfortunately not. Not {{this side of the}} best-seller lists. I don't envy Mr Bond's wealthy creator, Ian Fleming. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> pity him", whilst L.G.

500|$|... "Swim Good" [...] {{has been}} called an [...] "astonishing suicide song" [...] and that Ocean finds himself dressed in black ('Like I'm ready for a funeral'), tormented by heartbreak and {{on the verge of}} driving his car into the sea. The song is a grim escape fantasy {{describing}} a murder suicide, which [...] "has the singer driving his car to the shore, his trunk 'bleeding' with 'broken hearts'." [...] The hook of the song ends with the refrain of [...] "I feel like a ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby." [...] "Dust" [...] uses books as an extended metaphor for memories and experience, with lines like [...] "so many pages I wrote, <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> revise 'em / But there's no erasing".|$|E
500|$|... 1922 – '"I <b>Wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Shimmy Like My Sister Kate"' is a jazz {{composition}} {{with words}} and Lyrics by Armand J. Piron.

She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, [...] "He was mean, but {{he wanted to be a}} good person.
