25|$|From his Greenwich Village apartment, Cuppy {{continued}} {{to turn out}} magazine articles and books. He always worked from notes jotted on 3x5-inch index cards. Cuppy would amass hundreds of cards even for a short article. His friend and literary executor Fred Feldkamp (1914–1981) reported that Cuppy sometimes read more than 25 thick books on a subject before he wrote a single <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|On October 1, 2015, it was {{reported}} that HBO was in talks with Snyder to make a TV series based on the comics with no <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> being related to the film. As of 2016 it is believed that talks about the TV series are on hold as a result of Snyder's involvement with the DC Extended Universe.|$|E

500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. I quite {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E
500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>it...</b> and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and you can hardly ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the First World War, Giri {{travelled}} from Dublin to London and {{met with}} Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi wanted for Giri to join the Imperial war effort as a Red Cross Volunteer. Giri initially acceded to Gandhi's request but later regretted his decision. According to one of Giri's biographers, [...] "Gandhiji with his characteristic magnanimity relieved Giri of the obligation to join the Red Cross and did not breathe a <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to anyone.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A celebrated {{performer}} {{has seen}} fit to oblige {{the world with a}} confession of his faith; or, Br–’s RELIGIO DRAMATICI. This gentleman, in his laudable attempt to shift from his person the obloquy of Judaism, with the forwardness of a new convert, in trying to prove too much, has, in the opinion of many, proved too little. A simple declaration of his Christianity was sufficient; but, strange to say, his apology has not a <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> [...] We can do no less than congratulate the general state of Christendom upon the accession of so extraordinary a convert.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name is curious; it is not from the German Eidegenossen as has been supposed. Reguier de la Plancha {{accounts}} for it as follows: — [...] "The name huguenand was given {{to those of the}} religion during the affair of Amboyse, and they were to retail it ever since. I'll say a <b>word</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to settle the doubts of those who have strayed in seeking its origin. The superstition of our ancestors, to within twenty or thirty years thereabouts, was such that in almost all the towns in the kingdom they had a notion that certain spirits underwent their Purgatory in this world after death, and that they went about the town at night, striking and outraging many people whom they found in the streets. But the light of the Gospel has made them vanish, and teaches us that these spirits were street-strollers and ruffians. In Paris the spirit was called le moine bourré; at Orleans, le mulet odet; at Blois le loup garon; at Tours, le Roy Huguet; and so on in other places. Now, it happens that those whom they called Lutherans were at that time so narrowly watched during the day that they were forced to wait till night to assemble, for the purpose of praying God, for preaching and receiving the Holy Sacrament; so that although they did not frighten nor hurt anybody, the priests, through mockery, made them the successors of those spirits which roam the night; and thus that name being quite common in the mouth of the populace, to designate the evangelical huguenands in the country of Tourraine and Amboyse, it became in vogue after that enterprise." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, that {{is settled}} then, {{and no more}} <b>words</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> We shall be glad to have two more with us, and we {{intended}} to go alone only {{because it is not}} everyone that can be trusted." ...|$|R

6000|$|But {{that was}} just the trouble--they wouldn't. And so in course of time Mr. Spillikins was compelled, for {{academic}} reasons, to abandon his life work.

60|$|I {{took it off}} 'ome with me when I left at {{six o'clock}} next morning, and tied it up in my yard.

60|$|Let me, this evening, say a {{few words}} to you on theology, that is, on the being and {{character}} of God. You need not be afraid that I shall use long or difficult words.
