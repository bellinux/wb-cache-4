40|$|Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) {{present a}} {{promising}} avenue to develop spintronic technologies. Addressing individual molecules <b>with</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> in SMM-based spintronic devices remains a ubiquitous challenge: interactions with metallic electrodes can drastically modify the SMM’s properties by charge transfer or through {{changes in the}} molecular structure. Here, we probe electrical transport through individual Fe 4 SMMs using a scanning tunnelling microscope at 0. 5 [*]K. Correlation of topographic and spectroscopic information permits identification of the spin excitation fingerprint of intact Fe 4 molecules. Building from this, {{we find that the}} exchange coupling strength within the molecule’s magnetic core is significantly enhanced. First-principles calculations support the conclusion that this is the result of confinement of the molecule in the two-contact junction formed by the microscope tip and the sample surface...|$|E
40|$|Described {{here are}} efforts to {{diagnose}} transient pressures {{generated by a}} short-pulse (about 0. 5 microseconds) high intensity proton ({approximately} 2 * 10 14 per pulse) beam. Proton energy is 800 -MeV. The tests were performed at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center - Weapons Neutron Research (LANSCE-WNR). Such capability is required for understanding target interaction for the Spallation Neutron Source project as described previously at this conference. 1 - 4 The main approach to effect the pressure measurements utilized the deflection of a diaphragm in intimate contact with the mercury. There are {{a wide variety of}} diaphragm-deflection methods used in scientific and industrial applications. Many deflection-sensing approaches are typically used, including, for instance, capacitive and optical fiber techniques. It was found, however, that conventional pressure measurement using commercial pressure gages <b>with</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> was not possible due to the intense nuclear radiation enviro nment.

30|$|The {{capability}} of SE imaging in the Hitachi HF- 3300 {{at the high}} temperatures afforded by the Protochips Aduro heater system is an added benefit for complementary analysis of catalyst structure and behavior during elevated temperature treatments. The MEMS-fabricated Aduro heater devices have a nominal 500 [*]×[*] 500  μm 2 thin ceramic membrane {{on the order of}} 100 -nm thick supported over a window in a silicon chip. The ceramic membrane has a pattern of 6 -micron diameter holes over which is suspended a holey carbon support film (e.g., C-flat, Protochips, Inc.). In this study, all heating experiments were conducted under high-vacuum conditions in the microscope column. The heater device fits onto a special-made specimen holder, <b>with</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> to provide power from a Keithley 2611 A source meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA). The profile of temperature as a function of input current is calibrated by the manufacturer, using an optical pyrometer while heating the device in a vacuum chamber, thus allowing estimation of temperature of the sample deposited on it, up to 1, 200 °C. Owing to its miniature heated volume, the heating chip has minimal thermal drift and a near instantaneous temperature response at a heating/cooling rate on the order of 106 °C/s [15].|$|E

40|$|A rodent {{model was}} {{developed}} to assess the osteogenic potential of continuous capacitive electrical stimulation on bone healing around titanium (Ti) implants. Adult male rats were fitted subcutaneously <b>with</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>leads,</b> that were placed around Ti implants inserted in the tibia. One electrical lead was attached directly to the extraosseous component of the implant, {{and the other was}} anchored to the adjacent subcutaneous tissues. Bone healing around the Ti implant was assessed histologically after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14 and 21 days of continuous capacitive electrical stimulation as compared to controls and sacrificed immediately. Other groups of animals were given 7 days of continuous capacitive electrical stimulation but sacrificed at day 14 or 21 post-implantation. Histomorphometric analysis of the bone-Ti interface revealed that animals given 5 [...] 7 days of continuous capacitive electrical stimulation demonstrated more bone at the surface of the Ti implant than in controls. Radioautographic analyses of bone formation was carried out in rats injected with tritiated (3 H) -proline 4 days prior to sacrifice at days 7, 14 and 21. These results showed increased 3 H-proline deposition at day 7, corresponding to increased bone formation as shown by morphometric findings. Biomechanical 'pull-out' tests demonstrated that the force required to remove the Ti implants from the tibiae was significantly greater in electrically stimulated animals compared to controls at day 7. Bone densitometric measurements revealed a statistically significant increase in bone density in the electrically-stimulated animals by days 5 [...] 7 compared to controls. In summary, an animal model {{was developed to}} evaluate the effects of continuous capacitive electrical stimulation on bone healing around Ti implants placed in tibiae of rats. Significant bone growth was demonstrated by days 5 [...] 7 postimplantation as in all parameters tested. These findings suggest that continuous capacitive electrical stimul...|$|E
40|$|Coaxial {{electric}} heaters {{have been}} conceived {{for use in}} highly sensitive instruments {{in which there are}} requirements for compact heaters but stray magnetic fields associated with heater electric currents would adversely affect operation. Such instruments include atomic clocks and magnetometers that utilize heated atomic-sample cells, wherein stray magnetic fields at picotesla levels could introduce systematic errors into instrument readings. A coaxial electric heater is essentially an axisymmetric coaxial cable, the outer conductor of which is deliberately made highly electrically resistive so that it can serve as a heating element. As in the cases of other axisymmetric coaxial cables, the equal magnitude electric currents flowing in opposite directions along the inner and outer conductors give rise to zero net magnetic field outside the outer conductor. Hence, a coaxial electric heater can be placed near an atomic-sample cell or other sensitive device. A coaxial electric heater can be fabricated from an insulated copper wire, the copper core of which serves as the inner conductor. For example, in one approach, the insulated wire is dipped in a colloidal graphite emulsion, then the emulsion-coated wire is dried to form a thin, uniform, highly electrically resistive film that serves as the outer conductor. Then the film is coated with a protective layer of high-temperature epoxy except at the end to be electrically connected to the power supply. Next, the insulation is stripped from the wire at that end. Finally, electrical leads from the heater power supply are attached to the exposed portions of the wire and the resistive film. The resistance of the graphite film can be tailored via its thickness. Alternatively, the film can be made from an electrically conductive paint, other than a colloidal graphite emulsion, chosen to impart the desired resistance. Yet another alternative is to tailor the resistance of a graphite film by exploiting the fact that its resistance can be changed permanently within about 10 percent by heating it to a temperature above 300 C. A coaxial heater, <b>with</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>leads</b> attached, that has been bent into an almost full circle for edge heating of a circular window is shown. (In the specific application, there is a requirement for a heated cell window, through which an optical beam enters the cell. ...|$|E

The factors that need to be examined for these materials include material purity, mechanical properties, and superconducting ability below the critical temperature.
