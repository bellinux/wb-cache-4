5|$|A {{new line}} to Rodeløkka was opened on 3 January 1955. The bus {{operation}} {{had been more}} expensive than the tram, and a double track line was built from Carl Berners plass through Dælenenggata to Rodeløkka. The balloon loop was built around the block of Dælenengata, Fagerheimgata, Marstrandgata and Københavngata. The line <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the old Rodeløkka Line with a triangular loop in Københavngata. On 23 April 1961, all traffic on the Rodeløkka Line was terminated. The tracks were removed between 1962 and 1964.|$|E

5|$|During the Roman era {{there was}} a {{settlement}} named Abona at the present Sea Mills; this was important enough to feature in the 3rd-century Antonine Itinerary which documents towns and distances in the Roman empire, and <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> Bath by a road. Archaeological excavations at Abona have found a street pattern, shops, cemeteries and wharves, indicating that the town served as a port. Another settlement at what is now Inns Court, Filwood, had possibly developed from earlier Iron Age farmsteads. There were also isolated villas and small settlements throughout the area, notably Kings Weston Roman Villa and another at Brislington.|$|E
5|$|Each pair of antennas <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> a {{motorized}} switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were {{then sent to}} a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E

5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} {{for construction of}} a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were asking for an upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform {{is the only one of}} the four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E
5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that <b>was</b> <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> a {{revolving}} ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, everything in the turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
