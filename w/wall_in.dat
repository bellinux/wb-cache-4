30|$|Nonlinear {{response}} history {{analyses were}} performed to investigate {{the effects of the}} arrangements of the infill <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> seismic performance of infill <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> RC dual frames. To this end an existing RC building which was damaged during the 23 October 2011 Van earthquake was considered. The building was numerically modeled in its actual situation and 17 other arrangements of the infill <b>walls.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the van earthquake, the response histories of all of the models were estimated due to the three other ground motions. Results of this study revealed that infill walls {{play a vital role in}} seismic performance of the RC buildings. It was shown that noticeable changes may occur in seismic performance (e.g., experienced damage state, energy dissipation, etc.,) of the same structure with different arrangements of the infill <b>walls.</b> <b>In</b> other words, neglecting the effects of the infill <b>walls</b> <b>in</b> nonlinear dynamic analysis may lead to noticeable misunderstanding the seismic performance of the structure.|$|R
