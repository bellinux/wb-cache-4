5|$|Stripped of {{the ability}} to {{construct}} new capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy instead opted to significantly upgrade and reconfigure their existing battleships and battlecruisers. Kirishima was placed in Third Reserve in December 1926, before beginning her first reconstruction in early 1927. Horizontal armor over the ammunition magazines was strengthened, and she was also fitted with anti-torpedo bulges, as permitted by the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty.</b> To upgrade Kirishimas speed, the 36 coal-fired Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with ten new mixed-firing Kampon boilers. To allow for more equipment to be installed on board, her forward superstructure was reconstructed in the Pagoda mast style, facilitating the removal of one of her three funnels. The reconstruction of the Kongō-class battlecruisers added an additional 4,000 tons of armor to the ships, directly violating the terms of the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty.</b> On 16 April 1930, the reconstruction was declared complete.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, most battleships, {{dreadnought}} and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed {{under the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely this meant the ships being broken up for scrap; others were destroyed in target practice or relegated to training and supply duties. One, Mikasa, was given a special exemption to the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty</b> and was maintained as a museum and memorial ship.|$|E

5|$|Unable to {{construct}} new capital ships until 1931, Japan resorted to upgrading battleships and battlecruisers. In July 1926, Haruna {{became the first}} of Japan's vessels to undergo extensive modernization and modification, in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Over the next two years, her horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened, and the machinery spaces within the hull were increased. Anti-torpedo bulges were added along the waterline, as permitted by the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty.</b> She was refitted to accommodate three Type90 Model0 floatplanes. To increase her speed and power capacities, all 36 Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with 16 newer boilers, and Brown-Curtis direct-drive turbines were installed. Harunas forward funnel was removed, and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened. The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6,502 to 10,313long tons, directly violating {{the terms of the}} <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty.</b> In July 1928, Haruna—now capable of speeds of —was reclassified as a battleship.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, the British {{planned to}} build the G3 class, which had the same {{armament}} and armour as battleships {{of the time and}} were rated as battlecruisers only by comparison to the more heavily armoured and slower battleships also planned. They were cancelled as they exceeded the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty. Of the first nine battlecruisers, only HMS Tiger survived the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty</b> and into the 1930s. The three Courageous-class ships were converted to aircraft carriers during the 1920s and only Repulse, Renown and Hood served in the Second World War as battlecruisers. All three went through substantial refits between the wars. Hood was lost {{in the battle of the}} Denmark Strait, Repulse was sunk by Japanese aircraft at the start of the war in the Pacific, and Renown survived the war to be scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the eight}} battlecruiser hulls {{laid down by}} Japan (the four Kongō and four Amagi class), none survived the Second World War. Amagi was being {{converted}} to an aircraft carrier when its hull was catastrophically damaged by the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923 and subsequently broken up, while the last two of the Amagi class were scrapped in 1924 according {{to the terms of}} the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty.</b> was converted to an aircraft carrier in the 1920s, but was scuttled after suffering severe damage from air attacks during the Battle of Midway on 5 June 1942. The four Kongō-class ships were lost in action as well: two during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in November 1942, one by American submarine in November 1944, and one by American aircraft at Kure Naval Base in July 1945.|$|E

5|$|To {{avoid having}} to scrap Hiei {{under the terms of}} the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty,</b> the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to convert her into a demilitarized {{training}} ship. On 15 October 1929, she went into drydock at Kure Naval Arsenal. Her aft 14-inch gun turrets were removed, and she was stripped of all eight of her submerged torpedo tubes, as well as her 6-inch guns and armor belt. All but nine of her boilers were taken out, reducing her speed to , and one of her three funnels was removed. She was reclassified as a reserve ship at the end of November 1929. On 24 April 1930, reconstruction was halted due to the signing of the London Naval Treaty, which further restricted battleship construction and possession amongst the great naval powers, and preservation work was begun at Sasebo. Reconstruction would not resume until July 1931.|$|E
5|$|While {{the victors}} were not {{limited by the}} Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were {{crippled}} after the war. Faced {{with the prospect of}} a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The <b>Washington</b> <b>treaty</b> was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of World War II, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–39 than in 1905–14. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships.|$|E
25|$|The signatories of the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty</b> {{were the}} US, UK, Japan, and France, and Italy; {{at that time}} the only nations in the world with {{significant}} battlefleets. As a result, the terms of the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty,</b> and the subsequent treaties of London 1930 and London 1936 had a decisive effect on the future of capital ship design.|$|E

25|$|The {{practicality}} {{of building}} battleships came into question since during World War I, no decisive victory had {{resulted from a}} major clash between battleships, {{in contrast to the}} Japanese victory of Tsushima more than 17 years before. However, the war experience had clearly shown the problem of ensuring the safety of maritime commercial routes against commerce raiders, for which cruisers appeared better suited than battleships. Thus, by the late 1920s all the countries that had signed the <b>Washington</b> <b>Treaty</b> were building new heavy cruiser classes. For France, the priority was the safety of the waterborne connections between France and her African colonies/protectorates (via the Marseille-Algiers and Bordeaux-Casablanca-Dakar routes).|$|E
