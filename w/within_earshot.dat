However, the early 19th century invention of the bell pull, a complicated system of wires and chains within ceiling and wall cavities, meant a servant could be summoned from a greater distance, and therefore also kept at a greater distance. From this time on it became fashionable for servants to be as near to invisible as possible, which fitted exactly with the next change in architectural and aesthetic fashions.|$|E
25|$|Historian Stanley Karnow said of Kỳ and Thi: “Both {{flamboyant}} {{characters who}} wore gaudy uniforms and sported sinister moustaches, {{the two young}} officers had been friends, and their rivalry seemed to typify the personal struggles for power that chronically afflicted South Vietnam.

The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, said that Thi once refused to report to Kỳ in Saigon when requested. On one occasion, Kỳ came to I Corps to remonstrate with him in early March, Thi addressed his staff and asked mockingly, “Should we pay attention to this funny little man from Saigon or should we ignore him?” Thi made this comment rather loudly, <b>within</b> <b>earshot</b> of Kỳ, and the Vietnamese politician Bùi Diễm thought that the prime minister viewed Thi's comment as a direct challenge to his authority.|$|E

500|$|Project {{director}} Greg LoPiccolo wanted Thiefs audio to both {{enrich the}} environment and enhance gameplay, and the game's design necessitated an advanced sound system. The designers created a [...] "room database" [...] for every mission; these provided a realistic representation of sound wave propagation. Audio designer Eric Brosius and the development team gave sound multiple roles. It was used to give the player aural clues about the NPCs' locations and internal states; to enhance this, vocals were recorded for NPCs. Conversely, sounds generated by objects gave clues to NPCs about the player's location, and NPCs used sound to communicate; a guard's call for help signals other guards <b>within</b> <b>earshot.</b> Sound was also used to divulge narrative information, so that stealthy players could eavesdrop on NPC conversations and {{learn more about the}} game's backstory.|$|E

He has also long warred with Orcus, one of the few demon lords in the Abyss who can match his power. Yet the most notorious of Graz'zt's wars have been against Demogorgon.

60|$|I {{reached the}} {{neighbourhood}} {{of the cottage}} before seven; and as I breasted the steep ascent {{which leads to the}} garden wall, I was struck with surprise to hear a dog. Dogs I had heard before, but only from the hamlet on the hillside above. Now, this dog was in the garden itself, where it roared aloud in paroxysms of fury, and I could hear it leaping and straining on the chain. I waited some while, until the brute’s fit of passion had roared itself out. Then, with the utmost precaution, I drew near again; and finally approached the garden wall. So soon as I had clapped my head above the level, however, the barking broke forth again with redoubled energy. Almost at the same time, the door of the cottage opened, and Ronald and the Major appeared upon the threshold with a lantern. As they so stood, they were almost immediately below me, strongly illuminated, and <b>within</b> easy <b>earshot.</b> The Major pacified the dog, who took instead to low, uneasy growling intermingled with occasional yelps.|$|R
40|$|Despite their semi-solitary nature, {{associations}} among orangutans {{are more}} common than expected by chance for most combinations of age-sex classes. Variation in party size is due to variation in food availability or sexual activity, reflecting the two main types of parties encountered in orangutans. Parties may involve mating or are formed around mothers and immatures of various ages, in which social play is the main social activity. Beyond direct association, Sumatran females tend to remain within audible range of the dominant flanged males, using his long calls to adjust their ranging. Females {{tend to be more}} philopatric than males, although {{it is not clear whether}} males disperse away from their natal range or end up including their natal range within a much larger home range. The accumulating evidence suggests that orangutans live in more than mere neighbourhoods, but in loose communities in which related females form clusters, share a preference for the same dominant flanged male, <b>within</b> whose <b>earshot</b> they tend to remain and whose ranging is more limited.

Two groups of guerrillas of the Luzon Guerrilla Armed Forces, one under Pajota and another under Capt. Eduardo Joson, would be sent in opposite directions to hold the main road near the camp. Pajota and 200guerrillas were to set up a roadblock next to the wooden bridge over the Cabu River. This setup, northeast of the prisoner camp, would be {{the first line of defense}} against the Japanese forces camped across the river, which would be <b>within</b> <b>earshot</b> of the assault on the camp. Joson and his 75guerrillas, along with a Ranger bazooka team, would set up a roadblock [...] southwest of the prisoner camp to stop any Japanese forces that would arrive from Cabanatuan. Both groups would each place 25 land mines in front of their positions, and oneguerrilla from each group was given a bazooka to destroy any armored vehicles. After the POWs and the remainder of the attacking force had reached the Pampanga River meeting point, Prince would fire a second flare to indicate to the ambush sites to pull back (gradually, if they faced opposition) and head to Plateros.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU's Chi Omega {{sorority}} house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism. Beginning at about 2:45a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking. He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle. In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger. Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, <b>within</b> <b>earshot</b> of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing. After leaving the sorority house Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places.

Courtenay was under orders to watch New York City, where one of the frigates was known to be at anchor. On 28 June 1793, Boston arrived off New York, Courtenay deliberately disguising his ship to resemble a French vessel by having the French-speaking members of his crew talk loudly on the quarterdeck while an American pilot boat was <b>within</b> <b>earshot.</b> The French ship in New York was Bompart's ship Embuscade, a large and powerful vessel that had been built less than three years before and carried a combined broadside weight of , [...] more than that of Boston.

2500|$|Jackson's troops served {{well under}} Lee {{in the series}} of battles known as the Seven Days Battles, but Jackson's own {{performance}} in those battles is {{generally considered to be}} poor. He arrived late at Mechanicsville and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night <b>within</b> clear <b>earshot</b> of the battle. He was late and disoriented at Gaines' Mill, and late again at Savage's Station. At White Oak Swamp he failed to employ fording places to cross White Oak Swamp Creek, attempting for hours to rebuild a bridge, which limited his involvement to an ineffectual artillery duel and a missed opportunity. At Malvern Hill Jackson participated in the futile, piecemeal frontal assaults against entrenched Union infantry and massed artillery, and suffered heavy casualties (but this was a problem for all of Lee's army in that ill-considered battle). The reasons for Jackson's sluggish and poorly coordinated actions during the Seven Days are disputed, although a severe lack of sleep after the grueling march and railroad trip from the Shenandoah Valley was probably a significant factor. Both Jackson and his troops were completely exhausted. An explanation for this and other lapses by Jackson was tersely offered by his colleague and brother in-law General Daniel Harvey Hill: [...] "Jackson's genius never shone when he was under the command of another." ...|$|R
