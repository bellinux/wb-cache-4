5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins to fear that the fad will <b>wear</b> <b>off,</b> so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
5|$|Joe and Bonnie host a {{backyard}} barbecue, where Joe's baby daughter, Susie, {{gets into a}} fight with Stewie over a doll and attacks him. Upset by this, Peter takes Stewie to train at the local gymnasium. A trainer notices Stewie struggling with barbells and offers steroids. Peter injects the drugs into Stewie, who becomes incredibly buff and develops an aggressive personality, much to the horror of his family. Stewie becomes tormenting towards Brian. As time passes, Stewie's drugs gradually <b>wear</b> <b>off,</b> much to his shock. His skin becomes incredibly loose and flabby. Stewie jumps out of his bedroom window to avoid Brian's wrath, only to have his loosened skin help him glide to safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects <b>wear</b> <b>off</b> within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of LSVT-BIG for advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off</b> {{remains to be}} determined. Therefore, we evaluated whether LSVT-BIG improves motor disability in eight PD patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off.</b> Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, daily off time, and mobility assessments were evaluated during the “on” time {{before and after the}} LSVT-BIG course. LSVT-BIG significantly improved UPDRS III scores at 4 weeks and UPDRS II scores in the “off” state at 12 weeks, with no changes in the other measures. The findings suggest that LSVT-BIG may be an effective therapy for advanced PD patients with <b>wearing</b> <b>off...</b>|$|R

5|$|By lap 43, Romain Grosjean {{had managed}} to {{overtake}} Verstappen for tenth place. Hamilton started to lose ground on Rosberg, trailing him by 3.4 seconds on lap 44; however, he managed {{to close the gap}} in the succeeding laps. Kimi Räikkönen put in his second stop on lap 47, followed by Vettel's third just one lap later, with Rosberg reacting and changing tyres as well. Hamilton changed tyres on lap 50, and went on to set the fastest lap of the race one lap later. On lap 53, Massa moved ahead of Grosjean into eighth place, but was already reported under investigation for his pre-race tyre temperatures at that point. After serving his penalty, Maldonado managed to overtake Nasr for ninth place on lap 57. Nasr, who was utilizing a two-stop strategy, struggled with his tyres and fell back behind Ricciardo on lap 61. Ricciardo gained another position at Pérez's expense on lap 67, while Verstappen moved into tenth place one lap later, overtaking Maldonado. At the front, Hamilton's tyre started to <b>wear</b> <b>off</b> in the closing stages, enabling Rosberg to take victory 7.7 seconds ahead of his teammate.|$|E

25|$|The {{duration}} of apparent action is usually {{considerably less than}} the half-life. With most benzodiazepines, noticeable effects usually <b>wear</b> <b>off</b> within a few hours. Nevertheless, {{as long as the}} drug is present it will exert subtle effects within the body. These effects may become apparent during continued use or may appear as withdrawal symptoms when dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the early}} European {{exploration}} and trade of Canada {{was based on the}} quest for beaver. The most valuable part of the beaver is its inner fur whose many minute barbs make it excellent for felting, especially for hats. In Canada a 'made beaver' or castor gras that a native had worn or slept on was more valuable than a fresh skin since this tended to <b>wear</b> <b>off</b> the outer guard hairs.|$|E

25|$|While {{the causes}} of a {{hangover}} are still poorly understood, several factors {{are known to be}} involved including acetaldehyde accumulation, changes in the immune system and glucose metabolism, dehydration, metabolic acidosis, disturbed prostaglandin synthesis, increased cardiac output, vasodilation, sleep deprivation and malnutrition. Beverage-specific effects of additives or by-products such as congeners in alcoholic beverages also play an important role. The symptoms occur typically after the intoxicating effect of the alcohol begins to <b>wear</b> <b>off,</b> generally the morning after a night of heavy drinking.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} of mild reductions in growth rate with prolonged stimulant treatment in children, but no causal relationship has been established and reductions {{do not appear to}} persist long-term. Weight loss almost always corresponds with loss of appetite, which may result from the medication. Severe weight loss is very uncommon though. Loss of appetite is very temporary and typically comes back as daily effects of stimulates <b>wear</b> <b>off.</b> Nausea, dizziness, and headaches, other side effect, can also indirectly affect appetite and result in weight loss.|$|E
25|$|The longest-acting {{barbiturates}} have half-lives {{of a day}} or more, {{and subsequently}} result in bioaccumulation of the drug in the system. The therapeutic and recreational effects of long-acting barbiturates <b>wear</b> <b>off</b> significantly faster than the drug can be eliminated, allowing the drug to reach toxic concentrations in the blood following repeated administration (even when taken at the therapeutic/prescribed dose) despite the user feeling little or no effects from the plasma-bound concentrations of the drug. Users who consume alcohol or other sedatives after the drugs effects have worn but before it has cleared the system may experience a greatly exaggerated effect from the other sedatives which can be incapacitating or even fatal.|$|E

25|$|Anesthesia {{awareness}} {{occurs when}} general anesthesia is inadequately maintained, {{for a number}} of reasons. Typically, anesthesia is 'induced' with an intravenous drug, but 'maintained' with an inhaled anesthetic given by the anesthesiologist (note that several other methods safely and effectively maintaining anesthesia). Barbiturates are used only for induction of anesthesia and these drugs rapidly and reliably induce anesthesia, but <b>wear</b> <b>off</b> quickly. A neuromuscular blocking drug may then be given to cause paralysis which facilitates intubation, although this is not always required. The anesthesiologist has the responsibility to ensure that the maintenance technique (typically inhalational) is started soon after induction to prevent the patient from waking up.|$|E
25|$|Several {{drugs can}} cause or worsen anxiety, whether in intoxication, {{withdrawal}} or from chronic use. These include alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, sedatives (including prescription benzodiazepines), opioids (including prescription pain killers and illicit drugs like heroin), stimulants (such as caffeine, cocaine and amphetamines), hallucinogens, and inhalants. While many often report self-medicating anxiety with these substances, improvements in anxiety from drugs are usually short-lived (with worsening of anxiety in the long-term, sometimes with acute anxiety {{as soon as}} the drug effects <b>wear</b> <b>off)</b> and tend to be exaggerated. Acute exposure to toxic levels of benzene may cause euphoria, anxiety, and irritability lasting up to 2 weeks after the exposure.|$|E
