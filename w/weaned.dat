5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, {{eyes open and}} fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice, while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are <b>weaned.</b> The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when <b>weaned.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be <b>weaned</b> off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful.

5|$|For otariids {{and some}} phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups {{for a few}} days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These {{foraging}} trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. While their mothers are away, the pups will fast. Lactation in otariids may last 6–11 months; in the Galápagos fur seal it can last as long as 3 years. Pups of these species are <b>weaned</b> at lower weights than their phocid counterparts. Walruses are unique in that mothers nurse their young at sea. The female rests at the surface with its head held up, and the young suckle upside down. Young pinnipeds typically learn to swim on their own and some species can even swim at birth. Other species may wait days or weeks before entering the water. Elephant seals do not swim until weeks after they are <b>weaned.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally <b>weaned</b> from their mothers between four and six months of age.|$|E
5|$|In precocial species, {{the mothers}} invest little in nest {{building}} {{and some do}} not build nests at all. The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her. Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls. Though relatively independent and <b>weaned</b> within days, precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers. Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters {{spend more time in}} the nest than those with larger litters.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: The {{majority}} of patients entering the <b>weaning</b> process from mechanical ventilation (MV) in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) will have a short and simple <b>weaning</b> (SW) successfully terminated within 24  hours, while other may take up to one week (difficult <b>weaning)</b> or longer.

5|$|The {{gestation}} period for cats is between 64 and 67 days, {{with an average}} of 66 days. The size of a litter usually is three to five kittens, with the first litter usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are <b>weaned</b> between six and seven weeks old, and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months (females) and to 5–7 months (males), although this can vary depending on breed. Females can have two to three litters per year, so may produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding span of around ten years.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} three to four years, while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are <b>weaned</b> at eight to nine months of age.|$|E
5|$|Capybara {{gestation}} is 130–150 days, {{and produces}} {{a litter of}} four capybara young on average, but may produce between one and eight in a single litter. Birth is on land and the female rejoins the group {{within a few hours}} of delivering the newborn capybaras, which join the group as soon as they are mobile. Within a week, the young can eat grass, but continue to suckle—from any female in the group—until <b>weaned</b> around 16 weeks. The young form a group within the main group. Alloparenting has been observed in this species. Breeding peaks between April and May in Venezuela and between October and November in Mato Grosso, Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Crossbred cows produce up to, and in {{some cases}} in excess of, 20% more <b>weaned</b> calf weight as a result of {{increased}} reproductive performance and maternal ability. Crossbred cow longevity is also increased by up to two years when compared with straightbred cows. However, the benefits of hybrid vigour in a crossbred cow decline in subsequent generations if progeny are mated to cattle of parentage similar to the cow, and increase if a new breed is introduced. Although studies acknowledge that the major production benefits of hybrid vigour occur in crossbred cow herds, the main use of Limousins outside of Europe continues to be as terminal sires in purebred British breed cow herds.|$|E
5|$|However, in Scotland {{and parts}} of {{northern}} England near the Scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century.

40|$|Weaning is {{a source}} of social, {{nutritional}} and environmental disorders that challenge piglet health. This study assesses the relevance of using plasma indicators of oxidative status as biomarkers of health around <b>weaning</b> in pigs. Blood antioxidant potential (BAP), hydroperoxides (HPO), oxidative stress index (OSI, e. g. HPO/BAP), vitamin A and E concentrations were investigated in two different trials. Trial A was carried out in an experimental unit to investigate the effects of age (from 12 to 147 days of age), <b>weaning</b> (at 21 or 28 days of age) and management at <b>weaning</b> (in optimal (OC) or deteriorated (DC) conditions) on those parameters. Trial B was performed in 16 commercial pig farms to describe the variability of these indicators on field between 26 and 75 days of age. In trial A, between 12 and 147 days of age, HPO globally increased (P 0. 1). Vitamins E and A concentrations dropped 5 days after <b>weaning</b> independently of <b>weaning</b> age, <b>weaning</b> conditions and expression of diarrhea (P < 0. 001). Twelve days after <b>weaning,</b> whatever the <b>weaning</b> age, HPO and OSI increased in DC compared to OC piglets (P = 0. 05 and P < 0. 01) and in piglets exhibiting diarrhea compared to those without diarrhea (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001). In DC pigs, BAP was also decreased (P < 0. 05) 12 days after <b>weaning.</b> On trial B, plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E decreased and HPO increased 5 and 19 days respectively after <b>weaning</b> (P < 0, 001). Contrarily to trial A, BAP values did not drop after <b>weaning.</b> Piglets which had the lowest ADG (Average Daily Gain) after <b>weaning</b> had greater HPO and OSI and lower vitamin A and E concentrations after <b>weaning</b> but also lower vitamin E concentration before <b>weaning</b> (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, HPO or OSI seem to be good indicators of health disorders around <b>weaning</b> and plasma concentration of vitamin E before <b>weaning</b> is associated to growth after <b>weaning...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to raise {{questions}} on the effect of skill mix and organizational structure on <b>weaning</b> from mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is an essential life-saving technology. There are, however, numerous associated complications that influence the morbidity and mortality of patients receiving intensive care. Therefore, it was essential to use the safest and most effective form of ventilation for the shortest possible duration. Because of the potential complications and costs of mechanical ventilation, research to date have focused on accurate <b>weaning</b> readiness assessment, methods and organizational aspects that influence the <b>weaning</b> process. In early 2005, the literature was reviewed from 1986 to 2004 by accessing the following databases: Medline, Proquest, Science Direct, CINAHL, and Blackwell Science. The keywords mechanical ventilation, <b>weaning,</b> protocols, critical care, nursing role, decision-making and <b>weaning</b> readiness were used separately and combinations. Controversy exists in <b>weaning</b> practices about appropriate and efficacious <b>weaning</b> readiness assessment indicators, the best method of <b>weaning</b> and the use of <b>weaning</b> protocols. Arguably, the implementation of <b>weaning</b> protocols may have little effect in an environment that favours collaboration between nursing and medical staff, autonomous nursing decision-making in relation to <b>weaning</b> practices, and high numbers of nurses qualified at postgraduate level.

Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts.
