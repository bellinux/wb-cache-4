5|$|The {{available}} evidence {{does not indicate}} that circumcision provides HIV protection for heterosexual women. Data is lacking regarding the effect circumcision may have on the transmission rate of men who engage in anal sex with a female partner. It is undetermined whether circumcision benefits men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Those at {{high risk}} of {{infection}} should be tested as there is effective treatment for those who have the disease. Groups that screening is recommended for include those who have not been vaccinated and one of the following: people from areas of the world where hepatitis B occurs in more than 2%, those with HIV, intravenous drug users, men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> and those who live with someone with hepatitis B.|$|E
50|$|In {{public health}} settings, MSM ("men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men") is {{clinically}} {{used to describe}} men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> other men without referring to their sexual orientation, <b>with</b> WSW ("women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women") also used as a corollary.|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women. Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: Women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women <b>have</b> been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women. Women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women <b>have</b> been an obscure group. Conclusion: The conclusion was that women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women <b>have</b> not been included in the STI information available on the internet within the county councils of Kalmar and Kronoberg...|$|R
2500|$|Some other {{cultures}} {{do not recognize}} a homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual distinction. It is common to distinguish a person's sexuality according to their sexual role (active/passive; insertive/penetrated). In this distinction, the passive role is typically associated with femininity or inferiority, while the active role is typically associated with masculinity or superiority. For example, an investigation of a small Brazilian fishing village revealed three sexual categories for men: men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> only <b>with</b> men (consistently in a passive role), men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> only <b>with</b> women, and men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women and men (consistently in an active role). [...] While men who consistently occupied the passive role were recognized as a distinct group by locals, men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> only women, and men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women and men, were not differentiated. Little is known about same-sex attracted females, or sexual behavior between females in these cultures.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> and following disasters.|$|E
5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir, with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{evaluating}} {{the effect of}} circumcision on the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections have reached conflicting conclusions. A 2006 meta-analysis found that circumcision was associated with lower rates of syphilis, chancroid and possibly genital herpes. A 2010 review found that circumcision reduced the incidence of HSV-2 (herpes simplex virus, type 2) infections by 28%. The researchers found mixed results for protection against trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis and no evidence of protection against gonorrhea or syphilis. Among men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> reviews have found poor evidence for protection against sexually transmitted infections other than HIV, {{with the possible exception}} of syphilis.|$|E

Like older studies, the data also showed that vaginal penetration with dildos, or <b>with</b> other <b>sex</b> toys, among women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women is rare. A 2012 online survey of 3,116 women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women, published in The BMJ, found the majority of women reporting a history of genital rubbing (99.8%), vaginal fingering (99.2%), genital scissoring (90.8%), cunnilingus (98.8%) and vibrator use (74.1%).|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{prostitution}} and drug use, homosexuality {{has never been}} banned in China, but it was listed as a psychiatric disorder until 2001, and public acts of homosexual sex are punishable as hooliganism. Although increasingly tolerated in the cities, in general, homosexuality is highly stigmatised and men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> are under considerable pressure to conceal their sexual orientation. As a result, most homosexuals are married, or {{will be in the}} future, and form a bridge between the high-risk men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> group to their low-risk wives and other partners. The government has initiated few interventions for men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men,</b> leaving such programmes to advocacy groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers. However, the government recently estimated that there were 5–10 million men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> living in China, of whom 1.35% are thought to be HIV positive. This information, in addition to studies indicating low levels of HIV knowledge, perceived risk, and testing, and high rates of sexually transmitted diseases, has prompted the Ministry of Health to now include men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>men</b> in the high-risk groups and to call for the development of novel interventions to target them.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women <b>who</b> {{reported}} <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> {{both men and women}} and women <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % <b>who</b> reported ever <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a woman were compared with those <b>who</b> reported <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. RESULTS: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a <b>sex</b> partner <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors.
