By 2017, data showed that, under her tenure, the homeless rate had gone up by 48 percent in her district, with a 36 percent increase in the San Gabriel Valley itself. [...] The increase was attributed by officials familiar with the problem to constantly increasing housing costs combined with flat incomes.

[...] Thompson called the game subtle, including jabs at the participants and gaming culture by using the language of games {{as a way to}} think about the killings. Writing for The Courier Mail, Paul Syvret's advice to those who found the game controversial and in bad taste was to [...] "lighten up". Bogost summed up his review of the game by writing [...] "this game is not fun, it is challenging, and difficult to play—not technically difficult, but conceptually difficult. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> of that." [...] David Kociemba, a professor at Emerson College, agreed with Bogost and commented that [...] "the controversy should be that there aren't more games like Super Columbine Massacre RPG! that are as demanding and as artistically innovative."

Eva Evans mentioned the need for a math and science program, [...] "As a college sorority, we've always advanced an educational agenda. We always had high GPA requirements. [...] And more than ever, we're pushing the importance of math and science for our girls. [...] <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>more</b> black women in those fields." [...] The program's purpose is to increase the successes of youth in mathematics and science, as well as technology. Campaigns to highlight the program's importance were sponsored by the National Science Foundation and historically black colleges from across the country. Several chapters provided two-week math and science summer camps on college and day school campuses, which consisted of hands-on-learning through laboratory interactions, field trips to important sites, youth camps, and speeches from influential experts in specific areas of studies. For example, a PIMS program at Park Street Elementary School in Marietta, Georgia, consisted of third through fifth grade girls and provided educational field trips in order to stimulate involvement in math and science. Also, a national P.I.M.S. Olympiad, deriving from knowledge of math and science, in conjunction with the PIMS Community Parade was held at the 58th Boulé in Dallas, Texas.|$|E
