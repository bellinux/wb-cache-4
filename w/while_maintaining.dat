40|$|High {{humidity}} {{enhances the}} injurious effect of ultraviolet radiation. This was demonstrated in experiments in which hairless mice were irradiated with Westinghouse FS- 40 -T- 12 sunlamps <b>while</b> <b>maintained</b> in an environmental chamber allowing controlled conditions of relative humidity and temperature. Hairless mice given 10 MED (minimal erythemal dose) <b>while</b> <b>maintained</b> at 80 % relative humidity had markedly greater exfoliation, crusting, and erosion of skin than did mice maintained at 5 % and 10 % relative humidity. Animals kept at 50 % humidity had damage intermediate to those kept at {{high and low}} humidity. These morphologic observations were confirmed histologically. Additionally, water immersion enhances ultraviolet injury. Animals immersed in water for 6 hr prior to irradiation with 3 MED had more damage than animals irradiated but not immersed. Similarly, albino rabbits irradiated with 300 nm radiation from a xenon arc grating monochrometer had lower erythemal energy requirements on that part of their skin that had been hydrated with wet packs compared to nonhydrated skin...|$|R

Yeasts at the higher growth rates contained many more ribosomes than did yeasts at the lower growth rates. They also had a higher percentage of ribosomes active in protein synthesis and a faster rate of polypeptide-chain elongation than did the slower-growing cells. Hyphal cells at faster growth rates also contained many more ribosomes and showed a faster rate of polypeptide-chain elongation than did slower-growing cells. However, the faster-growing cells had a substantially lower proportion of ribosomes active in protein synthesis than did the slower-growing hyphae. Pulse-chase experiments failed to provide any evidence of protein turnover, which might otherwise invalidate the values calculated for the peptide-chain elongation rates...|$|R
5|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, <b>while</b> <b>maintaining</b> the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch.|$|E

5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, <b>while</b> <b>maintaining</b> airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E

50|$|Incubator Shaker (or thermal shaker) can be {{considered}} a mix of an incubator and a shaker.

5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to display on the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, <b>while</b> <b>maintaining</b> the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process.
