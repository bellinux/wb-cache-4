5|$|According to Procopius, the Slavs {{believed}} in one god, {{the creator of}} lightning and master of the entire universe, to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E

In recent years the Hoyas only play Cornell and Holy Cross regularly (in football), and many of these schools no longer use the fight songs that Georgetown's song mocks.|$|E
5|$|On February 10 Matsui {{received}} a messenger from the Army General Staff who informed him, much to Matsui's chagrin and disappointment, {{that he would}} soon be relieved of command and replaced with Shunroku Hata. Ultimately, the Army General Staff did not punish Matsui but they did shake up the whole field command in China and Matsui {{was just one of}} eighty senior officers, including Asaka and Yanagawa, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> recalled at the same time.|$|E

5|$|Rakočević, Sabolović, Radojčić and {{two other}} former KOS agents were tried in Belgrade in 1993. The five were charged with {{instigation}} of terrorism and other crimes, but all were acquitted. Radojčić was arrested again in Zagreb in late 1993. The second Trial of Radojčić and eight other suspects charged in connection with Operations Labrador and Opera, held in Zagreb, ended with the acquittal of Radojčić and Ratomir Mažibrada, who were in custody, and the convictions of the other defendants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> tried in absentia.|$|E
5|$|The source {{material}} {{comes from the}} works of three Roman historians, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> born after the events of 52 AD. Suetonius (c.69–75 to after 130, probably writing around AD 121), and Cassius Dio (around 155–164 to after 229, probably writing 200–22) both wrote about the event and quoted the phrase. Tacitus (c.56–117, writing from around 98 to 117) mentions the event but does not quote the phrase.|$|E

5|$|Trigg {{was the son}} of William Trigg (1716–1773) and Mary (Johns) Trigg (1720–1773), {{whose family}} was {{prominent}} on the Virginia frontier. His father served as a Judge of the Court of Chancery, an equity court, and the Bedford County Court. Trigg had four brothers, William, John, Abram and Daniel, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> soldiers in the Revolutionary War. Two of these brothers, John and Abram, later represented Virginia in the U.S. Congress. Stephen married Mary Christian, daughter of another Virginia pioneer, Israel Christian. Trigg lived the early part of his life in southwest Virginia and ran a tavern in Botetourt County.|$|E
5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and water shortages also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force. This broke up most assaults before they got started.|$|E
5|$|During the tour, Saggers had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Fifty light {{infantry}} {{men were}} in pursuit of Mercer's men when a fresh brigade of 1,100 militiamen {{under the command of}} Cadwalader appeared. Mawhood gathered his men <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> over the battlefield and put them into battle line formation. Meanwhile, Sullivan was at a standoff with the detachment of the 55th Regiment that had come to assist the 40th Regiment, neither daring to move towards the main battle for risk of exposing its flank. Cadwalader attempted to move his men into a battle line but they had no combat experience and did not know even the most basic military maneuvers. When his men {{reached the top of the}} hill and saw Mercer's men fleeing from the British, most of the militia turned around and ran back down the hill.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo was a {{contemporary}} of Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Perugino, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> slightly {{older than he}} was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the Academy of the Medici. Botticelli was a particular favourite of the Medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's ability to deliver a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.|$|E

5|$|Montreal was {{the capital}} of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament {{building}} to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill. For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> vying to become the young nation's official capital.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{holds that}} either Hotu Matu‘a or Tu‘u ko Iho, the legendary founder(s) of Rapa Nui, brought 67tablets from their homeland. The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous {{plants such as}} the toromiro. However, there is no homeland likely {{to have had a}} tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America. Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development. Given that few if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s could read the glyphs, it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate. Indeed, early visitors were told that literacy was a privilege of the ruling families and priests <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> kidnapped in the Peruvian slaving raids or died soon afterwards in the resulting epidemics.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E
