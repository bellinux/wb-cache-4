5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E

The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E

25|$|Meitei {{literature}} is the literature {{written in the}} Meitei language (Manipuri, Meiteilon), including literature composed in Meitei by writers from Manipur, Assam, Tripura, Myanmar and Bangladesh. The history of Meitei literature trace back to thousands of years with flourish of its civilization. The survival of the literature after passing through the massive devastation, the terror event of history, by burning of Meitei scriptures, which is known as Puya Meithaba, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> The resilience that Meiteis could acquire {{in the event of}} devastation proved her ability to survive in history. Most of the early literary works found in Meitei literature were in poetry and prose. Some of the books were written with combination of both the prose and poetry. One of the most famous Meitei writers of the twentieth century is M. K. Binodini Devi.|$|E

Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi placed the entry as the fourth best of the series in 2009, viewing its bleak humor and [...] "thought-provoking moments" [...] of dialogue as the factors that made it one of the most popular episodes. In 2008, Starpulse gave the installment an honorable mention as one of the 10 best X-Files episodes.

500|$|After the {{publication}} of Eureka, a vehement anonymous censure {{was published in the}} Literary Review. Poe believed it to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820–1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as pantheistic and [...] "a damnable heresy" [...] that [...] "conscience would compel him to denounce". Literary critic George Edward Woodberry in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school [...] "rendered ridiculous" [...] by absurdity and the density of his ignorance. Thomas Dunn English, a writer, lawyer, and doctor who frequently criticized Poe, wrote a news article for the John-Donkey with the headline, [...] "Great Literary Crash". The article explained that a shelf of books crashed because someone had [...] "imprudently" [...] stacked an edition of Eureka on it and that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that the whole building did not fall down because of it.|$|E

500|$|A {{letter to}} Hagenauer dated 16 August {{indicated}} that Leopold wished {{to proceed to}} Turin, then across northern Italy to Venice, and home via the Tyrol. [...] "Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to follow our noses", he wrote, but added: [...] "...I have said I shall go [...] home and I shall keep my word". The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in Geneva on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: [...] "I wrote for him [...] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> The child had never broken off, but following the modulations, he had substituted a number of passages for those I had written".

2500|$|The first section, [...] "A Miracle", {{discusses}} the popular view of Mother Teresa {{and focuses on}} the 1969 BBC documentary Something Wonderful for God which {{brought her to the}} attention of the general public and served as the basis for the book of the same title by Malcolm Muggeridge. Hitchens says that Calcutta's reputation as a place of abject poverty, [...] "a hellhole", is not deserved, but nevertheless provides a sympathetic context for Mother Teresa's work there. He quotes from conversations between Muggeridge and Mother Teresa, providing his own commentary. He quotes Muggeridge's description of [...] "the technically unaccountable light" [...] the BBC team filmed in the interior of the Home of the Dying as [...] "the first authentic photographic miracle". Hitchens contrasts this with the cameraman's statement that what Muggeridge thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> was the result of them using the latest Kodak film.|$|E

2500|$|When the Rosary Way was {{successfully}} completed, Kossowski received [...] "the biggest ceramic commission that I ever had till then", The Vision of St. Simon Stock. Kossowski recalled:At that time I {{had already had}} some experience with the famous old Fulham Pottery which was still operating. They were quite ready to fire for me the larger pieces of ceramics in their old-fashioned kiln, one not used anymore elsewhere, heated by coal and coke. They could get only one temperature and one kind of glaze. You could not make any changes and I realized that every piece could be fired only once. So I had to put the colours and the glazes and the body in one firing only. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that it came out quite alright, with very few small cracks.

2500|$|Just before Thanksgiving 1983, {{complications}} from {{a blood clot}} forced her to have her leg amputated. When {{she returned to the}} show in April 1984, her character's life mirrored her own. [...] After visiting Aunt Meta in New York, Bert returned to Springfield and began experiencing pain in her leg (which had been fitted with a prosthesis by this time and mostly kept off camera). [...] She ended up having her leg amputated just as the actress who played her had. For the first time in decades, Bert had to depend upon others to wait on her hand and foot, resulting in one of the series' most memorable stories. (Bert, sitting in a wheelchair at Cedars Hospital, told Josh Lewis, who had been paralyzed recently and had given up hope, that life itself <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> and never to forget it.) In a moving scene, Bauer dropped a teacup. She tried to get it, but could not, and in sheer frustration, she burst into tears. [...] As she went through rehab following her operation, camera shot closed in on her remaining leg as she learned to walk again, bringing even more realism to the storyline.|$|E
2500|$|The Muqaddimah further {{notes that}} Moses lived {{only a few}} generations after Jacob, {{the founder of the}} Israelite tribes, {{according}} to the Levite tribe genealogy, as described by Al-Masudi. Ibn Khaldun argues that it [...] "is improbable that the descendants of one man could branch out into such a number within four generations." [...] The Muqaddimah also states that there was a general assumption that Solomon's army was similarly large, but Ibn Khaldun refutes this, noting that Solomon came only eleven generations after Jacob, and argues that the [...] "descendants of one man in eleven generations would not branch out into such a number, as has been assumed." [...] He then agrees with another statement from the [...] "Israelite Stories" [...] suggesting that Solomon's army had 12,000 soldiers and 1,400 horses. He notes that this was when the Israelite state was at its strongest, making other claims giving larger numbers for the Israelite army unlikely. Ibn Khaldun notes that Jews have claimed the unrealistically large increase in the Israelite population within several generations was possible because it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> of God, a claim that Ibn Khaldun did not dismiss completely. He considers such a miracle highly unlikely, but appears to be open to the possibility.|$|E

2500|$|The {{process of}} canonisation {{requires}} the documentation {{of a miracle}} resulting from the intercession of the prospective saint. In 2002 the Vatican recognised as a miracle the healing of a tumour in the abdomen of Monica Besra, an Indian woman, after {{the application of a}} locket containing Teresa's picture. According to Besra, a beam of light emanated from the picture and her cancerous tumour was cured; however, her husband and some of her medical staff said that conventional medical treatment eradicated the tumour. Dr. Ranjan Mustafi, who told the New York Times he had treated Besra, said that the cyst was caused by tuberculosis: [...] "It was not a miracle... She took medicines for nine months to one year." [...] According to Besra's husband, [...] "My wife was cured by the doctors and not by any miracle... This miracle is a hoax." [...] Besra said that her medical records, including sonograms, prescriptions and physicians' notes, were confiscated by Sister Betta of the Missionaries of Charity. According to Time, calls to Sister Betta and the office of Sister Nirmala (Teresa's successor as head of the order) elicited no comment. Officials at Balurghat Hospital, where Besra sought medical treatment, said that they were pressured by the order to call her cure miraculous. In February 2000, former West Bengal health minister Partho De ordered a review of Besra's medical records at the Department of Health in Kolkata. According to De, there was nothing unusual about her illness and cure based on her lengthy treatment. He said that he had refused to give the Vatican the name of a doctor who would certify that Monica Besra's healing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b>|$|E
