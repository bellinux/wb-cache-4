25|$|In Yorkshire, a mill is {{a textile}} factory. The {{original}} mill {{was built by}} John Moore in 1875 for <b>worsted</b> <b>spinning.</b> In 1919 the clock tower was built as a war memorial to those lost in World War I, and two floors were added. The mill was later sold to W & J Whitehead, who ran the ring spinning machine which {{is still in the}} spinning gallery. In 1970 Bradford Council bought the mill and it opened as a museum on 14 December 1974.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the differences between}} two international test methods on the assessment of pilling and appearance change of <b>worsted</b> <b>spun</b> cashmere and superfine wool knitwear and their blends. Differences between the standard ICI Pill Box Method and the Random Tumble Method were found in both the significance and magnitude of resistance to pilling and appearance change {{and the amount of}} fabric mass loss of <b>worsted</b> <b>spun</b> cashmere and cashmere superfine wool blend knit fabrics. The ICI Pill Box Method differentiated to a greater extent the effects of wool type and blend ratio of cashmere and wool compared with the Random Tumble Method. Generally the addition of cashmere or low crimp superfine wool resulted in fabrics being more resistance to pilling and appearance change compared with fabrics made from high crimp superfine wool. This was associated with increased fabric mass loss when assessed by the ICI Pill Box Method but not with the Random Tumble Method.

2500|$|The woollen {{industry}} {{developed as}} a cottage industry but during the Industrial Revolution and the mechanisation of the textile industry, mills were built using water then steam power. A cotton mill and weaving shed for calicoes were built by the river in the late 18th century. Later woolcombing and <b>worsted</b> <b>spinning</b> were introduced. By the mid 19th century 500 inhabitants were employed in two worsted-mills, a paper-mill, and other mills. A tannery {{was established in the}} 19th century. At this time the opening of the new Leeds Road and Bradford Road greatly increased access for trade. Many houses were built {{from the middle of the}} 19th century onwards, including the first row of terraces by the newly formed Otley Building Society from 1847. Otley railway station opened in 1865 connecting goods and people to Leeds, with a connection to Bradford in 1875. [...] At its peak it had 50 trains a day, but it was closed in 1965 under the Beeching cuts. [...] Kirkgate was the first street to be paved in 1866, followed by sewers in 1969.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the processing requirements of both cash-mere and superfine Merino wool is often kept confidential and little research on cashmere processing has been pub-lished. Given the lack of technical information on the dehairing, worsted processing, and quality of cashmere tex-tiles, a series of experiments have been completed [1]. This work has shown that Australian cashmere has greater length after carding than cashmere from other origins [2, 3], sug-gesting that Australian cashmere should perform at a satis-factory level during top making and produce yarns of at least equivalent quality to cashmere from Iran and Mongolia. The trends in textiles, and in particular for textiles com-posed of animal fibers, are for finer fabrics that are suitable for trans-seasonal wear [4, 5].

50|$|Many spinners {{differentiate}} between worsted preparation and <b>worsted</b> <b>spinning.</b> Worsted preparation {{refers to the}} way the fibre is prepared before spinning, using ginning machines which force the fibre staples to lie parallel to each other. Once these fibres have been made into a top, they are then combed to remove the short fibres. The long fibres are combined in subsequent gilling machines to again make the fibres parallel. This produces overlapping untwisted strands called slivers. <b>Worsted</b> <b>spinning</b> refers to using a worsted technique, which produces a smooth yarn in which the fibres lie parallel.|$|E

50|$|Roving {{and wool}} top {{are often used}} to <b>spin</b> <b>worsted</b> yarn. Many hand spinners buy their fibre in roving or top form. Top and roving are ropelike in appearance, in {{that they can be}} thick and long. While some mills put a slight twist in the rovings they make, it is not enough twist to be a yarn. The fibres in top and rovings all lie {{parallel}} to one another along the length, which makes top ideal for <b>spinning</b> <b>worsted</b> yarns.|$|R
25|$|Cloth {{production}} {{moved away}} from the cottage into manufactories. The first moves towards manufactories called mills were made in the spinning sector. The move in the weaving sector was later. By the 1820s, all cotton, wool and <b>worsted</b> was <b>spun</b> in mills; but this yarn went to outworking weavers who continued to work in their own homes. A mill that specialised in weaving fabric was called a weaving shed.|$|R

40|$|Eri silk {{produced}} by Philosamia cynthia ricini silkworm is a fibre not well-known to the silk industry, {{in spite of}} the fact that Eri silk is finer, softer, and has better mechanical and thermal properties than most animal fibres. Eri silk has a high commercial potential, as the host plants of Eri silk worms are widespread in diverse geographical locations, and the worms also have a higher degree of disease resistance than most other silk worms. Mills are often not aware of the properties of Eri for designing appropriate end products. Thus, Eri silk yarn is traditionally {{produced by}} hand spinning, and Eri silk usually ends up as material for handwoven shawls. The potential for bulk fibre processing and the development of soft luxurious novel Eri silk products is yet to be discovered. To better understand the material and its processing behaviour, Eri silk was characterised and cocoons were processed into tops through degumming, opening, and cutting filaments into different lengths, followed by a <b>worsted</b> <b>spun</b> silk processing route. Fibre properties such as fineness, crimp, strength and length at different processing stages up to combed tops were measured. The results indicate that staple Eri silk can be processed via the worsted topmaking route, using a cut length of 200 mm or 150 mm for filament sheets prepared from degummed cocoons. <br /...|$|R
