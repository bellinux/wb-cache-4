500|$|Interpretations of the song's meaning {{vary from}} one {{listener}} to the next; some people {{view it as}} a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. University of Florida scholar Jonathan Matusitz describes the song's lyrics as a means of expressing politically sensitive ideas that could not be stated through any other medium. In this interpretation, the lyrics near the beginning, [...] "I've asked you without end / <b>When</b> <b>will</b> <b>you</b> go with me / But you always laughed at me / for having nothing to my name" [...] ("") are taken to express the [...] "humiliation and lack of individuality, possession, and personal freedom", the [...] "sense of loss and disorientation" [...] among China's youth in the 1980s. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as [...] "recast the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole." [...] The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yī wú suŏ yŏu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means [...] "to have nothing" [...] and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning [...] "I have nothing" [...] (implying that it is a song about two people), or [...] "we have nothing" [...] (understanding it as social commentary).|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Harvard Crimson, Soyoung Kim {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{representation}} of females in K-pop has been problematic" [...] and singled out Girls' Generation's [...] "Gee" [...] as an embodiment; its repetitive lyrics [...] "What should I do?" [...] (...) , [...] "fool" [...] (...) , or [...] "I don't know" [...] (...) {{suggest that the}} girls are [...] "utterly clueless children" [...] who [...] "dumb [...] down" [...] just to attract a partner. He further cited the single [...] "I Got a Boy" [...] as an epitome of the group's non-empowering lyrics, with lines such as [...] "I got a boy, he's awesome / I got a boy, he's kind / I got a boy, handsome boy, my heart's been taken away [...] My prince! / <b>When</b> <b>will</b> <b>you</b> rescue me?" [...] Kim {{came to the conclusion}} that [...] "female K-pop artists orient themselves around men in order to gain attention." [...] Despite the criticism, several of Girls' Generation's songs, such as [...] "Run Devil Run", [...] "Hoot", and [...] "Bad Girl" [...] (from their 2011 eponymous Japanese album) are noted for portraying [...] "confident young women with their own opinion", which is a departure from their early singles. The group's 2011 single [...] "The Boys" [...] was noted for conveying a feminist theme and was compared to Beyoncé's 2011 single [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] for the same [...] "women-powered" [...] content; Eun-Young Jun in the book The Korean Wave: Korean Media Go Global (2013) noted its lyrics for depicting [...] "sexually daring women" [...] who are confident in their sexuality.|$|E

2500|$|The first movement, an aria, {{begins with}} an {{expressive}} melody of the obbligato oboe which is {{picked up by the}} voice on the words [...] (I have enough). The beginning upward leap of a minor sixth is reminiscent of the aria [...] (Have mercy) in Bach's St Matthew Passion and the aria [...] (<b>When</b> <b>will</b> <b>you</b> come, my salvation?) from [...] The first motif is changed to a phrase that appears at the end of three vocal sections. A similar motif begins the middle section on the words [...] (I have seen him), turning upwards in the end. Klaus Hofmann notes a [...] "feeling of serene contentedness with life" [...] in [...] "elegiac tones" [...] as the aria's expression. Musicologist Julian Mincham notes [...] "that instant when body and soul come to rest and are resigned and in complete harmony. Bach encapsulates this experience of peace and acquiescent submission beyond anything that mere words can convey." [...] He sees the [...] "flowing oboe arabesques", which the singer imitates twice on the word [...] (joy) as a [...] "clear indication that their expressive function is to proclaim the Christian's personal bliss, an inextricable element of this important experience of life".|$|E
