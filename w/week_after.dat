40|$|Recently, {{a radical}} {{operation}} on jaundiced patients is performed after biliary decompression by PTCD. In this study, {{the mechanism of}} liver cell recovery after biliary decompression was studied hisologically and electron microscopically. Thirty adult dogs were used. After laporatomy, the common bile duct was doubly ligated and severed. The obstruction was released by cholecystoduodenostomy, 2 (Group 1), 3 (Group 2), 4 (Group 3) and 5 and 6 <b>weeks</b> (Group 4) <b>after</b> the operation. A liver biopsy was obtained at the second operation. Four <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the second operation, all dogs were sacrified. Liver specimens were taken and examined histologically and electron microscopically. Two <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ligation, a marked decrease in glycogen particles, moderate dilatation of bile canaliculi, swelling of Kupffer cells, edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the interlobular connective tissue, increase in smooth endoplasmic reticulum and enlargement of the Golgi zone were seen in Group 1. Four <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> release of the obstruction, glycogen particles increased greatly, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum decreased. Generally, the liver cells and bile canaliculi returned to almost thier normal structure. Three <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ligation, similar changes occurred in Group 2 as in Group 1, although the changes were more advanced. Four <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> release of the obstruction, the liver cells returnd to almost thier normal appearance. Four <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ligation, the bile canaliculi markedly dilated and microvilli disappeared in Group 3. The increase in smooth endoplasmic reticulum, enlargement of Golgi apparatus, decrease in glycogen particles and appearance of myeloid bodies were prominent. Four <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> release of the obstruction, these changes were still observed, and the liver cells remained in the recovery process. Five or 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ligation, similar changes in Group 4 as seen in Group 3 occurred, but the changes were more advanced. Four <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> release of the obstruction, the liver cells had not recovered well.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the temporal modifications in bone mass, bone biomechanical properties and bone morphology in spinal cord injured rats 2, 4 and 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> a transection. Material and methods: Control animals were randomly distributed into four groups (n = 10 each group) : control group (CG) - control animals sacrificed immediately after surgery; spinal cord-injured 2 weeks (2 W) - spinal cord-injured animals sacrificed 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery; spinal cord-injured 4 weeks (4 W) - spinal cord-injured animals sacrificed 4 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery; spinal cord-injured 6 weeks (6 W) - spinal cord-injured animals sacrificed 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery. Results: Biomechanical properties of the right tibia were determined by a threepoint bending test and injured animals showed a statistically significant decrease in maximal load compared to control animals. The right femur was used for densitometric analysis and bone mineral content of the animals sacrificed 4 and 6 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery was significantly higher compared to the control animals and animals sacrificed 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> surgery. Histopathological and morphological analysis of tibiae revealed intense resorptive areas in the group 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> injury only. Conclusions: The results of this study show that this rat model is a valuable tool to investigate bone remodeling processes specifically associated with SCI. Taken together, our results suggest that spinal cord injury induced bone loss within 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> injury in rats. CNPqCNPqFAPESPFAPES...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPulmonary {{vascular}} resistance decreases dramatically after pulmonary thromboendarterectomy {{and further}} improves in time. This {{may reflect the}} slow regression of postobstructive pulmonary vasculopathy. We hypothesized that postobstructive pulmonary vasculopathy may regress after reperfusion in a piglet model of chronic (5 weeks) left pulmonary artery obstruction. MethodsThe ligated left pulmonary artery was reimplanted into the pulmonary arterial trunk. Pulmonary artery blood flow and pressure were measured 2 days and 5 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> reperfusion. Pulmonary artery smooth muscle thickness, endothelium-dependent relaxation, and left lung endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and expression were assessed 5 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ligation (n = 10) and 5 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> reperfusion (n = 10), and compared with a sham group (n = 10). Patency of the anastomoses and systemic blood supply to the lung were assessed by pulmonary angiography and nonselective thoracic aortography, respectively. ResultsAngiography showed that pulmonary artery anastomoses were patent in all animals. Five <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> reperfusion, left pulmonary blood flows {{were similar to those}} in the sham animals, and systemic blood supply to the left lung decreased. Left pulmonary vascular resistance decreased by 50 % at 5 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> reperfusion compared with 2 days after reperfusion (P =. 0009). Medial muscle thickness of the left pulmonary artery greater than 600 μm increased 5 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ligation and regressed to sham values 5 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> reperfusion (P =. 001). Endothelium-dependent relaxation was only partially restored 5 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> reperfusion, whereas left lung endothelial nitric oxide synthase expressions and activities returned to sham values. ConclusionsThis study shows that postobstructive pulmonary vasculopathy induced by ligation of the pulmonary artery for 5 <b>weeks</b> regresses <b>after</b> reperfusion, accounting for the progressive improvement in hemodynamics after thromboendarterectomy...|$|R

40|$|In the {{previous}} study, we demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have neuroprotective effects against ischemic {{damage in the}} ventral horn of L 5 - 6 levels at 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion. In the present study, we expanded our observations for 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ischemia/reperfusion {{to rule out the}} possibility of delayed neuronal death in several days after ischemia/reperfusion. Transient spinal cord ischemia was induced by a 15 [*]min aortic artery occlusion in the subrenal region and rabbit ASCs were administered intrathecally into recipient rabbits (2 × 105) immediately after reperfusion. Transplantation of ASCs improved the neurological motor functions of the hindlimb 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ischemia/reperfusion. Similarly, the cresyl violet-positive neurons were significantly increased at 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ischemia/reperfusion compared to that in the vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) -treated group. The transplantation of ASCs significantly reduced reactive microglia induced by ischemia at 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ischemia/reperfusion. In addition, transplantation of ASCs maintained the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ischemia/reperfusion. These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of ASCs are maintained 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> ischemia/reperfusion by modulating microgliosis and BDNF levels in the spinal cord...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes on antioxidant-like protein- 1 immunoreactivity, protein carbonyl levels, and malondialdehyde formation, a marker for lipid peroxidation, in the hippocampus. For this study, streptozotocin (75 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into adult rats to induce type 1 diabetes. The three experimental parameters were determined at 2, 3, 4 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> streptozotocin treatment. Fasting blood glucose levels significantly increased by 20. 7 - 21. 9 mM after streptozotocin treatment. The number of antioxidant-like protein- 1 immunoreactive neurons significantly decreased in the hippocampal CA 1 region, but not the dentate gyrus, 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> streptozotocin treatment compared to the control group. Malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels, which are modified by oxidative stress, significantly increased with a peak at 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> malondialdehyde treatment, and then decreased 4 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> malondialdehyde treatment.

40|$|Interstitial {{mononuclear}} cell infiltration in rats {{during the development}} of autoimmune Heymann nephritis (HN) was studied using the fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) technique. The results were compared with those obtained by immunohistochemical studies of infiltrating T helper (T-h) and T suppressor/cytotoxic (T-s) cells, and with traditional histopathological and immunofluorescence examinations. Three <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> initial immunization with isolated tubular brush border antigen, when the histopathological finding was quite normal, FNAB revealed increased numbers of interstitial blast cells, large granular lymphocytes and activated lymphocytes. These increases reached significant levels 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> a booster injection and were still prominent in a few rats with manifest membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) and proteinuria 14 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> initial immunization. Immunohistochemical staining 3 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> immunization showed {{a significant increase in}} T-h cells in peritubular regions. Infiltration decreased successively 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the booster and during manifest MGN. On the other hand, the mean number of cortically infiltrating T-s cells successively increased {{during the course of the}} study and this increase had reached a statistically significant level 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the booster. Prominent T-s infiltration appeared in a few rats 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the booster and when MGN was histopathologically manifest, and it was then associated with histopathologically detectable interstitial mononuclear infiltration and also with blast cell infiltration in FNAB. Our results suggest linkage between tubulointerstitial lesions in HN and cell-mediated immunoreactivity, and that severe interstitial inflammation is associated with T-s cell infiltration. Cytological interpretation indicated that infiltrating blast cells were plasmablasts, which may imply local antibody production, especially since anti-brush border antibody titres and blast cell infiltration simultaneously reached maximum levels 2 <b>weeks</b> <b>after</b> the booster...|$|R
