5|$|It {{became clear}} that Auschwitz was not a normal {{internment}} camp with above-average SS rations, but that it served an additional function.

It replaced an earlier place of worship on Cheetham Hill Road, and an earlier chapel on Wellington Street. It is the oldest purpose-built Orthodox church in the country.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{religious}} and political offices in Jerusalem were usually held by Europeans <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> on pilgrimage or crusade. William {{was one of the}} few natives with a European education, and he quickly rose through the ranks. After his return to the Holy Land in 1165, he became canon of the cathedral at Acre. In 1167 he was appointed archdeacon of the cathedral of Tyre by Frederick de la Roche, archbishop of Tyre, with the support of King Amalric.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{had begun}} {{as early as}} 1911 to procure arms and smuggle them into India. When {{a clear idea of}} the {{conspiracy}} emerged, more earnest and elaborate plans were made to obtain arms and to enlist international support. Herambalal Gupta, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> in the United States in 1914 at the Berlin Committee's directives, took over the leadership of American wing of the conspiracy after the failure of the SS Korea mission. Gupta immediately began efforts to obtain men and arms. While men were in plentiful supply with more and more Indians coming forward to join the Ghadarite cause, obtaining arms for the uprising proved to be more difficult.|$|E

5|$|Government {{officials}} {{stood on}} trucks, using loudspeakers {{to call out}} above the noise, urging the Buddhists — primarily high school and university students <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> on bicycles — to disperse. The announcements were met by jeers when the government spokesperson blamed the unrest on the Vietcong. At 18:30, the military personnel at the scene dispersed the crowd by emptying vials of brownish-red liquid on the heads of praying protestors, resulting in 67 Buddhists being hospitalized for chemical injuries. The symptoms consisted of severe blistering of the skin and respiratory ailments. The crowd responded angrily to the apparent use of poison gas, and the incident became a public relations disaster for Diệm.|$|E
5|$|His reign {{was marked}} by {{multiple}} wars with the Lombards, a Germanic people <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> in the former Roman province of Pannonia {{under the leadership of}} their king, Audoin. Thurisind also had to face the hostility of the Byzantine Empire, which was resentful of the Gepid takeover of Sirmium and anxious to diminish Gepid power in the Pannonian Basin, a plain covering most of modern Hungary and partly including the bordering states. The Byzantines' plans to reduce the Gepids' power took effect when Audoin decisively defeated Thurisind in 551 or 552. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian forced a peace accord on both leaders so that equilibrium in the Pannonian Basin could be sustained.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and {{a friend}} from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away their {{belongings}} and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of other Americans <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> since his previous visit. Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites.

5|$|When Guggenheim {{closed her}} gallery in 1947 {{to move to}} Venice, artists like Pollock had to find new representation. The Betty Parsons Gallery, which opened the {{previous}} year, began representing Pollock, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. Parsons was already representing Adolph Gottlieb, Hedda Sterne and Theodoros Stamos. It was while Pollock showed at Parsons' gallery that he started making his iconic drip-paintings in 1947. It was also here that Barnett Newman exhibited his first breakthrough works in 1950. Rothko, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> at his distinctive mural sized paintings in 1947, first exhibited them at the Parsons Gallery.|$|E
5|$|Becket excommunicated both de Brocs {{again on}} Christmas Day, 1170. On 28 December 1170, de Broc {{received}} at Saltwood Castle four knights– William de Tracy, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, and Richard le Breton– <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> from the continent. The five men conceived {{a plan to}} surround Canterbury Cathedral and force Becket to rescind his excommunications. On 29 December 1170, the five men arrived at Canterbury, where it appears that de Broc {{was in charge of}} the soldiers surrounding the cathedral while the other four went inside to negotiate with the archbishop. The four did not succeed in persuading the archbishop and the situation degenerated into the four men murdering Becket at one of the altars of the cathedral. After this, the four rejoined de Broc and searched the archiepiscopal residence for papers and other documents that de Broc was to send to the king. The party then returned to Saltwood.|$|E
5|$|Early on 10 June {{another group}} of thirty-one men arrived at the 9th Parachute Battalion position. These and other stragglers, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> through the night, brought the {{battalion}} strength to around 270 men. At 11:00 the Germans attacked 'A' Company again, {{but this time the}} attack was ill-coordinated and was easily repelled. Shortly afterwards the battalion killed around fifty Germans, who had started digging defences {{in full view of the}} British position. Then 'A' Company ambushed a German patrol, causing several casualties. That afternoon a strong force of Germans occupied the Château and used it as a base to start an infantry and self propelled gun assault on the British battalion. With no mortar ammunition left, the British had to use their PIATs and machine-guns to stop the attack.|$|E

5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote in his diary that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people.

The closure was without warning; visitors <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> for scheduled events found a paper notice at the entrance that the center was temporarily closed. The next days' events involving chef Andrew Carmellini and singer Joni Morris were also abruptly cancelled; the museum later stated that it would reopen on December 1. On that day, the organization (with $80 million ($ today) in debt) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The federal bankruptcy court blocked a $2 million ($ today) emergency loan with priority in security, leaving Copia with no funds to resume operations.|$|E

Upon arriving in Kingston on the 25th, Köhler learned of the rising political tensions in Europe during the July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. By this time, the ship {{was in need of}} a refit in Germany, and met with her replacement, Karlsruhe, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the following day. Lüdecke, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>arrived</b> in command of Karlsruhe, traded places with Köhler aboard Dresden. The Admiralstab initially ordered Dresden to return to Germany for overhaul, but the heightened threat of war by the 31st led the staff to countermand the order, instead instructing Lüdecke to prepare to conduct Handelskrieg (trade war) in the Atlantic.|$|E
