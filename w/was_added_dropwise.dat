In the first approach, 1  mg of lyophilized protein was mixed with 1  ml of TPP solution (0.1 % (w/v)), and the mixture <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>dropwise</b> to 1  ml of CS solution (0.2 % (w/v)) with stirring using a magnetic stirrer. In the second method, 1  mg of lyophilized protein was mixed with 1  ml of CS solution (0.2 % (w/v)), and TPP (0.1 % (w/v)) <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>dropwise</b> to the protein/CS mixture with stirring. After 10  min of stirring, each opalescent solution was centrifuged (25, 000 [*]×[*]g, 25 °C for 30  min), and the amounts of the free protein in each supernatant were measured in order to analyze the entrapment efficiency.|$|E
30|$|Chitosan was {{dissolved}} in 1 % acetic acid solution {{to form a}} concentration of 10  mg/mL of solution, which was diluted with water to various concentrations: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0  mg/mL. Subsequently, the TPP prepared at 0.25 % w/v, <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>dropwise</b> to the chitosan solution and stirred consistently.|$|E
30|$|For {{synthesis}} of BPPPO, PPPO (5  g) and CHCl 3 (50  cc) <b>are</b> <b>added</b> to a 100  cc flask. The mixture is stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The 20  cc of bromine solution included Br 2 (10  cc) and CHCl 3 (10  cc), <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>dropwise</b> to the mixture during 30  min under Argon atmosphere. After 1  h stirring {{at room temperature}}, 800  cc ethanol <b>is</b> <b>added</b> under mechanical stirring and the BPPPO is precipitated out. The produced polymer is filtered and dried at room temperature under vacuum. The extent of bromination is 80 – 95 % from NMR spectrum. The density of BPPPO is[*]∼[*] 1.43  g cm− 3 measured by the excluded volume method at room temperature with Mn[*]∼[*] 180, 000.|$|R
50|$|Although {{available}} commercially, diethyl azodicarboxylate {{is often}} prepared fresh in the laboratory, especially if required in pure, non-diluted form. A two-step synthesis starts from hydrazine, first by alkylation with ethyl chloroformate, followed by treating the resulting diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate with chlorine (bubbling through the solution), hypochlorous acid, concentrated nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid. The reaction {{is carried out}} in an ice bath, and the reagents <b>are</b> <b>added</b> <b>dropwise</b> so that the temperature does not rise above 20 °C. Diethyl hydrazodicarboxylate is a solid with melting temperature of 131-133 °C which is collected as a residue; it is significantly more stable to heating than DEAD and is conventionally dried at a temperature of about 80 °C.|$|R
30|$|A {{solution}} of (Zn (NO 3) 2 · 6 H 2 O (0.1  M) is prepared in 100  ml of deionised water and refluxed at about 70  °C for 5  min under magnetic stirring {{to get a}} homogeneous solution. 30  mL of aqueous extract <b>is</b> <b>added</b> <b>dropwise</b> to it. The mixture is refluxed at 70  °C under continuous stirring for 2  h. The reacted solution is allowed to dry in the hot air oven to yield pale white precipitates. Precipitates are washed with methanol and water {{to get rid of}} any unreacted materials and dried in air. Finally, it is annealed at 400  °C for 1  h in the furnace and used for further characterization.|$|R
