The pre-bulging hydromechanical deep drawing process was introduced on <b>wrinkles</b> <b>controlling</b> of a complicated curved surface part, effects of pre-bulging pressure and chamber pressure on behavior of wrinkles were investigated both by experiments and numerical simulations, the mechanism of pre-bulging process on <b>wrinkles</b> <b>controlling</b> was discussed by plastic stress and strain analysis. The study shows that the pre-bulging hydromechanical deep drawing process {{can be used to}} eliminate wrinkle by reducing the tangential compressive stress on unsupported region and increasing the area of sheet adhered to the punch surface. Furthermore, higher pre-bulging pressure can increase tangential plastic strain of unsupported region and have the biaxial tension effect, which result higher ability of avoiding wrinkles of the blank on unsupported region...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} wrinkle {{behavior in}} both flat and cylindrical membranes undergoing shear displacement. The {{goal is to}} establish a relationship between the wrinkle behavior in the two types of membranes and understand how different geometric properties affect the behavior. The analysis is an equilibrium path-tracking analysis using the finite-element method. By applying cyclic boundary conditions to a flat membrane, a degree of similarity in the wrinkle behavior can be established between flat and cylindrical membranes. In both membranes, the initial wrinkles cover the entire membrane. These wrinkles are followed by smaller, localized wrinkles, referred to as collapsed sections. These collapsed sections form on existing wrinkles. The generation of new wrinkles, by splitting the existing <b>wrinkles,</b> is <b>controlled</b> by collapsed sections and is the same in both types of membranes. For the cylindrical membrane, the curved shape results in a more <b>controlled</b> <b>wrinkle</b> behavior. This is represented by fewer bifurcation points that require larger values of shear to occur. Second, the collapsed section frequency and position are fixed with respect to the wrinkle frequency and position. The cause of simplified and <b>controlled</b> <b>wrinkle</b> behavior is analyzed, and the control mechanism is explained...|$|R

40|$|Graphyne, a novel carbon allotrope, is a {{two-dimensional}} lattice of sp 2 +sp 1 hybridization-type carbon atoms, similar to graphene. The initiation {{and development of}} wrinkles in single-layer graphynes (α-, β-, γ-, and 6, 6, 12 -graphyne) subjected to in-plane circular shearing are investigated. In comparison with graphene, wrinkle pattern and profile characterization in relation to wave number, wavelength and amplitude of graphynes are extensively explored using classic molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations. Unlike graphene, the wave numbers of graphynes increase with increasing rotational angles; the wavelengths reduce correspondingly. The amplitudes show an increasing trend, with some local drops when the rotational angles increase. The drops occur as {{the positions of the}} wave numbers increase. Graphynes have superior fracture properties to graphene, despite the densities of graphynes being far lower. The fracture rotational angles depend on the percentages of acetylenic linkages in the graphyne structures: the more acetylenic linkages, the larger the fracture rotational angles. Meanwhile, acetylenic linkages also affect the bond length strains of the graphynes during the wrinkling process. The influences of the temperature on the fracture rotational angles are also examined to obtain further insights into the mechanical properties of such kinds of carbon allotropes. The achieved results can be used as guidelines for the <b>wrinkling</b> <b>control</b> and potential applications of graphynes. ...|$|R

In this paper, we present an approach to generate static and dynamic wrinkles on human skin. For the static model, we consider micro and macro structures of the skin surface geometry. For the wrinkle dynamics, an approach using a biomechanical skin model is employed. The tile texture patterns in the micro structure of skin surface are created using planar Delaunay triangulation. Functions of barycentric coordinates are applied to simulate the curved ridges. The visible (macro) flexure lines which may form wrinkles are predefined edges on the micro structure. These lines act as constraints for the hierarchical triangulation process.

40|$|A stiff skin {{forms on}} surface areas {{of a flat}} {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) upon exposure to focused ion beam (FIB) leading to ordered surface <b>wrinkles.</b> By <b>controlling</b> the FIB fluence and area of exposure of the PDMS, one can create a variety of patterns in the wavelengths in the micrometer to submicrometer range, from simple one-dimensional wrinkles to peculiar and complex hierarchical nested wrinkles. Examination of the chemical composition of the exposed PDMS reveals that the stiff skin resembles amorphous silica. Moreover, upon formation, the stiff skin tends to expand in the direction perpendicular to the direction of ion beam irradiation. The consequent mismatch strain between the stiff skin and the PDMS substrate buckles the skin, forming the wrinkle patterns. The induced strains in the stiff skin are estimated by measuring the surface length in the buckled state. Estimates of the thickness and stiffness of the stiffened surface layer are estimated by using the theory for buckled films on compliant substrates. The method provides an effective and inexpensive technique to create wrinkled hard skin patterns on surfaces of polymers for various applications...|$|R

40|$|In deep drawing, a low {{blank holder}} force (BHF) can cause wrinkling, while a high BHF {{can lead to}} tearing. In this study, a {{variable}} blank holder force (VBHF) approach to deep drawing is employed, and a simple closed-loop type algorithm is developed for the VBHF trajectory. The proposed algorithm {{is divided into two}} phases. The objective of the first phase is to check wrinkling and tearing. In this phase, a low BHF is used as the initial BHF, which is then increased to prevent <b>wrinkling</b> while <b>controlling</b> tearing. This phase of the algorithm is terminated when tearing occurs. In numerical simulation, the distance between the die and the blank holder is used to measure wrinkling, and the minimum thickness of the blank is used to determine the tearing. In {{the second phase of the}} algorithm, the deviations in thickness of the part are iteratively examined, without neglecting the occurrence of wrinkling. One of the advantages of using VBHF instead of constant BHF is that it reduces the forming energy. The validity of the proposed algorithm is examined comparing numerical simulation and experimental results. Finally, the proposed algorithm is also applied to obtain the segmented VBHF trajectory. © 2010 Satoshi Kitayama et al...|$|R

In this process, a small wrinkle occurs near the die corner in the former stage, and then the wrinkle is eliminated in the latter stage because the flat bulge appears in the former stage due to the oscillation of internal pressure.

The filling of the die corner for the mean linear pressure was not sufficient due to large wrinkles appearing in the former stage, whereas bursting occurs for the peak linear pressure due to round bulging.

40|$|Tunable surface {{morphology}} in III-V semiconductor nanomembranes provides opportunities to modulate electronic structures and light interactions of semiconductors. Here, we introduce a vacuum-induced wrinkling method {{for the formation}} of ordered wrinkles in InGaAs nanomembranes (thickness, 42 nm) on PDMS microwell arrays as a strategy for deterministic and multidirectional wrinkle engineering of semiconductor nanomembranes. In this approach, a vacuum-induced pressure difference between the outer and inner sides of the microwell patterns covered with nanomembranes leads to bulging of the nanomembranes at the predefined microwells, which, in turn, results in stretch-induced wrinkle formation of the nanomembranes between the microwells. The direction and geometry of the nanomembrane <b>wrinkles</b> are well <b>controlled</b> by varying the PDMS modulus, depth, and shape of microwells, and the temperature during the transfer printing of nanomembrane onto heterogeneous substrates.

40|$|Heliogyros with blade length-to-width aspect {{ratios of}} 1000 can achieve ambitious science mission goals, but such designs {{have not been}} {{analyzed}} with rigor. Archived heliogyro analyses indicate that aspect ratios of 1000 are feasible, but the calculations supporting this claim {{are based on the}} simplifying assumptions of decoupled twist, vertical deflection, and in-plane deflection of the blades. In making such simplifications, the equations become more tractable, but crucial behavioral characteristics are possibly lost. Without a more rigorous analytical investigation, the reliability and robustness of the heliogyro remains in doubt. However, with verified control models and an appropriate operations strategy, performance of aggressive heliogyro designs can be presumed. This thesis asserts that heliogyro blades with aspect ratios of 1000 : 1 can sufficiently operate in space. The crux of this investigation is a high-fidelity model that accurately represents a heliogyro blade. Pitch controls command the thrust vector of the large sail structure. Although the validation model mimics a real solar sail, the controller is driven toward the most simplified configuration.

50|$|Raising {{the junk}} sail {{is done by}} easing the sheets until the furled sail is blown down wind. This will take the {{pressure}} off the sail and ease the raising. Then {{it is important to}} watch the lines that will run in while the sail is raised, including the gaff hauling parrel, luff hauling parrel, the downhauls if equipped, and the sheets. Hauling the sail with a 3:1 or 4:1 purchase will ease the burden, but the length of halyard will consequently be very long. The fully battened sail will remain calm in the lee of the mast during the hauling. Due to the weight of a huge canvas sail and its many spars, some junk sailors find a winch is needed for the last few feet. There is probably already a standing tack line in place, so the halyard is hauled until the tack line is taut, although {{there is no need to}} tighten up the leech severely to avoid scallops as in trimming the triangular sails. After hauling and securing the halyard, the fore and aft position of the leech is set by hauling the yard hauling parrel until the halyard is close to the mast. A short pull on the luff hauling parrel may be needed to extend the middle battens toward the leech to <b>control</b> <b>wrinkles</b> in the sail.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{understanding}} the buckling deformation mechanisms of bending, wrinkling, and folding that {{occur on the}} surfaces and interfaces of polymer systems. We gained fundamental insight into the formation mechanism of these buckled structures for thin glassy films placed on an elastomeric substrate. By taking advantage of geometric confinement, we demonstrated new strategies in <b>controlling</b> <b>wrinkling</b> morphologies. We were able to achieve surfaces with controlled patterned structures which will have a broad impact in optical, adhesive, microelectronics, and microfluidics applications. Wrinkles and strain localized features, such as delaminations and folds, are observed in many natural systems and are useful {{for a wide range}} of patterning applications. However, the transition from sinusoidal wrinkles to more complex strain localized structures is not well understood. We investigated the onset of wrinkling and strain localizations under uniaxial strain. We show that careful measurement of feature amplitude allowed not only the determination of wrinkle, fold, or delamination onset, but also allowed clear distinction between each feature. The folds observed in this experiment have an outward morphology from the surface in contrast to folds that form into the plane, as observed in a film floating on a liquid substrate. A critical strain map was constructed, where the critical strain was measured experimentally for wrinkling, folding, and delamination with varying film thickness and modulus. Wrinkle morphologies, i. e. amplitude and wavelength of wrinkles, affect properties such as electron transport in stretchable electronics and adhesion properties of smart surfaces. To gain an understanding of how the wrinkle morphology can be controlled, we introduced a geometrical confinement in the form of rigid boundaries. Upon straining, we found that wrinkles started near the rigid boundaries where maximum local strain occurred and propagated towards the middle as more global strain was applied. In contrast to homogeneous wrinkling with constant amplitude that is observed for an unconfined system, the wrinkling observed here had varying amplitude as a function of distance from the rigid boundaries. We demonstrated that the number of wrinkles can be tuned by controlling the distance between the rigid boundaries. Location of <b>wrinkles</b> was also <b>controlled</b> by introducing local stress distributions via patterning the elastomeric substrate. Two distinct wrinkled regions were achieved on a surface where the film is free-standing over a circular hole pattern and where the film is supported by the substrate. The hoe diameter and applied strain affected the wavelength and amplitude of the free-standing membrane. Using discontinuous dewetting, a one-step fabrication method was developed to selectively deposit a small volume of liquid in patterned microwells and encapsulate it with a polymeric film. The pull-out velocity, a velocity at which the sample is removed from a bath of liquid, was controlled to observe how encapsulation process is affected. The polymeric film was observed to wrinkle at low pull-out velocity due to no encapsulation of liquid; whereas the film bent at medium pull-out velocity due to capillary effect as the liquid evaporated through the film. To quantify the amount of liquid encapsulated, we mixed salt in water and measured the size of the deposited salt crystals. The salt crystal size, and hence the amount of liquid encapsulated, was controlled by varying either the encapsulation velocity or the size of the patterned microwells. In addition, we showed that the deposited salt crystals are protected by the laminated film until the film is removed, providing advantageous control for delivery and release. Yeast cells were also captured in the microwells to show the versatility. This encapsulation method is useful for wide range of applications, such as trapping single cells for biological studies, growing microcrystals for optical and magnetic applications, and single-use sensor technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|Graphene is {{the strongest}} {{material}} ever discovered and has an extremely high Young's modulus (~ 1 GPa). Although stretching the sp 2 covalent bonds between carbon atoms is very difficult, significant deflections do develop in graphene membranes. In fact, thermal rippling naturally emerges in graphene at any finite temperature. Moreover, the topological defects mediating plastic deformation often cause out-of-plane crumpling, {{an effective way to}} reduce the total elastic energy of the topological defect. It is even possible to design specific stress states to produce periodic wrinkles in graphene with adjustable wave lengths. This work aims to understand how buckling influences the elastic and plastic behavior of graphene-based nanostructures. While the elastic moduli may be straightforwardly computed using structure optimization techniques with applied test stresses, it is a nontrivial task to obtain elastic properties at any specific temperature. Further, linear elastic theories are not able to describe large buckling because the second order nonlinear terms in the definition of the Lagrangian finite strain tensor cannot be neglected. In addition, the existence of topological defects and constraints need to be properly treated. Finally, buckling and defects of a curved surface such as a nanotube is even more complicated and poses other intriguing challenges. To proceed, we employ Monte Carlo techniques to obtain fundamental elastic properties of graphene at desired temperatures, which supplies useful inputs for a nonlinear continuum model for graphene. This model not only takes into account, in a suitable manner, both large out-of-plane buckling and interactions among edge dislocations with periodic boundary conditions, but also serves as a handy tool for simulating nanoindentation experiments and the <b>controlled</b> <b>wrinkling</b> of graphene. At last, we focus on the Stone-Wales defect mediated plasticity of CNTs. Specifically, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework is designed to model the defect dynamics over a long time scale. We find that in large nanotubes, a chain of closely packed dislocations (called a "dislocation worm") may have less buckling and lower formation energy than the conventional dislocation glide under high tensile stresses...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} soft {{material}} deformation and adhesion has broad applicability to industries ranging from automobile tires to medical prosthetics and implants. When a mechanical load is imposed on a soft material system, {{a variety of}} issues can arise, including non-linear deformations at interfaces between soft and rigid components. The work presented in this dissertation embraces the occurrence of these non-linear deformations, leading to the design of functional systems that incorporate a soft elastomer layer with application to bio-inspired adhesives and wrinkled surface fabrication. Understanding the deformation of a soft elastomer layer and how the system loading and geometry influence non-linear mechanical transitions, including interfacial failure and surface buckling, are crucial for predicting the performance of the mechanical system. This dissertation focuses on three soft composite systems of particular interest: (1) a multi-component, multiple adhesive contact surface device that allows for control of reversible adhesive force with geometric arrangement, (2) a confined isolated shear contact and an elastomeric coating, where the deformation and adhesion scale with the degree of confinement, and (3) a thin film lamination technique involving a soft substrate, where surface wrinkles are created and tuned in a continuous manner by controlling interfacial strains via applied contact load and substrate curvature. We first study the deformation and adhesion of a multi-component fabric-elastomer system with multiple adhesive contacts, or 2 ̆ 2 digits 2 ̆ 2. We conduct lap adhesion experiments in a model three digit system, finding that increasing angular spacing between adhesive digits increases system compliance and attenuates adhesive force capacity. To describe these findings we develop several relationships between system loading, materials properties, and geometry. We develop an equation which describes the relationship of system compliance with individual digit compliance and angular spacing between adhesive digits that agrees well with experimental data. Additionally, we derive equations for adhesive force capacity in a multiple adhesive contact system that agree well with experimental data. These explicit equations not only relate angular spacing with force capacity, but include critical strain energy release rate, digit compliance, and contact area. The equations derived and verified in this study will lead to more complex adhesive device design, as well as provide a foundation for studying the biomechanics of animals that use adhesion for locomotion. Next, we examine the deformation and adhesion of a rigid punch contacting and shearing a thin elastic coating. Using experiment we find that increasing confinement leads to a decrease in compliance and an increase in adhesive force capacity. We develop an explicit, semi-empirical equation with the help of finite element analysis to describe the influence of confinement ratio on shear compliance. This derived equation agrees with our experimental data, {{with the exception of a}} few data points that deviate due to a pronounced normal force component. Additionally, we derive an equation for adhesive force capacity as a function of confinement, elastic coating modulus, and critical strain energy release rate. We find experimentally that an increase in adhesive force capacity was largely dictated by an increase in confinement, with some additional contributions attributed to dissipative processes confined to the adhesive crack tip. These equations will serve as a guide for decoupling the contributions of geometry and materials parameters to adhesive force in systems involving a thin elastic layer. Lastly, we develop a fabrication technique that transforms the existing manufacturing process of film lamination to create tunable wrinkled surfaces in a thin film/soft elastomer composite. We conduct experiments to find that the process parameters of applied contact load and roller curvature can be used to <b>control</b> <b>wrinkle</b> aspect ratio. Our experimental results convey that increasing applied contact load and decreasing roller radius lead to an increase in wrinkle amplitude. Using both experimental results and finite element analysis, we develop a relation between wrinkle aspect ratio and the process parameters of applied contact load and roller curvature. This explicit equation allows us to predict the change in wrinkle amplitude for a given materials system as process parameters are tuned using our modified film lamination technique. Wrinkled surface technology has been envisioned in many applications ranging from optoelectronics to enhanced adhesives. The technique presented here to tune wrinkle size in a continuous process can lead to the large scale manufacturing of these previously proposed wrinkling technologies...|$|R
