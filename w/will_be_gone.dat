25|$|Peru {{contains}} over {{two-thirds of}} all tropical glaciers which provide important water sources for the dry western half of the country. These glaciers are rapidly melting {{as a result of}} climate change, making the flow of rivers more irregular, leading to more droughts and floods. A report by a team from the World Bank published in June 2007 in the bulletin of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) predicts that many of the lower glaciers in the Andes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> in the next decade or so, and that glacial runoff may dry up altogether within 20 years. The last comprehensive satellite survey by Peru's National Environmental Council, carried out in 1997, found that the area covered by glaciers had shrunk by 22% since the early 1960s. Partial surveys by geologists suggest that {{the rate at which the}} glaciers are melting has sped up over the past decade.|$|E

Ian, Jane and Lucy try to stop him, a {{struggle}} ensues, and Jane is accidentally shot in the stomach; as a result, she is unable to have children. Ian admits Steven to a psychiatric hospital. When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going {{as far as to}} break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries {{to commit suicide}} by dousing himself in petrol; however, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is waiting for him to mess up so he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> from her life for good.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, the U.S. Geological Survey began a more {{systematic}} {{study of the}} remaining glaciers, which has continued to the present day. By 2010, 37 glaciers remained, but only 25 of these {{were considered to be}} [...] "active glaciers" [...] of at least [...] in area. The National Park Service warns that if the current warming trend continues, the park's remaining glaciers <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> by 2030. This glacier retreat follows a worldwide pattern that has accelerated even more since 1980. Without a major climatic change in which cooler and moister weather returns and persists, the mass balance, which is the accumulation rate versus the ablation (melting) rate of glaciers, will continue to be negative and the glaciers have been projected to eventually disappear, leaving behind only barren rock.|$|E

500|$|On the {{sheltered}} {{slopes of}} the highest peaks of Glacier National Park in Montana, the eponymous glaciers are diminishing rapidly. The area of each glacier has been mapped for decades by the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey. Comparing photographs from the mid-19th century with contemporary images provides ample evidence that they have retreated notably since 1850. Repeat photography since clearly show that glaciers such as Grinnell Glacier are all retreating. The larger glaciers are now approximately {{a third of their}} former size when first studied in 1850, and numerous smaller glaciers have disappeared completely. Only 27% of the [...] area of Glacier National Park covered by glaciers in 1850 remained covered by 1993. Researchers believe that by the year 2030, the vast majority of glacial ice in Glacier National Park <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> unless current climate patterns reverse their course. Grinnell Glacier {{is just one of many}} glaciers in Glacier National Park that have been well documented by photographs for many decades. The photographs below clearly demonstrate the retreat of this glacier since 1938.|$|E

This was the 19th {{consecutive}} game since Opening Day in which Sandoval had a hit, setting a Giants franchise record for longest consecutive hitting streak to begin a season. The previous record – of 18 games – was set by Johnny Rucker in 1945. Sandoval ran it up to 20 before it was snapped. However, in May, Sandoval fractured his left hamate bone, an injury which kept him out until early June. Giants' head athletic trainer Dave Groeschner said the day before Sandoval had surgery, [...] "I guess the good news is both [...] <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> tomorrow and he can't do it again." [...] On July 1, 2012, it was announced that Sandoval had beaten out David Wright for his second All-Star team, as the starting third baseman for the National League. The choice was considered somewhat controversial by fans and executives (particularly Sandy Alderson), as David Wright had a significantly higher batting average than Sandoval at the time. Wright made the team as a reserve, and as a reporter pointed out, Sandoval in 2009 [...] "outperformed Wright, who was the fans' choice to start." [...] On July 10, at Kansas City's Kauffman Stadium, Sandoval highlighted the NL's five-run opening inning with the first bases-loaded triple {{in the history of the}} Midsummer Classic, off of reigning American League (AL) Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander.|$|E

500|$|A large {{region of}} {{population}} surrounding {{the central and}} southern Andes of Argentina and Chile reside in arid areas that are dependent on water supplies from melting glaciers. The water from the glaciers also supplies rivers that have in some cases been dammed for hydroelectric power.

This represents a loss of 8% of the ice field, with all glaciers experiencing significant retreat. The Southern Patagonian Ice Field has exhibited a general trend of retreat on 42 glaciers, while four glaciers were in equilibrium and two advanced during the years between 1944 and 1986.

2500|$|Denmark has a {{universal}} health care system, characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, {{for most of the}} services, run directly by the regional authorities. One of the sources of income is a national health care contribution (...) (2007–11:8%; '12:7%; '13:6%; '14:5%; '15:4%; '16:3%; '17:2%; '18:1%; '19:0%) but it is being phased out and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>gone</b> from January 2019, with the income taxes in the lower brackets being raised gradually each year instead. Another source comes from the municipalities that had their income taxes raised by 3 percentage points from 1 January 2007, a contribution confiscated from the former county tax to be used from 1 January 2007 for health purposes by the municipalities instead. This means that most health care provision is free at the point of delivery for all residents. Additionally, roughly two in five have complementary private insurance to cover services not fully covered by the state, such as physiotherapy. , Denmark spends 11.2% of its GDP on health care; this is up from 9.8% in 2007 (US$3,512 per capita). This places Denmark above the OECD average and above the other Nordic countries.|$|E
