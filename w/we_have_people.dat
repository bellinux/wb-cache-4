At his {{memorial}} service, Victor Hugo pronounced [...] "Today <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> in black {{because of the}} death of the man of talent; a nation in mourning for a man of genius". The funeral was attended by [...] "almost every writer in Paris", including Frédérick Lemaître, Gustave Courbet, Dumas père and Dumas fils, as well as representatives of the Légion d'honneur and other dignitaries.|$|E

The {{party leader}} {{presented}} its candidate list on 30 August 2012, affirming {{it as the}} only party [...] "entirely Azorean", {{and that they had}} recruited candidates from Facebook, citing [...] "We don't have famous people, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> of every class and profession, from lawyers to the unemployed and domestics". The party, which received over 1% of the popular vote did not achieve any seats in the last regional assembly, and hoped to elect at least one. Running on an autonomic campaign of [...] "Azores for the Azoreans", the party supports home rule and traditional commerce; party leader (Matos) suggested that the sale of the Banco Comercial dos Açores (BCA) was lamentable, since the financial insolvency of the local construction sector could only be resolved by the public treasury.|$|E
2500|$|On September 30, 2014, Abarca {{asked for}} a 30-day leave of absence which was granted by the Iguala city council. His absence came amid {{pressures}} from {{other members of his}} political party, the PRD, who asked him to resign in order to facilitate investigations. Before the official session was over at the city council, federal agents arrived asking for Abarca, but he had already left. Federal agents then raided the mayor's house because he had an order of appearance. Abarca was believed to have left Iguala with his wife and children. Investigations concluded that he had left Guerrero but was still in hiding somewhere in Mexico. [...] "We are looking for him in an ongoing investigation. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> on him," [...] said Tomás Zerón de Lucio, head of the Criminal Investigation Agency. Rumors suggested that he had fled the country. Felipe Flores Velásquez was also issued an order of appearance. However, Flores was not located. At that time, Abarca still benefited from immunity under Mexican law, which protects elected officials from prosecution unless they commit a serious crime. In Abarca's case, he was protected from prosecution of common crimes, but not from federal charges.|$|E

2500|$|Gabbard, a {{vice-chair}} of the Democratic National Committee, {{was critical}} of the decision by DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to hold only six debates during the 2016 Democratic Party primary season, compared with 26 in 2008 and 15 in 2004. Some {{have argued that the}} number of debates was intentionally limited in order to bolster Secretary Hillary Clinton's position as the Democratic front-runner, citing Wasserman Schultz's previous position as co-chair of Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign as a conflict of interest and a newly created penalty barring further participation in sanctioned debates for any candidate who participates in an unsanctioned debate as an effort to limit public exposure to other candidates. Gabbard appeared on multiple news outlets to express her dissatisfaction with the number of debates. Following her public criticisms, she claimed she was uninvited from attending the Democratic debate in Las Vegas as a result. In a telephone interview with The New York Times, Gabbard stated, [...] "It's very dangerous when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> in positions of leadership who use their power to try to quiet those who disagree with them. When I signed up to be vice-chair of the DNC, no one told me I would be relinquishing my freedom of speech and checking it at the door." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, [...] "Episode VII" [...] was {{included}} in the film's opening crawl, but not in its official title. In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the Star Wars universe, revealed that the working title for the film was Shadow of the Empire [...] "for the longest time". Advance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015, and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing. Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater. In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day. In total it sold over $50 million in pre-sales breaking the record. This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14. However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying [...] "people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening… <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> buying Star Wars [...] into 2016. It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon." [...] Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK, Canada, and Germany.|$|E

That’s fine but it was tricky in places. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> flying drones over Pinewood studios trying to take photographs. It was nuts.

60|$|You {{see that}} not only Saint Sand is an apostle, in her way; but Saint Dumas is another. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> in England who write for bread, like Dumas and Sand, and are paid so much for their line; but they don't set up for prophets. Mrs. Trollope has never {{declared}} that her novels are inspired by heaven; Mr. Buckstone has written {{a great number of}} farces, and never talked about the altar and the tabernacle. Even Sir Edward Bulwer (who, on a similar occasion, when the critics found fault with a play of his, answered them by a pretty decent declaration of his own merits,) never ventured to say that he had received a divine mission, and was uttering five-act revelations.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, then NASA Administrator Michael Griffin {{identified}} space colonization as {{the ultimate}} goal of current spaceflight programs, saying: ... the goal isn't just scientific exploration ... it's also about extending the range of human habitat out from Earth into the solar system as we go forward in time ... In the long run a single-planet species will not survive ... If we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years, we must ultimately populate other planets. Now, today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable. We're in the infancy of it. ... I'm talking about that one day, I don't know when that day is, but there will be more human beings who live off the Earth than on it. <b>We</b> may well <b>have</b> <b>people</b> living on the Moon. <b>We</b> may <b>have</b> <b>people</b> living on the moons of Jupiter and other planets. <b>We</b> may <b>have</b> <b>people</b> making habitats on asteroids ...

2500|$|Most actors {{had contact}} before filming with the {{individuals}} {{they were to}} portray, often by telephone. Several veterans came to the production site. Hanks acknowledged that alterations were needed to create the series: [...] "We've made history fit onto our screens. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to condense down {{a vast number of}} characters, fold other people's experiences into 10 or 15 <b>people,</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> saying and doing things others said or did. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> take off their helmets to identify them, when they would never have done so in combat. But I still think it is three or four times more accurate than most films like this." [...] As a final accuracy check, the veterans saw previews of the series and approved the episodes before they were aired.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were also}} breakthroughs. Marilyn Dubow, a soloist with the symphony, won {{a seat in}} the New York Philharmonic as the first female violinist. Elayne Jones, one of the founders, joined the San Francisco Symphony as its first black woman timpanist. Thinking back on her days with the Symphony of the New World, Jones remembers, [...] "The {{legitimacy}} of our organization was not acceptable until <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>people</b> who were supporting us. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to have donations to begin to establish as a viable organization and to get union support! <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to begin getting players for this orchestra.

60|$|Yet things {{quite as}} preposterous as this are said and written under the {{influence}} of that great spectacle of babyish helplessness, the economic theory of history. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> who represent that all great historic motives were economic, and then have to howl {{at the top of their}} voices in order to induce the modern democracy to act on economic motives. The extreme Marxian politicians in England exhibit themselves as a small, heroic minority, trying vainly to induce the world to do what, according to their theory, the world always does. The truth is, of course, that there will be a social revolution the moment the thing has ceased to be purely economic. You can never have a revolution in order to establish a democracy. You must have a democracy in order to have a revolution.|$|E

Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> with us that think a great deal of their geometry and astronomies, but I hold to no such slender threads.

6000|$|Different people, {{of differing}} {{temperament}} and tradition, have sought oneness, this steadying and universalizing thing, in various manners. Some have attained {{it in this}} manner, and some in that. Scarcely a religious system has existed that has not worked effectively and proved true for someone. To me {{it seems that the}} need is synthetic, that some synthetic idea and belief is needed to harmonize one's life, to give a law by which motive may be tried against motive and an effectual peace of mind achieved. I want an active peace and not a quiescence, and I do not want to suppress and expel any motive at all. But to many people the effort takes the form of attempts to cut off some part of oneself as it were, to repudiate altogether some straining or distressing or disappointing factor in the scheme of motives, and find a tranquillizing refuge in the residuum. So we have men and women abandoning their share in economic development, crushing the impulses and evading the complications that arise out of sex and flying to devotions and simple duties in nunneries and monasteries; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> cutting their lives down to a vegetarian dietary and scientific research, resorting to excesses of self-discipline, giving themselves up wholly to some [...] "art" [...] and making everything else subordinate to that, or, going in another direction, abandoning pride and love in favour of an acquired appetite for drugs or drink.|$|E
