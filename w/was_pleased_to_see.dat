Overall, she described the episode as [...] "a very solid hour of entertainment, with very few nitpicks... a slick package with the values I consider to be real Trek". Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] wasn't enthusiastic about a particularly [...] "lackluster" [...] action scene which he felt was a bad cross between [...] and Andromeda.

500|$|Several themes {{ran through}} the reviews, {{one of which was}} the lack of focus on adult characters.

The gay-centered storylines also attracted much commentary. Christie Keith of lesbian and bisexual media website AfterEllen.com suggested that [...] "Duets" [...] was [...] "the queerest episode of any series that's ever been on television". Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack wrote that Kurt [...] "stole the show in terms of pure emotional power" [...] and called him [...] "the most important character on television right now".

Online's Jenna Mullins <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more than her usual [...] "deadpanning and one-liners", and Wieselman called it a [...] "wonderful moment" [...] when she and Artie broke up, which led to the depiction of [...] "real feelings" [...] in Brittany for the first time. Canning found Brittany and Artie's coupling [...] "uneven" [...] and preferred her with Santana, as their development made them [...] "uniquely interesting and a blast to watch."
