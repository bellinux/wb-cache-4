5|$|At Issus in 333BC, {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Darius, {{he used the}} same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.

Alexander arranged a double phalanx, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming.

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of gravity over the hips.|$|E

5|$|The {{low-level}} {{center of}} Pat began decoupling from convection late on February10 once it cleared Aitutaki. The storm rapidly weakened amid strong shear, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> being left completely exposed early on February11. A solitary band remained {{along the south}} side of the storm by that time, and the FMS no longer considered it a tropical cyclone after 06:00UTC. The lone band of convection dissipated later that day and with no residual thunderstorm activity, the skeletal low turned westward in response to westerly flow. The JTWC maintained Pat as a tropical storm until 18:00UTC and as a tropical depression until its dissipation early on February12.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} {{system that}} would form Dean was a stationary front situated in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico {{in the last week}} of July. On July 27, it developed a weak upper-level circulation indicated by reports from buoys in the Gulf, its structure was disorganized but {{was in the process of}} organizing. The system continued to organize early on July 28, and that afternoon it developed a surface circulation. The tropical depression that spawned Dean was thought to have formed at around 1800 UTC, July 28. It was later declared Tropical Depression Four that same day <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> located about 345miles (555km) southeast of New Orleans.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{was perched}} {{at the end}} of a thick, S-shaped neck, and a long, heavy tail acted as a {{counterweight}} to balance out the head and torso, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of mass over the hips. Tyrannosaurids are known for their proportionately very small two-fingered forelimbs, although remnants of a vestigial third digit are sometimes found. Tarbosaurus had the shortest forelimbs compared to its body size, while Daspletosaurus had the longest.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{transitioning}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression executed an elongated counter-clockwise loop to the northeast. Conditions favored further intensification, {{and based on}} ship reports, it is estimated the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bertha early on July28. Bertha quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status early on July29 about halfway between Cape Canaveral, Florida and Bermuda. The strengthening trend was brief, however, as increased vertical wind shear weakened it back to a tropical storm late on July29, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> exposed from the deep convection. Bertha continued slowly northeastward to ridging from the Bermuda high extending westward to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers such as David Morrison {{argue that}} the galactic equator is an entirely {{arbitrary}} line and can never be precisely drawn, because {{it is impossible to}} determine the Milky Way's exact boundaries, which vary depending on clarity of view. Jenkins claimed he drew his conclusions about the location of the galactic equator from observations taken at above , an altitude that gives a clearer image of the Milky Way than the Maya had access to. Furthermore, since the Sun is half a degree wide, its solstice position takes 36 years to precess its full width. Jenkins himself noted that even given his determined location for the line of the galactic equator, its most precise convergence <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the Sun already occurred in 1998, and so asserts that, rather than 2012, the galactic alignment instead focuses on a multi-year period centered in 1998.|$|E

5|$|East of Jacobsville, MD 177 {{receives}} {{the eastern end}} of MD 100. There is no direct access from eastbound MD 100 to westbound MD 177. The state highway becomes a three-lane road <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> lane controlled by lane use signals. During rush hours, there are two lanes in the relevant direction; at all other times, the center lane serves as a center left turn lane. The eastern end of the three-lane section is at South Carolina Avenue in the community of Lake Shore. MD 177 continues east as a two-lane road and passes a loop of Old Mountain Road. At Pinehurst Road, which leads to Downs Memorial Park, the route veers southeast toward Gibson Island. MD 177 reaches its eastern terminus at the gatehouse that guards the private island community {{on the north side of}} the mouth of the Magothy River at the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, heat shock {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the crowded and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of cancer cells.|$|E
5|$|On February21, Météo-France {{began to}} issue {{advisories}} on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo which presented a well-defined circulation. Later that day, deep convection redeveloped around the center as the low entered an area favorable for development. At 0830UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, stating that Hondo {{was likely to}} regenerate into a tropical cyclone. Later that day, Hondo became almost stationary and was upgraded to a tropical depression as it continued to develop. The next day, Hondo was downgraded to a tropical disturbance as wind shear constrained convective development and caused the system to weaken. However, early on February23, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Hondo as they estimated winds to have reached 65km/h (40mph) once more. At 0600UTC, Hondo attained winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds) near Mauritius and Réunion. Due to the proximity to the islands, convection associated with the storm became disorganized and it began to weaken. The JTWC issued their final advisory early on February24 as the system significantly weakened, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> devoid of convection. Météo-France issued their final advisory several hours later. The remnants of Hondo persisted for another five days, executing a counterclockwise loop before dissipating on February29.|$|E
