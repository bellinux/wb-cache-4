500|$|Ndegéocello {{spent over}} a year writing the songs from Devil's Halo, being {{inspired}} in part by her trip to Ireland. [...] "I went {{to a couple of}} pubs and there were much older gentlemen playing the guitar and just singing these amazing, simple songs", Ndegéocello recalled. [...] "I really admired that. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> that kind of place where the song could just exist with a guitar and a vocal." [...] With Icelandic audio engineer S. Husky Höskulds, Ndegéocello proceeded to record the album in seven days, backed by a band that featured guitarist Chris Bruce, keyboardist Keefus Ciancia, and drummer Deantoni Parks. She later credited them with providing her inspiration and critique while keeping her [...] "clear about what is the real focus—in life and in music". Their instruments were recorded live without digital post-production, which New York Times critic Ben Ratliff said contributed to the music's raw and organic sound.|$|E

2500|$|The Seekers reunited late in 1992, {{with the}} classic line-up of Durham, Guy, Potger and Woodley. [...] In March 1992, all four met together, {{for the first}} time in 20 years, at a {{restaurant}} in Toorak. Before then they had never talked about reforming, they just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know each other again. It was two months later that they decided to do a reunion concert, which led to a 102 date tour. [...] The 25-Year Silver Jubilee Reunion Celebration tour in 1993 was sufficiently successful that the group has continued to perform and record together, on and off, ever since. They staged several sell-out tours of Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The reformed group issued several albums, including new studio albums Future Road in October 1997 (which peaked at No.4 on the ARIA Albums Chart) and Morningtown Ride to Christmas (which reached the top20 in 2001). and both albums were certified platinum.|$|E

2500|$|Johan Derksen {{claimed in}} VI that Cambuur had paid {{a large sum}} of money to keep Oeki Hoekema from being suspended. According to Derksen Vlaardingen player and chief witness of the case Herman den Haag had {{received}} a few banknotes for the trouble {{out of the hands}} of a Cambuur official whilst on the toilet. De Volkskrant <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the bottom of it and called KNVB official Van Zon, who stated he had laughed very hard when he heard the claims. [...] "Money handed out on the toilet? How did he come up with that? I have seen it with my own eyes: the Cambuur representative gave the cash to the witnesses. No, not on the toilet but in public in the bar of our restaurant. It wasn't much money either, If I recall correctly it was fl. 50. Those few ten-guilder notes aren't even enough to cover the witnesses' expenses, since all the witnesses had to travel from Rotterdam to here. The KNVB pays fl. 0.35 per kilometre." [...] "Quite a crappy story indeed, Derksen wrote, but then again, that's what we're accustomed to. You wanna know who were present in court at the time? Me, another journalist and a man with a tape recorder. Derksen wasn't there. Probably on the toilet." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{years during}} Gwynn's career, media preseason {{predictions}} declared that [...] "this season" [...] {{he would become}} {{the first player to}} hit [...]400 since Williams in 1941. Relatively healthy in 1994, Gwynn batted [...]394, his career-high and the highest in the National League since Bill Terry hit [...]401 in 1930; he also had a league-leading [...]454 OBP. From April 22 through the 24 against Philadelphia, he had eight consecutive hits and reached base nine straight times, tying Padres records held by Winfield and Bip Roberts, respectively. Gwynn was batting [...]383 at the All-Star break; however, talk of a strike by the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) was looming, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> [...]400 before that date. He hit [...]423 over 28 games in the second half, and heated up to [...]475 though 10 games in August, when the season ended prematurely on August 11 due to the baseball strike. He was 6-for-9 in the last two games and 3-for-5 in the eventual finale, falling short of batting [...]400 by three hits. Fans were awaiting an end to the strike and for Gwynn to resume his quest for [...]400, but hopes of the season restarting were dashed when the World Series was canceled. He later commented, [...] "I'm not unhappy or bitter that the strike came. I look at it this way: I would have sooner fell short due to the strike than if I would have hit [...]400 and then the strike came. Then people would have thought I would have collapsed down the stretch, instead of being at [...]390 when the strike came and being so close." [...] That year, Gwynn pulled the ball with greater regularity. He was 10th in the league with a slugging percentage of [...]568, which was also his career-high. His 12homers in 419at-bats was a higher rate than in 1986, when he hit a then-career high 14homers in 642at-bats. He won another batting title (.368) in 1995. For the second straight year, he did not go longer than two games without a hit. He led the NL in batting {{with runners in scoring position}} (.394), and he had a then-career high 90 RBI. Gwynn hit in 15 straight games in July, his longest hitting streak since his 18-game run in 1988. He hit 28-for-65 (.431) with 15 RBI during the streak. Although he missed batting [...]400 in 1994, he batted [...]403 during a 179-game stretch between July 3, 1993 and May 9, 1995.|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
