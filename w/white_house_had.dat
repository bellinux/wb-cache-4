The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> declined to sell 66 F-16C/D fighter planes as US Pacific Command has felt no need for advanced arms to be sold to the ROC.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{began the}} process of {{identifying}} potential Supreme Court nominees shortly after his election in 2008, before a Supreme Court vacancy was actually known. White House Counsel Greg Craig helped assemble an early list of possible names. Once the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> learned of Souter's plans to retire, {{two members of the}} Vice President's staff, Chief of Staff Ron Klain and Counsel Cynthia Hogan, ran the daily operations of the selection process.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the American Civil War, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> become overcrowded. The {{location}} of the White House was questioned, just north of a canal and swampy lands, which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions. Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler was tasked to propose solutions to address these concerns. He proposed abandoning the use of the White House as a residence and designed a new estate for the first family at Meridian Hill in Washington, D.C., but Congress rejected the plan.|$|E
25|$|On February 28, 1973, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray {{testified before}} the Senate Judiciary Committee during his {{nomination}} to replace J. Edgar Hoover as Director of the FBI. Armed with newspaper articles indicating the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> possession of FBI Watergate files, the committee chairman, Sam Ervin, questioned Gray as to what {{he knew about the}} White House obtaining the files. Gray stated he had given FBI reports to Dean, and had discussed the FBI investigation with Dean on many occasions. It also came out that Gray had destroyed important evidence entrusted to him by Dean. Gray's nomination failed and now Dean was directly linked to the Watergate cover-up.|$|E
25|$|During the {{confirmation}} hearing, Gray defended his bureau's investigation. During questioning, he volunteered {{that he had}} provided copies {{of some of the}} files on the investigation to White House Counsel John Dean, who had told Gray he was conducting an investigation for the President. Gray testified that before turning over the files to Dean, he had been advised by the FBI's own legal counsel that he was required by law to comply with Dean's order. He confirmed that the investigation supported claims made by The Washington Post and other sources of dirty tricks committed and funded by the Committee to Re-Elect the President, notably activities of questionable legality committed by Donald Segretti. The <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> for months steadfastly denied any involvement in such activities.|$|E

25|$|The 1962 United States {{elections}} were under way, and the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> denied charges {{that it was}} ignoring dangerous Soviet missiles 90 miles from Florida. The missile preparations were confirmed when an Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range (SS-4) and intermediate-range (R-14) ballistic missile facilities. The US established a military blockade to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba; Oval Office tapes during the crisis revealed that Kennedy had also put the blockade in place {{as an attempt to}} provoke Soviet-backed forces in Berlin as well. It announced that they would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Within {{a week of}} Souter's {{announcement}} the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> formalized its {{short list}} of candidates to replace Souter, with Judge Sonia Sotomayor of the Second Circuit, Judge Diane Pamela Wood of the Seventh Circuit, and Solicitor General Elena Kagan reportedly leading contenders for the nomination. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, California Supreme Court Justice Carlos Moreno, and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm were also reportedly {{on the short list}} of candidates under serious consideration by the White House. Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears of the Georgia Supreme Court, Judge Merrick B. Garland of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Judge Ruben Castillo of the Federal District Court for the Northern District in Illinois were also on the final list of nine candidates.|$|E
25|$|However, on November 10, 2009, the White House {{decided in}} the CIA's favor, agreeing that the {{authority}} to appoint station chiefs overseas should remain with the CIA. Some intelligence experts believe this significantly weakens the DNI's authority, comparing the DNI to a DCI without an agency. Senator Susan Collins of Maine expressed concerns during hearings over the botched 2009 Christmas terrorist attack that the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> undermined the power of ODNI by siding with the CIA in turf disputes, specifically citing this disagreement over intelligence community appointees. In a January 2010 statement to lawmakers by Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton who led the 9-11 Commission Report, Kean and Hamilton urged Obama to be clear {{who was in charge}} and urged a strong DNI. According to the Washington Post, a former Clinton administration official suggested scrapping the DNI position if Blair were removed.|$|E

25|$|On 16 October 2016, the New York Times {{reported}} that American {{officials said the}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> quietly broadened the president’s authority {{for the use of}} force in Somalia by allowing airstrikes to protect American and African troops as they combat fighters from al-Shabaab. About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. SEAL Team 6 has been heavily involved in many of these operations. American military officials said once ground operations are complete, American troops working with Somali forces often interrogate prisoners at temporary screening facilities, including one in Puntland, before the detainees are transferred to more permanent Somali-run prisons. The Pentagon has only acknowledged a small fraction of these operations, announcing 13 ground raids and airstrikes so far in 2016 (3 of which took place in September) — up from 5 in 2015; according to data compiled by New America (a Washington Think tank) the strikes have killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants. At a former Russian fighter jet base in Baledogle, U.S. Marines and private contractors are working to build up a Somali military unit designed to combat Al-Shabaab throughout the country.|$|E

500|$|On June 18, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director Louis Freeh {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.|$|E
500|$|After {{announcing his}} {{infection}} in November 1991, Johnson created the Magic Johnson Foundation to help combat HIV, although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable goals. In 1992, {{he joined the}} National Commission on AIDS, a committee appointed by members of Congress and the Bush Administration. Johnson left after eight months, saying that the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> [...] "utterly ignored" [...] {{the work of the}} panel, and had opposed the commission's recommendations, which included universal healthcare and the expansion of Medicaid to cover all low-income people with AIDS.

500|$|There {{were strong}} {{political}} implications in {{the handling of}} the riot, as Romney was seen as a leading Republican contender to challenge Johnson's presidential re-election the following year; Romney believed the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> intentionally slowed its response and he charged Johnson with having [...] "played politics" [...] in his actions. The riot notwithstanding, by the end of Romney's governorship the state had made strong gains in civil rights related to public employment, government contracting, and access to public accommodations. [...] Lesser improvements were made in combating discrimination in private employment, housing, education, and law enforcement. [...] Considerable state and federal efforts were made during this time to improve the lot of Michigan's migrant farm workers and Native Americans, without much progress for either.|$|E

500|$|Chotiner was {{involved}} in recruiting Republican candidates in the unsuccessful attempt to get a Republican Senate majority in the 1970 elections. Some of Chotiner's friends stated that Nixon involved him in this project after news reports claimed that Nixon had abandoned his former campaign manager, however, Chotiner himself denied that and stated he had been made special counsel because {{some people in the}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> decided he could be useful. The special counsel also coordinated Vice President Spiro Agnew's campaign against [...] "radic lib" [...] senatorial candidates, including New York Republican Senator Charles Goodell, who was subsequently defeated by Conservative Party candidate James L.

500|$|Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House Travel Office employees, {{an affair}} that {{became known as}} [...] "Travelgate", began with charges that the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> used audited {{financial}} irregularities in the Travel Office operation {{as an excuse to}} replace the staff with friends from Arkansas. The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true. The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made [...] "factually false" [...] statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.|$|E
500|$|Though her elegant fashions and {{wardrobe}} were {{hailed as}} a [...] "glamorous paragon of chic", they were also controversial subjects. In 1982, she revealed that she had accepted {{thousands of dollars in}} clothing, jewelry, and other gifts, but defended her actions by stating that she had borrowed the clothes, and that they would either be returned or donated to museums, and that she was promoting the American fashion industry. Facing criticism, she soon said she would no longer accept such loans. While often buying her clothes, she continued to borrow and sometimes keep designer clothes throughout her time as first lady, which came to light in 1988. None of this had been included on financial disclosure forms; the non-reporting of loans under $10,000 in liability was in violation of a voluntary agreement the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> made in 1982, while not reporting more valuable loans or clothes not returned was a possible violation of the Ethics in Government Act. Reagan expressed through her press secretary [...] "regrets that she failed to heed counsel's advice" [...] on disclosing them.|$|E
