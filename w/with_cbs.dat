5|$|On September 8, 2009, Dahl began doing daily podcasts from {{a studio}} in the {{basement}} of his home. At the time, Dahl was still under contract <b>with</b> <b>CBS,</b> who had agreed in July 2009 to partner with him to produce a daily, hour long podcast complete with a few commercials. On August 1, 2011, Dahl, no longer under contract <b>with</b> <b>CBS,</b> began the Steve Dahl Network whose 11 unique weekly shows can be either downloaded or streamed via his official website and app or downloaded from iTunes. Originally, there was only just a daily podcast from Dahl; the network, however, has expanded and now includes podcasts by friends Kevin Matthews and Daniel Van Kirk among others.|$|E

5|$|Advertising {{rates were}} {{reported}} as being slightly {{higher than in the}} year before, <b>with</b> <b>CBS</b> confirming a price of $2.6 million for some 30-second spots, compared with $2.5 million during Super Bowl XL. However, CNN reported that after discounts, the average price is likely closer to $1.8 to $2 million. Familiar advertisers in recent years such as Anheuser-Busch, CareerBuilder, General Motors and Coca-Cola bought multiple advertising spots, and other popular advertisers like Go Daddy and Emerald Nuts had commercials this year.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, TISM entered {{negotiations}} <b>with</b> <b>CBS</b> Records and Phonogram Records {{and were}} {{signed by the}} latter. In April that year, the band began work on what would become their next album with producer Laurence Maddy. When Phonogram released Hot Dogma (1990) it failed to reach the commercial charts, and TISM were fired six months later due to management issues, despite owing the label {{tens of thousands of}} dollars. Hot Dogma is the first release to use the acronymic form of the band's name exclusively.|$|E

Gray had bought KSNB under a failing station waiver to form a duopoly <b>with</b> <b>CBS</b> station KOLN/KGIN, and operated the station as a MyNetworkTV/MeTV affiliate with local programming focused on central Nebraska; this existing programming was moved to KSNB-DT2 upon the transition.

5|$|Originally to air on CBS with a {{start time}} of 2:30p.m. CST, CBS reassigned the game for primetime {{television}} at 7:00p.m. CST {{as part of a}} trade announced October 23. The deal <b>with</b> <b>CBS</b> involved swapping games to other networks and gave future scheduling considerations for the 2012 season to ESPN. This was the case as CBS used their allotted SEC primetime slot for the Alabama–Florida game earlier in the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, {{sessions}} for the album started, with recording {{taking place at}} three different studios in Kingston, Jamaica: Dynamic Sound, Harry J's and Randy's. Engineer Sylvan Morris put the songs on eight-track tape, and allocated tracks with the drum mixes on one track and piano and guitar together on another. In the winter of 1972, Marley flew back to London to present the master tapes. The deal with Island led to a dispute <b>with</b> <b>CBS</b> and Sims, to whom the band were already contracted. The Island Records label won the resulting court case, and it received US$9,000 and two percent of royalties from the band's first six albums, and Sims received 5,000 and the publishing rights to the Wailers songs.|$|E

5|$|The Giants' run of {{championship}} game appearances combined with their large market location translated into financial success. By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract <b>with</b> <b>CBS</b> — {{four times as}} much as small-market Green Bay, {{which was one of the}} most successful teams of the era. However, in the league's new contract, the Maras convinced the other owners that it would be in the best interest of the NFL to share television revenue equally, a practice which is still current, and is credited with strengthening the league.* King, Peter. , Sports Illustrated, October 25, 2005, accessed December 14, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Garland's history <b>with</b> <b>CBS</b> {{prior to}} the series was a {{checkered}} one. She had previously headlined several specials for the network. The first was the inaugural episode of the Ford Star Jubilee which aired in 1955. The special, the first full-scale color telecast on CBS, was a ratings triumph, garnering a 34.8 Nielsen rating. This success led to Garland's signing a three-year, $300,000 contract with the network. Only a single special aired, a live General Electric Theater episode in 1956, before the pact was terminated. The relationship between CBS and Garland and her then-husband and manager, Sid Luft, dissolved in acrimony in 1957 after they and agent Freddie Fields were unable {{to come to terms}} with the network over the format of her next special. Garland filed a US$1.4 million lawsuit against CBS for libel and breach of contract (CBS filed a counterclaim) that was not settled until 1961, when Garland and CBS each agreed to drop their claims and negotiations began for a new round of Garland specials for the network.|$|E
5|$|In January 1937, {{ownership}} of WAAB was consolidated {{with that of}} another Boston station controlled by Shepard: WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network, a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial. Yankee flagship WNAC had been an affiliate of CBS Radio, changing affiliation to NBC Red later in 1937 when CBS purchased WEEI in that city. The Texas Network soon added twenty-three more stations to the Mutual affiliate roster. WGAR dropped out, but the United Broadcasting Company, part of The Plain Dealer business, joined with its lead station, WHK. Within a few years, this new Ohio participant {{would become one of}} the network's central members, a shareowner in Mutual. By the end of 1938, Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups, Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 <b>with</b> <b>CBS.</b> The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders. Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS, however, {{and the fact that the}} lion's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual's emergence (the exceptional, and soon departed, WLW aside), the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage.|$|E

5|$|In American football, if {{what would}} {{normally}} be a safety is scored on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt (officially known in the rulebooks as a try), one point is awarded to the scoring team. This {{is commonly known as}} a conversion safety or one-point safety and it can be scored by the offense. There are at least two known occurrences of the conversion safety in Division I college football– a November 26, 2004 game in which Texas scored against Texas A, and the 2013 Fiesta Bowl in which Oregon scored against Kansas State. In both games, the point-after-touchdown kick was blocked, recovered by the defense, and then fumbled or thrown back into the end zone. Coincidentally, play-by-play commentator Brad Nessler of the ESPN family of networks (currently <b>with</b> <b>CBS)</b> called both of these games. No conversion safeties have been scored in the NFL since 1940, although it is now slightly more likely after the rule change in 2015 which allowed the defense to take possession and score on a conversion attempt. Before 2015, the only scenario in which a one-point safety could have been scored in the NFL would have involved the defense kicking or batting a loose ball out the back of the end zone without taking possession of it. After the 2015 rule change, a one-point safety can also be scored after the defense takes possession and fumbles out of their own end zone or is tackled in it after leaving it, as in the NCAA.|$|E
