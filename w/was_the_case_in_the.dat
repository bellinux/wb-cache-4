5|$|The RAAF's MirageIII pilots {{generally}} {{found the}} process of converting to the Hornet to be straightforward. While the F/A-18 {{was considered to be}} easier to fly, its more sophisticated avionics and weapons systems required improved cockpit workload management skills. The Hornets have also proven to be mechanically reliable and easy to maintain, though shortages of spare parts reduced availability rates {{during the early years of}} their service with the RAAF. The updates installed as part of the HUG process have further simplified maintenance procedures. In recent years, however, the aging aircraft have required much more servicing than <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E
5|$|The main tournament {{combined}} {{elements of}} both previous WBC editions. The first round was split all teams into fourpools, where the teams competed in a round-robin, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2006 tournament. The second round used the same modified double-elimination format as used in the 2009 tournament and the 2013 qualifying tournament. The final round was contested {{in the same manner}} as both previous tournaments: the top two teams from each group in the second round qualifying for the two semi-final matches, the winners of which played in the championship game.|$|E
5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it and NATO members. Such <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E

5|$|The 2008–09 NBA {{season was}} to be Bowen's last with the Spurs. Although he played in 80 regular season games, {{he was no longer}} a starter as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} seven San Antonio campaigns. His minutes were also greatly reduced (from 30+ to 18.9 per game), although his shooting numbers remained consistent. The Spurs went into the 2009 NBA Playoffs with a 54–28 record and as the third seed. With influential shooting guard Manu Ginóbili out injured, the Spurs got off to a bad start to the series and eventually lost 4–1 against the Dallas Mavericks, bowing out of the playoffs in the first round {{for the first time since}} 2000.|$|E
5|$|The WHL {{folded in}} 1926, and its assets were {{bought by the}} NHL. This left the NHL as the only league left {{competing}} for the Cup. Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the cup to the NHL, allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished {{to play for the}} Cup. A 2006 Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley's conditions in the 1947 agreement. The NHL has agreed to allow other teams to play for the Cup should the league not be operating, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|Between 2015 and 2017, {{upgrades}} from K185 to K200 {{were also}} completed in Kulm, Planica, and Oberstdorf. All are now equipped for jumps exceeding 240m (previous hill records were broken at each opening event), {{as well as}} having improved facilities for athletes and spectators; Harrachov remains the only hill (at K185) to have not been upgraded since the 1990s. Although the new hills are much larger than ever before, most of them feature longer and less steeply angled slopes, designed purely for the V-style and {{with the knowledge of}} 80 years' worth of world record progression. Inrun tables have also been placed further back from the knoll and flight curves made shallower in order to allow athletes to glide more efficiently along the contour of the slope. This has significantly reduced such precarious heights over the knoll as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s and prior: in that era, athletes using the parallel style would jump in a more upward trajectory off the table, reaching vast heights but at the expense of distance. Furthermore, rather than glide, they instead plummeted towards the slope. However, Planica remains extremely steep in the flight phase; Vikersund, by comparison, has a longer slope and does not enable as much height over the knoll.|$|E
25|$|Nations {{regulate}} arbitration {{through a}} variety of laws. The main body of law applicable to arbitration is normally contained either in the national Private International Law Act (as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Switzerland) or in a separate law on arbitration (as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> England and Jordan). In addition to this, a number of national procedural laws may also contain provisions relating to arbitration.|$|R

5|$|In 1993, the Patriots and {{new head}} coach Bill Parcells {{were looking to}} improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed Scott Secules, and {{attempted}} to sign Steve Beuerlein, but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade. In April, Millen {{was traded to the}} Dallas Cowboys, and the Patriots chose Drew Bledsoe with the first pick in the 1993 NFL Draft. During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback. Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes. He became a restricted free agent in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years. As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. As <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the holder for extra point and field goal attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback. The 1995 season was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992. On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 3017. Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the Denver Broncos. This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained {{for the rest of the}} season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{interest}} rate targeting {{there are other}} possible targets of open markets operations.

25|$|The {{parliamentary}} threshold {{does not}} apply to independents, meaning that Kurdish nationalist politicians who poll strongly in the south-east but are not able to win 10% of the overall vote stand as independents rather than as party candidates.

25|$|Blackpool's {{success was}} {{reflected}} in the crowds they were drawing, both at home and at grounds all across England.

25|$|Furthermore, some {{competing}} elite political players {{may not be}} in power; {{they would}} remain unincorporated into the central system.

25|$|Around {{the year}} 1000, the County of Brussels {{became a part}} of the Duchy of Brabant (and {{therefore}} of the Holy Roman Empire) with Brussels as one of the four capitals of the Duchy, along with Leuven, Antwerp, and 's-Hertogenbosch. Dutch was the sole language of Brussels, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other three cities. Not all of Brabant, however, was Dutch-speaking. The area south of Brussels, around the town of Nivelles, was a French-speaking area roughly corresponding to the modern province of Walloon Brabant.|$|E
