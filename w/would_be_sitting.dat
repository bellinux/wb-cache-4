25|$|In South Africa, the Australia {{team had}} a very {{successful}} tour and senior players such as Bill O'Reilly were pointed in their comments about the enjoyment of playing under Richardson's captaincy. A clique of players who were openly hostile toward Bradman formed during the tour. For some, the prospect of playing under Bradman was daunting, as was the knowledge that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in judgment of their abilities {{in his role as}} a selector.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, California's George Murphy {{joined the}} Senate, and kept candy {{in his desk}} to offer his colleagues, and for himself, though eating is not allowed on the Senate floor. When he left the Senate after a six-year term, other Republican {{senators}} maintained the custom. The nascent tradition did not become publicly known until the mid-1980s, when Washington Senator Slade Gorton disclosed it in announcing that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> at the Candy Desk.|$|E
25|$|The scenic {{stage was}} {{probably}} some 50’ deep and 30’ high. The proscenium arch {{may have been}} some 30’ wide and at least 25’ high to accommodate the scenery in operas such as Dioclesian, The Fairy-Queen, or The World in the Moon. Both the forestage and the scenic stage were raked. The music box above the proscenium arch could hold perhaps 8 to 10 musicians, to provide incidental music. A full orchestra <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in the pit, {{just in front of the}} stage.|$|E

2500|$|On April 25, 2007, it was {{announced}} that drummer Dave Buckner <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> out the band's touring schedule due to personal matters. He was expected to rejoin the group shortly afterwards. Jacoby Shaddix later confirmed in an interview with Launch Radio Networks that Dave had entered rehab to [...] "go clean his act up 'cause he was out of his mind." [...] Unwritten Law drummer Tony Palermo filled in on drums.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the most}} recent edition of The Amber Spyglass {{released}} in the UK, the post-script [...] "Lantern Slides" [...] section shows Lyra studying the alethiometer (a rare truth-telling device) with Pantalaimon at age 18. She is excited to start recognising a pattern in the readings, and Pullman tells us that this discovery of a pattern is the [...] "second thing she said to Will next day in the Botanic Garden", implying that {{the next day was}} Midsummer's Day, when she and Will <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> on the same bench in their separate worlds.|$|E
2500|$|Bar Lev {{suggested}} {{that such a}} line would defend against any major Egyptian assault across the canal, and was expected {{to function as a}} [...] "graveyard for Egyptian troops". Moshe Dayan described it as [...] "one of the best anti-tank ditches in the world." [...] Sharon, and Israel Tal on the other hand, vigorously opposed the line. Sharon said that it would pin down large military formations that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> ducks for deadly artillery attacks, and cited the opinion of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, who explained him [...] "the great military disaster such a line could bring." [...] Notwithstanding, it was completed in spring 1970.|$|E

2500|$|In July 2011, Osbourne {{and some}} of her fellow The Talk panelists were criticised for their conduct when {{discussing}} the story of Catherine Kieu. Osbourne described Kieu's cutting off of her husband's penis and putting it in a garbage disposal as [...] "quite fabulous", Osbourne also laughed about the incident with her fellow panellists and members of the audience. Osbourne's cohost Sara Gilbert offered the counterpoint [...] "Not to be a total buzz kill, but {{it is a little bit}} sexist. If somebody cut a woman's breast off, nobody <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> laughing.", Osbourne replied by saying [...] "It's different". Osbourne later apologised for her behaviour, stating [...] "she was sorry she offended people" [...] and that she [...] "did not condone genital mutilation".|$|E
2500|$|Travis Smith unofficially {{left the}} band {{on the second}} leg of the [...] "Into the Mouth of Hell We Tour" [...] tour. On February 4, 2010, the band {{announced}} that Travis had indeed officially left the band and fill-in drummer, ex-drum tech, Nick Augusto, was replacing him. Augusto is {{a former member of}} Maruta and Metal Militia, in which he played with Gregoletto. The band has not yet stated the reason of his departure. While Trivium's relationship with Smith had deteriorated over the years, the band had no immediate plans to replace him when he announced in late October 2009 that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> out the 'Into the Mouth of Hell We March' tour to take care of [...] "some personal business." ...|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{role the}} new Queen would play, if any, in public or {{government}} affairs, was uncertain with her main role being simply {{to give the}} Shah a male heir. [...] Within the Imperial Household, her public function was secondary to the far more pressing matter of assuring the succession. [...] However, {{after the birth of}} the Crown Prince, the new Queen was free to devote more of her time to other activities and official pursuits. Mohammad Reza was always very attracted to tall women and Farah was taller than her husband, which led him to wear elevator shoes to disguise this fact. Usually when the Imperial couple were photographed, one or both <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in a chair or alternatively the Shah and his Queen were photographed on a staircase with Mohammad Reza standing on the upper stairs.|$|E

5000|$|In her memoir, {{entitled}} Has Corinne Been a Good Girl? (1983), {{she stated}} that the roles she played for Hollywood studios never challenged her acting ability. In 1958, referring to being cast as a French temptress, she told an interviewer, [...] "If I had come to Hollywood as a dramatic actress, I never <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> Corinne Calvet, and you never <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> here talking to me." ...|$|R
50|$|In January 2011, she was {{selected}} as a Fianna Fáil candidate in Dublin Central for the 2011 general election. Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who was not running again, said his loyalties this time <b>would</b> <b>be</b> with <b>sitting</b> TD Cyprian Brady {{and there was no}} hope of Fianna Fáil winning two seats in the constituency.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Reformation, altars were fixed against the east end of the church, and the priests would {{celebrate}} the Mass standing {{at the front of the}} altar. [...] Beginning with the rubrics of the Second Prayer Book of Edward VI published in 1552, and through the 1662 Book of Common Prayer (which prevailed for almost 300 years), the priest is directed to stand [...] "at the north syde of the Table." [...] This was variously interpreted over the years to mean the north side of the front of a fixed communion table, the north end of a fixed table (i.e., facing south), the north side of a free-standing table (presumably facing those intending to receive the Elements who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in the quire stalls opposite), or at the north [...] end of a free-standing table lengthwise in the chancel, facing a congregation seated in the nave.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{interpreted}} Song of Songs [...] "My beloved {{is like a}} gazelle or a young hart; behold, {{he stands}} behind our wall," [...] to apply to God's Presence in the synagogue. The Midrash read the words, [...] "behold, He stands behind our wall," [...] to allude to the occasion in [...] when God came to visit Abraham {{on the third day}} after Abraham's circumcision. [...] says, [...] "And the Lord appeared to him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat ( [...] , yoshev)..." [...] The word for [...] "he sat" [...] is in a form that can be read yashav, the letter vav being omitted, as though it read that Abraham was sitting before he saw God, but on seeing God, he wanted to stand up. But God told him to sit, as Abraham would serve as a symbol for his children, for when his children would come into their synagogues and houses of study and recite the Shema, they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> down and God's Glory would stand by. To support this reading, the Midrash cited [...] "God stands in the congregation of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Few drafts and {{preparatory studies}} were made, {{contrary}} to David's normal practice. Gros, David's pupil, produced a small oil {{sketch of a}} horse being reined in, which was a probable study for Napoleon's mount, and the notebooks of David show some sketches of first thoughts on {{the position of the}} rider. The lack of early studies may in part be explained by Bonaparte's refusal to sit for the portrait. He had sat for Gros in 1796 on the insistence of Joséphine de Beauharnais, but Gros had complained that he had not had enough time for the sitting to be of benefit. David had also managed to persuade him to sit for a portrait in 1798, but the three hours that the fidgety and impatient Bonaparte had granted him did not give him sufficient time to produce a decent likeness. On accepting the commission for the Alpine scene, it appears that David expected that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> for the study, but Bonaparte refused point blank, not only on the basis that he disliked sitting but also because he believed that the painting should be a representation of his character rather than his physical appearance: ...|$|E
60|$|He came to {{the opening}} of the street where Dromore lived. She <b>would</b> <b>be</b> there, <b>sitting</b> by the fire in the big chair, playing with her kitten, thinking, dreaming, and--alone! He passed on at such a pace that people stared; till, turning the last corner for home, he ran almost into the arms of Oliver Dromore.|$|R
50|$|During the San Diego Comic Con {{event of}} 2014, Straczynski {{announced}} that he <b>would</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> down to write a Babylon 5 feature film, which is envisioned as a reboot of the iconic sci-fi series. JMS said {{that he plans to}} get the script locked down by the end of 2015 and the film would then enter production the following year in 2016.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear it. Do you know, {{that is a great}} {{concession}} for me to make, but it is the truth? I {{like you}} to be interested in me. Yet I must confess that your ignorance as to who I really am astonishes me. Perhaps," [...] she added gravely, [...] "if you knew, you <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> by my side at the present moment." ...|$|R
2500|$|Stuart's career {{advanced}} when English director James Whale chose her for {{the glamour}} role as a sentimental wife who winds up stranded among strangers at a spooky mansion in his ensemble cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Raymond Massey) for The Old Dark House (1932). The film was critically praised, and The New York Times called Stuart's performance [...] "clever and charming," [...] with the movie later becoming a cult classic. Stuart's experience filming The Old Dark House also became integral {{to the formation of}} the Screen Actors Guild in 1933: [...] "James [...] joined all the English actors,” Stuart recalled. “So {{on one side of the}} set they had their ‘elevensies’ and `foursies,’ and Melvyn [...] and I <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> together, not invited. One day, Melvyn said to me, `Are you interested in forming a union together?’ I said, ‘What’s a union?’ He said, ‘Like in New York – Actor’s Equity. The actors get together and work for better working conditions.’ I said, ‘Oh wonderful,’ because I was getting up at five every morning; in makeup at seven, in hair at eight, wardrobe at quarter of nine, and then sometimes if production wanted you to, you worked until four or five the next morning. There was no overtime. They fed us when they felt like it, when it was convenient for production. It was really very, very hard work." [...] After filming completed, Stuart began canvassing, and was one of the union's first founding members.|$|E

6000|$|So Miss Ophelia tried it. Topsy would {{scream and}} groan and implore. But {{half an hour}} later she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> among the other little niggers {{belonging}} to the house, laughing about it. 'Miss Feely whip!' she would say, 'she can't do it nohow.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "After all, why isn't it?" [...] she agreed. [...] "I walked {{round the}} garden once, {{thinking}} about a certain matter in which you are concerned, and then I walked in the park, {{and it occurred to}} me that you <b>would</b> probably <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> out here, only a few hundred yards away, just as you are doing, and that you could, if you would, set my mind at rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe I did him an injustice, Pa," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I {{like him}} any better now. I must {{be honest about}} that. I simply can't like him. But I do think {{that if he had}} been as unscrupulous as I thought, he would have deserted you long ago for {{something}} more profitable. He <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> in the office day after day making plans for the business when the war is over." ...|$|R

60|$|He lighted his {{cigarette}}. After all, Irene had {{not made}} a scene! She would come round--that {{was the best of}} her; she was cold, but not sulky. And, puffing the cigarette smoke at a lady-bird on the shining table, he plunged into a reverie about the house. It was no good worrying; he would go and make it up presently. She <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> out there in the dark, under the Japanese sunshade, knitting. A beautiful, warm night....|$|E
60|$|At first Paul lay {{very still}} on his luxurious perfumed pillows. It was the first night he had ever spent away from the little seaward-looking loft where he could touch the rafters with his hands. He thought of it now and a lump came into his throat and a strange, new, bitter longing came into his heart. He missed the sea plashing on the rocks below him--he could not sleep without that old lullaby. He turned his face into the pillow, and the longing and {{loneliness}} grew worse and hurt him until he moaned. Oh, {{he wanted to be}} back home! Surely he had not left it--he could never have meant to leave it. Out there the stars would be shining over the harbour. Stephen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> at the door, all alone, with his violin. But he would not be playing it--all at once Paul knew he would not be playing it. He <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> there with his head bowed and the loneliness in his heart calling to the loneliness in Paul's heart over all the miles between them. Oh, he could never have really meant to leave Stephen.|$|E
60|$|The {{sight of}} Acacia Villa, {{suggesting}} that everybody {{was in bed}} and asleep, served to further irritate him. A dog-like wife <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> up {{to see if there}} was anything he wanted. Mr. Korner, acting on the advice of his own brass plate, not only knocked but also rang. As the door did not immediately fly open, he continued to knock and ring. The window of the best bedroom on the first floor opened.|$|R
5000|$|... "They {{highlighted}} my hair {{to match}} Robert's," [...] explained Davison, [...] "and {{over the next}} three years I <b>would</b> regularly <b>be</b> seen <b>sitting</b> in a high-end hairdressing salon in a fashionable part of London, with bits of tin foil covering my head." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, a {{carriage}} ride succeeded, near the solemn river, stealing away by night, as all things steal away, by night and by day, so quietly yielding to {{the attraction of}} the loadstone rock of Eternity; and the nearer they drew to the chamber where Eugene lay, the more they feared that they might find his wanderings done. At last they saw its dim light shining out, and it gave them hope: though Lightwood faltered as he thought: 'If he <b>were</b> gone, she <b>would</b> still <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> by him.' ...|$|R
