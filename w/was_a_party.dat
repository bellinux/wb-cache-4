5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing {{a sense of}} humor. Sherwood wore trousers instead of a dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E

With an accomplice, he shot and killed Bazin on February 9, 1929, as the Frenchman left his mistress's house. The French {{attributed}} the attack to the VNQDD and reacted by apprehending all the party members they could find: between three and four hundred men were rounded up, including 36government clerks, 13French government officials, 36schoolteachers, 39merchants, 37landowners and 40military personnel. The subsequent trials resulted in 78men being convicted and sentenced to jail terms ranging between five and twenty years. The arrests severely depleted the VNQDD leadership: most of the Central Committee were captured, though Học and Nhu were among the few who escaped from a raid on their hideout at the Vietnam Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress {{established}} a six-member Supreme Court. The court {{was composed of}} one Chief Justice and five Associate Justices.

The Court was given appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the federal circuit courts as well as decisions by state courts holding invalid any statute or treaty of the United States; or holding valid any state law or practice that was challenged as being inconsistent with the federal constitution, treaties, or laws; or rejecting any claim made by a party under a provision of the federal constitution, treaties, or laws.|$|E

25|$|With Saulsbury as governor, the Democratic Party took {{full control}} in Delaware. Under Saulsbury’s leadership, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> that bitterly detested {{virtually}} anything {{associated with the}} Republican policies of the federal government, particularly its actions to end slavery and to expand the rights of African-Americans. Strongly opposed to the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, Saulsbury and the Democrats took every possible step to frustrate their implementation and deny the new rights given to African-Americans. This included the recommendation that African-Americans convicted of certain crimes be sold back into slavery. This fear-mongering was so successful that no Republicans were elected to the Delaware General Assembly in 1868, and hardly any were elected for many years thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The first {{minor league}} is {{traditionally}} {{considered to be}} the Northwestern League of 1883 to 1884. Unlike the earlier minor associations, it was conceived as a permanent organization. It also, along with the National League and the American Association, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to the National Agreement of 1883. Included in this was the agreement to respect the reserve lists of clubs in each league. Teams in the National League and the American Association could only reserve players who had been paid at least $1000. Northwest League teams could reserve players paid merely $750, implicitly establishing the division into major and minor leagues. Over the next two decades, more minor leagues signed various versions of the National Agreement. Eventually, the minor leagues joined together to negotiate jointly.|$|E

25|$|If an adjudicator has a pecuniary or {{monetary}} {{interest in}} the matter {{he or she is}} presiding over, no matter how small it is, he or she is automatically disqualified from making the decision. The decision, if made, may be set aside. Thus, in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the House of Lords held that the Lord Chancellor, who was a shareholder of one of the companies that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to certain legal proceedings he was presiding over, was disqualified from hearing the case. His ruling had to be annulled. This was not because there was a real possibility of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint the fairness of the proceedings.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{defeated}} Adams in the 1800 presidential election. Jefferson {{wanted to}} oversee his administration's foreign policy, and he selected the loyal Madison {{for the position}} of Secretary of State despite the latter's lack of foreign policy experience. Along with Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin, Madison became {{of the two major}} influences in Jefferson's cabinet. At the start of his term, Madison <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to the United States Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison (1803), in which the doctrine of judicial review was asserted by the high Court, much to the annoyance of the Jeffersonians who did not want a powerful federalist judiciary. Throughout Jefferson's presidency, much of Europe was at war, and the main challenge to the Jefferson administration was maintaining neutrality during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
