5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end of the wire and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
25|$|The main {{suspension}} cables {{in older}} bridges were often made from chain or linked bars, but modern bridge cables {{are made from}} multiple strands of wire. This not only adds strength but improves reliability (often called redundancy in engineering terms) because {{the failure of a}} few flawed strands in the hundreds used pose very little threat of failure, whereas a single bad link or eyebar can cause failure of an entire bridge. (The failure of a single eyebar was found to be the cause of the collapse of the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River.) Another reason is that as spans increased, engineers were unable to lift larger chains into position, whereas <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> cables can be formulated one by one in mid-air from a temporary walkway.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid {{composite}} cable with increased, {{in comparison with}} CFCC, breaking elongation and decreased, {{in comparison with the}} steel cables, dead weight could be elaborated for prestressed cable net on the base of carbon and steel. Hybrid {{composite cable}} contains three layers: carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) core, glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) distributional layer and steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands.</b> All layers of hybrid composite cable take up tension stresses, acting in the cable during exploitation. But GFRP has second function - distribution of transversal pressure of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> at CFRP core. The dependence of external pressure per unit of the surface area of the GFRP (due to the pressure of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands)</b> of hybrid composite cable on the axial force and angle of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> twisting was estimated by the engineering method of calculations. Tangential and radial stresses for GFRP and CFRP components of hybrid composite cable were obtained.

50|$|At high frequencies, current travels {{near the}} surface of the wire because of the skin effect, {{resulting}} in increased power loss in the <b>wire.</b> <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> might seem to reduce this effect, since the total surface area of the strands is greater than the surface area of the equivalent solid <b>wire,</b> but ordinary <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> does not reduce the skin effect because all the strands are short-circuited together and behave as a single conductor. A <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> will have higher resistance than a solid wire of the same diameter because the cross-section of the <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is not all copper; there are unavoidable gaps between the strands (this is the circle packing problem for circles within a circle).

5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all <b>wire</b> <b>strands,</b> and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw. Since <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> may not be contained by the screw head in a basic screw terminal, <b>stranded</b> <b>wires</b> may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|R
50|$|In comparison, the Brooklyn Bridge, with wire-cable suspension, was {{designed}} with an excess strength factor of six. Wire cables have extremely {{high levels of}} redundancy, with {{the failure of a}} single <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> almost unnoticeable. During its construction it was discovered that some rejected steel wire had been used. To compensate for the rejected steel wire already in the cables, 150 more good steel wires per cable were added to bring the total up to 5,434 redundant strands. The designer's son decided the safety factor may have been reduced, but was far more than sufficient.|$|E

5000|$|Litz wire: To reduce {{skin effect}} losses, some coils are wound {{with a special}} type of radio {{frequency}} wire called litz wire. Instead of a single solid conductor, litz wire consists {{of a number of}} smaller wire strands that carry the current. Unlike ordinary stranded wire, the strands are insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist pattern ensures that each <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> spends the same amount of its length {{on the outside of the}} wire bundle, so skin effect distributes the current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.|$|E
50|$|Technologically, the Waldo-Hancock Bridge {{represented}} {{a number of}} firsts. It {{was one of the}} first two bridges in the U.S. (along with the St. Johns Bridge in Portland, Oregon, completed in June, 1931) to employ Robinson and Steinman’s prestressed twisted <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> cables, which were first used on the 1929 Grand Mère Suspension Bridge over the Saint-Maurice River in Quebec. The prefabrication and prestressing of the cables decreased the number of field adjustments required, saving considerable time, effort, and money. As an additional experiment in efficiency, the Waldo-Hancock cables were marked prior to construction, ensuring proper setting. This method had never been used before and proved successful in this instance. These innovations, invented and pioneered by Steinman, were a significant step forward for builders of suspension bridges.|$|E

50|$|Wire ropes were {{developed}} starting with mining hoist {{applications in the}} 1830s. Wire ropes are used dynamically for lifting and hoisting in cranes and elevators, and for transmission of mechanical power. Wire rope {{is also used to}} transmit force in mechanisms, such as a Bowden cable or the control surfaces of an airplane connected to levers and pedals in the cockpit. Only aircraft cables have WSC (<b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> core). Also, aircraft cables are available in smaller diameters than wire rope. For example, aircraft cables are available in 3/64 in. diameter while most wire ropes begin at a 1/4 in. diameter. Static wire ropes are used to support structures such as suspension bridges or as guy wires to support towers. An aerial tramway relies on wire rope to support and move cargo overhead.|$|E

50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called ordinary lay rope if the lay direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a lang lay rope (formerly Albert’s lay or Lang’s lay). Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|E
