500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E

And because of that, that's why they are scared, because they don't know to what level we will go to protect, but we will protect.|$|E
2500|$|Gleizes {{first learned}} {{of the death of}} his {{brother-in-law}} and friend when a postcard on which he had written [...] "Patience, a little more patience, it is impossible that this war can endure much longer... then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> ourselves back to work..." [...] came back marked [...] "disparu". Gleizes painted two works entitled To Jacques Nayral (A Jacques Nayral) in 1914 and 1917 as an homage to the writer. These are private portraits that signify an intensely personal memorial to his closest friend and key figure who shared the hopes of the pre-war Passy group for an innovative collective artistic program.|$|E

2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013. The match was billed in advance as the toughest contest Donegal would face in Ulster, with the winner thought {{likely to become}} Ulster champions. Donegal brushed aside Tyrone with {{relative}} ease. McGuinness said afterwards: [...] "In {{the last two years}} the exact same thing was said. The only difference this year was that we were relegated [...] There was {{a lot of talk about}} putting all the eggs into one basket, but it was the same last year and the same the year before. That's what we do – it's championship football. It will be no different next year. It was a media spin that got the whole debate going.

As a child in 1937, he was admonished by his mother for leaving the house to watch Adolf Hitler pass by in a motorcade, telling him that [...] "A Jew risks a lot doing that". He would lose dozens of family members in The Holocaust, and {{maintained}} a commitment to the preservation of the Jewish religion and identity exemplified by his grandfather's having given him shreds of a Torah scroll the day after the November 1938 Kristallnacht that had been desecrated and thrown into a river during the anti-Jewish pogrom and telling Gottschalk that [...] "one day <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>put</b> them together again".|$|E
