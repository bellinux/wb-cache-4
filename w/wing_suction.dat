Several wind tunnel tests campaigns enabled to characterize the buffet aerodynamic instability and to study the efficiency of fluidic control devices designed and manufactured by ONERA.

40|$|The {{integration}} of UHBR (Ultra High Bypass Ratio) engines mounted under backward swept wings may lead {{at low speed}} to local flow separations on the <b>wing</b> <b>suction</b> side {{in the wake of}} the nacelle. These local flow separations can trigger the total wing stall which degrades the total aircraft performance. This paper presents a numerical study of AFC (active flow control) applied at the engine-wing junction of a generic full scale wind tunnel model to suppress the local flow separations. The AFC method is based on the principle of fluidic actuation and assembles a pulsed blowing with a 180 ° phase shift between the neighboring nozzles. Its working principle is the production of vortices that enhance the mixing of the boundary layer and the free stream flow. The free stream flow {{in the wake of the}} nacelle is compromised due to the wakes of local flow separations and longitudinal vortices such as the strake vortex. The computation results show that pulsed blowing is capable of suppressing the local separations. It is shown that a certain blowing velocity exists that is required for the suppression of the nacelle-wake separation. Additionally the influence of the pulse frequency was analyzed with a parameter study. It was shown that the local flow separations were suppressed by both low and high pulse frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The method {{described}} in this Report gives an approximate solution for the cross-flow velocity in an incompressible laminar boundary layer on an infinite swept wing. The cross flow is defined as that velocity in the boundary layer in a direction normal to the outer flow streamline. The two-dimensional flow in the chordwise direction is assumed known. The boundary-layer equations are expressed in a non-dimensional form. Head's method, {{which is based on}} the momentum and energy equations and is used to solve the two-dimensional flow, is briefly described. From the non-dimensional boundary-layer equations, an equation involving the cross-flow profile directly is obtained. This equation is then integrated throughout the boundary layer giving two integral equations. Typical cross-flow shapes have been used to calculate functions which when used in conjunction with the two integral equations and the boundary condition at the wall enable the cross flow to be determined for arbitrary velocity and suction distributions. The stability criterion for three-dimensional flow is expressed in the notation of this method and is a simple condition on the cross flow. The method is then applied to the upper and lower surfaces of a <b>wing,</b> <b>suction</b> distributions being calculated to maintain stability at each point of the wing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study of active flow control applied at the engine-wing junction of a generic full scale {{wind tunnel model}} representing a landing configuration to increase the high-lift performance. The use of UHBR (Ultra High Bypass Ratio) engines is currently {{one of the most}} promising approaches to further increase the efficiency of transport aircraft. However their large engine diameter also compromises the aerodynamic efficiency of airliners with engines mounted under backward swept wings. In order to keep a low ground clearance to avoid a heavy landing gear extension the large UHBR engine nacelles have to be closer coupled to the wing. This prevents the mounting of leading edge high-lift devices at the nacelle-wing junction such as slats, Krueger flaps or droop noses at the junction and leads to a local flow separation on the <b>wing</b> <b>suction</b> side in the wake of the nacelle which may trigger the total wing stall. This reduces the maximum lift coefficient which is a sizing parameter of the high-lift system. In order to reduce the size of the high-lift system and hence increase the overall aircraft efficiency this local flow separation has to be suppressed. Within the European project AfloNext (Active Flow - Loads and Noise control) the use of AFC (Active Flow Control) for the suppression of this flow separation is studied with high-fidelity numerical simulations and experimental studies with a full scale wind tunnel model.

40|$|A {{low scale}} wind tunnel {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} rolling flow {{to determine the effects}} of aspect ratio and sweep (when varied independently) on the rolling stability derivatives for a series of untapered wings. Test results indicate that when the aspect ratio was held constant, an increase in the sweepback angle caused a significant reduction in the damping in roll at low lift coefficients for only the higher aspect ratios that were tested. This result was in agreement with available swept wing theory which indicated no effect of sweep for aspect ratios near zero. The result of the linear theory that the damping in roll is independent of lift coefficient and that the yawing moment and lateral force due to rolling are directly proportional to the lift coefficient was found to be valid for only a very limited lift coefficient range when the wings were highly swept. For such wings, the damping was found to increase in magnitude and the yawing moment due to rolling, to change from negative to positive at moderate lift coefficients.

40|$|Summary. -Camber {{and twist}} {{is applied to}} the problem of {{reducing}} the drag due to incidence, of thin triangular or swept-back wings, at supersonic speeds, with subsonic leading edges and supersonic or sonic trailing edges. Two cases are considered: (i) with leading-edge suction forces ignored, (ii) with leading-edge suction forces included. It is found that twist, especially towards the wing tips, is more effective in reducing drag, for given lift, for the larger values of tan yjtan u, where y is the semi-apex-angle and ft is the Mach angle, and that camber is more effective for the smaller values, though, in general, the best results are obtained by a suitable combination of camber and twist. For triangular <b>wings,</b> with <b>suction</b> ignored, the maximum percentage drag reduction varies from about 10 per cent (for sonic leading edges) to 50 per cent (for very slender plan-forms) and, if suction forces are included, from zero (for very slender plan-forms) to about 10 per cent (when the leading edges are sonic). The effect of the swept-back trailing edge is, in general, to increase the maximum percentage drag reduction for given lift if suction forces are ignored; but to decrease the maximum reduction for smaller values of tan yjtan ft, and to increase the maximum reduction for values of tan yjtan ft near to one, if suction forces are included.

Closer to the ground, at a ride height of less than 10 % chord, downforce drops as the wing stalls.

Oscillation frequencies up to 22 Hz and amplitudes smaller than 1 ° were used. The pressure distributions suggest flow conditions that {{can be divided into}} three Regimes, depending on the mean angle of attack: I) Above 10 °, at the rear outboard part of the <b>wing,</b> the <b>suction</b> increases which is caused by a vortical flow occurring close to the surface. A strong suction peak emerges at the leading edge. II) At higher angles of attack, the strong suction peak at the leading edge breaks down, and a typical hump like pressure distribution below a vortex core is generated further downstream. This is the sign for a vortex flow further separating from the surface. Features of a vortex breakdown can be found. However, it lacks the typical signs for a transformation from a jet-like to a wake-like flow. III) Finally, the low pressure region below the vortex moves inboard and a deadwater type of flow exists at the outboard part of the wing. The unsteady pressure distributions strongly depend on the mean angle of attack. The highest unsteady pressures occur in Regimes II and III. Especially the out of phase parts drastically increase in Regime II. Furthermore, the quasi-steady effects strongly lag the motion. This means, the sign of the imaginary part of the unsteady pressure distribution is opposite to that of the real part. The lag increases with frequency.

The critical Reynolds number, R 9 L, of the attachment line boundary layer for the spanwise spread of turbulence was found to be about 100 for sweep angles in the range 40 °- 60 °.

With the aid of this bump experiments were Possible on L laminar boundary layer at Reynolds numbers above the lower critical value. A spark was used to introduce spots of turbulence into the attachment line boundary layer and the propagation speeds of the leading and trailing edges were measured. The spots expanded, the leading edge moving faster than the trailing edge, at high Reynolds numbers, and contracted at low values. The behaviour of Tollmien-Schlichting waves was also investigated by exciting the flow with sound emanating from a small hole on the attachment line. Measurements of the perturbation phase and amplitude were made downstream of the source and although accurate values of wave length and propagation speed could be found no difficulties were experienced in evaluating the amplification ratio. Nevertheless, all small disturbances decayed at a sufficient distance from the source hole up to the highest Reynolds number tested of 170...|$|R
