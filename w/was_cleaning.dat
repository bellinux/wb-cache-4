25|$|In 1976, {{she started}} working on her second series of collage images. She began working on these collages after she <b>was</b> <b>cleaning</b> out her studio and {{discovered}} some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940. After she saved a few of them, she {{decided to use the}} rest in a new series of collages. In these collages, the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint. The hard-edged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into curvilinear shapes that recall floral patterns. Texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas. Since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged without consideration of their original intention or message, the differences between the old drawings and new structures is highly exaggerated. All of the collages' titles from this series are different verb tenses which is interpreted as a critique of Greenberg's and Michael Fried's insistence on the presentness of modern art. These works are also considered as a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older. This collage series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the Pace Gallery.|$|E

500|$|His {{first job}} that {{involved}} ladders {{was given to}} him while he still worked as a joiner. [...] He was asked to point a garden wall and then the gable end of the customer's house. [...] He used several short ladders, lashed together with rope and hardboard. [...] This gave Dibnah valuable experience and his employer expanded the business to include property repairs. [...] Aged about 17–18 he climbed the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge, for a 10shilling bet. During the night he took two Union flags {{to the top and}} secured each to the lightning conductors there. The Bolton Evening News reported the incident, with a photograph of Dibnah's feat, but attributed it to the activities of students from Manchester University. At about the same time, Dibnah decided to replace the chimney stack at his mother's house on Alfred Street with one of his own design, as his mother used only one fireplace—leaving four of the five chimney pots redundant. As the single opening {{at the top of the}} new stack was only about [...] wide, the flue needed regular maintenance. On one occasion, he <b>was</b> <b>cleaning</b> the flue using a sack of bricks tied to a rope when the sack ripped open, breaking several lead pipes and flooding his mother's kitchen. After the death of his mother, the house was sold and the council placed a preservation order on the chimney, which remains to this day.|$|E
500|$|Al Milgrom, who {{was ending}} {{his career as}} a Marvel editor to go freelance, found Adams' samples as he <b>was</b> <b>cleaning</b> out his office for its future occupant, editor Carl Potts. Potts and his {{assistant}} editor, Ann Nocenti, sent Adams a Defenders script, from which Adams did layouts of 10 to 15 pages. Adams stated that while his action scenes were not rendered very well, the editors praised his casual, character-based scenes. Nocenti described to Adams the concept for a miniseries she was writing, Longshot, which had been turned down by every other artist she offered it to. Adams, now a couple of months before his twentieth birthday, did a series of preliminary design drawings, basing the main character's appearance and hairstyle on that of singer Limahl, and the female lead, Ricochet Rita, on Nocenti herself. The series was freelance-edited by Louise Simonson, and without a firm schedule, which provided Adams the time he needed to complete it. This was due in part to his problems with perspective and other things he was not accustomed to drawing, such as windmills, babies and people smiling, and in part because he had to redraw the first half of it, as Ann Nocenti's story was so dense that the pages featured up to 20 panels. As a result, Adams took eight months to draw the first issue. This problem was addressed by editor Elliot Brown, who showed Adams how to compose panels depicting multiple actions. Simonson would later introduce Adams to Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, who furthered Adams' understanding of storytelling clarity by sitting down with him and showing him the panel-to-panel structure in an old Marvel book. He would take two years to draw all six issues of the miniseries. Longshot #1 was published with a cover date of September 1985. Reviewing the first issue for Amazing Heroes, R.A.

Kampusch ran for some 200metres through gardens and a street, jumping fences, and asking passers-by to call the police, but they paid her no attention. After about five minutes, she knocked on {{the window of a}} 71-year-old neighbour known as Inge T, saying, [...] "I am Natascha Kampusch". The neighbour called the police, who arrived at 1:04pm.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his {{assigned}} work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates: Jesse Anderson and Christopher Scarver. The trio was left unsupervised in the showers of the prison gym for approximately 20minutes. At approximately 8:10a.m. Dahmer was discovered {{on the floor of}} the bathrooms of the gym suffering from extreme head and facial wounds; he had been severely bludgeoned about the head and face with a 20-inch (51cm) metal bar. His head had also been repeatedly struck against the wall in the assault. Although Dahmer was still alive and was rushed to a nearby hospital, he was pronounced dead one hour later. Anderson had also been beaten with the same instrument, and died two days later from his wounds. Scarver, who was serving a life sentence for a murder committed in 1990, informed authorities he had first attacked Dahmer with the metal bar as he (Dahmer) <b>was</b> <b>cleaning</b> a staff locker room, before attacking Anderson as he (Anderson) cleaned an inmate locker room. According to Scarver, Dahmer did not yell or make any noise as he was attacked. Immediately after attacking both men, Scarver returned to his cell and informed a prison guard: [...] "God told me to do it. Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer are dead." [...] Scarver was adamant he had not planned the attacks in advance, although he would later divulge to investigators he had concealed the 20-inch iron bar used to kill both men in his clothing shortly before the killings.|$|E
2500|$|The monarchy became {{subject to}} {{sharpened}} criticism during the financial crisis, particularly 2012 {{which became a}} kind of [...] "annus horribilis" [...] for the monarchy, as {{members of the royal family}} became increasingly seen as out-of-step with the Spanish mainstream or drawn into scandal. Queen Sofía was criticized in 2008 for inarticulately disclosing her private opinions on gay marriage in a biography publicly released that year. [...] In 2011 the king’s son-in-law Iñaki Urdangarin, Duke of Palma de Mallorca, was accused of money laundering and impropriety for using his connection to the royal family for personal financial gain. In April 2012 the king’s grandson, 13-year-old Froilán, shot himself in the foot during target practice at his father’s estate, echoing a similar but far more serious gun accident involving the king in 1956. According to historians, the then 18-year-old Juan Carlos <b>was</b> <b>cleaning</b> a revolver when he accidentally shot to death his 14-year-old brother Alfonso. Also in 2012, the monarchy was seen as out-of-touch during the financial crisis as the king went on a hunting safari in Botswana while Spanish citizens suffered crippling unemployment and austerity measures at home. Furthermore, sporting a hunting vest and rifle the king was photographed over a dead elephant propped against a tree. Despite public knowledge of the king's interest in hunting, the image this time contrasted sharply with his patronage of the Spanish branch of the conservation group World Wildlife Fund and with Spanish public opinion trending against animal hunting. Though elephant hunting is legal on the game preserve in Botswana, the World Wildlife Fund lists elephants as an endangered species, and the public outcry led to the WWF to strip the king of his honorary patronage in July, 2012. With the perceived disconnect public support of the monarchy has dropped to a new low of only 49%, according to a December 2011 Metroscopia survey.|$|E
