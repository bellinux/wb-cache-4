2500|$|Beginning in the 1850s, the {{restaurant}} hosted the annual {{gathering of the}} New England Society of New York, which featured many important speakers of the day. In 1860, Delmonico's provided the supper at the Grand Ball welcoming the Prince of Wales at the Academy of Music on East 14th Street. Supper was set out in a specially constructed room; the menu was French, and the pièces montées represented Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the Great Eastern and Flora's Vase. The New York Times reported, [...] "We may frankly say that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a public supper served in a more inapproachable fashion, with greater discretion, or upon a more luxurious scale". In 1862, {{the restaurant}} hired Charles Ranhofer, {{considered one of the}} greatest chefs of his day.|$|E
2500|$|Like James, the 1869 article [...] "Table Talk" [...] in Once a Week did {{not view}} the {{characters}} in Our Mutual Friend as realistic. The article asks: [...] "Do men live by finding {{the bodies of the}} drowned, and landing them ashore 'with their pockets allus inside out' {{for the sake of the}} reward offered for their recovery? As far as we can make out, no. We have been at some trouble to inquire from men who should know; watermen, who have lived on the river nigh all their lives, if they have seen late at night a dark boat with a solitary occupant, drifting down the river on the 'look out,' plying his frightful trade? The answer has uniformly been 'No, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> such men,' and more, they do not believe in their existence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whom {{shall we}} in future trust? Here is Sir Morton Peto, saying expressly, ‘These {{debentures}} are not debentures; I {{do not know}} what they are, but debentures they are not. I got money on them, it is true, but they are not worth anything. They are only quasi things, and the good debentures are elsewhere.’ <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the whole basis of railway credit so rudely shaken. We could not have believed that such a defence could have been offered. How is Lombard-street ever to rely on having good debentures, when it finds men of the greatest repute and the highest standing offering it documents so very like debentures, but after all not real? ... Of course the company was primarily responsible; but Sir Morton Peto was acting as their trusted financial agent, ... and therefore he must be held responsible, not of course exclusively, but conjointly with those with whom he acted." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We didn't {{know what}} to expect because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> Indiana. The only {{scouting}} report <b>we</b> <b>had</b> was a letter from a KU alumnus back there Indiana." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{refused to}} discuss the subject further, {{somewhat}} to our disappointment. For <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{a picture of the}} person referred to, and we were rather curious regarding it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it's bad for you, and I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> those people," [...] said Mrs. March. [...] "I don't believe he'll want to {{talk with}} you; but if--" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. MALAPROP <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> your son, Sir Anthony; but I hope no {{objection}} on his side.|$|E
60|$|MISS FANNY (plaintively). <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her, sir. Neither Miss Susan nor Miss Phoebe {{will present}} her to us.|$|E
60|$|We {{put on the}} {{customary}} expression of comic imbecility and beckoned the girl to us. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> this fail on the stage.|$|E
6000|$|Here {{again we}} were at fault. In all our lives <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{anything}} in the air. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> even looked there. [...] "Now," [...] continued the Stranger, [...] "I want your paper to help. I want you to join in. I {{want you to give}} publicity." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, as we {{afterward}} came to know, it is {{the custom}} among savages, that when one of their women begs {{for the life of}} a prisoner, to grant the prayer, and so it was done in this case, else <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> my master again.|$|R
60|$|Tor. Then see {{how much}} unhappy love has made us. O Leonora! Oh! We two were born when sullen planets reigned; When each the other's {{influence}} opposed, And drew the stars to factions at our birth. Oh! better, better had it been for us, That <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen,</b> or <b>never</b> loved.|$|R
60|$|When the {{sun shines}} brightly on the new snow, we {{discover}} ranges of hills, miles away towards the south, which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before.|$|E
6000|$|... "We know not, O Queen," [...] {{answered}} the physician, [...] "for {{in all our}} lives <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> its like. The flesh is suddenly wasted, and the limbs are paralysed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He must be left here, Parker,--that's {{the long}} and short of it. There is not the least fear of his being traced here; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a soul since we left Canterbury." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{drew near}} to the balcony and stood before it. At this the figure raised its head and looked at us. It was beautiful, it was young; but its {{substance}} seemed to be of an ethereal quality which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> or known of. With its full, soft eyes fixed upon us, it spoke.|$|R
6000|$|And {{when at last}} he came, {{his face}} seemed old and sad as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> it. He paused {{a moment on the}} {{threshold}} and we heard him say, [...] "I have done all that I can." [...] Then he beckoned us into the darkened room, and, for the first time, we knew Death.|$|R
6000|$|This was why <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> visited Monkshead. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> Uncle William, and {{we always}} {{thought of him as}} a sort of ogre when we thought of him at all. When we were children, our old nurse, Margaret Hannah, used to frighten us into good {{behaviour}} by saying ominously, [...] "If you 'uns aint good your Uncle William'll cotch you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{disappeared}} utterly and forever. We hunted {{high and}} low for him and offered a big reward for any information. It was useless. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> him or heard a word of him since." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> him, {{though we}} think he is about, {{for one of the}} sailors, who was going to shoot Mr. Clayton in the back, {{received}} a spear in his shoulder from some unseen hand in the jungle.|$|E
6000|$|For no {{apparent}} reason Maud Barrington evaded her aunt's gaze. [...] "You," [...] she said dryly, [...] "have forgiven one of that type a good deal already, but, at least, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> him when the fit was upon him." ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Asgaard Farm, Mountain Road, Jay, New York"And there, westward and heavenward, to {{the high}} ridge of Whiteface northward to the {{northern}} limit of the mountains, southward to their highest peaks, was spread the full half-circle panorama of the Adirondacks. It was as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the mountains before."—This Is My Own, Rockwell Kent.|$|R
60|$|We all {{confessed that}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anyone more beautiful. The {{theatrical}} yet natural character which she assumed had driven away every vestige of her depression. <b>Never</b> before <b>had</b> the child appeared so gay. Mrs. Wilbur's most insinuating remark had now no sting. The joyous present was enough; {{she would not}} believe that the future might be full of tears.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the entire}} mass of a {{magnificent}} solitary mountain {{a little to}} the northward, in general shrouded more or less in mist, and the summit of which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen,</b> was revealed, without a cloud to dim the dazzling splendour of its jagged snowy peaks, the extensive snow-fields which clothed its sides and the deep blue crevassed glaciers which filled its gorges. Robert Oliver Cunningham ...|$|R
60|$|Rebecca {{started back}} {{a picture of}} consternation. In {{the course of this}} history <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her lose her {{presence}} of mind; but she did now, and wept some of the most genuine tears that ever fell from her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Marama, {{the chief}} of Orofena. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> men like you before, if you are men. What brought you here and with you that fierce and terrible animal, or evil spirit which makes a noise and bites?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Rhoda; you see {{uncle was}} in the army, and used {{to talk to us}} about that; and, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the sea, we don't care for it as some boys do. No, we shall try and go as soldiers." ...|$|E
60|$|Hollis looked smiling {{into the}} box. He had lately made a dash home through the Canal. He {{had been away}} six months, and only joined us again {{just in time for}} this last trip. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the box before. His hands hovered above it; and he talked to us ironically, but his face became as grave as though he were pronouncing a {{powerful}} incantation over the things inside.|$|R
6000|$|The Queen-Regent was in {{the highest}} spirits. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her dignity so relax into merriment as when she set the little ones to dance {{together}} after the supper was over; but she sent them to bed early, much earlier than her sons desired. We heard his real Majesty saying to Gaspard, 'M. le Marquis, since you are King of the Bean, command {{that we should be}} like all other revelers, and sit up till morning.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Writer Tim Minear {{said the}} script for this episode was difficult, because [...] "it was Faith as <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her before. It was sort of easy when it was evil Faith, which {{was a lot of}} fun. The problem was trying to make her turn realistic." [...] He {{admitted}} to being nervous about writing Buffy's scenes because of the challenge of writing to her character and tone. He convinced Whedon to come in and write all of Buffy's scenes.|$|R
6000|$|... {17a} For ourselves, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{or heard}} a table give any {{responses}} whatever, {{any more than}} {{we have seen the}} ghosts, heard the raps, or viewed the flights of men in the air which we chronicle in a later portion of this work.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{anything}} like the stage child outside a theater excepting one--that was on the pavement {{in front of a}} tailor's shop in Tottenham Court Road. He stood on a bit of round wood, and it was fifteen and nine, his style.|$|E
60|$|The King family {{expect their}} Aunt Eliza {{to visit them}} in January. She is really our great-aunt. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her but we are told she is very deaf and does not like children. So Aunt Janet says we must make {{ourselves}} scarece when she comes.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{following}} the attacks, the Bush Administration stated that [...] "nobody {{in our government}} at least, and I don't think the prior government, could envisage flying air planes into buildings" [...] (George Bush) and that no-one [...] "could have predicted that {{they would try to}} use an airplane as a missile" [...] (Condoleezza Rice). An Air Force general called the attack [...] "something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before, something <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> even thought of." [...] FBI Director Robert Mueller announced [...] "there were no warning signs that I'm aware of." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{experimental}} feature film, Antigone/Rites Of Passion premiered at the Berlin Film Festival, and has screened internationally, {{including the}} 2004 Athens pre-Olympics celebrations; was a prize winner at the American Film Festival. The film is now distributed by Alive Mind Media, and {{is taught in}} colleges, universities and high schools across the US. Kevin Thomas writes {{of it in the}} Los Angeles Times, “Dazzling! Bold! Triumphantly ambitious and successful! An ‘Antigone’ as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> it performed in any other form before.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{trouble you}} for that ha'rpin," [...] said Miggles gravely. Half a dozen hands were eagerly {{stretched}} forward; the missing hairpin was restored to its fair owner; and Miggles, crossing the room, looked keenly {{in the face of}} the invalid. The solemn eyes looked back at hers with an expression <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before. Life and intelligence seemed to struggle back into the rugged face. Miggles laughed again,-- it was a singularly eloquent laugh,--and turned her black eyes and white teeth once more towards us.|$|R
