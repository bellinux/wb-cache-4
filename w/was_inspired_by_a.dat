5|$|Bartholdi <b>was</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> French law {{professor}} and politician, Édouard René de Laboulaye, {{who is said to}} have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples. Because of the post-war instability in France, work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s. In 1875, Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal. Bartholdi completed the head and the torch-bearing arm before the statue was fully designed, and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions.|$|E

Other than a band of Romani people, the film has a character based on Yvette Lundy, a French teacher who {{was active in the}} French resistance and deported to a concentration camp for forging passports for Romani. Gatlif had intended to make a documentary but the lack of supporting documents led him to present it as a drama.|$|E

David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game. Berg was at the game when this accident occurred; he was profoundly affected by Edwards' injury and how it overturned his life. Berg set up a similar incident in the pilot.|$|E

5|$|HMS Hotspur <b>was</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} French coast-defence ships with the ram {{as their primary}} weapon. The layout of Glatton was {{modified}} with a fixed turret and her freeboard was increased over that of the older ship.

It was nominally capable of firing forward, but this proved to damage the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red.

When Seeley started working on Revival, a friend recommended he watch They Came Back to avoid similarities. Since The Returned is inspired by the film, he and Norton watched it and became fans of the show.|$|E
5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set <b>was</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set {{to look like a}} natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E
5|$|Kwee Tek Hoay {{received}} numerous {{letters from}} fans of Allah jang Palsoe, spurring {{him to continue}} writing.

This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, <b>was</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe.|$|E
