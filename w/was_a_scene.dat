5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling two {{stories in the}} episode. The first was a traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a flashback from Henry's past. The flashback either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper case, or <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from Henry's backstory, such as {{his life in the}} Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s. Both the father-son relationship between Henry and Abe and one of the two season-long story arcs, Henry's relationship with his wife Abigail, were told through flashbacks.|$|E
5|$|Cecil {{was drawn}} to {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, but still look similar to Bob. According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are both so big. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E
5|$|Ottman {{said the}} {{challenge}} on Valkyrie {{was to create}} tension from dialogue scenes, and he often reshaped scenes to do this: moments rather than whole scenes were cut from the film. Being historically accurate meant Ottman was more restricted in reorganizing scenes, but {{he was able to}} choose what lines and close-ups he could focus on. Ottman said the scene he was most saddened to delete <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> where von Stauffenberg dances with his wife because he had been looking forward to scoring it.|$|E

5|$|Gaara's initial attire, {{along with}} the costumes of his siblings, was {{difficult}} for Kishimoto to draw on a weekly basis. Because of this, Kishimoto gave {{the three of them}} simpler costumes towards the end of Part I; Gaara received an outfit with an upright collar. In addition to being easier to draw, it was used to demonstrate the change in relationship between Gaara and Naruto following their previous fight. Kishimoto cites The Matrix, one of his favorite movies, as an inspiration for Gaara's new costume, and he considers it to be his favorite costume of the three siblings. For Part II, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> where an antagonist Deidara was sitting on Gaara's body. This shot was inspired by Akira, a manga by Katsuhiro Otomo that Kishimoto was a fan of.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

25|$|During the 1991–1995 Croatian War of Independence, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of some {{sporadic}} fighting surrounding its JNA army barracks, but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it {{was targeted}} by Serb rocket artillery in two Zagreb rocket attacks which killed seven civilians.|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd century AD, the Lazi tribe came to {{dominate}} most of Colchis, establishing {{the kingdom of}} Lazica, locally known as Egrisi. Colchis <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of the protracted rivalry between the Eastern Roman/Byzantine and Sassanid empires, culminating in the Lazic War from 542 to 562.|$|E
25|$|This lanx, {{what was}} left of it, was {{decorated}} with pastoral and hunting motifs around the edges, and at the centre <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> from a boar hunt, similar to the pagan ones on the Mildenhall bowls. On one fragment there was also a curious scene of a cherubic figure riding a lion.|$|E

25|$|After {{producers}} {{sent the}} film to the network, the producers learned that CBS's test audience requested the inclusion of two additional scenes. The first scene to be included <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> in which Don explained Charlie's reaction to their mother's chemotherapy and subsequent death due to cancer. In the original script, the explanation was never given. Heuton and Falacci added the scene for storytelling purposes. CBS wanted the audience to follow the plot without any confusion.|$|E
25|$|The second scene <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> {{toward the}} end of the episode in which Don and Charlie talk while Don prepares for the arrest. The scene was in the {{original}} script as Charlie's emotional reward and as the reformation of Don and Charlie's partnership. During production, the production crew realized that they did not have enough time to film the scene, and the scene was removed from the production schedule. After the test audience suggested its inclusion, the cast and crew filmed the scene.|$|E
25|$|Since 2007 {{the airport}} has {{occasionally}} {{been used by}} BBC motoring TV show Top Gear as the location for various stunts and experiments. The best known <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> similar to one featured in the film Casino Royale and featured both a Ford Mondeo and a Citroën 2CV parked behind the engines of a Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747-400, in an experiment to investigate whether the thrust from the aircraft's four jet engines really could lift a car off the ground.|$|E

25|$|Southland <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> {{of early}} {{extended}} contact between Europeans and Maori, notably whalers and missionaries – Wohlers at Ruapuke. In 1853, Walter Mantell purchased Murihiku from local Maori iwi, claiming {{the land for}} European settlement. Otago, of which Southland was itself part, {{was the subject of}} planned settlement by the Free Church, an offshoot of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. Settlement broadened with the discovery of gold in Central Otago in the 1860s. Today, traces of Scottish speech persist in Southland voices, with R often pronounced with a rolling burr. This is more noticeable among country people.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} year was tumultuous; it {{was marked by}} the assassination of Civil Rights Movement leader Martin Luther King Jr., subsequent King assassination riots across the nation, the assassination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses. Incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had won a landslide victory for the Democratic Party four years earlier, declined to seek re-election amid growing discontent over the Vietnam War and his worse-than-expected showing in the New Hampshire primary. The 1968 Democratic National Convention <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> of violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters as the Democrats split into multiple factions.|$|E
25|$|The {{battlefield}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> {{of widespread}} destruction, covered with dead men and animals. The Chancellor family, whose house was destroyed during the battle, placed the entire 854-acre property for sale {{four months after}} the battle. A smaller version of the house was rebuilt using some of the original materials, which served as a landmark for many of the veteran reunions of the late 19th century. In 1927, the rebuilt house was destroyed by fire. That same year, the United States Congress authorized the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, which preserves some of the land that saw fighting in the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg, the Chancellorsville Campaign, the Battle of the Wilderness, and the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House (the latter two being key battles in the 1864 Overland Campaign).|$|E

500|$|The second {{scene of}} the episode has Captain Gault beating two of his men, who had {{attempted}} to leave the freighter. Gault's actor Grant Bowler explained that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> about how far and fast things were spiralling out of control [...] the freighter … It was also {{about his ability to}} run the ship and {{that he was willing to}} go to such great lengths to keep order. It was about status, and keeping level-headed, and being in control." ...|$|E
500|$|After three romantic comedies, Siddharth Anand {{wanted his}} next film to be a romance, yet {{different}} from the usual films which were being made at the time. Anand felt he {{had run out of}} plot ideas, believing he was writing just [...] "another story". His wife Mamta then came up with the core narrative concept about [...] "two suicidal strangers meeting and falling in the love". Anand revealed that this changed his viewpoint, saying: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> that got me completely excited and we started writing immediately. It's a scene that dictates the story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{magazine}} Screen {{called the}} film [...] "a brilliantly made entertainer". Dina Thanthi wrote [...] "Not {{one would not}} have been mesmerized by the [...] "Thillana" [...] dance sequence". The British newspaper Daily Mail said Thillana Mohanambal is [...] "a feast to the eyes and ears". Subhashini Pathmanathan of Daily News Sri Lanka praised the film's dance and music sequences. Tamil Canadian journalist D. B. S. Jeyaraj wrote for Daily FT that Ganesan's [...] "...duel over artistic superiority with Padmini, particularly during the 'Nalanthaana?' song sequence" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>scene</b> that [...] "remains etched in [...] memory".|$|E
