40|$|Abstract—The speculated {{execution}} of threads in a multithreaded architecture, plus the branch prediction used in each thread execution unit, allows many instructions {{to be executed}} speculatively, that is, before it is known whether they actually will be needed by the program. In this study, we examine how the load instructions executed on what {{turn out to be}} incorrectly executed program paths impact the memory system performance. We find that incorrect speculation (<b>wrong</b> <b>execution)</b> on the instruction and thread-level provides an indirect prefetching effect for the later correct execution paths and threads. By continuing to execute the mispredicted load instructions even after the instruction or thread-level control speculation is known to be incorrect, the cache misses observed on the correctly executed paths can be reduced by 16 to 73 percent, with an average reduction of 45 percent. However, we also find that these extra loads can increase the amount of memory traffic and can pollute the cache. We introduce the small, fully associative <b>Wrong</b> <b>Execution</b> Cache (WEC) to eliminate the potential pollution that can be caused by the {{execution of}} the mispredicted load instructions. Our simulation results show that the WEC can improve the performance of a concurrent multithreaded architecture up to 18. 5 percent on the benchmark programs tested, with an average improvement of 9. 7 percent, due to the reductions in the number of cache misses.

Handoff {{is one of the}} most critical procedures in cellular systems. Network operators give emphasis to optimize handover, since it is strongly related to dropped calls, network overload and subsequently users' criticism. Handoff can be seen as a blind procedure, if it is only based on the comparison of measurements, without the information of location. Since signal propagation and pathloss are complex in nature, we can expect unnecessary and <b>wrong</b> handoff <b>executions.</b> Both UMTS and those of the second generation (GSM) systems will require redefined handoff algorithms of active connections as the smooth mobility support and continuous connection are essential issues for obtaining high performance and increasing user satisfaction.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we study hard {{real-time}} systems composed of independent periodic preemptive tasks where {{we assume that}} tasks are scheduled by using Liu & Layland's pioneering model following the Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA). For such systems, the designer must guarantee that all the deadlines of all the tasks are met, otherwise dramatic consequences occur. Certainly, guaranteeing deadlines is not always achievable because the preemption is approximated when using this analysis, and this approximation {{may lead to a}} <b>wrong</b> real-time <b>execution</b> whereas the schedulability analysis concluded that the system was schedulable. To cope with this problem the designer usually allows margins which are difcult to assess, and thus in any case lead to a waste of resources. This paper makes multiple contributions. First, we show that, when considering the cost of the preemption during the analysis, the critical instant does not occur upon simultaneous release of all tasks. Second, we provide a technique which counts the exact number of preemptions of each instance for all the tasks of a given system. Finally, we present an RMA extension which takes into account the exact cost due to preemption in the schedulability analysis rather than an approximation, thus yielding a new and stronger schedulability condition which eliminates the waste of resources since margins are not necessary...|$|R
40|$|Since their dawning, space {{communications}} {{have been}} among the strongest driving applications for the development of error correcting codes. Indeed, space-to-Earth telemetry (TM) links have extensively exploited advanced coding schemes, from convolutional codes to Reed-Solomon codes (also in concatenated form) and, more recently, from turbo codes to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The efficiency of these schemes has been extensively proved in several papers and reports. The situation is a bit different for Earth-to-space telecommand (TC) links. Space TCs must reliably convey control information as well as software patches from Earth control centers to scientific payload instruments and engineering equipment onboard (O/B) spacecraft. The success of a mission may be compromised because of an error corrupting a TC message: a detected error causing no execution or, even worse, an undetected error causing a <b>wrong</b> <b>execution.</b> This imposes strict constraints on the maximum acceptable detected and undetected error rates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Reinforcement {{learning}} algorithms {{have been}} successfully applied in robotics {{to learn how to}} solve tasks based on reward signals obtained during task execution. These reward signals are usually modeled by the programmer or provided by supervision. However, there are situations in which this reward is hard to encode, and so would require a supervised approach of reinforcement learning, where a user directly types the reward on each trial. This paper proposes to use brain activity recorded by an EEG-based BCI system as reward signals. The idea is to obtain the reward from the activity generated while observing the robot solving the task. This process does not require an explicit model of the reward signal. Moreover, it is possible to capture subjective aspects which are specific to each user. To achieve this, we designed a new protocol to use brain activity related to the correct or <b>wrong</b> <b>execution</b> of the task. We showed {{that it is possible to}} detect and classify different levels of error in single trials. We also showed that it is possible to apply reinforcement learning algorithms to learn new similar tasks using the rewards obtained from brain activity. I...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent multithreaded {{architectures}} exploit both instruction-level and thread-level parallelism {{through a}} combination of branch prediction and thread-level control speculation. The resulting speculative issuing of load instructions in these architectures can significantly impact the performance of the memory hierarchy as the system exploits higher degrees of parallelism. In this study, we investigate the effects of executing the mispredicted load instructions on the cache performance of a scalable multithreaded architecture. We show that the execution of loads from the wrongly-predicted branch path within a thread, or from a wrongly-forked thread, can result in an indirect prefetching effect for later correctlyexecuted paths. By continuing to execute the mispredicted load instructions even after the instruction- or thread-level control speculation is known to be incorrect, the cache misses for the correctly predicted paths and threads can be reduced, typically by 42 - 73 %. We introduce the small, fully-associative <b>Wrong</b> <b>Execution</b> Cache (WEC) to eliminate the potential pollution that can be caused by the execution of the mispredicted load instructions.

40|$|Aggressive superscalar {{processor}} with deep pipeline and sophisticated speculative execution techniques {{is pushing the}} power budget to its limit. It is found that {{a significant portion of}} this power is wasted during <b>wrong</b> path <b>execution</b> and non power optimal allocation of power hungry resources. Dynamic reconfiguration of micro-architectural resources can be exploited to bring down this waste at runtime. Lack of architectural method to capture the behavior of a program at runtime makes dynamic reconfiguration a challenge. In this paper we propose a method to characterize program behavior at runtime using conflict miss pattern of a data cache, which in turn identifies different program phases in terms of cache utilization. We use this phase information to enable/disable cache ways dynamically depending on the conflict miss pattern of a program. Using a hardware tracking mechanism we ensure that the program performance (throughput in terms of IPC) does not degrade beyond a tolerable limit. Through simulation we establish that an average improvement of 32 % (best case 38 %) in cache power saving is achieved at the expense of less than 2 % degradation in performance for SPEC-CPU and MEDIA benchmarks. The additional hardware that detects and captures the phase information is outside the critical path of the processor and does not contribute to the overall delay...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Trace caches {{deliver a}} high number of {{instructions}} per cycle to wide-issue superscalar processors. To overcome complex control flow, multiple branch predictors have to predict up to 3 conditional branches per cycle. These multiple branch predictors sometimes predict completely <b>wrong</b> paths of <b>execution,</b> degrading the average fetch bandwidth. This paper shows that such mispredictions can be detected by monitoring trace cache misses. Based on this observation, a new technique called trace substitution is introduced. On a trace cache miss, trace substitution overrides the predicted trace with a cached trace. If the substitution is correct, the fetch bandwidth increases. We show that trace substitution consistently improves the fetch bandwidth with 0. 2 instructions per access. For inaccurate predictors, trace substitution can increase the fetch bandwidth with up to 2 instructions per access. ...|$|R

She said it appears that the sedative and paralytic drugs failed to take effect as Steckel was seen to convulse.

40|$|The foundry {{industry}} is historically associated with bad manufacturing practices {{and is usually}} linked to poor working conditions. For this reason, the implementation of standard procedures and best practices is considered essential for companies’ survival in this business, in particular for the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Nevertheless, the companies operating in the foundry industry barely implement a change in how they work and that is even more accentuated for the SMEs. In fact, {{they do not have}} the possibility of large investments, the operators usually work without following defined instructions and there are not defined tasks because the organisational hierarchy is more flat. That is demonstrated by the lack in the literature of clear steps to follow in order to improve their business. The methodology used to develop this project, validated through an industrial case study, provides a systematic approach applicable for the implementation of manufacturing procedures within the foundry of a SME, allowing to achieve a competitive advantage. In particular, starting from a best practices research and highlighting the importance of people involvement, the thesis demonstrates the positive effects the procedures implementations, such as the minimisation of jobs reworked, their related costs and the shorter lead time to deliver the product, with the consequent achievement of a higher customer service. For the validation of the method proposed, the project has been developed in collaboration with J H Richards, a small family-run English company that produces and repairs bearings for pumps and power stations. The foundry of the organisation, in particular, is facing problems with the quantity of jobs reworked due to the <b>wrong</b> <b>execution</b> of a process. The thesis shows that with the manufacturing procedures implementation and the change of the employees’ culture, this company can achieve savings for 2. 5 % of turnover, with consequent other benefits...|$|E
40|$|Catheterization is a performance, {{that can}} be found nearly in all {{departments}} of the hospital, in old people´s homes, different institutes and last but not least also in the home environment. Many things have changed since the distant times, when a red tube was used as a catheter. The aids for catheterization are firstly manufactured so that they are so gentle as possible and secondly so that the use of them reduce the possible risks on a minimum. Moreover some types of catheters have some attributes of the modern technologies included, e. g. X-ray contrast strips or contrastive sensors for the monitoring of the inside body temperature. Even though the right execution of the performance seems to be easy, it still has its own specifics, and this is the observance of the right course of action under the high-asepticconditions. Since it is about an invasive input of the ureter to the urinary bladder, together with the <b>wrong</b> <b>execution,</b> the possibility of the undesirable complications increases, most often {{in the form of the}} infection of the urinary canal, that not only worsen the state of health, but also has the economic impacts on the medical institutes. The catheterization of a woman shall therefore be carried out only by the registered nurse or by the undergraduate nurse or the nurse with a specialist education. In this thesis I focused mainly on the execution of catheterization from the student point of view, as already there is being decided with the help of the right education, how he or she will be able to carry out this execution on his/her own (how much he or she will be reliable, on which level of knowledge and skills). The aim of this thesis was to chart the most frequent problems, that the students meet during the execution of the female catheterization and to find out, if they have the needed information and how they advise the clients during the one-time catheterization, as well as the clients with the permanent urinary catheter. In the practical part of the thesis the qualitative survey in the form of the structured conversation was used. Ten students of the second and third grade ZSF JCU, Department for nursing and midwifery, General nursing and midwifery assistant, were addressed on the base of the intentional choice. Four interviews were recorded with the help of the voice recorder, the next were noticed with the respect to the wish of the respondents only in a written form. The answers of the students were then transcribed and encoded into categories and under categories and thus with the help of the method. It has been found out from the research that the most common problem during the female catheterization mentioned by the students, is the difficult orientation in the sometimes confused field of the anatomic ratio of the genital and thus mainly in the case of older or obese female patients and and on the second place the is the difficulty of the execution by means of the observance of asepsis and the general technique of the performance, particularly if it is carried out without assistance. In the next evaluation it has been found out that the students are aware of the risks, especially in the form of an infection and they know how to minimize them. The issue of the presentation of the needed information to the female patient was evaluated as not fully sufficient, mainly in the case of the one- time catheterization...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} transistor density due to Moore's law scaling {{continues to}} drive the improvement in processor core performance with each process generation. The additional transistors are used to widen the pipeline, {{increase the size of}} the out-of-order instruction scheduling window, register files, queues and other pipeline data structures to extract high levels of instruction level parallelism and improve upon single- threaded performance. Such dynamically scheduled superscalar processor cores speculatively fetch and execute several instructions far ahead in a program, along the program path predicted by its branch predictors. During branch mispredictions, the architectural state of high performance processor cores can be restored at cost of high latency penalties, but the speculative memory requests sent by data memory access instructions on the mispredicted paths cannot be revoked. Such memory requests alter the data arrangement across memory hierarchy and result in wasted memory transactions, bandwidth and energy consumption. Even with low branch misprediction rates, these processor cores spend significant time on mispredicted program paths. In this thesis, we propose a probability based memory access controller to curb the data memory requests sent along mispredicted paths and achieve energy and memory bandwidth savings with minimum impact on performance. It computes path probability of instructions and throttles memory access instructions with low probability of execution. A deterministic or dynamically varying probability value is used as a threshold to control speculative memory requests sent to the memory hierarchy. The proposed design with a dynamic threshold reduces up to 51 % of wrong path memory accesses and maximum of 31 % of <b>wrong</b> path <b>execution</b> while achieving power savings up to 9. 5 % and maximum of 6. 3 % improvement in IPC/Watt in a single core processor system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Improving branch {{prediction}} accuracy {{is essential in}} enabling high-performance processors to find more concur-rency and to improve energy efficiency by reducing <b>wrong</b> path instruction <b>execution,</b> a paramount concern in today’s power-constrained computing landscape. Branch prediction traditionally considers past branch outcomes as a linear, continuous bit stream through which it searches for patterns and correlations. The state-of-the-art TAGE predictor and its variants follow this approach while varying {{the length of the}} global history fragments they consider. This work identifies a construct, inherent to several appli-cations that challenges existing, linear history based {{branch prediction}} strategies. It finds that applications have branches that exhibit multi-dimensional correlations. These are branches with the following two attributes: 1) they are enclosed within nested loops, and 2) they exhibit correlation across iterations of the outer loops. Folding the branch history and interpreting it as a multidimensional piece of information, exposes these cross-iteration correlations allowing predictors to search for more complex correlations in the history space with lower cost. We present wormhole, a new side-predictor that exploits these multidimensional histories. Wormhole is integrated alongside ISL-TAGE and leverages information from its existing side-predictors. Experiments show that the wormhole predictor improves accuracy more than existing side-predictors, some of which are commercially available, with a similar hardware cost. Considering 40 diverse application traces, the wormhole predictor reduces MPKI by an average of 2. 53 % and 3. 15 % on top of 4 KB and 32 KB ISL-TAGE predictors respectively. When considering the top four workloads that exhibit multi-dimensional history correlations, Wormhole achieves 22 % and 20 % MPKI average reductions over 4 KB and 32 KB ISL-TAGE. I...|$|R

When the program starts, the state will be at state - 1 (note that {{the use of the word}} ’State’ here is only for explanation in Fig. 1. State - 1 only occurs once when the program starts. During this state, start-up booting will occur as well as extracting crucial information from the knowledge base. The first goal is also obtained at this stage. Planning will occur to devise a sequence of plans to fulfill the goal. If a solution is found, the program will proceed to state 1. Otherwise, it will go to state 4, signifying a failure in finding solution. The purpose of state 1 is to obtain the next service in the plan for execution, after which will be executed at state 2. State 2 implements as the orchestrator. It first checks whether preconditions of the current activity are met or not. If not, the program will proceed to state 0, or else, the service will be executed and returns to state 1 to pick up the next service. State 0 resembles state - 1, just that it doesn’t require start up phase. The transition from state 2 to state 0 enables dynamic planning. This is important to deal with uncertain situation, where variables cannot be confirmed except during run-time. In this case, re-planning can occur at state 0 if expectation is <b>wrong.</b> After plan <b>execution,</b> state 3 will re-check whether the goal is fulfilled, upon which is yes, it will proceed to state 5.

40|$|Some opinion holders have harangued {{that being}} the largest Black Country in the world, Nigeria may be the next world power. Successive Nigerian governments have desired to have Nigeria a {{permanent}} seat on the United Nations Security Council and to be listed among world’s 20 strongest economies by 2020. Such desires have been matched with almost flawless planning but something almost always go <b>wrong</b> at the <b>execution</b> of such lofty agendas. A cursory look at Nigeria, reputed to have over 160 million population, depicts the peoples as intensely religious, worshipping varied deities and demonstrating uncommon passion and commitment to their chosen faith but divided along tribal, religious and socio-economic lines. Since exponents of religion contend that religions are intended to infuse divinity into humanity, making humans less barbaric and more humane in their relationships with one another, {{it is expected that}} there would be some cultural overflow of religious legacies into the psychosocial and political atmosphere of the country. This was certainly the case {{in the early years of}} Nigeria’s independence. This was a time of relative peace, a season devoid of armed banditry and pen robbery as we see since the 1980 s. Given the present scenario of underdevelopment of Nigeria coupled with negative image peddled about Nigerians in the diaspora and prevailing religious bigotry, it becomes expedient to review the place of Christianity (which incidentally is the foremost in terms of spread and influence) in sustainable national development in Nigeria. Globally, Christian nations seem to fair better socioeconomically and politically than others. It is also taken in Nigeria that Christians are the more educated, perhaps more exposed than other religious adherents. The Bible also list Christians as the light of the world and the salt of the earth. The premise here is that as the Church became engrossed in materialistic cares of the world system, she became an offence to God, thus persecution became a pattern more in Northern Nigeria and is fast spreading even to traditional Christian enclaves in southern Nigeria today. Darkness naturally takes centre stage whenever light recedes, so is the case of Nigeria in contemporary times. Moral conscience for which many of the tribes and races were known for has become strange to the succeeding generations. Thus, it is commonplace today for cult groups and witchcraft societies to flaunt their paraphernalia publicly, acts which were not socially acceptable in the yesteryears. To whom much is given, much is expected. If Christianity gave United Kingdom, United States of America and other western nations of the world a head start, in sustainable socio-economic and political development, over other nations of the world, Nigeria may also leverage the Christian faith for her development, which has been more of a mirage for succeeding governments. All depends on the moral courage and readiness of the Church to carve a niche for herself in the sands of time. Repentance is the key to revival and revamping Nigeria and her ailing economy. This well-articulated book, Role of the Church in Sustainable National Development, seeks to answer the question of bringing Nigeria out of the woods utilising the instrumentality of Christianity. Starting out from the place of prophecy in national development, a lot has been said concerning the place of Nigeria in God’s end time programme. It will take only a revived, purposeful and united church to make the Word of God a reality for Nigeria. Christian youths must begin to showcase Christ for others to see and come to the light of Christ. This book is a must-have for everyone who is depressed about the present state of the black man and seriously wants answers to the question, “What is the matter with the black man?” The glorious light of the gospel must begin to shine all over for the present darkness to be wiped out. The end of this age is at hand; in order not to be caught napping when Jesus Christ returns the second time, we need to set our lives, families, and indeed our country Nigeria in order...|$|R
