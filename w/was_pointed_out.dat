5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This <b>was</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> to me by somebody who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E
5|$|Between 1885 and 1908 it was {{believed}} that the signal had been sent using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 it <b>was</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that this had not been replaced until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, when it <b>was</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium {{that had the}} 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E

50|$|After a spymaster {{gives the}} hint with its word and number, their field {{operatives}} make guesses about which code name cards bear words {{related to the}} hint and <b>point</b> them <b>out,</b> one at a time. When a code name card <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card -- a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card -- as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If the assassin <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If {{an agent of the}} other team <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn simply ends; but note that this also eliminates one more potential wrong guess that the other team might have made, right before their turn. If an agent of the playing team <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the team may <b>point</b> <b>out</b> another card if they have guesses left. Again, the maximum number of guesses in any turn is the hint's number plus one.|$|R
5|$|These {{computations}} all {{assume that}} the white dwarf is non-rotating. If the white dwarf is rotating, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium must be modified {{to take into account}} the centrifugal pseudo-force arising from working in a rotating frame. For a uniformly rotating white dwarf, the limiting mass increases only slightly. If the star is allowed to rotate nonuniformly, and viscosity is neglected, then, as <b>was</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> by Fred Hoyle in 1947, there is no limit to the mass for which it is possible for a model white dwarf to be in static equilibrium. Not all of these model stars will be dynamically stable.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1888, based on specimens he had originally collected {{as far back}} as 1869, in New York state, near Sand Lake, Albany, and Port Jefferson. In his 1888 publication he indicated that he had originally listed these collections as Boletus flavidus (now known as Suillus flavidus) in his 1869 Report of the State Botanist (published in 1872). However, as <b>was</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> nearly a century later in 1986, the 1869 report does not actually mention the species; rather, Peck's field notes that year (which served {{as the basis for the}} report) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original (1888) description was most likely based. Because Peck failed to designate a type specimen, one of the Sand Lake specimens was lectotypified in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Concern was {{expressed}} at York's poor support {{towards the end}} of their third season in the Football League, and director G. W. Halliday believed the only solution was a change of ground. A major problem was the ground's relatively inaccessible location, and in early 1932, York held preliminary discussions about moving to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club. A special meeting of the shareholders was held, in which chairman Arthur Brown drew attention to gate receipts figures in Fulfordgate's three Football League seasons, which represented average crowds of 4,000 and a deficit on the balance sheet. It <b>was</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> by Halliday that within onemile (1.6km) of Bootham Crescent the population was 30,000, whereas it was only 3,000 for a similar radius of Fulfordgate. The directors were satisfied that the new ground would fulfil all requirements, although there was some opposition to the move. Two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression, and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited. Following much discussion, the decision to move to lease Bootham Crescent was approved by 115votes to 37, and Fulfordgate was sold and developed as a housing estate. Today, Eastward Avenue occupies the area where the ground once stood.|$|E

5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The common customs tariff, levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this <b>was</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out.</b> As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E
