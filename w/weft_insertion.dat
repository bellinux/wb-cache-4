40|$|Air jet weaving is {{the most}} productive, but also the most energy {{consuming}} weaving method. Increasing energy costs and environmental impact are constantly a challenge for the manufacturers of weaving machines. Current technological developments concern with low energy costs, low environmental impact, high productivity, and constant product quality. The high degree of energy consumption of the method can be ascribed to the high need of compressed air. An energy efficiency method {{is applied to the}} air jet weaving technology. Such method identifies and classifies the main relevant energy consumers and processes from the exergy point of view and it leads to the identification of energy efficiency potentials during the <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> process. Starting from the design phase, energy efficiency is considered as the central requirement to be satisfied. The initial phase of the method consists of an analysis {{of the state of the}} art of the main <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> components in order to point out a prioritization of the high demanding energy components and processes. The identified major components are investigated to reduce the high demand of energy of the <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> process. During the interaction of the flow field coming from the relay nozzles within the profiled reed, only a minor part of the stream is really accelerating the weft yarn, hence resulting in large energy inefficiency. Different tools such as FEM analysis, CFD simulation models and experimental analysis are used in order to design a more energy efficient design of the involved components in the filling insertion. A different concept for the metal strip of the profiled reed is developed. The developed metal strip allows a reduction of the machine energy consumption. Based on a parametric and aerodynamic study, the designed reed transmits higher values of the flow power to the filling yarn. The innovative reed fulfills both the requirement of raising energy efficiency and the compliance with the weaving constraints...|$|E

Through the map analysis and comparison, the relationship of changing the two components ’ material and the motion curves of sword belt were found.

This article is devoted to the derivation of boundary conditions that considerably affect the form of the balloon. In this way, a mathematically well defined model of yarn unwinding will be obtained which could be solved by using the tools of numerical mathematics. The unwinding of yarn from an optimally designed package can be simulated and this knowledge can be used to find an optimal design of packages...|$|E

Careful timing of buffering and insertion by new insertion rules for a new insertion system (NIRIS) enables the use of all parts of the conventional <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> system. FillMax allows weaving mills to increase production speed by 10 % without a corresponding increase in yarn tension, or allovvs weaving at the same speed with a significantly lowered air pressure at the main nozzles.

40|$|Abstract. In textile {{production}} the yarn {{is being}} withdrawn from cross-wound packages in warping and <b>weft</b> <b>insertion.</b> During unwinding there appear {{forces in the}} yarn that are approximately proportional to {{the square of the}} unwinding velocity. During unwind the yarn tension is not constant, but it oscillates within some interval. This is especially noticeable in over-end unwinding from a static cross wound packages, where the yarn is being withdrawn with a high velocity {{in the direction of the}} package axis. Even when the yarn is not strongly stressed, so that the tension does not exceed a few percent of the breaking strength, the yarn still can break sometimes. This is why we think that a cross-wound package is not an ideal form of a package and that such packages are not always made without flaws...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} of the multi-rapier <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> system which has been developed by the authors is descrived in this paper. 　First, the kinetic equations of the rapiers, and then the method of increasing the rapier speed are investigated. 　The results are as follows. (1) On the accelerating period, the practical velocity of the multi-rapier is very smaller than the theoretical one. This {{is due to the}} fact that the assumptions, which are used to derive the theoretical equations, can not fully satisfy the practical movement. While on the inertial moving period, the theoretical equations show the practical movement accurately. (2) The method of introducing the spring inside of the rapier reduces the disagreement between the theory and the experiment, and as the result, increases the rapier speed. 　Although in this paper the movement is investigated without the weft yarn, the result obtained here will be usefull to future practical developements of this system...|$|E
40|$|Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle <b>weft</b> <b>insertion.</b> As the package size varies when winding pirns, the varying balloon effect caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. As a number of pirns can be wound from a single supply yarn package, pirns are wound from different yarn package diameters. A significant change in take off tension takes place from pirn to pirn. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent. However, incorrect timing of compensation and stepwise compensation may create significant tension variations in pirn windings. The authors attempted to design a tension control device by applying an automatically continuously varying electromagnetic force on the dead weight, so that the variation of take off tension due to change of package diameter is compensated and investigate influence of varying supply yarn package diameter on the fmal winding tens ion of pirn...|$|E

This paper compares the effects of two different processing methods of casting vs. pultrusion on the mechanical properties, fabric-matrix bond, and microstructural characteristics of fabric-cement composites. Bonded glass mesh fabrics, woven polyvinylalcohol (PVA), as well as warp knitted <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> polypropylene (PP) fabrics were used in this study. Tensile tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites. Pullout tests were carried out to examine the bond between the fabric and the cement matrix. A microstructural analysis was conducted and correlated with the mechanical performance of the composite and bonding. The advantages of using the pultrusion process for the production of fabric-cement composites were clearly indicated in this study. Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (not impregnated in epoxy) having open junction points (not glued). This improved mechanical performance was explained due to improve bonding, obtained by the impregnation process of the fabric in the cement chamber during the pultrusion process, which helped fill the spaces between the filaments of the bundled yarns. 1...|$|E

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{in recent years in}} the use of fabrics as reinforcements for cement composites. The present paper addresses the influence of the production processes, casting and pultrusion of fabric-cement composites, on the mechanical properties of the composites, fabric-matrix bond and microstructural characteristics. Bonded glass mesh fabrics, woven polyethylene fabrics and warp knitted <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> polypropylene fabrics were studied. Tensile, flexural and fabric-matrix bond tests were conducted to study the mechanical performance of the composites. SEM observations were carried out to correlate microstructural characteristics with mechanical performance. The advantages of using the pultrusion process for the production of fabric-cement composites were clearly identified in this study. Improved mechanical performance was obtained for fabric-cement composites produced with the pultrusion process, especially with fabrics made from multifilament yarns (not impregnated in epoxy) having open junction points. This improved mechanical performance could be accounted for by the improved bonding, which was induced by the impregnation of the spaces between the filaments in the pultrusion process, and the lack of such effective impregnation is the casting process. However, in the epoxy impregnated fabric and the mono-filament fabric sufficient interfacial bonding could be obtained in the casting process and pultrusion did not yield a significant advantage...|$|E
40|$|Weaving is {{a textile}} {{manufacturing}} {{process in which}} weft yarns are inserted by machines through {{a gap in the}} warp yarns called a shed to form a woven fabric through interlacing. The filling insertion systems that are currently being used in the market have reached their maximum potential in terms of speed and production rate. There are also limitations that the current methods face such as a finite maximum width of woven fabric that can be produced which is caused by a limitation in machine width. Current weaving machines also produce too much noise pollution which may cause damage to the operator’s ears. These set maximums and limitations have led us to seek an alternative method to insert weft yarns into fabrics. In this study, electromagnetic force is being used as an alternative method for inserting weft yarn. In order to accomplish this, an electromagnetic launcher called a coil gun is used to launch a ferromagnetic projectile which would carry the weft yarn through the shed of the warp yarns in order to achieve the interlacing necessary to form a woven fabric. It is expected that this new method of <b>weft</b> <b>insertion</b> would reduce the energy costs that are associated with other weaving machines. The proposed design would be able to insert yarns at a higher rate than any o...|$|E
40|$|In Textile industry, {{production}} is mostly key concern for Industry owner. This always has attracted researchers and machines manufacturers {{to make new}} developments in process and machines. Air-jet {{is one of the}} leading and successful highest productive weaving machines. However, it is now well established that due to add of charges of compressed air, manufacturing cost of air-jet weaving machine is higher as compared with rapier and projectile weaving machines. This is why countries having energy issues do not prefer air-jet weaving machines comparing projectile weaving machines. In this regard, several researchers and machine manufacturers have continuously been working to improve the efficiency of air-jet <b>weft</b> <b>insertion.</b> However, industry practice is as important as design made by researchers. The aim of this research is to investigate the air consumption of air-jet weaving on industrial scale practice. In this study, five weaving machine of same manufacturer and model were selected. It was observed that despite of manufacturing same quality of fabric, air consumption was varying almost in all weaving machines. Conventionally, mill workers adopt hit and trial practice in weaving industry including airpressure setting which leads to variation of nozzle pressure. Main reason of disparity of air consumption in air-jet weaving machines may be variation of distance from compressor to weaving machines, number of joints, un-necessary valve opening and pipes leakages cause an increase of compressed air consumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Pirn winding is an {{operation}} of winding yarn from supply yarn package onto pirns {{which are used}} for shuttle <b>weft</b> <b>insertion.</b> Firm and coherent winding tension is required to maintain in the pirn winding process to withstand the high forces produced by the deceleration of the shuttle {{at the end of}} each pick and to avoid permanent strains in yarns which will appears as fabric defects in weaving. The package size and its diameter vary due to subsequent winding of pirns. Hence the balloon effect varies and caused to change the thread tension at the winding point of the pirn. The thread tension variation is considerably significant from the first pirn wound from a package to the last pirn wound from the same if no tension controlling mechanism is devised. Placing dead weights on the disc tension controller which adds a tension to take off tension may help to compensate the yarn tension variation to some extent to combat with this problem. However, this is a stepwise manual compensation technique which needs the correct timing of compensation to avoid significant tension variations in pirn windings. The author attempted to theoretically analyze the tension variation in the yarn path of the pirn winding machine and theoretically model the tension variation with and without deadweight placement on the tensioners. Author also verified the accuracy and the validity of the model developed through the experimental results obtained at different locations along the yarn path. ...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringYouqi WangTextile {{fabrics and}} textile {{composite}} materials demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness, high {{strength to weight}} ratio, damage tolerance, chemical resistance, high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion. Recent advances in weaving techniques have caused various textile fabrics to gain applications in high performance products, such as aircrafts frames, aircrafts engine blades, ballistic panels, helmets, aerospace components, racing car bodies, net-shape joints and blood vessels. Fabric mechanical properties are determined by fabric internal architectures and fabric micro-geometries {{are determined by the}} textile manufacturing process. As the need for high performance textile materials increases, textile preforms with improved thickness and more complex structures are designed and manufactured. Therefore, the study of textile fabrics requires a reliable and efficient CAD/CAM tool that models fabric micro-geometry through computer simulation and links the manufacturing process with fabric micro-geometry, mechanical properties and weavability. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation is developed to simulate the entire textile process. It employs the digital element approach to simulate weaving actions, reed motion, boundary tension and fiber-to-fiber contact and friction. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation models a Jacquard loom machine, in which the weaving process primarily consists of four steps: <b>weft</b> <b>insertion,</b> beating up, weaving and taking up. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation simulates these steps according to the underlying loom kinematics and kinetics. First, a weft yarn moves to the fell position under displacement constraints, followed by a beating-up action performed by reed elements. Warp yarns then change positions according to the yarn interlacing pattern defined by a weaving matrix, and taking-up action is simulated to collect woven fabric for continuous weaving process simulation. A Jacquard loom machine individually controls each warp yarn for maximum flexibility of warp motion, managed by the weaving matrix in simulation. Constant boundary tension is implemented to simulate the spring at each warp end. In addition, process simulation adopts re-mesh function to store woven fabric and add new weft yarns for continuous weaving simulation. Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation fully models loom kinetics and kinematics involved in the weaving process. However, the step-by-step simulation of the 3 D weaving process requires additional calculation time and computer resource. In order to promote simulation efficiency, enable finer yarn discretization and improve accuracy of fabric micro geometry, parallel computing is implemented in this research and efficiency promotion is presented in this dissertation. The Dynamic Weaving Process Simulation model links fabric micro-geometry with the manufacturing process, allowing determination of weavability of specific weaving pattern and process design. Effects of various weaving process parameters on fabric micro-geometry, fabric mechanical properties and weavability can be investigated with the simulation method...|$|E
