5|$|Then for {{the next}} week or two Mariah <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> and say, 'What {{do you think about this}} bit?' We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
25|$|Davydova {{was born}} in Voronezh, 500 {{kilometres}} south of Moscow. She became interested in gymnastics at age six after seeing on television the famous Soviet Olympic gold medallists Larisa Petrik and Natalia Kuchinskaya. She practicised the splits {{to see if she}} also could do them. Deciding {{she wanted to be a}} gymnast Elena went by herself to be enrolled in Voronezh's famous Spartak Gymnastics school, yet was turned away, as she was very small, and considered at the time to have the wrong physique for the sport."They <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Kolobok after the little fairytale pancake". Rather than giving up however, she secretly watched the lessons through windows and tried to imitate in the schoolyard what she had observed."My Mom wanted me to do Piano and I would run away from it to do gymnastics".|$|E
500|$|The Blue Jays drafted Loup in {{the ninth}} round of the 2009 Major League Baseball Draft. Loup had shown a strong {{performance}} when he was playing for the Tulane Green Wave and was the second Green Wave player to be drafted. Loup said of the event, [...] "I had 20 people text message me before I even heard anything and then my phone rang and I got the call. It's exciting. They told me they <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> {{as soon as the}} draft was over and we would discuss details, so hopefully everything will shake out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't that offend you even?" [...] said Danville, with an insolent smile. [...] "You have a {{wonderful}} temper--any other man <b>would</b> have <b>called</b> <b>me</b> out!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{felt the}} blood rush through {{me like a}} storm; {{bitterness}} and burning anger took hold of my heart. [...] "What hast thou to say, Cleopatra?" [...] I answered boldly. [...] "Where is thy vow, sworn on the dead heart of Menkau-ra, the ever-living? Where now thy challenge to this Roman Antony? Where thy oath that thou <b>wouldest</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> 'husband' {{in the face of}} Egypt?" [...] and I choked and ceased.|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Pendennis is {{with his}} {{regiment}} in India, mother," [...] Mr. Pendennis remarked, [...] "and, if you please, I wish you <b>would</b> not <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Johnny before the young man--before Mr. Parkins." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Pitchfork Media, record {{producer}} Larry Crane {{reported on}} his Tape Op message board {{that he had}} planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote, [...] "I hadn't talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [...] and asked if I'd like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [...] I said 'yes, of course', and chatted with Elliott {{for the first time in}} ages. It seems surreal that he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, 'I don't understand, he was so healthy.|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
2500|$|Stack says {{he became}} {{involved}} in politics through his parents, who took him to political rallies in Union City. The Stacks were active in their community, as their apartment was a hospitable place that was likened to [...] "a stop for tenants and neighborhood people seeking assistance or advice." [...] It was with his parents that Stack first began {{to participate in the}} practice of providing turkeys and holiday gifts to the needy, a practice that Stack would later institute as Mayor As Stack explained to a reporter when he was 19, [...] "I remember when I was about 6 or 7 years old being at the Doric Temple polling place on election day just sitting and listening to the local politicians. I would probably say I dedicated my high school years to politics when I guess I should have been more into school activities. My classmates <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> 'mayor'. But I always believed it's vitally important for young people to get involved. We are the future." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{a certain}} amount of dogma in the way," [...] he answered. [...] "I should make but a poor Churchman. They <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a free-thinker. Besides, I wanted my independence." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If I was {{to marry}} a white man and he <b>would</b> dare <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a 'squaw'—as an epithet with the sarcasm that we know so well—I believe that I would feel like killing him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} {{that you did}} not <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Bimbashi, Captain Keppel. The title is ridiculous for me, and it was only given me that it might be useful when with Egyptian or Soudanese soldiers. I should feel really obliged, if you <b>would</b> simply <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Hilliard.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the trial}} in November 1929, Shuler's lawyer cross-examined Cryer about {{allegations}} that he [...] "pitched dice at in Farmer Page's place," [...] and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor. [...] Cryer testified {{that he had a}} personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to [...] "realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position." [...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] I had to take the telephone out of my house so I could get a little sleep. [...] I used to come home at nights from a banquet or something and people <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning -- some of them apparently insane." ...|$|E

60|$|I should {{prefer that}} you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> nothing at all. I have {{absolutely}} no wish to know you.|$|E
6000|$|If {{but some}} vengeful god <b>would</b> <b>call</b> to <b>me</b> From up the sky, and laugh: [...] "Thou {{suffering}} thing, Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy, That thy love's loss is my hate's profiting!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} <b>would</b> not <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Lady Beaumaris. That may be, and indeed perhaps is, {{necessary}} in society, {{but when we}} are alone, I prefer being called by a name which once you always and kindly used." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Pau Amma said, 'I do {{not choose}} yet. Look! {{there is that}} girl who saw me running away at the Very Beginning. If she had spoken then, the Eldest Magician <b>would</b> have <b>called</b> <b>me</b> back, and all this would never have happened. What will she do for me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} else, I expect," [...] said Miss Ward, with a smile. [...] "Good-bye. I want to {{get back}} before he wakes up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hate gallantry; {{it is all}} bosh. I wish I were a man, {{and that}} I could call you Bertram, and that you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> Cox." ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Everybody <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> a brute if I told Ann {{the truth}} about herself {{in terms of her}} own moral code. To begin with, Ann says things that are not {{strictly}} true.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you knew}} how I hated that word!" [...] she murmured. [...] "I may never see you again, you know, after this evening, {{so it really}} does not matter--but <b>would</b> you mind <b>calling</b> <b>me</b> Adelaide?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "DEAR SIR: Having remarked {{with some}} {{interest}} the verdict for a [...] client of yours against the United Northeastern Railroads, I wish [...] you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> and see <b>me</b> at your earliest convenience.|$|R
60|$|In {{the other}} I told Harry {{all that had}} passed, asking him to {{transmit}} {{as much as he}} thought proper to Lee, and then awaited developments. The first result was a note from storekeeper Moran saying that as he was looking up orders for implements he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> on <b>me,</b> which he did presently, and proceeded to discuss the matter with frankness.|$|R
6000|$|Austin met {{his gaze}} steadily, though the flush {{was still in}} his face. [...] "I {{scarcely}} think anybody <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> an enterprising business man, that is, at least, from the conventional English point of view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> out for it, I suppose, had I the {{advantage}} of being a man--You may do so as it is, if you like it--I can shoot flying, as well as leap a five-barred gate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Kauffman, who {{was lying}} on a couch {{in a corner of}} the office, turned his face and bravely smiled. [...] "I'm glad," [...] he weakly replied. [...] "I was afraid they <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> to the stand again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! {{would you}} have us remain together, hating each other, vilifying each other, calling each other base names as you just now <b>called</b> <b>me?</b> And {{do you think that}} we could still be man and wife? No, Sir Henry. I have made one great mistake--committed one wretched, fatal error. I have so placed myself that I must hear myself so called and bear it quietly; but I will not {{continue}} to be so used. Do you think he <b>would</b> have <b>called</b> <b>me</b> so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|For some unaccountable reason, in this infernal impasse my spirits {{began to}} rise, to soar. I declare it: I led Flora {{forward to the}} set with a gaiety {{which may have been}} unnatural, but was {{certainly}} not factitious. A Scotsman <b>would</b> have <b>called</b> <b>me</b> fey. As the song goes--and it matters not if I had it then, or read it later in my wife's library-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear sisters," [...] he began, in Italian, [...] "I {{received}} your note before I {{went out}} this morning, {{telling me that}} you were here, and <b>would</b> <b>call</b> upon <b>me</b> after mass. I was indeed glad to hear of your coming. It is three years now since I last saw you. It was in a humbler lodging than this that you then visited me." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{other times}} he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> up with the simple message, [...] "Q is here," [...] or would send me a telegram, or a written note saying, [...] "Q needs money; bring any that you have, but no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{it to be}} borne, brother," [...] {{answered}} Gudruda, [...] "that the man who <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> wife {{should be}} named Ospakar the Niddering? When that shame is washed away, and then only, can I think on marriage. I will never be Niddering's bride!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] I said; [...] "I {{have given}} up writing, {{at least for the}} present. I wish I could make you {{understand}} how glad I am to call you sister, and how it would joy my heart if you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With pleasure, Roland. I have an {{outstanding}} engagement with you, you know, and I have been hoping that you <b>would</b> <b>call</b> and remind <b>me</b> of it; in fact I made so sure you would, that I considered myself engaged and refused two invitations yesterday." ...|$|R
5000|$|He became Bubba when he {{was born}} and his 15-month-old sister, Charmin, could not say [...] "brother". The name stuck.

6000|$|...
