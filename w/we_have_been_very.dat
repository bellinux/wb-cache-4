500|$|After the ceremony, Melua stated {{her pride}} at her newest nationality. [...] "As a family, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{fortunate}} {{to find a}} happy lifestyle {{in this country and}} we feel we belong. We still consider ourselves to be Georgian, because that is where our roots are, and I return to Georgia every year to see my uncles and grandparents, but I am proud to now be a British citizen".|$|E

"We {{always said}} we would suspend players if they reoffended and Ben has reoffended by missing training, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{consistent}} with that … We believe he's breached his contract and acted unprofessionally and that's why he's been suspended and that's why we're giving him every opportunity to fix up his personal and private issues." ...|$|E

6000|$|She hesitated; I {{thought she}} was perhaps {{going to say that}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> base. But she remarked after a moment, in a candid, {{wondering}} way, [...] "How much you must want them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{get along}} famously," [...] she said, [...] "and, perhaps, it won't be many months before {{it will be}} {{possible}} to get enough ahead so we can venture to the city. I am going to open an account at the store in your name, for what little cash <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> nearly exhausted." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{said that}} no doubt it <b>was</b> partly that. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> close {{associates}} in the West Indies from where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> returned together, {{and he had a}} notion that I could be depended on, too. But mainly, I suppose, it was from taste. And there was in him also a fine carelessness as to what he did and a love of venturesome enterprise.|$|R
60|$|Jerome. Oh, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> busy. You know we {{are going}} to put up new buildings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> remiss," [...] apologized Nasmyth, {{when they}} joined her. [...] "Still, we didn't know, {{and we had}} some {{business}} to talk about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so, Dias. We did {{not come}} out here to fight. So far <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> fortunate, and have not had to fire a shot, except at those wretched savages." ...|$|E
5000|$|Had he been an SAS member, {{he would}} not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allowed {{to operate in the}} way he did. Before his death <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{concerned}} at the lack of checks on his activities. No one seemed to know who his boss was, and he appeared to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> allowed to get out of control, deciding himself what tasks he would do. Connor ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, <b>we</b> really <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{uneasy about}} him,' said Lady Marney, 'but the last bulletin,' she added, with a smile, 'announces a tooth.' ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly we sighted {{the three}} girls standing, with a fourth sister, {{in front of}} a shop on the wide selvage of the roadway. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> merry with them a little while ago, to be sure. But what was the {{etiquette}} of Origny? Had it been a country road, of course <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> spoken to them; but here, under the eyes of all the gossips, ought we to do even as much as bow? I consulted the Cigarette.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{think that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> considerate, Mr. Brooks," [...] Selina remarked, with an {{engaging}} smile. [...] "We gave up our usual dinner this evening as papa {{had to leave}} so early." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{must say}} I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{comfortable}} here, under Mr. Snape,' said Charley. But if Mr. Snape is to go, why the office {{certainly would be}} deuced dull without him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bad {{news came}} in {{yesterday}} evening, {{and we should}} have come straight over if it had been possible, but Mr. Mitford would not let us leave till morning. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> anxious about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> poor, but <b>we</b> {{should not}} <b>have</b> starved. I had my fellowship, and I {{could have taken}} pupils. I <b>am</b> sure <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> happier. And then--" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> never <b>been</b> <b>very</b> numerous, but we {{can claim}} at least to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{faithful}} to maintaining the continuity of our aims" [...] (cited from upcoming book on NZ Howard League.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{did n't you}} let us {{help you}} in the beginning? <b>We</b> should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> glad to, I 'm sure," [...] put in Mrs. Shaw, who quite burned {{to be known as}} a joint patroness with Mrs. Davenport.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] she said, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> frivolous. I agreed to dine {{with you that}} we might speak {{together}} of this unfortunate person, Leslie Guest. You saw him last night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three {{hours are}} too much,--as {{interrupting}} our happiness. But {{as she is}} here, and as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> intimate for many years, and as she herself has named the time, I have not liked to contradict her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Aunt Jane, I {{would not}} break you down if I could help it. I have {{struggled}} so hard,--simply {{that you might}} be freed from me. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> foolish, both of us; but I would bear all the punishment,--if I could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] replied Achmet, [...] "would {{have little}} power to please if the jewels were not {{numerous}} and costly. But happily our treasury can afford it, although <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>been</b> <b>very</b> successful in war of late." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. PEARCE. No, sir. <b>We</b> shall <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> {{particular}} {{with this}} girl as to personal cleanliness.|$|R
2500|$|The current {{notion of}} Chinese {{philosophy}} {{as an academic}} field of study first appeared during the 20th century. In 1918, Hu Shih published [...] "An Outline of the History of Chinese philosophy". In the preface of this book, Chinese educator Cai Yuanpei wrote: There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> no systematic recording of classical Chinese learning. All <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> pedestrian accounts. If we wish to compose a systemic account of classical learning, the studies :of Antiquity are of no help, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> no other way but follow the criteria of histories of philosophy in the West. In other words, only those who have studied {{the history of western}} :philosophy can determine the appropriate form of exposition.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Constantine was too {{agitated}} to speak, but Louis said, 'I {{am glad to}} see you again. Hearing a noise, a {{few minutes}} ago, I came out to learn what it could be. I found you absent, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> much alarmed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, nothing;--very little, that is. But Bella {{has spoken}} to me. Oh, mamma, I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> wrong in this. That is, I have been wrong. I feel as though I should disgrace myself, and turn the whole party here into a misfortune." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{have come}} up to stay here till you are better, as {{you seem to have}} no other woman friend who cares whether you are dead or alive. I am living quite near. I am glad you have got round the corner. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> anxious.' ...|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN [desperately] I daresay <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the <b>very</b> {{imperfect}} {{children of}} a very perfect mother; but I do beg you to let me alone for once, and {{tell me about this}} horrible business of my father wanting to set me aside for another son.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} I should know him again," [...] the child said, [...] "though I only saw {{him for a}} moment. We <b>are</b> <b>very</b> much obliged to you, boy, papa and me, because it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> mamma's locket, and <b>we</b> should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> sorry to <b>have</b> lost it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We had {{a passing}} fancy for one another, and that {{satisfied}} {{there was nothing}} more to keep us together. <b>We</b> should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> foolish not to break the chain; if you had not done so, I should have. With your woman's intuition, you saw that and forestalled me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother, Major Pendennis, {{has often}} {{mentioned}} your name to us," [...] the widow said, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> much amused {{by some of}} your droll books, sir," [...] Helen continued, who never could be brought to like Mr. Wagg's books, and detested their tone most thoroughly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps. It {{is just a}} {{fortnight}} since, and I felt a strange shudder and chill as I was talking. But it may be nothing; only keep Mite away till I have seen Trotman. My Mary, don't look like that! It may be nothing, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> happy--thank God.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, let me {{warn you}} to keep your distance," [...] said Dick sternly. [...] "If you don't, you'll regret it. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> easy {{with you in the}} past, but if you go too far, I, for one, will be for putting you where your father is, in prison." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, some people {{questioned}} the intentions behind the Monroe Doctrine. Diego Portales, a Chilean businessman and minister, {{wrote to a}} friend: [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> careful: for the Americans of the north the United States, the only Americans are themselves".|$|R
6000|$|Towards midnight {{the people}} had wrought {{themselves}} up to a frenzied condition, and made so much noise {{that we could not}} sleep. In the midst of the uproar Makarooroo, who <b>we</b> observed <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> restless all the evening, rushed into our hut, exclaiming, [...] "Massa! massa! come, save my Okandaga! come quick!" ...|$|R
40|$|We were dismayed {{and deeply}} {{concerned}} to learn, from the Editor’s note to Professor Cooper’s letter, 1 that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> characterised as holding a pro-choice position in our commentary on Fergusson et al’s paper. 2 This was {{not mentioned in}} the commissioning process and, if it <b>had</b> <b>been,</b> the invitation would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> declined. Our commentary acknowledged a range of opinions among ourselves. Our arguments were based on an analysis of Fergusson et al’s paper, explicitly eschewing any partisan approach, and stating quite clearly that the debate on the rights and wrongs of abortion is primarily moral, legal and ethical rather than psychiatric or indeed scientific. <b>We</b> hoped <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> clear in this approach, and most strongly reject any suggestion that our commentary was based in beliefs from either ‘side of the debate’...|$|R
