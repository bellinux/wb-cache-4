40|$|Ascending auctions offer agents {{the option}} to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> before {{deciding}} to drop out. We show that in contexts where as time proceeds agents get finer and finer estimates of their valuations, incentives to drop out at one’s expected valuation are weak: it is optimal for agents to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> We first illustrate the claim in a private value setting. We next analyze an interdependent value setting in which this <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> option results in an imperfect information aggregation. We also analyze the implications for the seller’s revenue, and show that the ascending format may dominate the second-price format, independently of the date at which the second price auction is run.

40|$|QuestionWhat is {{the effect}} of {{physiotherapy}} compared with a <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> approach or corticosteroid injections for tennis elbow?DesignRandomised controlled trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding, and intention-totreat analysis. SettingCommunity setting in Australia. Participants 198 respondents to advertisements of the trial, aged 18 to 65 years, with a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow of a minimum six weeks’ duration, who had not received any treatment of the elbow by a health practitioner in the previous six months. InterventionsOn entering the study all participants were given an information booklet outlining the disease process and providing practical advice on self management and ergonomics. Participants were randomised to physiotherapy, corticosteroid injections, or <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> The physiotherapy group received eight treatments of 30 minutes over six weeks, consisting of elbow manipulation (mobilisation with movement) and therapeutic exercise. They were also taught home exercises with a resistant exercise band and self manipulation. The corticosteroid injection group received an injection of 10 mg of triaminolone acetonide in 1 mL of lidocaine, plus a repeat injection after two weeks if necessary. The <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> group received reassurance that the condition would settle and advice to remain active without aggravating their pain. OutcomesGlobal improvement (those who rated themselves as ‘completely recovered’ or ‘much improved’ were considered to be successes), grip force, and an assessor's rating of severity measured at six and 52 weeks. ResultsAt six weeks follow-up 78 % of the participants reported success with injections compared with 65 % for physiotherapy [relative risk reduction (RRR) 0. 4 (99 % CI − 0. 2 to 0. 9) ] and 27 % for <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> [RRR 0. 7 (99 % CI 0. 4 to 0. 9) ]. At 52 weeks, the injection group participants were significantly worse on all primary outcomes compared with the physiotherapy group [RRR for success 0. 3 (99 % CI 0. 1 to 0. 5); number needed to treat = 4] and on two out of the three measures compared with <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> [RRR for success 0. 3 (99 % CI 0. 04 to 0. 4) ]. Physiotherapy performed significantly better than <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> at six weeks for all outcome measures; however, by 52 weeks no difference existed on any primary outcome measure, as most participants were successes. Recurrences after injection were significantly greater than in the physiotherapy [RRR 0. 9 (99 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 1) ] or <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> [RRR 0. 9 (99 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 1) ] groups, which were not significantly different from each other [RRR 0. 2 (99 % CI – 1. 4 to 1. 7) ]. Patients who received physiotherapy also sought significantly less other treatment. ConclusionRecurrence rates were higher and recovery delayed in the mid to long term after corticosteroid injection compared with physiotherapy or <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> Physiotherapy was superior to injection after 52 weeks <b>and</b> to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> at six weeks...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} physiotherapy compared to both a <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> approach <b>and</b> corticosteroid injections over 52 weeks in tennis elbow. Design: Single blind randomised controlled trial Setting: Community setting, Brisbane, Australia Participants: 198 participants aged 18 to 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow of a minimum six weeks duration, who had not received any other active treatment by a health practitioner in the previous six months. Interventions: Eight sessions of physiotherapy versus corticosteroid injections or <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see.</b> Main outcome measures: Global improvement, grip force and assessor's rating of severity measured at baseline, 6 and 52 weeks. Results: Corticosteroid injection showed significantly superior effects at six weeks, but with high recurrence rates thereafter (47 / 65 of successes subsequently regressed), and significantly poorer outcomes {{in the long term}} when compared with physiotherapy. Physiotherapy was superior to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> in the short term; no difference was seen at 52 weeks, when most participants in both groups reported a successful outcome. Participants who had physiotherapy sought less additional treatment, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, than did participants who had <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> or injections. Conclusion: Physiotherapy combining elbow manipulation and exercise has a superior benefit to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> in the first six weeks and to corticosteroid injections after six weeks, providing a reasonable alternative to injections in the to mid to long term. The significant short term benefits of corticosteroid injection are paradoxically reversed after six weeks with high recurrence rates, implying that this treatment should be used with caution in the management of tennis elbow.
