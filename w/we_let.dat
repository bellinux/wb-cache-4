25|$|The {{extension}} property makes β a functor from Top (the {{category of}} topological spaces) to CHaus (the category of compact Hausdorff spaces). If <b>we</b> <b>let</b> U be the inclusion functor from CHaus into Top, maps from βX to K (for K in CHaus) correspond bijectively to maps from X to UK (by considering their restriction to X {{and using the}} universal property of βX). i.e. Hom(βX, K) = Hom(X, UK), which means that β is left adjoint to U. This implies that CHaus is a reflective subcategory of Top with reflector β.|$|E

25|$|Discussions about Fahrenheit 451 often {{center on}} its story {{foremost}} {{as a warning}} against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, {{he was concerned about}} censorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956, Bradbury said:I wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if <b>we</b> <b>let</b> ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.|$|E

Donahue described the audition as Myrick and Sánchez posing her the question: [...] "You've served seven years of a nine year sentence. Why should <b>we</b> <b>let</b> you out on parole?" [...] to which Donahue was required to improvise a response. Joshua Leonard, also in response to audition calls through Backstage, claimed he was cast in the film due to his knowledge of how to run a camera, as there was not an omniscient camera filming the scenes.|$|E

500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. <b>We</b> <b>let</b> a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour.

500|$|Fellow judge James L. Oakes {{described}} Medina as a {{fair and}} reasonable judge, and wrote that [...] "after the judge saw what the lawyers were doing, he gave {{them a little bit}} of their own medicine, too." [...] Legal scholar and historian Michal Belknap writes that Medina was [...] "unfriendly" [...] to the defense, and that [...] "there is reason to believe that Medina was biased against the defendants", citing a statement Medina made before the trial: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>let</b> them do that sort of thing , they'll destroy the government". According to Belknap, Medina's behavior towards the defense may have been exacerbated by the fact that another federal judge had {{died of a heart attack}} during the 1943 trial involving the Smith Act. Some historians speculate that Medina came to believe that the defense was deliberately trying to provoke him into committing a legal error with the goal of achieving a mistrial.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 12 July, Hitler summoned Kluge and Manstein to his {{headquarters}} at Rastenburg in East Prussia. Two days earlier, the Western Allies had invaded Sicily. The threat of further Allied landings in Italy or along southern France made Hitler believe it was essential to move forces from Kursk to Italy and to discontinue the offensive. Kluge welcomed the news, as {{he was aware that}} the Soviets were initiating a massive offensive against his sector, but Manstein was less welcoming. Manstein's forces had just spent a week fighting through a maze of defensive works and he believed they {{were on the verge of}} breaking through to more open terrain, which would allow him to engage and destroy the Soviet armoured reserves in a mobile battle. Manstein stated, [...] "On no account should <b>we</b> <b>let</b> go of the enemy until the mobile reserves he [...] committed [...] completely beaten." [...] Hitler agreed to temporarily allow the continuance of the offensive in the southern part of the salient, but the following day he ordered Manstein's reserve – the XXIV Panzer Corps – to move south to support the 1st Panzer Army. This removed the force Manstein believed was needed to succeed.|$|E
