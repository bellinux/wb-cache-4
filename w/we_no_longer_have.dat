Hodgson's barrister at the 1982 trial, Robin Grey QC, was there to shake his hand as he was released. Grey said: [...] "As a human being I feel glad that <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> capital punishment.

500|$|After {{two centuries}} in which Monteverdi {{had been largely}} {{forgotten}} as a composer of opera, interest in his theatrical works revived in the late 19th century. A shortened version of Orfeo was performed in Berlin in 1881; {{a few years later}} the Venice score of L'incoronazione was rediscovered, leading to a surge of scholarly attention. In 1905, in Paris, the French composer Vincent d'Indy directed a concert performance of L'incoronazione, limited to [...] "the most beautiful and interesting parts of the work." [...] D'Indy's edition was published in 1908, and his version was staged at the Théâtre des Arts, Paris, on 5 February 1913, the first recorded theatrical performance of the work since 1651. The work was not received uncritically; the dramatist Romain Rolland, who had assisted d'Indy, wrote that Monteverdi had [...] "sacrifice freedom and musical beauty to beauty of line. Here <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the impalpable texture of musical poetry that we admire in Orfeo." ...|$|E

However, much of their land has already been registered {{in the name of}} multinational corporations, logging companies and other wealthy Filipinos, many of whom are, relatively speaking, recent settlers to Mindanao. Mai Tuan, a T'boli leader explains, [...] "Now that there is a peace agreement for the MNLF, we are happy because we are given food assistance like rice … we also feel sad because <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the pots to cook it with. <b>We</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> control over our ancestral lands." ...|$|E

Lee Dorrian described the band's planned retirement as a [...] "funeral" [...] for the band, which was a [...] "long and gratifying process". For Dorrian, the announcement enabled the band to record the album without pressure, [...] "as it meant that <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> anything to prove and could make this album purely on our own terms".|$|R

2500|$|Soon after {{becoming}} SACLANT, McCormick traveled to every NATO capital seeking pledges of contributions from allied navies. He {{hoped that the}} European allies could begin by preparing to secure their own national waters {{in the event of}} war, but quickly found that the smaller nations viewed SACLANT as a concern primarily for the United States, Britain, and Canada, the major NATO seapowers. He complained to the NATO Standing Group that Europe treated his appointment as an excuse for complacency: [...] "Now that SACLANT is appointed, <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> any naval worries, he will take care of everything for us...we need not do anything now." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1922-1923, as a nationalist, anti-democratic and anti-Semitic student {{movement}} centered around Corneliu Zelea Codreanu gained ascendancy, {{he was not}} at the forefront of its radical promoters, but rather figured among a group of moderate, respectable academic supporters who countenanced the agitators and lent them an air of general acceptance. In March 1923, he wrote an article applauding the 15,000 {{student movement}} participants; praising the cohesion they showed, rare for Romania, he claimed they represented [...] "a healthy and spontaneous reaction of the national preservation instinct". Addressing students from Bukovina, he called the numerus clausus something all those who wished the country well would endorse, for [...] "in our country [...] gained with so many sacrifices, <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> air to breathe; the invasion of the foreign element stifles us, chokes us".|$|E
25|$|Harold Le Druillenec, {{brother of}} Louisa May Gould, {{was arrested on}} 5 June 1944 for trying to help an escaped Russian {{prisoner}} of war and having a radio, his sentence took him to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp for ten months {{and he was the}} only British survivor from that camp. He commented that: All my time here was spent in heaving dead bodies into the mass graves kindly dug for us by 'outside workers' for <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> the strength for that type of work which, fortunately, must have been observed by the camp authorities. Jungle law reigned among the prisoners; at night you killed or were killed; by day cannibalism was rampant.|$|R
5000|$|Lamason recalled: [...] On {{the night}} of the raid our bomber was spotted by a German fighter, which locked on to it. I decided to turn and fight him. Within seconds an {{incendiary}} round hit a wing and caught the fuel tank. I gave the order to bail out as the gas torched. But Robbie, our mid-upper gunner, kept on firing. When he eventually did jump, <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> enough height. I saw his parachute open, but too late. He must have died on impact. I pushed the navigator out and managed to jump clear at the last minute. Along with his English navigator, Flying Officer Ken Chapman, Lamason was picked up by members of the French Resistance and hidden at various locations for seven weeks.|$|R
60|$|We came {{finally to}} the point of calling at every house where any crops lay ungathered, desperately in hope of {{securing}} something to do. At last there came a time when <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> money for a bed, and were forced to sleep wherever we could find covert. One night we couched on the floor of an old school-house, the next we crawled into an oat-shock and covered ourselves with straw. Let those who have never slept out on the ground through an August night say that it is impossible that one should be cold! During all the early warm part of the night a family of skunks rustled about us, and toward morning we both woke because of the chill.|$|R
2500|$|Hitchens has criticised {{human rights}} {{laws and the}} European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), citing that [...] "habeas corpus, the answerability of the {{sovereign}} to the law, jury trial, the right to silence, the rule against double jeopardy, the prohibition of torture, the freedom to bear and keep arms, the inviolability of property, the prohibition of search or arrest without proper warrant, the enforcement of open trials" [...] are things [...] "worth having", while the ECHR is [...] "a counterfeit currency of fake liberty. And worse, it is a licence for judicial interference". Also, he believes that [...] "‘Human Rights’ not only don’t protect us...they {{can be used by}} Judges to reduce our freedoms". Hitchens has expressed support for reintroducing capital punishment, saying that [...] "I think it is a great pity that <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> this powerful deterrent against cruel violence".|$|E
2500|$|Mugabe {{said at a}} rally on 14 June that he {{was willing}} to step aside at some point in favour of someone else from ZANU-PF, {{although}} he did not name the successor he envisioned or the time he planned for this to happen. He remarked, however, that he would [...] "not grow old" [...] "as long as the British still want to come here" [...] and [...] "until we know <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> sellouts among us". At a rally on 15 June, Mugabe said that the aid agencies had been suspended for exploiting the need for food aid by encouraging people who received the aid to vote for the MDC. Speaking at Silobela in Midlands Province, he said that [...] "a mere X" [...] (a vote) could not overturn the liberation struggle. In The Herald on 17 June, he again accused the MDC of orchestrating the violence and said that MDC leaders would soon be held responsible for violence committed by their supporters under a law regarding [...] "vicarious responsibility and liability". He also said that hunger and the absence of commodities were not problems worth [...] "selling the country" [...] over.|$|E
2500|$|This {{was a poor}} {{state of}} affairs {{considering}} German intelligence sources in Washington, prior to hostilities, had picked up minutely detailed reports on the performance and potential performance of American aircraft. Moreover, {{the capacity of the}} American aircraft industry was heavily documented in open source publications, and General Friedrich von Boetticher, Chief of Source and Information of the German military and air attaché at the Embassy in Washington, had produced a number of these reports on the Boeing B-17 four-engine heavy bomber development, supported by experts in the German aircraft industry, the War Economy and Armaments Office. [...] "Generaloberst" [...] Hans Jeschonnek, the Luftwaffe Chief of Staff, was impressed by these reports and arranged in May 1942 a meeting for Boetticher with Hitler to underline the threat posed by the USAAF. Hitler had then again dismissed the data and agreed with Göring. Jeschonnek despaired. He wrote to General Friedrich von Boetticher:Boetticher, we are lost. For years I have, on the basis of your reports, forwarded demands to Göring and Hitler, but for years my requests for the expansion of the Luftwaffe have not been answered. <b>We</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the air defence I requested and which is needed...we no longer have any time...to provide ourselves with the weapons to fight the dreadful threat which you have predicted and reported to us. Then we will be covered from the air with an enemy screen which will paralyze our power to resist.|$|E

50|$|The Wallsend Club {{of today}} came about {{due to the}} Swan Hunter Recreation Ground being given up during the great {{amalgamation}} of Swan’s, Vicker’s, Hawthorn Leslie’s and Readhead’s into “British Shipbuilders”. Fortunately, the Sports Centre at Bigge’s Maine had been opened and we were invited to move “lock, stock & goalposts” providing we changed our name to “Wallsend RFC” and our colours to Green & Gold. So we left behind “the Hut” and the communal concrete bath for our new home in 1969. The metamorphosis from “Swan’s in blue” to “Eagles in green” was not easy. We’d been our own masters with virtually no outside interference, but at the Sports centre we were just another section and difficulties arose with regard to changing room availability and pitch condition control; plus the fact that <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> our own income, but now had fees and charges imposed upon us.|$|R

Yes, I am very glad that this half-tame lion is gone, since sometimes I have thought that I should be obliged to poison it that we might sleep in peace. You know he called me a snake, Baas, and poison is a snake's only spear. Shall I tell the boys to inspan the oxen, Baas? I think the further we get from that King's captain and his men, the more comfortably shall we travel, especially now when <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> the Great Medicine to protect us." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{nowadays}} {{we cannot}} depend on these safeguards, {{such as they}} were. <b>We</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>have</b> large families: all the families {{are too small to}} give the children the necessary social training. The Roman father is out of fashion; and the whip and the cane are becoming discredited, not so much by the old arguments against corporal punishment (sound as these were) as by the gradual wearing away of the veil from the fact that flogging is a form of debauchery. The advocate of flogging as a punishment is now exposed to very disagreeable suspicions; and ever since Rousseau rose to the effort of making a certain very ridiculous confession on the subject, there has been a growing perception that child whipping, even for the children themselves, is not always the innocent and high-minded practice it professes to be. At all events there is no getting away from the facts that families are smaller than they used to be, and that passions which formerly took effect in tyranny have been largely diverted into sentimentality. And though a little sentimentality may be a very good thing, chronic sentimentality is a horror, more dangerous, because more possible, than the erotomania which we all condemn when we are not thoughtlessly glorifying it as the ideal married state.|$|E
