25|$|For forest managers, {{sustainably}} {{managing a}} particular forest tract means determining, in a tangible <b>way,</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use it today to ensure similar benefits, health and productivity in the future. Forest managers must assess and integrate {{a wide array}} of sometimes conflicting factors – commercial and non-commercial values, environmental considerations, community needs, even global impact – to produce sound forest plans. In most cases, forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens, businesses, organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed. The tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011 the Japanese Ministry of Science {{launched}} a phone hotline {{to deal with}} concerns about radiation exposure outside Fukushima Prefecture. Concerned Japanese citizens had been walking with Geiger-counters through their locality in search of all places with raised radiation levels. Whenever a site was found with a radiation dose at one meter above the ground more than one microsievert per hour and higher than nearby areas, this should be mentioned at the hotline. One microsievert per hour is the limit above this topsoil at school playgrounds would be removed, subsidized {{by the state of}} Japan. Local governments were asked to carry out simple decontamination works, such as clearing mud from ditches if necessary. When radiation levels would remain more than one microsievert higher than nearby areas even after the cleaning, the ministry offered to help with further decontamination. On the website of the ministry a guideline was posted on how to measure radiation levels in a proper <b>way,</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hold the dosimeter and how long to wait for a proper reading.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objects of}} this {{doctoral}} thesis are {{analysis of a}} small induction motor losses and research of <b>ways</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> reduce losses and increase efficiency of this motor. The <b>ways</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> reduce losses and increase efficiency under study are as follow: reduction of stator winding’s resistance, lengthening of magnetic circuit, modification of turn number, cooper squirrel cage, slots shape optimization, sheets annealing and use of sheets with lower specific losses. The losses analysis and the research of <b>ways</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> reduce losses are done due to laboratory work. For this laboratory work, eleven different samples of the motor with above mentioned modifications were manufactured. Results of their measurements and losses analysis are presented in this thesis. There were also simulations by finite elements method used to help solve objects of this thesis. Due to the simulations, analysis of loses of the induction motor under study was done. Results of this analysis include some details that {{are not included in}} the results from measurement, for example separation of core losses between rotor and stator. The simulations were also used for analysis of manufacturing technology impact onto the motor’s performance. During this analysis, following impacts were considered: actual shape of magnetic circuit, stator’s sheets riveting, influence of cutting onto material’s properties and placement of the stator into conductive frame. Results of this analysis are presented in this thesis...|$|R

However, as Camerer & Loewenstein (2004) mentioned, many economists have long been pessimistic that an experimental approach could offer such vivid illustrations {{of cause and effect}} in their field.

For this reason, we introduce the experimental design of our experiment and show some major problems with developing experiment, <b>ways</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> solve those problems or avoid the problem. Main theoretical focus of this essay is on paradigm about homo economicus and the ceteris paribus condition in the context of necessarily in economic research.
