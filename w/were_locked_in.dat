5|$|In 1912, {{there was}} an army camp held in the grounds of Somerhill. The {{soldiers}} were housed in bell tents. On Sir Osmond's death in 1940, it then passed to his eldest son Sir Henry. During the Second World War, Somerhill {{was the site of}} a Prisoner of War camp, known as POW Camp No. 40. Italian POWs were amongst those housed at Somerhill. The Army were in possession of Somerhill from 1940–49. Squatters occupied some of the 40-plus huts in 1948, they <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> by the Colonel in charge of the camp at the time.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, 1953, a burned crewman {{talks to}} three {{government}} agents about his {{experience on the}} submarine Zeus Faber, completing the story told in the previous episode. He explains that he and other crew members <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> with their captain, who was infected by the black oil. After being knocked out from behind, the black oil leaves the captain's body and exits via a grate into the sea. It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man {{are two of the}} agents who are interviewing the crewman.|$|E
5|$|The European powers <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> {{internal}} conflicts: e.g. {{the war in}} Lombardy. Skanderbeg {{believed that}} the threat of Mehmed launching his withheld European campaigns was at its highest. He sent urgent requests to Venice to prepare for a new Ottoman offensive, thus attempting to develop an Albanian-Venetian alliance. While recognizing the threat and Skanderbeg's sovereignty over Albania, Venice withheld an establishment of an alliance. Alfonso promised to send men and an annual pension of 1500 ducats to Skanderbeg, whereas Pope Nicholas V sent 5,000 florins. Albania, Ragusa, Serbia, and Hungary then made a loose anti-Ottoman coalition to halt any future Turkish expansions.|$|E
50|$|Result: A > D, B > C and C > D <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> first. Now, D > B can't <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> {{since it}} would create a cycle B > C > D > B. Finally, B > A and C > A <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in.</b> Hence, the full ranking is B > C > A > D. Thus, B is elected Ranked pairs winner.|$|R

5|$|Acting on Almond's instruction, Smith {{ordered the}} 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong-ni on 27 November. The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division {{and forced the}} Marines to dig in on the ridges {{surrounding}} Yudam-ni. As night came, three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked the ridges on the north and northwest of Yudam-ni, hoping to annihilate the garrison in one stroke. Close range fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions, but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties to the Chinese. As day broke on 28 November, the Chinese forces and the American defenders <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> a stalemate around the Yudam-ni perimeter.|$|E
5|$|For the 1920 season, Maryland {{played in}} the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). Meanwhile, members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> a heated debate over whether first-year {{students}} should be eligible to play football. The larger schools, in general, were against the practice, and eventually the disagreement resulted in a schism within the SIAA. Eight teams from the SIAA split to form the Southern Conference: Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Mississippi State, and Tennessee. They were joined by six non-SIAA members: North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Washington & Lee, and Maryland. Maryland would remain within the Southern Conference {{for the next three}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After much political dispute over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964. It was formally inaugurated on 17 October 1964.|$|E
50|$|Result: A > B and B > C <b>are</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> (and C > A cannot <b>be</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> after that), so {{the full}} ranking is A > B > C. Thus, A is elected Ranked pairs winner.|$|R

5|$|In 1889, the United States, the United Kingdom and the German Empire <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> {{a dispute}} {{over control of the}} Samoan Islands. Historian George H. Ryden's {{research}} indicates Harrison {{played a key role in}} determining the status of this Pacific outpost by taking a firm stand on every aspect of Samoa conference negotiations; this included selection of the local ruler, refusal to allow an indemnity for Germany, as well as the establishment of a three power protectorate, a first for the U.S.. These arrangements facilitated the future dominant power of the U.S. in the Pacific; Secretary of State Blaine was absent due to complication of lumbago.|$|E
5|$|On August 5, the KPA's 12th Division {{pushed back}} the ROK Capital Division in the Ch'ongsong-Kigye area, and linked up with {{elements}} of the 766th which had infiltrated the area of Pohyunsan. Unopposed, they began to prepare to attack P'ohang to secure entry into the UN's newly established Pusan Perimeter. The Regiment was ordered to begin an attack in coordination with the KPA's 5th Division. The Korean People's Army planned simultaneous offensives across the entire Perimeter, including a flanking maneuver by the 766th and the 5th Division to envelop UN troops and push them back to Pusan. The 766th was not reinforced; North Korean planners intended it to move unseen around the UN lines {{while the majority of}} the UN and North Korean troops <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> fighting around Taegu and the Naktong Bulge.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{political}} career began in July 1954, {{when he was}} appointed the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam by former Emperor Bảo Đại, who was Head of State. At the time, Vietnam had been partitioned at the Geneva Conference after {{the defeat of the}} French Union forces at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, with the State of Vietnam ruling the country south of the 17th parallel. The partition was intended to be temporary, with national elections scheduled for 1956 to create a government of a reunified nation. In the meantime, Diệm and Bảo Đại <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> a power struggle. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm but selected him in the hope that he would attract American aid. The issue was brought to a head when Diệm scheduled a referendum for October 1955 on whether South Vietnam should become a republic. Diệm won the rigged referendum and proclaimed himself the President of the newly created Republic of Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|KG 1, meanwhile, {{had a clear}} run to its target. The {{battles with}} KG 76 had drawn {{in four of the}} five RAF Squadrons. Still, the British sent No. 615 Squadron and its 15 Spitfires to deal with KG 1. They were confronted with a large number of Bf 109s from JG 54, escorting the He 111s. The German fighters {{successfully}} defended their charges and the RAF fighters could not break through to the bombers, which were flying in stepped-up waves from 12 to 15,000 feet. Most of the German bomber crews noted the absence of fighter opposition and speculated that the RAF might be {{at the end of its}} tether. Most of the personnel at Biggin Hill had time to take cover before the bombers arrived. KG 1 lost only one He 111 and one another damaged but failed to damage Biggin Hill. It is likely the losses sustained by KG 1 were inflicted by Spitfires from No. 65 Squadron RAF which stumbled across of their He 111s while 615 and JG 54 <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> combat.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{succeeded in}} linking {{up with the}} {{remnants}} of their forces in the Muskauer Forst, and throwing the local Polish and Soviet forces into chaos. The Polish Second Army lost cohesion and split into four groups. Several units of the Polish Second Army found themselves surrounded. In particular, the Polish 5th Infantry Division and 16th Tank Brigade were struck in the rear, suffering severe losses. The headquarters of the 5th Division, defended only by sapper and training battalions, came under attack. The command group managed to break through to the 16th Tank Brigade, but that unit itself was almost annihilated at Förstgen (Forsiegen), losing over 90 percent of its personnel; out of 1,300 soldiers, only about 100 survived. The commanding general of the Polish 5th Infantry Division, Aleksander Waszkiewicz, was killed. In the village of Niederkaina, today a part of Bautzen, between 196 and 300 captured German members of the Volkssturm <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> a barn which was set on fire by retreating Polish or Soviet troops.|$|E
5|$|The ROK 1st Infantry Division, with 7,500 men {{had held}} the line around the Bowling Alley since August 12. The Bowling Alley area was {{selected}} because of its advantageous high ground which provided natural barriers to funnel North Korean troops into smaller fronts where South Korean defenses could attack them from the high ground in concealed positions. In the meantime, the KPA 3rd, 13th, and 15th Divisions were advancing south and preparing to close on Taegu. The KPA 13th Division converged on the Tabu-dong corridor and a vicious melee ensued between the North and South Korean troops, with ROK 1st Division's 11th, 12th, and 13th regiments committed against the KPA 13th Division's 19th, 21st and 23rd regiments. The fight became a battle of attrition. As the two sides closed on one another, the battle took a brutal turn by August 15 as supplies ran low and units <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> close quarters combat with little ammunition for the weapons. Fighting across the entire front became hand-to-hand combat and grenade fights at close range. The two divisions were so evenly matched that neither could make any appreciable gains for days of fighting and huge numbers of casualties.|$|E

5|$|The first mass exterminations at Auschwitz {{took place}} in early September 1941, when 900 inmates were killed by {{gathering}} them {{in the basement of}} Block 11 and gassing them with Zyklon B. This building proved unsuitable for mass gassings, so the site of the killings was moved to the crematorium at Auschwitz I (Crematorium I, which operated until July 1942). There, more than 700 victims could be killed at once. In order to keep the victims calm, they were told they were to undergo disinfection and de-lousing. They were ordered to undress outside and then <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> the building and gassed. After its decommissioning as a gas chamber, the building was converted to a storage facility and later served as an air raid shelter for the SS. The gas chamber and crematorium were reconstructed after the war using the original components, which remained on site. Some 60,000 people were killed at Crematorium I.|$|E
5|$|Although the Russians {{were quick}} {{to come to the}} aid of the British, the Anglo-Russian {{relationship}} was fraught with an underlying sense of distrust rooted in a long-standing history of competition. Just decades before the mutiny of 1915, Russia and Britain were already locked in imperialist rivalry. Spurred by the last tsar's Asiatic Mission and his visit to South East Asia as part of his world tour of 1891, the Russian government appointed its first ethnic-Russian Consul, V. Vyvodtsev, to Singapore as early as 1890. The Russian presence in Southeast Asia during the last quarter of the 19th century was meant not only to safeguard its economic and strategic position in China but also to carefully observe the designs and advances of its imperialist rivals in the region, foremost among them being the British empire. Anglo-Russian relationship took a turn for the worst during the latter half of the 19th century when both Britain and Russia <b>were</b> <b>locked</b> <b>in</b> competition for Afghanistan and Persia as well as when Britain halted Russian advancement into the Balkans and Turkey. Britain’s alignment with Japan as ally worsened Anglo-Russian relationship with the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05. This history of suspicion and rivalry explains why Rospopov sent a secret telegram on 21 February expressing his reservations at placing the Orel and its accompanying men and guns under the command of the British military in Singapore. Eventually the French admiral was able to assuage the fears of Rospopov and assured him that Russian aid at this point would serve as a good means to strengthen Anglo-Russian relation. When the mutiny was finally quelled, the Russian captain Vinokurov reportedly remarked to the British Governor to Singapore that the Russian assistance in suppressing the mutiny ‘’would unite the two countries better than any treaty’’.|$|E
5|$|John the Fearless accused Isabeau and Orléans {{of fiscal}} {{mismanagement}} and again demanded money for himself, in recompense {{for the loss}} of royal revenues after his father's death; an estimated half of Philip the Bold's revenues had come from the French treasury. John raised a force of 1,000 knights, and entered Paris in 1405. Orléans hastily retreated with Isabeau to the fortified castle of Melun, with her household and children a day or so behind. John immediately left in pursuit, intercepting the party of chaperones and royal children. He took possession of the Dauphin, and returned him to Paris under control of Burgundian forces; however, the boy's uncle, the duke of Berry, quickly took control of the child at the orders of the Royal Council. At that time Charles was lucid for about a month and able to help with the crisis. The incident, that {{came to be known as}} the enlèvement of the dauphin, almost caused full-scale war, but it was averted. Orléans quickly raised an army while John encouraged Parisians to revolt. They refused, claiming loyalty to the King and his son; Berry was made captain general of Paris and the city's gates <b>were</b> <b>locked.</b> <b>In</b> October Isabeau became active in mediating the dispute, in response to a letter from Christine de Pizan and an ordinance from the Royal Council.|$|E
