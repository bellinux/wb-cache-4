5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E

The Sounds organization installed a modern version {{at the new}} venue, capable of displaying high-definition video.

[...] Rosaline, however, chooses to remain chaste; Romeo says: [...] "She hath forsworn to love, {{and in that}} vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now." [...] This {{is the source of}} his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: [...] "That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad." [...] Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a crow" [...] alongside the other beautiful women. Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: [...] "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night." [...] Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.|$|E
500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or {{reflex sight}} is an optical device {{that allows the}} user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an aiming point or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> it is {{sitting in front of the}} viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the season}} premieres of most {{television}} series in September, a common practice by television networks would be to send screeners of pilots of new shows to critics. On August 18, The CW notified critics {{that they would not}} be releasing the premiere episodes, saying, [...] " [...] have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere. We're not hiding anything... simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9.02, riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night, and letting all our constituents see it at the same time." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV speculated that the decision was an indication of the low quality of the episodes, but pointed out that the pilot may not have been finished in time for a screener release, which was later confirmed to be the case. Despite not having watched the episode, the Parents Television Council said in a statement that [...] "if Gossip Girl is any indication of what 90210 <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>like,</b> advertisers have plenty of reason to steer clear of the show... No reputable advertiser should even consider sponsoring the show without viewing the content in advance." [...] "We're Not in Kansas Anymore", along with the following episode, averaged 4.9 million viewers throughout the two-hour broadcast on September 2. This gave The CW its highest-rated premiere ever in the adults 18-49 demographic with a 2.6. By comparison, the series finale of the original series was watched by 25 million viewers on its original broadcast in May 2000.|$|E
500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court! Sometimes I can see myself living in a castle surrounded by servants. I might even entertain the thought of a handsome prince.....As long as he was gentle and kind...

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace <b>will</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience out there that's somewhere in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|E
