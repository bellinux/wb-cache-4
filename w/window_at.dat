5|$|The late 20th century saw an {{extensive}} restoration programme, particularly {{of the west}} front. The stained glass is currently under restoration, with a programme underway to conserve the large 14th-century Jesse Tree <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the eastern terminal of the choir.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking out of the <b>window</b> <b>at</b> twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
5|$|Juliette Mayniel as Edna Grüber, a {{young woman}} who becomes a victim of Doctor Génessier {{experiments}} after being befriended by Louise in Paris. Edna is the first woman whose face is successfully transplanted to Christiane. While recovering from the surgery, she attacks Louise and then leaps from a <b>window</b> <b>at</b> Génessier's home and dies.|$|E

5|$|The Mk. XIV {{consisted}} of two independent parts, the sighting head and the computor. The sighting head was located in the bomb aimer's <b>window</b> <b>at</b> {{the front of the}} aircraft. The separate computor cabinet was assembled with the operating knobs positioned {{on the right side of}} the case, so it had to be placed on the left side of the fuselage. The two were connected via two flexible cable drives.|$|E
5|$|The {{liner notes}} of Seeger's Songs of Struggle and Protest, 1930–50 tell a {{different}} story of the song's creation; they state that Guthrie wrote the song while airborne on a flight into Pittsburgh. While looking out the <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the smoky skies, he quickly jotted down the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|The {{window in}} the centre north wall has two lights (sections of window {{separated}} by a mullion); there are two pairs of two-light windows in the south wall. The <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the east end {{had a pair of}} lights, topped by trefoils (a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles).|$|E

5|$|Adolphus Aylward, the vicar from 1847 to 1872 and {{overseer}} of {{the parish}} restructuring, is commemorated by a brass plaque on the south-west pillar of the tower, and by a Clayton and Bell window in the north-west chancel. Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with snowdrops at her mother's request, which still bloom each spring. Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls glass in the lancet <b>window</b> <b>at</b> {{the west end of}} the north aisle.|$|E
5|$|Angel's Bakery {{opened its}} {{landmark}} factory store {{adjacent to the}} Givat Shaul plant in 1984. The store offers a full selection of packaged breads, rolls, and muffins, bourekas, danishes, fancy cakes, handmade pastries, coffee and soft drinks. For many years, visitors could watch bakers braid challahs through a large side <b>window.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of the}} Passover holiday, a long line of customers traditionally forms outside the store after midnight, waiting to buy the first bread off the production line.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes {{service is}} commemorated with a stained-glass <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the Garden Island Naval Chapel. One of the ship's anchors is {{incorporated}} into a memorial to naval aviation at Nowra, New South Wales. Another anchor and the starboard side ship's bell are {{on display at the}} RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island. Memorabilia from Melbournes voyages with the Fleet Air Arm embarked, and examples of all the types of aircraft deployed on Melbourne, are on permanent static display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at HMAS Albatross.|$|E

5|$|Several windows {{maintain}} their original shape and size. The original stained-glass decorations were almost all {{lost in the}} 1702 fire and were simply replaced by normal glass. The current stained-glass designs were added during the renovation {{at the end of}} the 19th century, most of them by the Gothenburg firm, Svenska Glasmåleri. The large windows above the portals depict the Trinity: God the Father over the west door, God the Son above the south door (the largest in the church), and God the Holy Spirit above the north door. Crafted in limestone, the rose <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the north portal is the oldest, unchanged since the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} built from rubble masonry, dressed with freestone. It {{measures}} 45 feet by 14 feet 6inches (14 by 4.4metres). The building is largely 12th-century in construction, with {{the walls and}} a narrow lancet window in the south wall dating from that time; another <b>window</b> <b>at</b> {{the east end of}} the south wall is rectangular and dates from the late 14th or early 15th centuries, with a more modern window in between. The east wall and window, with stone tracery and an ogee-topped light in a pointed arch, are from the 14th century. Some of the windows use atypical green glass, and some have frames made out of wood.|$|E
5|$|The church, {{which is}} small and rectangular, has no {{internal}} division between the nave and the chancel. It measures 47feet 6inches by 14feet 9inches (14.5 by 4.5m). It is built of rubble masonry, and the roof is made of slate; there is a gabled bellcote at {{the west end of}} the roof. The roof timbers {{can be seen from the}} inside. Entrance to the church is through a porch with a rounded arch at the west end of the south wall, and there is a vestry, with one <b>window,</b> <b>at</b> the west end of the north wall.|$|E

5|$|The summer {{transfer}} <b>window</b> <b>at</b> Real Sociedad saw {{the arrival}} of Alonso's childhood friend Mikel Arteta. Arteta was ecstatic {{at the prospect of}} partnering Alonso in midfield but his excitement was short lived. Alonso was not picked for Real Sociedad's pre-season friendlies, signalling that an offer by Liverpool was being treated seriously. The Basque side announced on 20 August 2004 that they had made a deal worth £10.7million with Liverpool and Alonso had agreed terms with the Merseyside team. Alonso did not lament the fact that a move to Real Madrid had not materialised. Instead, he concentrated on integrating with the new Spanish contingent at Liverpool under the guidance of former Valencia manager Rafael Benítez.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular <b>window.</b> <b>At</b> the east end are three windows. The central <b>window,</b> <b>at</b> the end of the chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E
5|$|The {{windows in}} the 19th-century part are topped with trefoils (a {{stonework}} pattern of three overlapping circles) and set into square frames. The north wall has three windows, one with a single light (or section) and two with pairs of lights; there are two windows on the south wall (one with three lights, another with two) {{as well as a}} blocked <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the east end of the wall. The church's east window is a pointed arch with a lower section of three trefoil-headed lights and two smaller lights on top. The {{windows in the}} extension are set into pointed arches.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{light was}} {{optimised}} {{in the design}} of CH2 by creating a wavy ceiling, use of light shelves, larger <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> the bottom of building and smaller <b>windows</b> <b>at</b> the top, use of colours to accentuate the natural light, and the concepts that windowed areas were shared by all not owned individuals.|$|R
5|$|In 1661, after Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne, Robert Creighton, the king's chaplain in exile, was appointed dean and was bishop {{for two years before}} his death in 1672. His brass lectern, given in thanksgiving, {{can be seen in the}} cathedral. He donated the nave's great west <b>window</b> <b>at</b> a cost of £140. Following Creighton's appointment as bishop, the post of dean went to Ralph Bathurst, who had been chaplain to the king, president of Trinity College, Oxford and fellow of the Royal Society. During Bathurst's long tenure the cathedral {{was restored}}, but in the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Puritan soldiers damaged the west front, tore lead from the roof to make bullets, broke the windows, smashed the organ and furnishings, and for a time stabled their horses in the nave.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story <b>window</b> <b>at</b> {{the front of the}} building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1932, Holden was {{travelling}} as {{a passenger}} aboard a New England Airways DH.80 Puss Moth from Sydney to Brisbane when it crashed at Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, killing him instantly. The other occupants, pilot Ralph Virtue {{and the joint}} owner of the Canberra, Holden's schoolfriend Dr George Hamilton, also perished. Investigations determined that the Puss Moth, VH-UPM, had gone down {{as a result of}} wing failure caused by aileron flutter. A crowded memorial service for Holden and Hamilton took place at Sydney Church of England Grammar School on 20 September; they were cremated that afternoon at Rookwood Cemetery, where eighteen aircraft piloted by friends and associates of the pair overflew the chapel. Holden was survived by his wife and children. His father Hubert carried on operating Holden's Air Transport Services, floating it as a public corporation and serving as chairman. Les Holden, George Hamilton, and one of their schoolmates who had also recently died, Henry Braddon, were commemorated with a memorial stained-glass <b>window</b> <b>at</b> the Sydney Church of England Grammar School chapel in 1934. Holden was also honoured by Holden Street, built in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra in 1943.|$|E
