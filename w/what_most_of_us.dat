Thereafter, angina was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. By early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot next to Britten's. An obituary tribute in the magazine Early Music emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she [...] " [...] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder". [...] Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: [...] "Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her... content with few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days.

Yet that is what Dr. Sabiha Al-Jabbar did when {{she was working on}} her PhD in Baghdad. She had to design her experiments so that she could have the results she needed before the lights went out. Dr. Al-Jabbar suspected she would observe some of the properties of superconductivity at room temperature in bismuth if she made filaments by suspending colloids of the metal in hot molten epoxy. She inserted copper pins in the solution and applied voltage across them. Filaments formed between the pin points. After they hardened, she passed current through them. At some value of current, the resistance dropped to near zero, as did the voltage. Her power supply, she reports, blew a fuse at this point. She had become accustomed to that and simply replaced it from a supply of fuses she kept close by. Her power supply, she says, saw the sudden entry into the high conducting state as an electrical short and blew a fuse. She kept fuses handy to be able to continue her tests with as little interruption as possible. Three hours is not a lon...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} our teaching about gender on two social work courses. It describes the struggles and successes we experienced in continuing to teach gender issues on a one year course {{and to set}} up a discrete gender course on a two year course. An evaluation of the course was achieved through verbal and written feedback from the students. We also questioned staff about their views on discrete teaching on this subject. There were marked differences of opinion between staff, but in general students had found it a valuable experience. However, there were many issues that need review for future courses. ‘Race’ and gender issues are political areas for education and practice and will inevitably create conflicts and tensions if we are to raise awareness. We dedicate this article to the DSW I (later DSW II) student group 1989 – 1991 and also to the DASS student group 1989 – 1990. Gender is usually taken to be the socially imposed dichotomies of male and female roles and attributes.

60|$|Man ranges {{over the}} whole earth, and exists under the most varied conditions, leading {{necessarily}} to equally varied habits. He migrates--he makes wars and conquests--one race mingles with another--different customs are brought into contact--the habits of a migrating or conquering race are modified by the different circumstances of a new country. The civilized race which conquered Egypt must have developed its mode of building in a forest country where timber was abundant, for it is not probable, {{that the idea of}} cylindrical columns originated in a country destitute of trees. The pyramids might have been built by an indigenous race, but not the temples of El Uksor and Karnak. In Grecian architecture, almost every characteristic feature can be traced to an origin in wooden buildings. The columns, the architrave, the frieze, the fillets, the cantelevers, the form of the roof, all point to an origin in some southern forest-clad country, and strikingly corroborate the view derived from philology, that Greece was colonised from north-western India. But to erect columns and span them with huge blocks of stone, or marble, is not an act of reason, but one of pure unreasoning imitation. The arch is the only true and reasonable mode of covering over wide spaces with stone, and therefore, Grecian architecture, however exquisitely beautiful, is false in principle, and {{is by no means a}} good example of the application of reason to the art of building. And <b>what</b> do <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do at the present day but imitate the buildings of those that have gone before us? We have not even been able to discover or develope any definite style of building best suited for us. We have no characteristic national style of architecture, and to that extent are even below the birds, who have each their characteristic form of nest, exactly adapted to their wants and habits.|$|R

6000|$|And now I hear {{cries of}} protest arising all round. First my own schoolmasters, or their ghosts, asking whether I was cruelly beaten at school? No; but then I {{did not learn}} {{anything}} at school. Dr Johnson's schoolmaster presumably did care enough whether Sam learned anything to beat him savagely enough {{to force him to}} lame his mind--for Johnson's great mind was lamed--by learning his lessons. None of my schoolmasters really cared a rap (or perhaps it would be fairer to them to say that their employers did not care a rap and therefore did not give them the necessary caning powers) whether I learnt my lessons or not, provided my father paid my schooling bill, the collection of which was the real object of the school. Consequently I did not learn my school lessons, having much more important ones in hand, with the result that I have not wasted my life trifling with literary fools in taverns as Johnson did when he should have been shaking England with the thunder of his spirit. My schooling did me a great deal of harm and no good whatever: it was simply dragging a child's soul through the dirt; but I escaped Squeers and Creakle just as I escaped Johnson and Carlyle. And this is <b>what</b> happens to <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> We are not effectively coerced to learn: we stave off punishment {{as far as we can}} by lying and trickery and guessing and using our wits; and when this does not suffice we scribble impositions, or suffer extra imprisonments--"keeping in" [...] was the phrase in my time--or let a master strike us with a cane and fall back on our pride at being able to hear it physically (he not being allowed to hit us too hard) to outface the dishonor we should have been taught to die rather than endure. And so idleness and worthlessness on the one hand and a pretence of coercion on the other became a despicable routine. If my schoolmasters had been really engaged in educating me instead of painfully earning their bread by keeping me from annoying my elders they would have turned me out of the school, telling me that I was thoroughly disloyal to it; that I had no intention of learning; that I was mocking and distracting the boys who did wish to learn; that I was a liar and a shirker and a seditious little nuisance; and that nothing could injure me in character and degrade their occupation more than allowing me (much less forcing me) to remain in the school under such conditions. But in order to get expelled, it was necessary commit a crime of such atrocity that the parents of other boys would have threatened to remove their sons sooner than allow them to be schoolfellows with the delinquent. I can remember only one case in which such a penalty was threatened; and in that case the culprit, a boarder, had kissed a housemaid, or possibly, being a handsome youth, been kissed by her. She did not kiss me; and nobody ever dreamt of expelling me. The truth was, a boy meant just so much a year to the institution. That was why he was kept there against his will. That was why he was kept there when his expulsion would have been an unspeakable relief and benefit both to his teachers and himself.|$|R

60|$|The truly quaint materialism of {{our view}} of life {{disables}} us from pursuing any transaction to an end. You can make no one understand that his bargain is {{anything more than a}} bargain, whereas in point of fact it is a link in the policy of mankind, and either a good or an evil to the world. We have a sort of blindness which prevents us from seeing anything but sovereigns. If one man agrees to give another so many shillings for so many hours' work, and then wilfully gives him a certain proportion of the price in bad money and only the remainder in good, we can see with half an eye that this man is a thief. But if the other spends a certain proportion of the hours in smoking a pipe of tobacco, and a certain other proportion in looking at the sky, or the clock, or trying to recall an air, or in meditation on his own past adventures, and only the remainder in downright work such as he is paid to do, is he, because the theft is one of time and not of money,--is he any the less a thief? The one gave a bad shilling, the other an imperfect hour; but both broke the bargain, and each is a thief. In piecework, which is <b>what</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> do, the case is none the less plain for being even less material. If you forge a bad knife, you have wasted some of mankind's iron, and then, with unrivalled cynicism, you pocket some of mankind's money for your trouble. Is there any man so blind who cannot see that this is theft? Again, if you carelessly cultivate a farm, you have been playing fast and loose with mankind's resources against hunger; there will be less bread in consequence, and for lack of that bread somebody will die next winter: a grim consideration. And you must not hope to shuffle out of blame because you got less money for your less quantity of bread; for although a theft be partly punished, it is none the less a theft for that. You took the farm against competitors; there were others ready to shoulder the responsibility and be answerable for the tale of loaves; but it was you who took it. By the act you came under a tacit bargain with mankind to cultivate that farm with your best endeavour; you were under no superintendence, you were on parole; and you have broke your bargain, and to all who look closely, and yourself among the rest if you have moral eyesight, you are a thief. Or take the case of men of letters. Every piece of work which is not as good as you can make it, which you have palmed off imperfect, meagrely thought, niggardly in execution, upon mankind who is your paymaster on parole and in a sense your pupil, every hasty or slovenly or untrue performance, should rise up against you in the court of your own heart and condemn you for a thief. Have you a salary? If you trifle with your health, and so render yourself less capable for duty, and still touch, and still greedily pocket the emolument--what are you but a thief? Have you double accounts? do you by any time-honoured juggle, deceit, or ambiguous process, gain more from those who deal with you than if you were bargaining and dealing face to face in front of God?--What are you but a thief? Lastly, if you fill an office, or produce an article, which, in your heart of hearts, you think a delusion and a fraud upon mankind, and still draw your salary and go through the sham manoeuvres of this office, or still book your profits and keep on flooding the world with these injurious goods?--though you were old, and bald, and the first at church, and a baronet, what are you but a thief? These may seem hard words and mere curiosities of the intellect, in an age when the spirit of honesty is so sparingly cultivated that all business is conducted upon lies and so-called customs of the trade, that not a man bestows two thoughts on the utility or honourableness of his pursuit. I would say less if I thought less. But looking to my own reason and the right of things, I can only avow that I am a thief myself, and that I passionately suspect my neighbours of the same guilt.|$|E
