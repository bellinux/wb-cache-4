Mid-20th century biology texts about invading species reflected more complacency than alarm, as contemporary <b>wisdom</b> <b>about</b> them assumed the host environment would be largely immune. Everglades biologist Thomas Lodge writes that in the 1960s, evidence of non-native plant and animal life in South Florida was present but not particularly worthy of notice. Over the past decades, however, the number of exotic species and their spread has increased dramatically.|$|E

25|$|Prajñā (Sanskrit) or paññā (Pāli) is insight or {{knowledge}} of {{the true nature of}} existence. The Buddhist tradition regards ignorance (avidyā), a fundamental ignorance, misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality, as one of the basic causes of dukkha and samsara. By overcoming ignorance or misunderstanding one is enlightened and liberated. This overcoming includes awakening to impermanence and the non-self nature of reality, and this develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and liberates a being from dukkha and saṃsāra. Prajñā is important in all Buddhist traditions, and is the <b>wisdom</b> <b>about</b> the dharmas, functioning of karma and rebirths, realms of samsara, impermanence of everything, no-self in anyone or anything, and dependent origination.|$|E

500|$|While {{studying}} under F. M. Cornford at Cambridge, Havelock {{began to}} question the received <b>wisdom</b> <b>about</b> the nature of pre-Socratic philosophy and, in particular, about its relationship with Socratic thought. In The Literate Revolution in Greece, his penultimate book, Havelock recalls being struck by a discrepancy between the language used by the philosophers he was studying and the heavily Platonic idiom with which it was interpreted in the standard texts. It was well known {{that some of these}} philosophical texts (Parmenides, Empedocles) were written not only in verse but in the metre of Homer, who had recently been identified (still controversially at the time) by Milman Parry as an oral poet, but Cornford and other scholars of these early philosophers saw the practice as a fairly insignificant convention left over from Hesiod. Havelock eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} the poetic aspects of early philosophy [...] "were matters not of style but of substance," [...] and that such thinkers as Heraclitus and Empedocles actually have more in common even on an intellectual level with Homer than they do with Plato and Aristotle. However, he did not publicly break from Cornford until many years later.|$|E
500|$|Hirst {{produced}} {{a large number}} of important articles, chapters and books on Australian history. His academic interests were wide-ranging, including social, cultural and political history. Hirst's goal was to elucidate the qualities and characteristics of Australian society and how they had developed. Jeremy Sammut has described him as [...] "an elegant and outstanding stylist, as adept at clarifying complex issues by reducing them to their essentials as he was at crafting the pithy line that eliminated all doubt his interpretation was true and correct". In his historical work, Hirst's colleague at La Trobe University, Alan Frost, has noted that Hirst [...] "challenged orthodoxies and produced many new insights". He wrote two seminal books on colonial New South Wales which Frank Bongiorno has described as displaying [...] "a raw intellectual power": Convict Society and its Enemies (1983) and The Strange Birth of Colonial Democracy (1988) (both reprinted as Freedom on the Fatal Shore in 2008). Convict Society and its Enemies was particularly influential, arguing that rather than being a brutal slave society, early New South Wales was a place where rights and freedoms were well-established from the beginning. Hirst's study of Federation, The Sentimental Nation, was also a ground-breaking work, arguing that national sentiment was more important than economics in uniting the nation. Alan Frost has described Hirst's shorter analyses as notable: [...] "Distance in Australia: Was It a Tyrant?" [...] (1975), his response to Geoffrey Blainey's most famous concept, [...] "deserves much more attention than it now receives"; his [...] "Egalitarianism" [...] (1986) challenges [...] "received <b>wisdom</b> <b>about</b> colonial life". Many of his best shorter pieces were collected in Sense and Nonsense in Australian History (2009). A major achievement of Hirst's was a project to index the Melbourne Argus newspaper (1860–1909).|$|E

2500|$|Protagoras {{says his}} claim that virtue can be taught is better made by a story than by {{reasoned}} arguments, and he recounts a myth {{about the origins of}} living things. He says that Epimetheus (whose name means [...] "Afterthought") who was assigned the task of passing out the assets for survival, forgot to give mankind anything so his twin brother Prometheus (whose name means [...] "Forethought") stole fire from Hephaestus and practical wisdom from Athena and gave them to man. However, man was never granted civic wisdom which belonged to Zeus or the art of politics, so the race was initially in danger of extinction. [...] Zeus, however, sent Hermes to distribute shame and justice equally among human beings.

Robert Benchley wrote a parody of The Good Earth that focused on just these qualities.

Kang Liao argues that Buck played a [...] "pioneering role in demythologizing China and the Chinese people in the American mind". Phyllis Bentley, in an overview of Buck's work published in 1935, was altogether impressed: [...] "But we may say at least that for the interest of her chosen material, the sustained high level of her technical skill, and the frequent universality of her conceptions, Mrs. Buck is entitled to take rank as a considerable artist.

2500|$|In 1999, Philip Williamson {{published}} {{a collection of}} essays on Baldwin which attempted to explain his beliefs and defended his policies as Prime Minister. Williamson asserted that Baldwin had helped create [...] "a moral basis for rearmament in the mid 1930s" [...] that contributed greatly to [...] "the national spirit of defiance after Munich". His defenders counter that the moderate Baldwin felt he could not start a programme of aggressive re-armament without a national consensus on the matter. Certainly, pacifist appeasement was the dominant mainstream political view of the time in Britain, France, and the United States. Williamson admits that there was a clear postwar consensus that repudiated and denigrated all inter-war governments: Baldwin was targeted with the accusation that he had failed to rearm Britain in the 1930s despite Hitler's threat. Williamson says the negative reputation was chiefly the product of partisan politics, the bandwagon of praise for Churchill, selective recollections, and the need for scapegoats to blame for Britain's very close call in 1940. Only during the 1960s did political distance and then the opening of government records lead to more balanced historical assessments; yet the myth had become so central to larger myths about the 1930s and 1940s that it persists as conventional <b>wisdom</b> <b>about</b> the period.|$|E
2500|$|Margaret Eimer was the {{co-author}} for Caballero: A Historical Novel {{and a close}} friend to Jovita González. She used the pseudonym Eve Raleigh in her writing, possibly referencing to Eve, the first female, and Raleigh (Sir Walter Raleigh) the English explorer of the Americas. Eimer was a [...] "frustrated but talented writer whose short stories had been rejected by numerous magazines". She had moved to Del Rio, Texas {{along with her husband}} [...] "Pop" [...] Eimer from Joplin, Missouri in concurrence with the flow of Anglo settlers moving to Texas during the agricultural boom. In Del Rio, Eimer [...] "developed a warm, even intimate, friendship with Jovita González, a Texas local with Mexican-descent, with whom she shared both a passion for writing and a skeptical stance toward received <b>wisdom</b> <b>about</b> politics, religion, and gender norms". Letters written to González from Eimer expressed her East Coast intellectuality, organized religion, and her opinions regarding societal gender norms, for example, how she persistently refused to marry. González and Eimer collaboratively and interethnically wrote Caballero: A Historical Novel. Although Eimer eventually moved back to Missouri, through the use of the U.S. mail system they continued to work and edit Caballero manuscripts and finish the novel. Common for many other female writers during that time, publishers steadfastly refused to publish the novel and Eimer unfortunately never lived to see the novel published. Eimer died on 27 Oct 1986, however, contrary to previous belief, she died with relatives to claim her belongings, including the original copy of Caballero titled All This is Mine.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an exhibition}} of applied microeconomic theory in political and resource economics. As three examples, I investigate three different questions, respectively: Does polarization of beliefs always intensify political gridlock in collective decision making? Will input-efficiency improvement in water use, e. g., adoption of more-efficient irrigation technologies and investment in water-conveyance systems, definitely decrease the demand for water-storage capacities, e. g., dams and reservoirs? Is collectivism, rather than individualism, generally helping society overcome the collective action problem? Using the game-theory or stochastic-control approach, I theoretically challenge conventional <b>wisdoms</b> <b>about</b> these questions, and illustrate the empirical relevance of my challenges, qualitatively or quantitatively, in different contexts, e. g., the Chinese transition from the planned economy, World War II and Operation Market [...] Garden, the irrigation water-inventory management of the California State Water Project, and the histories of collective action in China and Europe...|$|R

In the fourth section we problematize a number of paradoxes of state sponsored peacebuilding from the viewpoint of critical peace research.

40|$|The transatlantic {{complaints}} over {{hormone-treated beef}} and {{genetically modified organisms}} before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) seem to confirm two separate but related conventional <b>wisdoms</b> <b>about</b> the transatlantic economic relationship: that it is highly conflictual and {{that many of the}} conflicts are rooted in profoundly different approaches to regulation. This article argues that neither of the two conventional wisdoms is accurate. Rather, it contends that they are products of two, compounding analytical shortcomings: one methodological, one empirical. The methodological shortcoming takes the form of an implicit selection bias. While WTO complaints are high profile they are rare and extreme examples; it is, therefore, unsound to generalise from them to the regulatory relationship as a whole. The empirical shortcoming has to do with neither the beef hormones nor the GMO dispute demonstrating what it is purported to. The article thus serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of relying on obvious cases and the need to question whether evidence really does support a prevailing popular narrative...|$|R
