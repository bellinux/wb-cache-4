500|$|Spector made various {{changes to}} the songs. His most {{dramatic}} embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to [...] "The Long and Winding Road", [...] "Across the Universe" [...] and [...] "I Me Mine" [...] at Abbey Road Studios. The {{only member of the}} Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector's characteristic [...] "Wall of Sound". Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: [...] "He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> I want to hear that. I must have this, I must have that.'" [...] The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector's behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him into coming back after Starr had told Spector to calm down.|$|E

Says one, 'I kin climb our apple tree {{clear to the}} top.' Says the other, 'Huh! I can climb {{to the roof of}} our house.' 'Hum,' says the first boy, 'I can climb to the roof of our house, an' it's higher'n yours.' 'No, 'taint.' 'It is so--it's got a cupola on top.' 'I don't care,' cried the other boy. 'Our's is higher. It's got a {{mortgage}} on it--I heard dad say so!'" [...] And a smile went the rounds.|$|E

5000|$|In 2014, {{at the end}} of Nostalgia Critic's {{review of}} The Purge, Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche reprised their roles as Pinky and The Brain respectively, in {{animated}} form, {{at the very end of}} the episode. The segment involves Brain spewing profanity-laced insults toward Pinky, which then cuts to live-action footage of LaMarche and Paulsen recording their lines with The Critic behind them. LaMarche asks if this is for a kid's show to which Critic says, [...] "Just say it, people have been <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> for years." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked how}} she created {{the voice of}} Starla from Regular Show, Taylor explained: [...] "I read for Starla and another smaller character. I wanted to do an annoying, Harvey Fierstein kind of voice. Nobody would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> voice {{for any length of}} time. I made the cashier sound like that.” As it turns out, her voice for the cashier was exactly what the crew wanted, not the {{original}} one she had performed for Starla. At first Taylor did not understand, but after hearing how Muscle Man sounded, the show’s entire aural aesthetic clicked for her.|$|E
5000|$|When Vail confronts {{his client}} and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and {{suddenly}} transforms {{into a new}} persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself [...] "Roy" [...] and confesses {{to the murder of}} the Archbishop. When this incident is over, Stampler once again becomes passive and shy, and appears to have no recollection of the personality switch. Molly Arrington, the psychiatrist examining Stampler, is convinced that he suffers from multiple personality disorder caused by years of abuse at the hands of his father. Vail does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> because he knows that he cannot enter an insanity plea during an ongoing trial.|$|E
5000|$|The Democratic {{expansion}} into Indiana, Virginia and Ohio has [...] "seriously diminished {{the chances for}} future Republican success" [...] it claimed. The paper, which {{has been described as}} the [...] "quasi-official organ of the Bush Administration" [...] also stated that more people would have to [...] "bendover" [...] to get anywhere in a political office and has called on Republicans to move to the center {{for the sake of the}} party's future viability saying [...] "conservatives won't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> but the Republican who maneuvered his way into the most impressive victory... won ... after moving to the center" [...] and that [...] "the South is not enough space to build a national governing majority".|$|E
5000|$|The band {{claimed that}} the song's lyrics were akin to an aural Rorschach test and that people only heard in it what they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear,</b> {{although}} <b>this</b> did not prevent persistent allegations that the lyrics alluded to heroin ...|$|R

5000|$|... "But then theres Beyoncé, at {{the center}} of the mix, intoning in an uncommonly hushed tone, I wanna leave my {{footprints}} in the sands of time. Instead of gnashing my teeth, I listen closer, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> shockingly affecting elegy directed for once not at one specific lover, but the world that allowed her to express that love in the first place. Oddly enough, the song reminds me of Lars von Triers best works, which provoke actual emotional reactions while being, on paper, contrived pieces of shit. I Was Here, and 4 in general, is that kind of a work, objectively middling, subjectively magnificent." [...] —Conrad Tao, Sputnikmusic ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Brian Olewnick awarded the album 3 stars stating [...] "This live set with his Sound Ensemble {{features}} several compositions and approaches that Roscoe Mitchell explored with some regularity {{in the late}} '80s... it's a pleasure to hear Mitchell's imaginative and forceful alto playing (as well as some fine work by trumpeter Ragin), {{but there is little}} sense of the group dynamics that were paramount on records like Snurdy McGurdy and Her Dancin' Shoes... Humdrum Mitchell is still more exciting than a lot of the better offerings from his peers though, so fans of his will still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> album. It's just a little disappointing after fine efforts".|$|E
5000|$|Browne's {{language}} was colourful, and an unauthorized biography of her, This Effing Lady, was published. She was a devout Catholic (by conversion). The two aspects {{came together in}} a story of her standing outside Brompton Oratory after Sunday mass when an actor came up to her with gossip about who was sleeping with someone else's wife. She stopped him in his tracks with: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> filth. Not with me standing here {{in a state of}} fucking grace." [...] The younger Australian performer Barry Humphries paid tribute to Browne at her memorial service with an appropriate poem: [...] "She left behind an emptiness/A gap, a void, a trough/The world is quite a good deal less/Since Coral Browne fucked off." ...|$|E
5000|$|Li Shidao {{continued}} {{to be concerned about}} Zhangyi's viability, and he sent his officer Liu Yanping (劉晏平) to secretly head to Zhangyi to confer with Wu Yuanji. Liu had to get by the imperial lines carefully, and when he arrived at Zhangyi, Wu gave him many gifts and sent him back to Liu. When Liu returned to Pinglu, however, he reported to Li that Wu was not diligent, was wasting time in games with his wife and concubines, and was not able in military matters. Liu predicted an imminent defeat for Wu. Li, who had hoped for a more optimistic report, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> and he soon thereafter found an excuse to put Liu to death. [...] As the Song Dynasty historian Hu Sanxing commented: ...|$|E
6000|$|Before we {{had settled}} into our wonted places--in fact, almost as we entered--Halson looked over his {{shoulder}} and said: [...] "Mr. Wanhope, I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> story of my friend's.

5000|$|Gibbs, having {{gotten the}} {{information}} ultimately decides to leave Ziva in Tel Aviv, {{saying that he}} would give her time to [...] "remember who she can trust" [...] and believing that she will return to NCIS soon enough. The team is shocked {{by the turn of}} events, and Ducky privately expresses his surprise that Gibbs would come to such a decision, saying, [...] "You took to Ziva more quickly than to any other agent before her. Timothy, Caitlin, even DiNozzo. I've always sensed there's a strong bond between the two of you. Something shared perhaps." [...] However, Vance confronts him shortly afterwards and questions the integrity of Ziva's position at NCIS as well as her motives for killing her half-brother, Ari Haswari, four years earlier to save Gibbs. Despite knowing that Gibbs doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> Vance believes that Ziva will serve them well at Mossad. Gibbs, on the other hand disagrees, stating if Vance knows Eli, then they'll probably never see Ziva again.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for the Greek newspaper Ethnos on 29 May 2011, the vice-president of the Greek government, Theodoros Pangalos, against whom various slogans had been shouted during the demonstrations, adopted an ironic stance towards the movement. He said that [...] "the formation of a political movement, however much the people who follow the technological trends don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> {{does not depend on}} how many 'likes' or 'dislikes' it gets on Facebook". He added that [...] "movements without ideology and organization, that is to say movements based on anger, can only lead to either an ineffective release tension, which {{at the end of the}} day is of no interest to the political world, or pave the way for an undemocratic change of regime by organized minorities". In response, the demonstrations addressed many chants to the vice-president, like [...] "the country is sinking, Theodore, lose some weight!" [...] and other more vulgar ones.|$|E
5000|$|Looking back on Shagrat in 1972, Took {{opined that}} the band had {{suffered}} from being {{ahead of its}} time. Interviewed by Charles Shaar Murray in 1972 for the NME, Took commented that [...] "(Record companies) didn't want to buy Steel Abortion or Peppermint Flickstick A bit naughty, the words, but then I'd taken in all this American culture and American society in general, and got chemicalised out of it, a general trip, and put it all into words. Now there's Alice Cooper's School's Out and Killer, Hawkwind and the general thing is there now, and it wasn't there then because they couldn't accept that it was gonna sell. I was saying to 'em. [...] "Look, man, look at the Yanks, because we're about three years behind them as far as youth culture is concerned. This is what's gonna sell."

50|$|On 22 October 2010, {{when the}} trial was nearing its conclusion, Wilders's {{attorney}} Moszkowicz asked for the judges to be substituted because of a perceived bias against his client. Moszkowicz had unsuccessfully asked for substitution before. The second request was made because Tom Schalken, one of the judges {{in the court of}} appeal case that ordered the prosecution of Wilders on 21 January 2009 had allegedly tried to convince a witness in the main trial, Hans Jansen, that {{the trial was}} justified. Moszkowicz <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> witness immediately regarding the alleged conflict of interest, but the court decided it would not hear the witness. The substitution chamber decided that this decision had an appearance of bias and awarded the substitution, thereby ordering a retrial.|$|R
5000|$|No New York was {{released}} in 1978 on record label Antilles without any notice on the Billboard charts. The original album had the lyrics printed {{on the inside of}} the record sleeve, which forced the owner to have to tear apart the sleeve to read them. Critic Richard C. Walls, writing for Creem, described it as the most [...] "ferociously avant-garde and aggressively ugly music since Albert Ayler puked all over my brain back in - what? - 64" [...] and stated [...] "If you're intrepid enough to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> stuff (a friend, 3/4 into the first side, complained that the music was painful - she wasn't referring to any abstract reaction, she was grimacing), be advised that Antilles is a division of Island Records, which ain't exactly Transamerica Corp.

The next day Linet and Lady Jean bring bread to a healed Allen and farm workers. Refusing the food, Allen laments to Linet about working so hard only to gain so little, referring to the poor harvest and telling her how the land was fertile (Green in the Blue). Everyone joins in singing and dancing, but the mood changes suddenly when Lord Godfrey appears. In an attempt to quell the situation, Lady Jean speaks to Godfrey, who repeats his marriage request. Jean speaks again of her love for Percival, whom Godfrey declares is dead. Linet speaks up to her uncle, saying her father is alive; Godfrey doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> and starts yelling. He tells Jean {{this will be the}} last time he asks. As he rides away, Linet chases him on foot saying her father is alive, before running into the woods.|$|E

5000|$|Being a {{community}} radio station, and therefore relying on volunteers, Toodyay didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{be prone to}} the same problems facing other community radio stations, where the availability of its volunteers and presenters can be unpredictable. Toodyay Community Radio took the bold step of turning itself over to its listeners during the day, and overnight, {{by allowing them to}} access part of the station's music library through the station's website, and to request the music that they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> <b>This</b> service differs greatly from request services offered by other radio stations, in that other stations allow you to email the station, and a request gets assigned to the next appropriate program.

It is implied that he has an affair with a woman from this group. He does not want to meet with Jason, whom he blames for Danny's death.Nat—Izzy and Becca's mother. She is the voice of reason for her daughters. She helps Howie and Becca in the moving process, and provides motherly experience to Becca.

This led to a lawsuit and a parting of the ways. In the book Overkill: The Untold Story of Motörhead, author Joel McIver sums up the band's perilous situation: [...] "..For much of 1988 and 1989, the road continued to be Motörhead's home, simply because they had no other option. Although headbangers continued to flock to their shows and the band played with as much venom as ever, it was clear in retrospect that the record industry and Motörhead were never likely to see eye to eye. The last few years had been plagued with logistical difficulties, with the last remaining refuge the tour bus.." [...] Guitarist Würzel is quoted in the insert of the re-mastered CD release, saying; [...] "..A lot of fans were saying that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> line-up on a live album.
