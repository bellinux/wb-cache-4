[...] Heav'n calls us diff'rent ways, on these bestows [...] 40 [...] One proper gift, another grants to those: [...] Not ev'ry man's obliged to sell his store, [...] And give up all his {{substance}} to the poor; [...] Such as are perfect, may, I can't deny; [...] But, by your leaves, divines, so am not I. [...] 45 [...] Full many a saint, since first the world began, [...] Lived an unspotted maid, in spite of man: [...] Let such (a God's name) with fine wheat be fed, [...] And let us honest wives eat barley bread. [...] For me, I'll keep the post assigned by heav'n, [...] 50 [...] And use the copious talent it has giv'n: [...] Let my good spouse pay tribute, do me right, [...] And keep an equal reck'ning ev'ry night: [...] His proper body is not his, but mine; [...] For so said Paul, and Paul's a sound divine.[4] [...] 55 [...] Know then, of those five husbands I have had, [...] Three were just tolerable, two were bad.[5] [...] The three were old, but rich and fond beside, [...] And toiled most piteously to please their bride: [...] But since their wealth, the best they had, was mine, [...] 60 [...] The rest, without much loss, I could resign. [...] Sure to be loved, I took no pains to please,[6] [...] Yet had more pleasure far than they had ease. [...] Presents flowed in apace: with show'rs of gold, [...] They made their court, like Jupiter of old. [...] 65 [...] If I but smiled, a sudden youth they found, [...] And a new palsy seized them when I frowned. [...] Ye sov'reign wives! give ear, and understand, [...] Thus shall ye speak, and exercise command.[7] [...] For never was it giv'n to mortal man, [...] 70 [...] To lie so boldly as we women can: [...] Forswear the fact, though seen with both his eyes, [...] And call your maids to witness how he lies. [...] Hark, old Sir Paul, 'twas thus I us'd to say, [...] Whence is our neighbour's wife so rich and gay? [...] 75 [...] Treated, caressed, where'er she's pleased to roam-- [...] I sit in tatters, and immured at home. [...] Why to her house dost thou so oft repair? [...] Art thou so am'rous? and is she so fair? [...] If I but see a cousin or a friend, [...] 80 [...] Lord! how you swell, and rage like any fiend! [...] But you reel home, a drunken beastly bear, [...] Then preach till midnight in your easy chair; [...] Cry, wives are false, and ev'ry woman evil, [...] And give up all that's female to the devil. [...] 85 [...] If poor, you say she drains her husband's purse; [...] If rich, she keeps her priest, or something worse; [...] If highly born, intolerably vain, [...] Vapours and pride by turns possess her brain, [...] Now gayly mad, now sourly splenetic, [...] 90 [...] Freakish when well, and fretful when she's sick. [...] If fair, then chaste she cannot long abide, [...] By pressing youth attacked on ev'ry side: [...] If foul, her wealth the lusty lover lures, [...] Or else her wit some fool-gallant procures, [...] 95 [...] Or else she dances with becoming grace, [...] Or shape excuses the defects of face. [...] There swims no goose so grey, but soon or late, [...] She finds some honest gander for her mate. [...] Horses, thou say'st, and asses men may try, [...] 100 [...] And ring suspected vessels ere they buy: [...] But wives, a random choice, untried they take, [...] They dream in courtship, but in wedlock wake; [...] Then, nor till then, the veil's removed away, [...] And all the woman glares in open day. [...] 105 [...] You tell me, to preserve your wife's good grace, [...] Your eyes must always languish on my face, [...] Your tongue with constant flatt'ries feed my ear, [...] And tag each sentence with, My life! my dear! [...] If, by strange chance, a modest blush be raised, [...] 110 [...] Be sure my fine complexion must be praised. [...] My garments always must be new and gay, [...] And feasts still kept upon my wedding-day. [...] Then must my nurse be pleased, and fav'rite maid: [...] And endless treats, and endless visits paid, [...] 115 [...] To a long train of kindred, friends, allies; [...] All this thou say'st, and all thou say'st, are lies. [...] On Jenkin too you cast a squinting eye: [...] What! can your 'prentice raise your jealousy? [...] Fresh are his ruddy cheeks, his forehead fair; [...] 120 [...] And like the burnished gold his curling hair. [...] But clear thy wrinkled brow, and quit thy sorrow, [...] I'd scorn your 'prentice, should you die to-morrow. [...] Why are thy chests all locked? on what design? [...] Are not thy worldly goods and treasures mine? [...] 125 [...] Sir, I'm no fool; nor shall you, by St. John, [...] Have goods and body to yourself alone. [...] One you shall quit, in spite of both your eyes; [...] I heed not, I, the bolts, the locks, the spies. [...] If you had wit, you'd say, [...] "Go where you will, [...] 130 [...] Dear spouse, I credit not the tales they tell; [...] Take all the freedoms of a married life; [...] I know thee for a virtuous, faithful wife." [...] Lord! when you have enough, what need you care [...] How merrily soever others fare? [...] 135 [...] Though all the day I give and take delight, [...] Doubt not, sufficient will be left at night. [...] 'Tis but a just and rational desire, [...] To light a taper at a neighbour's fire. [...] There's danger too, you think, in rich array, [...] 140 [...] And none can long be modest that are gay: [...] The cat, if you but singe her tabby skin, [...] The chimney keeps, and sits content within; [...] But once grown sleek, will from her corner run, [...] Sport with her tail, and wanton in the sun; [...] 145 [...] She licks her fair round face, and frisks abroad, [...] To show her fur, and to be catterwawed.[8] [...] Lo thus, my friends, I wrought to my desires [...] These three right ancient venerable sires. [...] I told 'em, Thus you say, and thus you do, [...] 150 [...] And told 'em false, but Jenkin swore 'twas true. [...] I, like a dog, could bite as well as whine, [...] And first complained, whene'er the guilt was mine.[9] [...] I taxed them oft with wenching and amours, [...] When their weak legs scarce dragged 'em out of doors; [...] 155 [...] And swore the rambles that I took by night, [...] Were all to spy what damsels they bedight. [...] That colour brought me many hours of mirth;[10] [...] For all this wit is given us from our birth; [...] Heav'n gave to woman the peculiar grace, [...] 160 [...] To spin, to weep, and cully human race. [...] By this nice conduct, and this prudent course, [...] By murm'ring, wheedling, stratagem, and force, [...] I still prevailed, and would be in the right, [...] Or curtain lectures made a restless night. [...] 165 [...] If once my husband's arm was o'er my side, [...] What! so familiar <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse?</b> I cried: [...] I levied first a tax upon his need: [...] Then let him--'twas a nicety indeed! [...] Let all mankind this certain maxim hold, [...] 170 [...] Marry who will, our sex is to be sold. [...] With empty hands no tassels you can lure,[11] [...] But fulsome love for gain we can endure; [...] For gold we love the impotent and old, [...] And heave, and pant, and kiss, and cling, for gold. [...] 175 [...] Yet with embraces, curses oft I've mixed, [...] Then kissed again, and chid, and railed betwixt. [...] Well, I may make my will in peace, and die, [...] For not one word in man's arrears am I. [...] To drop a dear dispute I was unable, [...] 180 [...] Ev'n though the Pope himself had sat at table.[12] [...] But when my point was gained, then thus I spoke, [...] "Billy, my dear, how sheepishly you look? [...] Approach, my spouse, and let me kiss thy cheek; [...] Thou should'st be always thus resigned and meek! [...] 185 [...] Of Job's great patience since so oft you preach, [...] Well should you practise, who so well can teach. [...] 'Tis difficult to do, I must allow, [...] But I, my dearest, will instruct you how. [...] Great is the blessing of a prudent wife, [...] 190 [...] Who puts a period to domestic strife. [...] One of us two must rule, and one obey; [...] } [...] And since in man right reason bears the sway, [...] } [...] Let that frail thing, weak woman, have her way. } [...] The wives of all my family have ruled [...] 195 [...] Their tender husbands, and their passions cooled. [...] Fye, 'tis unmanly thus to sigh and groan; [...] What! would you have me to yourself alone? [...] Why take me, love! take all and ev'ry part! [...] Here's your revenge! you love it at your heart. [...] 200 [...] Would I vouchsafe to sell what nature gave, [...] You little think what custom I could have. [...] But see! I'm all your own--nay hold--for shame! [...] What means my dear--indeed--you are to blame." [...] Thus with my first three lords I passed my life; [...] 205 [...] A very woman, and a very wife. [...] What sums from these old spouses I could raise, [...] Procured young husbands in my riper days. [...] Though past my bloom,[13] not yet decayed was I, [...] Wanton and wild, and chattered like a pye. [...] 210 [...] In country dances still I bore the bell. [...] And sung as sweet as ev'ning Philomel. [...] To clear my quail-pipe, and refresh my soul, [...] Full oft I drained the spicy nut-brown bowl; [...] Rich luscious wines, that youthful blood improve, [...] 215 [...] And warm the swelling veins to feats of love: [...] For 'tis as sure as cold ingenders hail, [...] A liqu'rish mouth must have a lech'rous tail; [...] Wine lets no lover unrewarded go, [...] As all true gamesters by experience know. [...] 220 [...] But oh, good gods! whene'er a thought I cast [...] On all the joys of youth and beauty past, [...] To find in pleasures I have had my part, [...] Still warms me to the bottom of my heart. [...] This wicked world was once my dear delight; [...] 225 [...] Now all my conquests, all my charms, good night! [...] The flour consumed, the best that now I can, [...] Is e'en to make my market of the bran.[14] [...] My fourth dear spouse was not exceeding true! [...] He kept, 'twas thought, a private miss or two: [...] 230 [...] But all that score I paid--as how? you'll say, [...] Not with my body, in a filthy way: [...] But I so dressed, and danced, and drank, and dined; [...] And viewed a friend, with eyes so very kind, [...] As stung his heart, and made his marrow fry,[15] [...] 235 [...] With burning rage, and frantic jealousy. [...] His soul, I hope, enjoys eternal glory, [...] For here on earth I was his purgatory. [...] Oft, when his shoe the most severely wrung, [...] He put on careless airs, and sat and sung. [...] 240 [...] How sore I galled him, only heav'n could know, [...] And he that felt, and I that caused the woe. [...] He died, when last from pilgrimage I came, [...] With other gossips, from Jerusalem;[16] [...] And now lies buried underneath a rood,[17] [...] 245 [...] Fair to be seen, and reared of honest wood. [...] A tomb indeed, with fewer sculptures graced, [...] Than that Mausolus' pious widow placed,[18] [...] Or where inshrined the great Darius lay; [...] But cost on graves is merely thrown away. [...] 250 [...] The pit filled up, with turf we covered o'er; [...] So bless the good man's soul, I say no more. [...] Now for my fifth loved lord, the last and best; [...] (Kind heav'n afford him everlasting rest) [...] Full hearty was his love, and I can shew [...] 255 [...] The tokens on my ribs in black and blue; [...] Yet, with a knack, my heart he could have won, [...] While yet the smart was shooting in the bone. [...] How quaint an appetite in woman reigns! [...] Free gifts we scorn, and love what costs us pains: [...] 260 [...] Let men avoid us, and on them we leap; [...] A glutted market makes provision cheap.[19] [...] In pure good will I took this jovial spark, [...] Of Oxford he, a most egregious clerk. [...] He boarded with a widow in the town,[20] [...] 265 [...] A trusty gossip, one dame Alison. [...] Full well the secrets of my soul she knew, [...] Better than e'er our parish priest could do. [...] To her I told whatever could befall: [...] Had but my husband pissed against a wall, [...] 270 [...] Or done a thing that might have cost his life, [...] She, and my niece, and one more worthy wife, [...] Had known it all: what most he would conceal, [...] To these I made no scruple to reveal. [...] Oft has he blushed from ear to ear for shame, [...] 275 [...] That e'er he told a secret to his dame.|$|E

5000|$|Over time, {{the model}} of Anthony and other hermits {{attracted}} many followers, who lived alone in the desert or in small groups.

Thousands joined them in the desert, mostly men but also a handful of women. Religious seekers also began going to the desert seeking advice and counsel from the early Desert Fathers. By the time of Anthony's death, there were so many men and women living in the desert in celibacy that it was described as [...] "a city" [...] by Anthony's biographer.

5000|$|Kierkegaard wrote {{much about}} the {{validity}} of marriage in all his books with this same idea in mind. Again, you can know everything in an objective way about marriage but its only when you actually decide to get married that you stand alone <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> and live the married life. He says, [...] "It is told that Socrates is supposed to have answered someone who asked him about marriage: Marry or do not marry-you will regret both. Socrates was an ironist who presumably concealed his wisdom and truth ironically lest it become local gossip, but he was not a mocker. The questioner's stupidity lies precisely in asking a third person for something one can never learn from a third person." [...] The Good is always a good gift from God: [...] Marriage likes deserters just as little as it allows one to serve two masters. Solomon puts it beautifully when he says that he who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains a good gift from God-or, to modernize the saying a bit, to him who falls in love, the god has been gracious. If he marries the beloved, he does a good deed and does well to finish what he has begun.|$|E
5000|$|The use of paywalls {{has also}} {{received}} many complaints from online news readers regarding an online subscriptions inability {{to be shared}} like a traditional printed paper. While a printed paper can be shared among friends and family, the ethics behind sharing an online subscription are less clear {{because there is no}} physical object involved. The New York Times [...] "ethicist" [...] columnist, Ariel Kaminer, addressing the question of sharing online subscription, states that [...] "sharing <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse</b> or young child is one thing; sharing with friends or family who live elsewhere is another." [...] The reader comments following Kaminers response focus on the dichotomy between paying for a printed paper and paying for an online subscription. A printed papers ease of access meant that more individuals could read a single copy, and that everyone who read the paper had the ability to send {{a letter to the editor}} without the hassle of registering or paying for the subscription. As such, the use of a paywall closes off the communication in both the personal realm and online. This opinion is not just held by online news readers, but also by opinion writers. Jimmy Wales comments that he [...] "would rather write opinion piece where it is going to be read", declaring that [...] "putting opinion pieces behind paywalls makes no sense." [...] Without easy access to both read and share insights and opinions, the online news platform loses an essential characteristic of democratic exchange.|$|E

40|$|Caregiving has multidimensional {{effects on}} the lives of spousal {{caregivers}} that in turn have an impact upon the care they provide to the individuals who have survived a stroke. It is important to examine the experiences of spousal caregivers from their perspective. This is a phenomenological study on the experiences of spousal caregivers for survivors of a stroke. Eight spouses (five females, three males) participated in the study. van Manen's (1997) approach was used to examine the spousal caregivers' experiences. Data were collected through audio-taped unstructured interviews. The interviews were transcribed verbatim to form textual descriptions of the caregivers' experience with caregiving. From data analysis six themes were explicated which together form the essence of the experience of the spousal caregivers. These interrelated themes were 1) experiencing a profound sense of loss, 2) adjusting to a new relationship <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse,</b> 3) taking on new responsibilities, 4) feeling the demands of caregiving, 5) having to depend on the support of others, and 6) maintaining hope and optimism.

It often {{reminds me of the}} the song “Now that we found love ” written by Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff and {{originally}} released on The O'Jays ’ (1973) album Ship Ahoy. In-memory technology—as considered by Gartner (2011) and Dutta & Bilbao-Osorio, (2012), for example, and discussed on BPTrends by Frankel (2012), among others—enables a remarkable increase in the information-processing capacity of organizations ’ application systems. For example, SAP reports increases in transaction speed by factors up to 100, 000 for its in-memory computing appliance, HANA (High-performance ANalytic Appliance). This increase in speed is comparable to improving the flight time from New York to Paris to 0. 28 seconds or that of circling the world to 1. 5 seconds (SAP, 2012 a). Truly, such acceleration goes beyond our imagination on what we can achieve through process improvement. “Imagine this speed increase: How would you plan your weekend <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse?</b> ” Martin Petry, CIO of the Hilti Corporation, asked. “You might actually consider visiting two or three continents as opposed to going shopping in th...|$|E
40|$|How does a person's mood during {{technology}} training influence motivation, intentions, and, ultimately, {{usage of}} the new technol-ogy? Do these mood effects dissipate or are they sustainable over time? A repeated-measures field study (n 5 316) investigated the effect of mood on employee motivation and intentions toward using a specific computer technology at two points in time: imme-diately after training and 6 weeks after training. Actual usage behavior was assessed for 12 weeks after training. Each individ-ual was {{assigned to one of}} three mood treatments: positive, nega-tive, or control. Results indicated that there were only short-term boosts in intrinsic motivation and intention to use the technology among individuals in the positive mood intervention.

30|$|Among {{the wide}} range of {{questions}} asked of the LOSEF respondents, those that are relevant to this study concern (1) satisfaction with their spouse and (2) the share of housework performed by the respondents and their spouse on weekdays and weekends. Regarding the former, the LOSEF specifically asks, “How satisfied are you <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse?</b> Please answer by using the following scale from one to six, one being ‘completely unhappy’ and six being ‘completely happy.’” 3 Regarding the latter, the LOSEF specifically asks, “In your current household, approximately what percentage of household chores (e.g., child care, cooking, cleaning, and yard work) are taken on by (i) yourself, (ii) your spouse/partner, and (iii) other family/household member(s). Percentages should sum to 100.” This questionnaire is adapted from Goldin and Katz’s (2008) questionnaire but asks the respondents to provide separate answers to this question for weekdays and weekends. In Japan, the other family members mentioned by married women include children more often than respondents’ parents/stepparents and/or respondents’ siblings because 85.1  % of married women in the LOSEF sample live with their children, whereas only 14.7  % of married women live with their parents/stepparents and/or their siblings. The rarity of outsourcing housework in Japan is shown by the fact that only 0.78  % of the LOSEF sample reports using housecleaning services more than once a year.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{study had}} four objectives, the major one being the {{identification}} of the common professional competencies for adequate performance as a Baptist clergyman. A second objective was to determine the common professional competencies needed by Baptist pastors and ministers of education. The determination if significantly different competencies were required for the pastor and the minister of education was the third objective. The final objective was to formulate recommendations which would be applicable in developing a curriculum for clergy preparation. A 90 -item mail-administered questionnaire was developed by a jury panel of experts (six pastors, three laymen, two professors, a minister of education and an associational official). A randomly selected population of 188 respondents, 80 ministers of education and 108 pastors equally distributed between two Baptist church associations, were asked to indicate on a five-point Likert-type scale the level of proficiency necessary for each competency in relation to their ministry. Data were analyzed by using a two-way analysis of variance and factor analytic techniques. Selected Findings The two-way analysis of variance revealed that no significant differences existed between the scores assigned by clergy of the two Baptist church associations to 64 of the 90 competencies and that no significant differences existed between the scores assigned by pastors and ministers of education to 75 of the 90 competencies. No significant interaction existed between associations and types of personnel in 89 of the 90 competencies. An R-technique factor analysis was utilized to identify common professional competencies. A three factor solution generated 68 competencies that had factor loadings of ±. 45 or higher. Factors identified were: 1. Factor I, Administration, was a general factor with four subfactors. Sub-factor Ia was named Program Development. Subfactor Ib was named Program Operation. Sub-factor Ic was named Community Relations and Sub-factor Id was named Counseling. 2. Factor II, Leadership, was a general factor with two subfactors. Sub-factor IIa was named Individual Ability and Interpersonal Relations was the name given to Sub-factor lib. 3. Factor III, Management, was a general factor with two subfactors. Sub-factor Ma was named Human Resources and Subfactor Illb was named Financial Resources. Five of the ten highest mean ranked competencies dealt with personal relationships. The highest mean ranked competency was Establish and maintain a meaningful and Biblical relationship <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>spouse.</b> The lowest mean ranked competency was Take responsibilities for leadership in civic or community activities. A Q-technique factor analysis revealed a commonality among the respondents to the degree that both pastors and ministers of education could be grouped as clergymen. Recommendations It was recommended that: 1. Baptist clergy recognize the Biblical concept of equipping others for ministry. 2. Baptist clergy become more involved in civic responsibilites. 3. Baptist clergy develop a more balanced ministry including evangelism, preaching, and the training of others for ministry. 4. Clergy preparation could essentially be one program for pastors or ministers of education. 5. Clergy preparation include additional psychology courses to expand self-perception abilities and the establishing of interpersonal relationships. 6. The establishing of a competency based clergy educational program will, of necessity, involve leaders within the local churches. 7. Other church associations with similar theological positions be the subject of further research...|$|E
