The {{aim of the}} work is to solve new {{problems of}} <b>waves</b> <b>diffraction</b> using a system of cylindrical inhomogeneities in hydrodynamic and electroconducting medium; to carry out numerical analysis of the effects connected with scatterers properties variability, multiconnectiveness and medium conduction. A procedure for the solution of multiply connected diffraction problem as applied to heterogeneous scatterers and to electroconducting media has been developed. Infinite systems properties have been investigated. Expressions for scattered fields characteristic in far-field zone have been derived.
