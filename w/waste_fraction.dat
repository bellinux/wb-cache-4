50|$|In the Eskilstuna municipality, all {{household}} {{solid waste}} is recycled with optical color sorting since 2011, {{which is a}} new way of recycling. Each <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> has its own colored recyclable plastic bag and is disposed of in the same garbage bin. By using optical color sorting, house owners are able to sort out organic food waste, plastic, metal and paper packaging, newspapers and household waste. The organic food waste is then used to produce biogas and the other five fractions are recycled and reused. The system of six different fractions is unique of its kind in Europe.|$|E

50|$|Transportable semi-mobile {{installations}} {{have gained}} increasing {{popularity in the}} last two decades. They are enabled by the fact that complete sensor-based sorting systems are relatively compact in relation to the capacity in tonnes per hour. This is mainly because little infrastructure is needed. The picture shows a containerised sensor-based sorter which is applied in Chromitite sorting. The system is operated in conjunction with a Diesel-powered mobile crusher and screen. Material handling of the feed, undersize fraction, product and <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> is conducted using a wheel loader. The system is powered by a Diesel generator and a compressor station delivers the instrument quality air needed for the operation.Semi-mobile installations are applied primarily to minimise material handling and save transport costs. Another reason for choosing the semi-mobile option for an installation is bulk testing of new ore bodies.Capacity of a system very much depends on the size fraction sorted, but a 250tph capacity is a good estimate for semi-mobile installations, considering a capacity of 125tph sorter feed and 125tph undersize material.During the last decade both generic plant designs and customised designs have been developed, for example in the framework of the i2mine project.|$|E
50|$|The oldest form {{of mineral}} {{processing}} practiced since the Stone Age is hand-picking. Georgius Agricola also describes hand-picking is his book De re metallica in 1556. Sensor-based sorting is the automation and extension to hand picking. In addition to sensors that measure visible differences like color (and the further {{interpretation of the}} data regarding texture and shape), other sensors are available on industrial scale sorters {{that are able to}} measure differences invisible for the human eye (EM, XRT, NIR).The principles of the technology and the first machinery has been developed since the 1920s (. Nevertheless, widely applied and standard technology {{it is only in the}} industrial minerals and gemstone segments. Mining is benefiting from the step change developments in sensing and computing technologies and from machine development in the recycling and food processing industries.In 2002, Cutmore and Eberhard stated that the relatively small installed base of sensor-based sorters in mining is more a result of insufficient industry interest than any technical barriers to their effective use Nowadays sensor-based sorting is beginning to reveal its potential in various applications in basically all segments of mineral production (industrial minerals, gemstones, base-metals, precious metals, ferrous metals, fuel). Precondition is physical liberation in coarse size ranges (~10 - 300 mm) to make physical separation possible. Either the product fraction, but more often the <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> needs to be liberated. If liberation is present, there is good potential that one of available detection technologies on today's sensor-based sorters can positively or negatively identify one of the two desired fractions.|$|E

40|$|In my Graduation Thesis I {{deal with}} the problem of {{collecting}} and disposing of communal waste in Šentjernej municipality. I represent introducing of and setting up a system of separately collecting communal <b>waste</b> <b>fractions,</b> setting up locations for separate fractions collectors, building up collecting & recycling centre and a system of control over the contractor. It is important that in these maters, the existing legislation and law directives in the Republic of Slovenia and also the directives from the European Union are followed. One of the procedures for reducing the quantities of disposed waste is separate collecting of communal <b>waste</b> <b>fractions</b> at source. The advantage of this system is that the waste is more or less pure at source, therefore we can achieve the best quantity and quality of separately collected fractions and the cost for further recycling is lower. In separate fraction collectors we separately collect: paper, glass, plastic and metal. With this approach of collecting waste we significantly reduce the quantity of disposed waste and also get secondary raw materials. There are 19 separate fractions collectors and one collecting & recycling centre planned on the area of Šentjernej municipality. Separate collecting of communal <b>waste</b> <b>fractions</b> on source is being carried out not only {{for the benefit of the}} present generation, but also for the benefit of the next generations. It is important that we properly introduce the system of separately collecting communal <b>waste</b> <b>fractions</b> as well as encourage environmental awareness for both will bring long-term financial benefits and a better culture of living to inhabitants of Šentjernej municipality...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} how in-tank measurements of moisture (H{sub 2 }O) and {{total organic carbon}} (TOC) are used to calculate combustible waste fractions (CWF) for 138 of the 149 Hanford single shell tanks. The combustible <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> of a tank is defined as that proportion of waste {{that is capable of}} burning when exposed to an ignition source. These CWF estimates are used to screen tanks for the organics complexant safety issue. Tanks with a suitably low fraction of combustible waste are classified as safe. The calculations in this report determine the combustible waste fractions in tanks under two different moisture conditions: under current moisture conditions, and after complete dry out. The first fraction is called the wet combustible <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> (wet CWF) and the second is called the dry combustible <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> (dry CWF). These two fractions are used to screen tanks into three categories: if the wet CWF is too high (above 5 %), the tank is categorized as unsafe; if the wet CWF is low but the dry CWF is too high (again, above 5 %), the tank is categorized as conditionally safe; finally, if both the wet and dry CWF are low, the tank is categorized as safe. Section 2 describes the data that was required for these calculations. Sections 3 and 4 describe the statistical model and resulting fit for dry combustible waste fractions. Sections 5 and 6 present the statistical model used to estimate wet CWF and the resulting fit.

40|$|Background: Depletion of {{petroleum}} resources has enforced {{the search for}} alternative sources of renewable energy. Introduction of biofuels into the market was expected to become {{a solution to this}} disadvantageous situation. Attempts to cover fuel demand have, however, caused another severe problem—the waste glycerol generated during biodiesel production at a concentration of approximately 10 % w/w. This, in turn, prompted a global search for effective methods of valorization of the <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> of glycerol. Results: Utilization of the <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> at 48  h with an initial glycerol concentration of 30  g·L- 1 and proceeding with 62 % efficiency enabled the production of 9  g·L- 1 dihydroxyacetone at 50 % substrate consumption.

40|$|The {{initiative}} to realise a waste incinerator facility {{was taken in}} 1986 by the waste treatment company ‘Vuilafvoer Maatschappij NV’ (VAM) {{in the village of}} Wijster. This village is incorporated in the municipality of Beilen, which is located in the province of Drenthe. The VAM company has a long tradition of composting the Dutch biodegradable <b>waste</b> <b>fraction.</b> The compostable fraction is taken there by train from all over the country. As a result of terminating the traditional process, the <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> that had to be deposited (at the same location) increased tremendously, which resulted in an increase in the deposited volume of 6 million cubic meters in about 7 years. At that time the existing landfill had nearly reached its maximum capacity. In order to reduce the fraction of the processed waste that had to be dumped, the VAM company proposed to build a waste incineration facility. The incinerator was planned to reach a maximum capacity of 350, 000 tons/year of domestic waste. In order to build this incinerator several phases had to be passed: the environmental impact assessment, the provincial waste plan, the region plan, and changing the local land use plans.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{recycling}} performance for some waste fractions selected including food waste, bulk waste, paper, metal products, plastics/rubber and glass products and then to develop some directions for the future improvements. The priority of each <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> for recycling is also analyzed by using an importance-performance analysis. Traditionally, the recycling rate that is calculated by the ratio of waste recycled to waste collected is used as an indicator to measure recycling performance. Due to a large variation among waste fractions in municipal solid waste (MSW), the recycling rate cannot reflect the actual recycling performance. The ceiling of recycling rate for each <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> estimated from the diffusion models is incorporated into a model to calculate recycling performance. The results show that (1) the diffusion effect exists significantly for the recycling of most recyclables but no evidence is found to support the diffusion effect for the recycling of food waste and bulk waste; (2) the recycling performance of waste metal products ranks the top, compared to waste paper, waste glass and other waste fractions; (3) furthermore, an importance-performance analysis (IPA) is employed to analyze the priority of recycling programs and thus this paper suggests that the recycling of food waste should be seen as the most priority item to recycle...|$|E
40|$|The final {{disposal}} of waste in sanitary landfill generates environmental impacts {{in the form of}} gaseous emissions and effluents in the seepage water. In product specicic Life Cycle Assessments, these environmental impacts resulting from the disposal of the product under study frequently have a strong influence on the overall results. The Sanitary Landfill (SL), like the Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI), is a complex system with a large variety of different types of waste with varying input composition. A direct determination of the environmental impacts resulting from the landfilling of a single input component, e. g. by measurements, is not possible. The model approach described in this paper shows an operationalized concept for the allocation of the environmental effects caused by the landfill process to special input components. The calculation of the landfill emissions in the model is based on the emission spectrum (landfill gas and seepage water) of an average-sized landfi ll in Germany and the elementary composition of the single <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> under consideration. The resulting reactor landfill module comprises an average split for diffuse and captured landfill emissions, the use of captured landfill gases in a gas engine and a cleaning of captured seepage water in a waste water treatment plant.

As waste management issues gain public awareness, concern has risen about the appropriateness of various disposal methods. The objective of this work is the environmental assessment of different municipal solid waste treatment strategies for the city of Thessaloniki, within the methodological frameworks of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the Integrated Solid Waste Management strategy, taking into account social, environmental and economic effects. The waste management methods in this study include: landfill of all <b>waste</b> <b>fractions,</b> recycling of paper, and anaerobic digestion of food waste in a biological treatment plant. The <b>waste</b> <b>fractions</b> considered are the total amount of food, paper and plastic waste produced in Thessaloniki during the period of one year. Environmental impacts are decreased when the solid waste management methods include some kind of recovery from waste. The results of this work indicate that paper recycling and anaerobic digestion of food waste is preferable compared to landfilling. It is also shown that landfilling of food waste utilizing the biocells method is more attractive than anaerobic digestion in a separate plant; nevertheless, energy recovery is about 45 % lower. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model was obtained from estimations of the higher heating value (HHV) and standard entropy of MSW using statistical analysis. The ultimate analysis of 56 different parts of MSW was used for the derivation of the HHV expression. In addition, 30 extra parts were used for validation. One hundred and seventeen relevant organic substances that represented the main constituents in MSW were used for derivation of the standard entropy of solid waste. The substances were divided into different waste fractions, and the standard entropies of each <b>waste</b> <b>fraction</b> and for the complete mixture were calculated. The specific chemical exergy of inorganic matter in the waste was also investigated by considering the inorganic compounds in the ash.
