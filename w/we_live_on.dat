500|$|Partially in {{an effort}} to counter-act {{negative}} publicity from oil sands-related issues—for example, the March 2009 edition of National Geographic Magazine contained a 20-page article portraying Alberta's oil sands operations as being highly environmentally damaging—in 2009 Stelmach's government spent $25million on a rebranding campaign for the province. Among other things, it replaced the [...] "Alberta Advantage" [...] slogan that had long been in use with [...] "Alberta: Freedom to create. [...] Spirit to achieve." [...] The campaign became the subject of some ridicule when the Edmonton Journal revealed that one of the photos used in it was not taken in Alberta, but at a North Sea beach in Northumberland. While the government initially claimed that it had intentionally used a foreign image to represent Alberta's engagement with the world, it later admitted that this was not the case, and that the photo had been used in error. [...] Stelmach responded to the image, which showed two children running along a beach, by saying that [...] "children, no matter where they are around the world, they are the next generation. And air quality, water quality, no matter where <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> this big globe, we're all responsible, and that's the message we're trying to portray." ...|$|E
500|$|The Beagle reached Ascension Island on 19 July 1836, and Darwin {{was delighted}} to receive letters from his sisters with news that Sedgwick had written [...] "He is doing admirably in S. America, & has already sent home a Collection above all praise.— It {{was the best thing}} in the world for him that he went out on the Voyage of Discovery— There was some risk of his turning out an idle man: but his {{character}} will now be fixed, & if God spare his life, he will have a great name among the Naturalists of Europe." [...] Darwin later recalled how he [...] "clambered over the mountains... with a bounding step and made the volcanic rocks resound under my geological hammer!." [...] He agreed with the saying attributed to the people of St Helena that [...] "We know <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder", and noted the care taken to sustain [...] "houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain". (In the 1840s Darwin worked with Hooker, who proposed in 1847 that the Royal Navy import tree species, a project started in 1850 which {{led to the creation of}} an artificial cloud forest.) ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, {{following}} speculation as {{to which}} label From Autumn to Ashes would release their next record, the band signed to Vagrant Records and enlisted Garth [...] "GGGarth" [...] Richardson as producer. After performing on the 2003 Warped Tour, they released their second full-length album, The Fiction <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> <b>on</b> September 9, 2003, which again featured vocals from Melanie Wills on the song [...] "Autumn's Monologue". The album was described as more melodic in sound than Too Bad You're Beautiful, which had a more [...] "hardcore sound." [...] Perri explained that The Fiction We Lives songs had more structure than their debut release, and {{was the result of}} the band's time together. Aubin Paul of Punk News viewed the release as a growth from Too Bad You're Beautiful, writing that [...] "like their previous , [...] contains its share of PSAT words, and overtly maudlin pseudo-poetry, but it's still a big improvement". The move to a larger label and slightly more commercialized sound allowed the band to find more mainstream success, producing three singles, [...] "The After Dinner Payback", [...] "Lilacs & Lolita" [...] and [...] "Milligram Smile". The song [...] "The After Dinner Payback" [...] also appeared on the soundtrack for the horror film Freddy vs. Jason. For the following months, the group toured the country, also playing on the 2004 Warped Tour, during which time Josh Newton (bass) joined, as Pilato left along with Gross.|$|E

2500|$|In 1836 the Beagle voyage visited Ascension. Charles Darwin {{described}} it as an arid treeless island, with nothing growing near the coast. Sparse vegetation inland supported [...] "about six hundred sheep, many goats, a few cows & horses", large numbers of guineafowl imported from the Cape Verde islands, rats, mice, and land crabs; he agreed with the saying attributed {{to the people of}} St Helena that [...] "We know <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder". He noted the care taken to sustain [...] "houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain", and cisterns at roadsides to provide drinking water. The springs were carefully managed, [...] "so that a single drop of water may not be lost: indeed the whole island may be compared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order." [...] In commenting on this, he noted René Primevère Lesson's remark [...] "that the English nation alone would have thought of making the island of Ascension a productive spot; any other people would have held it as a mere fortress in the ocean." ...|$|E
