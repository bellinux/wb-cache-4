25|$|Believing {{the game}} {{could also be}} a success on the PC, Interplay's Feargus Urquhart and David Perry {{contacted}} Polish developers CD Projekt. As Poland was known for only developing PC games, Urquhart and Perry believed Projekt <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> team to port Dark Alliance to PC. Sebastian Zieliński, developer of Mortyr 2093-1944, which Interplay had published, was placed in charge of the project, with Adam Badowski, a film storyboard artist, hired as designer. A PlayStation 2 development kit was smuggled from Interplay's offices in London to Poland, and work on the port began. However, almost immediately, Interplay cancelled development.|$|E

Dobermann served in the dangerous role of local tax collector, and ran the Apolda dog pound. With access to dogs of many breeds, he aimed to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him during his collections, which took him through many bandit-infested areas. He set out to breed a new type of dog that, in his opinion, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> combination of strength, speed, endurance, loyalty, intelligence, and ferocity. Later, Otto Goeller and Philip Greunig continued to develop the breed to become the dog that is seen today.|$|E
25|$|Herb Stempel was a {{contestant}} on Twenty One who was {{coached by}} the show's producer Dan Enright. While Stempel {{was in the}} midst of his winning streak, both of the $64,000 quiz shows were in the top-ten rated programs but Twenty One did not have the same popularity. Enright and his partner Albert Freedman were searching for a new champion to replace Stempel to boost ratings. They soon found what they were looking for in Charles Van Doren. Van Doren was an English teacher at Columbia University when a friend suggested he try out for a quiz show. Van Doren decided to try out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough. Enright, who produced both Tic-Tac-Dough and Twenty One, saw Van Doren's tryout and was familiar with his prestigious family background that included multiple Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and highly respected professors at Columbia University. As a result, Enright felt that Van Doren <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> contestant to be the new face of Twenty One.|$|E

25|$|The film had {{its roots}} in an earlier concept for a new King Kong feature {{developed}} by Willis O'Brien, animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien {{came up with a}} proposed treatment, King Kong meets Frankenstein, where Kong would fight against a giant version of Frankenstein's monster in San Francisco. O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art and a screenplay treatment) to RKO to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed King Kong vs. the Ginko when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to King Kong vs. Prometheus, returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (The Modern Prometheus was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of stop-motion animation discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio Toho, which had long wanted to make a King Kong film and was also planning for Godzilla to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have Shinichi Sekizawa rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> way to celebrate its thirtieth year in production. It was one of 5 big banner releases for the company to celebrate the anniversary alongside Sanjuro, , Lonely Lane, and Born in Sin. John Beck's dealings with Willis O'Brien's project were done behind his back and O'Brien was never credited for his idea. In 1963, Merian C. Cooper attempted to file a lawsuit against John Beck claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through as it turned out he was not Kong's sole legal owner as he had previously believed.|$|E

Simon Miller from VideoGamer.com thought that the game fulfilled its purpose as an Xbox One launch title, and demonstrated the power of the console. Andrew Reiner from Game Informer considered that the game's cinematic as [...] "towering achievements of visual design".

The intention was to make the song emotionally intense, {{but at the same time}} [...] "cold" [...] and [...] "empty". While writing the song, Chihiro was inspired by Zero's presentation within the game. The original draft of the song was created in around five minutes, and Chihiro had to sing the song five times before Okabe was satisfied with her performance. The song debuted in the game's trailer at the 2013 Tokyo Game Show.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor {{was originally devised}} by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited one piece of this concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people [...] "wouldn't mess with", {{he would not have}} to raise his voice as [...] "other characters [...] shut up and listen" [...] or face the consequences. Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a StarCraft film was produced, he believed Clive Owen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> choice to play Raynor due to him [...] "being dangerous".|$|E

Tooms was the first villain in the show's history to make an appearance in a second episode. It was actor Doug Hutchison's idea to play Tooms nude during the escalator sequence, a decision which Carter felt [...] "caused a little discomfort", but that [...] "actually added to the scene". The bile-like substance coating Tooms and his nest was actually a yellow piping gel, which the cast found would stick to their skin and pull out hair upon removal.

[...] The crew recruited scores of extras and all manner of surrealist street performers to appear in the video. On October 11, 2009, Thirty Seconds to Mars shut down Santa Monica Pier and filmed a segment of the short film along with a group of cyclists.

Stackpole said later of the experience, [...] "the artists were in from the first. They were called in conference and assumed responsibility and personal pride in the building." [...] At the Sansome Street tower entrance, Stackpole worked on a scaffolding with a crew of assistants to direct carve heroic figures in stone. After the building was completed, Stackpole was finally successful in winning a commission for Rivera; Pflueger became convinced that Rivera <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> muralist for decorating the staircase wall and ceiling of the Stock Exchange Club. This was a controversial selection considering Rivera's leftist political beliefs in contradiction to the Stock Exchange's capitalist foundation.

The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma wrote on his blog that there was originally a discussion among the staff of the show about how the sequence would be scored. According to Ledesma, Jean [...] "wanted something hustly-bustly that represented New York City. Thoughts immediately turned to the music of George Gershwin. Woody Allen had used 'Rhapsody in Blue' to great effect in Manhattan and probably connected forever in people’s minds the black & white images of New York with the melodies of that piece."

Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's attempt to split that difference." [...] Sanneh reports that the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", one of the band's anti-war song, [...] "sounds suspiciously like Green Day; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day's 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'." [...] Despite this, Sanneh {{goes on to say that}} Yellowcard is still [...] "pretty good" [...] at [...] "writing sweeping, upbeat punk-rock love songs". Ben Breier of Kent News wrote: [...] "One thing is certain: The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us. The band has vastly matured when compared to past records, but it comes at a price [...] members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place. It's clearly the right direction for the band, but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters, who was somewhat displeased with the album, wrote that the album does not [...] "make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album". Schiller went on to say, [...] "Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard’s attempt at a big, serious album, but the band doesn’t sound even remotely ready." [...] Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Those who register for Pop-Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard’s Lights And Sounds as their first set-work; the Jacksonville quintet's new album <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>perfect</b> teaching aid, as it's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise."
