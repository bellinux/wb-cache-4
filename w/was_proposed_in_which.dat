5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{announced}} plans to upgrade the route to main line railway standards and extend the line to Oxford, creating a through route from Aylesbury to Oxford. If built, the line {{would have been the}} shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford at the time. Despite the backing of the wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by the costly tunnelling proposed, and the Duke was unable to raise sufficient funds. In 1888 a cheaper scheme <b>was</b> <b>proposed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the line would be built to a lower standard and wind around hills to avoid tunnelling. In anticipation of this, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad. Although the existing line was upgraded in 1894, the extension to Oxford was never built. Instead, the operation of the Brill Tramway was taken over by London's Metropolitan Railway, and Brill became one of their two north-western termini. The line was rebuilt a second time in 1910, and more advanced locomotives were introduced, allowing trains to run faster.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} debates {{about whether the}} {{original}} gene duplication events occurred in a salivary gland or in body tissues themselves. The prevailing idea for many years is the birth-and-death model described above, in which genes in other body tissues are duplicated and then recruited to the venom gland before natural selection for toxicity. However, in 2014 a new model <b>was</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> salivary protein genes are duplicated and then restricted to the venom gland. This model does away with the recruitment hypothesis and cites the homology between certain venom and body genes as unrelated in the linear fashion described in the traditional birth-and-death model.|$|E

25|$|By 1872 the {{disagreement}} over an interior or coastal route was raging and a compromise <b>was</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the line {{would be built}} with two branches. The government recommended a twin-armed line on 5 April 1873 and was approved in Parliament on 5 June. Detailed surveying was led by Carl Abraham Pihl and concluded on 31 March 1874.

With increasing cost estimates, Parliament decided to reduce the standard on the Eastern Line. The line was approved with 59 against 42 votes in Parliament on 4 June 1874.|$|E
25|$|In this {{approach}} the physical vacuum {{is viewed as}} the quantum superfluid which is essentially non-relativistic whereas the Lorentz symmetry is not an exact symmetry of nature but rather the approximate description valid only for the small fluctuations of the superfluid background. Within {{the framework of the}} approach a theory <b>was</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the physical vacuum is conjectured to be the quantum Bose liquid whose ground-state wavefunction is described by the logarithmic Schrödinger equation. It was shown that the relativistic gravitational interaction arises as the small-amplitude collective excitation mode whereas relativistic elementary particles can be described by the particle-like modes in the limit of low momenta. The important fact is that at very high velocities the behavior of the particle-like modes becomes distinct from the relativistic one - they can reach the speed of light limit at finite energy; also, faster-than-light propagation is possible without requiring moving objects to have imaginary mass.|$|E
500|$|The most heated argument, however, was {{the issue}} of US60. [...] The Joint Board had {{assigned}} that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north–south than west–east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to Oklahoma City, from where it ran west to Los Angeles. Kentucky strongly objected to this designated route, {{as it had been}} left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the US62 designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of US52 east of Ashland, Kentucky, as US60. They assigned US62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US60. [...] But Missouri and Oklahoma did object—Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs. [...] A compromise <b>was</b> <b>proposed,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> US60 would split at Springfield, Missouri, into US60E and US60N, but both sides objected. [...] The final solution resulted in the assignment of US66 to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number. Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.|$|E

50|$|Since {{growth is}} a complex {{developmental}} procedure, there are indeed many requirements (both biotic and abiotic) that are needed for both touch perception and a thigmotropic response to occur. One of these is calcium. In a series of experiments in 1995 using the tendril Bryonia dioica, touch-sensing calcium channels were blocked using various antagonists. Responses to touch in treatment plants which received calcium channel inhibitors were diminished compared to control plants, indicating that calcium may be required for thigmotropism. Later in 2001, a membrane depolarization pathway <b>was</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> calcium was involved: when a touch occurs, calcium channels open and calcium flows into the cell, shifting the electrochemical potential across the membrane. This triggers voltage-gated chloride and potassium channels to open and leads to an action potential that signals the perception of touch.|$|E
