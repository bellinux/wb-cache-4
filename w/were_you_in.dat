25|$|The {{play was}} written in January 2006, {{initially}} with the title If I Were You, which was then altered to I to I before reverting to the original. However, there were no plans to produce the play that year, as the Stephen Joseph Theatre already planned to produce revivals of Intimate Exchanges and Woman in Mind. However, on 21 February 2006, Alan Ayckbourn suffered a stroke. As a result, directorship of Intimate Exchanges passed to Tim Luscombe, {{and the production of}} Woman in Mind was eventually dropped altogether. Whilst in hospital, Ayckbourn decided to use his latest play as a goal to work towards. I to I was scheduled for the autumn slot vacated by Woman in Mind in June, rehearsed at the rehearsal studio at his home, and the play was announced to the public, now retitled as If I <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> <b>in</b> July.|$|E
500|$|On May 13, 2013, Hurwitz and Blumenfeld {{announced}} their first new project since Jake and Amir: a comedy audio podcast called If I <b>Were</b> <b>You,</b> <b>in</b> which they give advice to listeners who submit questions. New episodes {{have been released}} every Monday since then, and the show has featured several guest stars, including Schwartz, Middleditch, Van Veen, Seidell and Williams. [...] Kayla Culver of The Concordian lauded the podcast as [...] "comfortable to listen to" [...] and [...] "genuinely funny" [...] and said [...] "It's like listening to two best friends having a hilarious conversation on the couch next to you." [...] The Guardian Miranda Sawyer called If I Were You [...] "a typical example of a comedy podcast" [...] and [...] "amiable enough", but said it contained [...] "far too much laughing", commenting that [...] "New Yorkers Jake and Amir laugh and laugh, giggle and chortle their way around a topic" [...] and [...] "if I wanted stream-of-consciousness waffle with the occasional funny line, I'd listen to [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Amir {{first came}} to {{national}} prominence in 2004 {{when he was a}} semi-finalist during Yahoo's inaugural national IM Live contest, losing to the eventual champions. [...] Now, he is best known for appearing in the web series Jake and Amir with Jake Hurwitz, in which he plays an annoying and exaggerated version of himself. Originally made by Hurwitz and Blumenfeld in their spare time, the series was then produced by CollegeHumor. Blumenfeld's acting in the series gained him a Webby Award for Best Individual Performance in 2010. In 2011, CollegeHumor released Jake and Amir: Fired, a 30-minute special that is the company's first paid content. Episodes of Jake and Amir average over 500,000 views; by 2012, over 500 had been produced. [...] The pair have also hosted numerous live shows, and started the advice podcast If I <b>Were</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> 2013. In December 2013, it was announced that Jake and Amir would be adapted into a TBS television comedy with Ed Helms as an executive producer. TBS never filmed the pilot, despite a fan-created #GreenlightJakeAndAmir Twitter campaign that garnered tens of thousands of tweets. Instead, sister network truTV picked up the pilot and filmed it, though it was never aired.|$|E
