The robots having become so advanced that they are then {{able to create a}} new race of people. The robots then fear that these new humans <b>will</b> <b>dominate</b> them, and when the Doctor arrives on their planet, they take this as proof of their fears.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it <b>will</b> <b>dominate</b> the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a V-shaped canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E

25|$|Conventional {{techniques}} for measuring in-situ infiltration {{include the use}} of a single or double ring infiltrometer. Single and double ring infiltrometer only measures flow under ponded (saturated) conditions, and when used in soil with distinct macropores, preferential flow <b>will</b> <b>dominate</b> the flow. (See: Poiseuille's law) This does not reflect infiltration under rainfall or sprinkler irrigation. Therefore, many authors attempted to create a negative potential (tension) on the water flow. This is to exclude macropores in the flow process, hence only measuring the soil matrix flow.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which a {{language}} is valued also has an effect on language acquisition in bilingual children. Languages that are deemed more useful or more important <b>will</b> <b>dominate</b> the bilingual mental lexicon while the less valued ones will not be acquired as fully. Studies have shown that children showed slower receptive vocabulary development in what they termed the 'minority' language while the children showed monolingual-like development in the 'majority' language. This has been attributed to the lack of opportunities bilinguals had available for the acquisition and development of their 'minority' language.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{negative}} feedback is that radiation leaving the Earth increases {{in proportion to the}} fourth power of temperature, in accordance with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This feedback is always operational; therefore, while it may be overridden by positive feedbacks for comparatively small temperature changes it <b>will</b> <b>dominate</b> for larger temperature changes. An {{example of a}} positive feedback is the ice-albedo feedback, in which increasing temperature causes ice to melt, which increases the amount of heat that Earth absorbs. This feedback only operates in a restricted range of temperatures (those for which ice exists, and does not cover the whole surface; once all the ice has melted, the feedback ceases to operate).|$|E

25|$|Hanson {{is opposed}} to the Russian {{intervention}} in the Syrian civil war, which he argues {{is a part of}} a bid by Putin to construct an anti-American Russian-Syrian-Iranian-Iraqi alliance that <b>will</b> <b>dominate</b> the Middle East and intimidate the Gulf states. Hanson has made the claim that the primary responsibility for the outbreak of the Second World War was not due to Adolf Hitler, but was rather due to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the French Premier Édouard Daladier who failed to maintain credible threats of deterrence. Hanson has argued Obama has likewise failed to maintain a credible threat of deterrence, and as such, the world {{is on the verge of}} another war comparable to the Second World War. Hanson has predicted that Putin will sometime in the near-future invade one or more of the Baltic states if the United States does not provide more deterrence to Russia.|$|E
25|$|Fissile U-235 and non-fissile but {{fissionable}} and fertile U-238 {{are both}} {{used in the}} fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 {{is more likely to}} capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions <b>will</b> <b>dominate</b> the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.|$|E
