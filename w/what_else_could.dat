In both mother and daughter, the {{researchers}} found evidence of a mutation related to porphyria; while the team notes they could not be [...] "completely certain" [...] that this mutation was caused by the genetic disease, they believe it [...] "beyond dispute" [...] based on the historical and biological evidence. They add that many of the same symptoms were found in Charlotte's mother Vicky, as well as other family members including Queen Victoria. Röhl, Warren, and Hunt conclude [...] "...for <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> have caused their terrible attacks of lameness and abdominal pain and skin rashes– and in Charlotte's case dark red urine?" ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{selected}} [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] {{as one of}} the 'track picks' from In the Zone. Caryn Ganz of Spin {{called the}} song [...] "a fine specimen of Britney 4.0 – a fast-paced dance anthem, all grinding percussion shuttling through a traffic jam of synths." [...] Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic said that [...] "Aside from numerous rather awful name-dropping passages and a disappointing chorus, the track is an ideal way to open the album. It's an up-tempo dance track with a big name attached; <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> you ask for?" [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine deemed it as [...] "arguably one of Britney's finest moments and one of her mentor's worst". Nick Southall of Stylus Magazine said that [...] "Madonna vamps it up (literally– her appearance here is not Sapphic but vampiric, the wizened old crone bleeding another period of forced longevity into her career like a cruenating corpse leaking plasma backwards) on 'Me Against The Music', but can't make it a bad tune." [...] Gavin Mueller, also writing for Stylus Magazine, said that the single [...] "benefits from a kinetic garage-inspired beat, even when a tepid Madonna threatens to spoil the fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Although the Nazis were {{suspicious}} of {{the chairman of the}} local Olympic organizing committee, Theodor Lewald, as he had a Jewish grandmother, they quickly saw the propaganda potential in hosting the Olympic Games. Lewald had intended to stage the Games on a shoestring budget; instead, the resources of the Reich were thrown behind the effort. As the Nazi hatred of the Jews manifested itself in persecution, there were calls to move the Olympics from Germany, or alternatively, to boycott the Games. As head of the Olympic movement in the US, Brundage received many letters and telegrams urging action. In 1933 and 1934, the IOC worked to assure that, consistent with Olympic ideals, the Games would be open to all, and {{that there would be no}} discrimination because of race or religion. IOC President Comte Henri de Baillet-Latour wrote to Brundage in 1933, [...] "I am not personally fond of jews [...] and of the jewish [...] influence, but I will not have them molested in no way [...] whatsoever." [...] According to historical writer Christopher Hilton in his account of the 1936 Games, [...] "Baillet-Latour, and the great and good around him, had no idea what was coming, and if the [...] German delegates kept offering assurances, <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> they do but accept them?" [...] Baillet-Latour opposed boycotting the Games, as did Brundage (who had learned in 1933 that he was being considered for IOC membership).|$|E

2500|$|Under materialism or even {{embodiment}} values, or in {{any system}} that recognizes the validity of ecology as a scientific study of limits and potentials, an ecosystem is a fundamental good. To all who investigate, it seems that goodness, or value, exists within an ecosystem, Earth. Creatures within that ecosystem and wholly dependent on it, evaluate good relative to <b>what</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> be achieved there. In other words, [...] good is situated in a particular place and one does not dismiss everything that is not available there (such as very low gravity or absolutely abundant sugar candy) as [...] "not good enough", one works within its constraints. Transcending them and learning {{to be satisfied with}} them, is thus another sort of value, perhaps called satisfaction.|$|E

2500|$|Preserving Frescati {{proved to}} be very much an uphill battle. The {{campaign}} continued, involving several lengthy court battles and petitions. One historian in Trinity College prepared a thesis for a Masters degree based on the Frescati situation. She was asked in court how she felt about the possible destruction of Frescati's wings. [...] "Bluntly", she replied, [...] "It's vandalism. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> one say of the destruction of good things left by our ancestors which are built to last?” A petition was presented in court that contained thousands of signatures from Ireland and abroad. It was argued that Frescati was structurally sound but that much work needed to be done inside. [...] "Princess" [...] Mariga Guinness of the Irish Georgian Society said that she had several inquiries from people who wanted to live in Frescati. She added that she had seen buildings such as the British Embassy and Holy Cross, which were in a much worse state of repair, restored.|$|E
2500|$|It may be possible, then, {{that our}} intuitions {{about the role}} of our {{conscious}} [...] "intentions" [...] have led us astray; it may be the case that we have confused correlation with causation by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in neurostimulation, brain damage, but also research into introspection illusions. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for moral responsibility. Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is [...] "intuitive": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues [...] "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> <b>could</b> they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion". Philosopher Walter Jackson Freeman III nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes [...] "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly {{trying to keep up with}} what we do." [...] To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.|$|E
