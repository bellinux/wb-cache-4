This {{has a great deal}} in common with thought processes... That's why I think the camera is an eye as well as a mind. Everything <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> camera has physiological and mental significance.|$|E

[...] She said that the creators had happily indulged in the chance to [...] "visually draw on everything" [...] that British {{imagination}} can offer. David Arnold said “It's going to be beautiful, cheeky, cheesy, camp, silly and thrilling", and added that [...] "we could have done this 15 times over, and not had the same show, and it would still have been full of amazing British music". He thought that it should be the [...] "greatest after party" [...] and was “really a celebration of Britishness in terms of [...] the arts". Arnold himself had devoted two years working on the ceremony and had turned down all other work including Skyfall, but said that it was the [...] "most fun" [...] he had [...] "ever had in music". In the handover section Rio aimed to express [...] "multicultural embrace." [...] Daniela Thomas stated that Rio [...] "want to show you how sophisticated we mix things, what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> things you believe we are, how we mix with pop culture." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parker {{gradually}} introduced Transcendentalist {{ideas into}} his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. “I preach abundant heresies,” {{he wrote to}} a friend, “and they all go down—for the listeners {{do not know how}} heretical they are.” For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing “some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.’” He was hardly alone. “‘What shall <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament?’ asked James Walker in 1838. ‘That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome." [...] Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based higher criticism, formed the basis of liberal Christianity as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo. Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L’Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence) and Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike), while Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L’Enfant. Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly {{the way they were}} rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions we give the actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say that we will see once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|E
