5|$|Five {{thousand}} people were evacuated to emergency shelters as Winifred neared. With {{the approach of}} the hurricane, watches and warnings were issued. On October 9 a tropical storm warning was issued from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. At the same time, a hurricane watch <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> the same area.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards {{the system was}} very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little {{they could do to}} prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows. The law also seeks to {{encourage the use of}} public transportation and reduce air pollution. According to the law, revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to urban infrastructure for public transportation and non-motorized modes of locomotion (such as walking and cycling), and to finance public subsidies to transit fares. The law <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> April 2013.|$|E

5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution finally <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock {{was elected}} Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In {{the absence of}} formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor health) {{to serve in the}} First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E
5|$|In March 1944, MacArthur {{met with}} Curtin and {{detailed}} {{his plans for}} the Western New Guinea campaign, explaining that he would assume direct command of land forces when he reached the Philippines, and suggesting that Blamey could either go with him as an army commander, or remain in Australia as Commander in Chief. The new organisation <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> September 1944, with Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth US Army, Lieutenant General Robert Eichelberger's Eighth United States Army, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee's First Australian Army, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead's I Australian Corps and Major General Oscar Griswold's XIV Corps reporting directly to GHQ. Allied Land Forces remained as an important administrative and logistical command, until it was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 2006, several players, {{including}} Buffon, {{were accused}} of participating in illegal betting on Serie A matches. Buffon voluntarily co-operated, allowing himself to be interrogated by Turin magistrates. While admitting that he did place bets on sporting matches (until regulations <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> late 2005, banning players from doing so), he vehemently denied placing wagers on Italian football matches. Despite concerns that he had jeopardised his chance of playing for Italy in the 2006 World Cup, he was officially named Italy's starting goalkeeper on 15 May and helped Italy to win their fourth title. Buffon was cleared of all charges by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on 27 June 2007. Following Juventus's punishment in the Calciopoli scandal, in which their two most recent Serie A titles were stripped and the squad were relegated to Serie B and penalized with a point deduction, rumours spread that Buffon would {{be placed on the}} transfer market. Buffon elected to remain with Juventus, despite the team's relegation, a decision which made him extremely popular with the Juventus fans.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to strong}} {{opposition}} by numerous groups, this bill was amended to require notification of potential power outages on all balloon weights and directs the University of California {{to work with}} the Public Utilities Commission to identify a cost-effective, consumer-friendly substitute for metallic balloons. The bill was originally intended to <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> 2010, but the version passed by the California senate would have <b>gone</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> January 2011.

5|$|The main {{factor in}} the {{continued}} decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they {{are believed to have}} healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all international trade in the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal. Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market have determined that Asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn.|$|E
