5|$|The {{trust the}} Archduke placed in Schmitt was briefly {{interrupted}} in 1799 {{when he was}} connected, by rumor, to the 29 April assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt. The assassination occurred as the delegation was leaving the city. The official investigation into the assassination placed enormous pressure on Schmitt, {{to such an extent}} that he briefly resigned as Charles' Chief of Staff, but he was quickly reinstated. On 1 March 1800, Schmitt was promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant, but later in that year, the Archduke was himself replaced as commander-in-chief by Field Marshal Pál Kray. Although Schmitt remained on Kray's staff, he again requested retirement, claiming he <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> could no longer cope with the stress of the job. In reality, he and Kray's Quartermaster General, Generalmajor Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles, seldom saw eye-to-eye on any of the main issues facing the army and Kray relied more on Chasteler than on Schmitt. His request was initially refused, but on 19 August 1800, Emperor Francis II approved the petition when Kray seconded it. Schmitt went first to Vienna and then Hostitz at Kromeriz, near Brno. There he lived with his old friend Ferdinand Ritter von Geißlern until 1805.|$|E

Final races of the season were a close battle between Maze and Fenninger. Maze won six more podiums {{until the end of}} the season and was leading 18 points in the overall standings before the last race but Fenninger won the last giant slalom and defended her overall title from the 2014 season. Maze finished the season second, with her second-highest number of season points. She also finished third in the slalom, super-G, and downhill standings. At the end of the season, Maze hinted that she may retire from competitive sport in the following months.|$|E

At the time, he mentioned to his publicist that he <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> had a sore throat, but felt that it would go away.|$|E
500|$|In England's chase, Trott was {{the only}} batsman dismissed, run out for 19, {{although}} replays suggested that it was possibly the wrong decision. Cook scored his second century of the series, and Pietersen finished on 74, scored at just under a run-a-ball. Bangladesh's bowling attack <b>was</b> <b>tired,</b> <b>and</b> rarely threatened England; Pietersen even opted to switch hit some deliveries. In Wisden, Hopps, who had described the second morning as being possibly [...] "England's lowest point of a long winter", contrastingly said of the final day; [...] "England's supremacy had rarely looked so marked." [...] Despite England's victory, which maintained their one hundred percent winning record against Bangladesh, Shakib was named as man of the match.|$|E
500|$|While the {{majority}} of the staff were pleased with [...] "Tapestry", Piller felt that the premise <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> was concerned that it was simply a take on the film It's a Wonderful Life. He said that some scenes were [...] "very talky", and the direction and some performances were [...] "flat". Moore participated in an AOL chat in 1997, where he described [...] "Tapestry" [...] as [...] "one of the best things I wrote and one of TNGs finest episodes". Some fans wrote in to the staff to complain that the episode glorified violence, and was against the principles of Star Trek. Jeri Taylor admitted that the episode could be seen as violent, but it never crossed the mind of any of the staff during production. She {{went on to say that}} if they had realized that [...] "Tapestry" [...] could be considered to promote violence, then they would have corrected it to ensure that it wouldn't be viewed as such.|$|E

500|$|RZA sent several beats to West, {{including}} some that he cited as being edgy, {{because he felt}} that West was the type who could work well on more forceful production, including the brooding [...] "So Appalled". The song was nearly featured on Last Train to Paris, a studio album by Diddy. According to another producer on the song, No I.D., it was offered to both Jay-Z and Diddy before it leaked. West freestyled over the track for fun and found that he actually liked it enough to ultimately use it himself, stating {{that it would make}} a good group song. Cyhi the Prynce's verse only appeared on the song because he [...] "tricked" [...] West. Originally he was only supposed to deliver a quick hook, but at the time West <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> let Cyhi record his verse alone. [...] When West awoke and played back the tape, he {{was surprised to find that}} Cyhi had recorded an entire verse. Impressed with it, West decided to include it on the track anyway. The song reportedly offended M.C. Hammer, who Jay-Z references on the line [...] "I spent another 30 / Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me".|$|E
500|$|As an adolescent, Olga {{received}} frequent reminders {{from her}} mother to be an example for the other children and to be patient with her younger sisters and with her nurses. On January 11, 1909, Alexandra admonished thirteen-year-old Olga for rudeness and bad behavior. She told the teenager that she must be polite to the servants, who looked after her well and did their best for her, and she should not make her nurse [...] "nervous" [...] when she <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> not feeling well. Olga responded on January 12, 1909 that she would try to do better but it wasn't easy because her nurse became angry and cross with her for no good reason. However, Ersberg, one of the maids, told her niece that the servants sometimes {{had good reason to}} be cross with Olga because the eldest grand duchess could be spoiled, capricious, and lazy. On January 24, 1909, Alexandra scolded the active teenager, who once signed another of her letters with the nickname [...] "Unmounted Cossack", again: [...] "You are growing very big — don't be so wild and kick about and show your legs, it is not pretty. I never did so when your age or when I was smaller and younger even." ...|$|E
500|$|Bauer created most of {{his major}} works in oil at the {{beginning}} of his career, since this was the traditional technique taught at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. The trip to northern Sweden resulted in many sketches and watercolors for the Lappland book, but also in an oil on canvas entitled, Kåsovagge (1904). From 1903 to 1905, he made several portraits and landscapes influenced by Expressionism. He also made his first oil of Ester, The Fairy Princess, a painting with elements from the Pre-Raphaelites. This work indicates what kind of paintings Bauer wanted to do, but his commissions from illustrating [...] "Among gomes and trolls" [...] got in the way. He wrote that he [...] "felt like a Jack-of-all-trades", and made regular outbursts in letters to editors and publishers asking for his help, saying that he [...] "had to work, he wanted a future painting in oil and the rest be damned". By the time he ceased painting his trolls and gnomes, he <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> worn out and turned to other venues such as scenography, writing a compendium on drawing to be used in schools, and starting with frescos. He never got to revisit oil painting fully before he drowned.|$|E

500|$|He {{played for}} only 32 minutes against Groningen, after a display which lacked creativity. He said {{afterwards}} he <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> {{was carrying a}} slight injury during the match, but Koeman criticised Mido saying he was not giving everything. He revealed in September 2002 {{that he wanted to}} leave Ajax in the transfer window in late December. However, Mido soon apologised to Koeman and Leo Beenhakker regarding the transfer comments, saying he was [...] "irresponsible" [...] and [...] "unthoughtful". He was handed a fine and suspended from Ajax's game against Olympique Lyonnais. In December of that year, he revealed that he wanted to stay at Ajax. He scored for Ajax during their 6–0 defeat of Willem II in February 2003, but Koeman again criticised Mido, commenting negatively on his performance against Roda in the KNVB Cup. He was dropped for Ajax's next game against Feyenoord, only featuring as an unused substitute. He suffered a muscle strain in his upper thigh after a friendly for Egypt, and was ruled out of Ajax's game against Groningen. Mido was relegated to the Ajax reserve team for disciplinary reasons, surrounding a perceived lack of effort in training. His situation at the club led to interest from Serie A clubs Juventus and Lazio and he later admitted to have thrown a pair of scissors at Ajax teammate Zlatan Ibrahimović following an argument in March 2003.|$|E
500|$|Johnson resumed the {{leadership}} on {{the field in the}} Second Test at Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad. The match was a high-scoring draw, but Miller scored only three and took match figures of 1/148. In the Third Test at Georgetown, Guyana, Miller removed both openers in the first innings and then scored 33 as Australia by eight wickets. He took 3/51 for the match. In the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, Miller came to the wicket with Australia at 3/226 on the first day. The tourists lost two more wickets to be 5/233. Miller and Archer launched a counter-attacking partnership of 206. Miller reached 137 and then walked after edging a ball, even though none of the opposition had appealed. Australia reached 668 and the West Indies were struggling at 6/147, with Miller having dismissed Weekes and Collie Smith in the same over. At the time, Miller was bowling at medium pace, but Johnson felt that the new batsmen Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza were vulnerable to express pace. Johnson ordered Miller to bowl fast, but was turned down. Johnson replaced Miller with Lindwall, who <b>was</b> <b>tired</b> <b>and</b> was hit around the ground. The pair seized the initiative and compiled a world Test record of 347 for the seventh wicket and the Australians were tired after failing to break the partnership. Miller attacked Johnson {{in front of the other}} players, saying [...] "You couldn't captain a bunch of bloody schoolboys!" [...] Johnson then offered to resolve the dispute [...] "out the back", implying a fisticuffs.|$|E
