40|$|The late Jerry Cohen {{struggled}} to reconcile his egalitarian political principles with his personal style of life. His efforts were inconclusive, but instructive.

The connection the principle states is more general and much tighter than Cohen and others, e. g. Thomas Nagel, have seen. Our principles of justice always put our personal integrity to the test, unless those principles are designed not to. But <b>to</b> craft principles <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>view</b> <b>to</b> avoiding that test is, as Cohen argued, itself to undermine both justice and our integrity...|$|R
