5|$|April Clark as Tondie, Ant's girlfriend. At first, she {{was rude}} to Ant when he <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> talk to her. After {{he begins to}} become more popular, she begins to develop a crush on him and asks him to be her boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including Sweaty Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody of the shopping channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong dislike for each other who <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> promote a useless product whilst making snide digs at each other underneath forced smiles and insincere laughter.|$|E
5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did not proceed as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

5|$|Everyone is {{in disbelief}} that Stewie <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> murder Lois, but she {{insists that he}} is evil, and {{explains}} what happened. After falling overboard, she was rescued by a merman. Having developed retrograde amnesia, she starts working at a fat camp in North Carolina. While in a diner, she meets a new boyfriend, who {{turns out to be}} a white supremacist. While at a white supremacist rally, she takes a blow to the head and regains her memory, at which point she returns to Quahog.|$|E
5|$|Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish {{girl would}} make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom {{glittering}} with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 2011, Ian Thorpe {{announced}} that he <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the 2012 Olympics in London. Thorpe's major focus was the 100m and 200m freestyle at 2012's trials, stating he could offer the most value to the Australian team in the relays. He would not swim the 400m, claiming {{he would not have}} enough time to build up endurance for that event. This led many to see a renewed rivalry with Michael Phelps.|$|E
60|$|Jet <b>would</b> have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> summon him by whistling, but for {{the fear}} Sam might hear the signal and come that way.|$|R
50|$|Direct defense: In {{case of a}} {{conventional}} Soviet attack (meaning non-nuclear or this {{would be considered a}} first strike) initial efforts <b>would</b> be <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and stop the Soviet advance with conventional weapons. This meant that the foreseen Soviet attack on West-Germany <b>would</b> be <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> be forced to a halt by NATO's European forces, Allied Command Europe.|$|R

5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, {{the object of the}} game was to touch the ball on the opponent's end of the pool. The goalkeeper would wait {{at the end of the}} pool until an opposing player approached the goal, when the goalkeeper <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> stop that player, for example, by dunking their head.|$|E
5|$|Valve {{considered}} {{adding a}} competitive mode to Portal 2. According to Wolpaw, the mode {{was similar to}} the video game Speedball; one team <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> transport a ball {{from one side of the}} playing field to the other using portals, while the other team would attempt to stop them with their own use of portals. Matches would commence with this objective in mind, but quickly descended into chaos. Valve realized that people enjoyed solving puzzles with portals more and therefore they focused on the cooperative mode.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked for acceptance from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E

5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while the tortoise is away. When it returns, the tortoise would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, the tortoise would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from the tortoise, which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or an even better one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero announced that he <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the battle, Qin Jiwei had worried that Van Fleet <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> lure the Chinese forces around Triangle Hill, with the real blow {{directed}} towards the Pyonggang Valley. To counter this possibility, the 44th Division and the 85th Regiment of the 29th Division had been conducting preemptive attacks on Jackson Heights since early October. From mid October, the 44th Division increased the strength of its attacks in an effort to relieve pressure from Triangle Hill, and the battle of attrition that was witnessed over Triangle Hill had also developed at Jackson Heights.|$|E
25|$|In {{the season}} Mike Hamar was introduced, he <b>would</b> often <b>try</b> <b>to</b> help Red around the lodge, but with humorously {{disastrous}} results due to mis-communications or Mike <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> imitate Red's corner cutting shortcuts.|$|R

5|$|Freed, Desha left Kentucky, {{traveling}} {{down the}} Ohio and Mississippi rivers. According to legend, {{he attempted to}} rob a flatboat skipper near Vicksburg, Mississippi. It happened the skipper was a longtime acquaintance of Desha, named G. W. Crawford. Crawford recognized Desha and asked why he <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rob him. Desha confessed {{that he had been}} living as an outlaw since his father's pardon. Crawford urged Desha to abandon his illegal activities and offered to give him free passage to New Orleans, Louisiana. Desha accepted, telling Crawford that he planned to travel on to a distant place, assume a new name, and seek a fresh start.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for {{their claim to}} the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In October 1980, he {{interacted with}} a {{delegation}} of Solidarity members that included Lech Wałęsa, future President of the Third Republic of Poland. When Wałęsa complained that the Polish government was not keeping to its promise of allowing the independent labour movement enough of an opportunity to publicize itself, Jagielski indicated that he <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> give the movement better access to the Polish press, and to the Polish radio network. Jagielski led a delegation that went to a meeting in Moscow of Comecon, the Eastern Bloc economic community, during January 1981. That month, the government declared that the poor economy was forcing it {{to cut back on}} its promise of ensuring that Polish workers did not have to work on Saturdays, and that it would offer a number of Saturdays as work-free instead.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to best {{practice}} guidelines, parents and interviewers discussed children's abuse-allegations {{that had been}} previously elicited by parents. Department of Social Welfare specialist interviewers Lynda Morgan and Sue Sidey both testified that they <b>would</b> then <b>try</b> <b>to</b> elicit the same allegations from the child. They <b>would</b> not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> determine if the allegations were reliable nor explore all possible origins of the children's allegations. One mother reportedly told her son's interviewer that she had repeatedly asked him direct questions. She said she was told she had done nothing wrong (Bander, 1997).|$|R

5|$|In fact, {{if such a}} {{strategy}} of financing development from outside the home country is undertaken, it creates a number of problems. For example, the foreign investors may carelessly misuse {{the resources of the}} underdeveloped country. This would in turn limit that economy's ability to diversify, especially if natural resources were plundered. This may also create a distorted social structure. Apart from this, there is also a risk that the foreign investments may be used to finance private luxury consumption. People <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> imitate Western consumption habits and thus a balance of payments crisis may develop, along with economic inequality within the population.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena {{to become one}} of their spokespeople in Texas. The jingle used in her first two {{commercials}} for the company were composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it would be best for them both to distance himself from her, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla, Jr. <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> break it up.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{service would}} have 16 weekly departures to Bergen Airport, Flesland. The main market segment is the {{offshore}} petroleum industry, and the departure times {{were designed to}} mesh with helicopter routes to offshore installations. The company estimated that one-quarter of travellers would be people commuting to the North Sea. Norsk Hydro, who {{have a lot of}} employees in the Grenland area, stated that they could not start using Vildanden because they had an agreement with SAS Braathens' services from Sandefjord. The first scheduled service flew on 24 January 2005, carrying eight passengers. This first month, 972 passengers took the plane, and Vildanden announced that they <b>would</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> also start a route to Stavanger Airport, Sola, as well as potentially to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.|$|E
