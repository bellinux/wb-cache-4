5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{formerly}} enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, {{such as the}} brothers Yeon Namsaeng (634–679) and Yeon Namsan (639–701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla began fighting the Tang forces there. At {{the same time the}} Tang faced threats on its western border <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670.

5|$|In 1969, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> {{chunk of}} stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation practices were undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, many {{counties}} in Pennsylvania were staunch {{supporters of the}} Democratic Party, while the newly {{elected president of the}} United States was the Republican Abraham Lincoln. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of men were drafted from Columbia County, tensions led to raids and arrests in Columbia and neighboring counties. As early as 1862, the local press expressed outrage at a draft of 636 men, mostly mechanics and laborers. An 1863 law requiring all men from 20 to 45 years old to be drafted increased tensions further. On July 20 locals broke into the district draft office and stole the items inside. But besides this event, there was little active violence against officials of the 1863 draft.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{arrived on}} Surtsey soon after its formation, and were first {{detected}} in 1964. The original arrivals were flying insects, {{carried to the}} island by winds and their own power.

Later insect life arrived on floating driftwood, and both live animals and carcasses washed up on the island. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> grass-covered tussock was washed ashore in 1974, scientists took half of it for analysis and discovered 663 land invertebrates, mostly mites and springtails, the great majority of which had survived the crossing.|$|E

5|$|Printing {{had been}} known in Japan from at least the 8th century, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of dharani known as Hyakumantō Darani were printed from 764 to 770 and placed in {{miniature}} wooden pagodas. These count among the oldest extant printed texts in East Asia and were likely made by woodblock printing. The Hyakumantō Darani were ritual Buddhist printings, neither meant for distribution nor for reading. This practice of devotional printing continued into the Heian period. The first practical printing in Japan can be dated to the 11th century and is associated with sutra commentaries and doctrinal works for which handcopying did not entail religious merit. Despite the increasing popularity of printing, many texts, particularly Japanese literature, continued to be copied by hand on manuscript scrolls. Commercial printing did not become common until the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The festivals {{associated}} with Vithoba primarily {{correspond to the}} bi-annual yatras (pilgrimages) of the Varkaris. The pilgrims travel to the Pandharpur temple from Alandi and Dehu, towns closely {{associated with}} poet-saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram respectively. Along the way, they sing abhangas (devotional songs) dedicated to Vithoba and repeat his name, carrying the palkhis (palanquins) of the poet-saints. Varkaris do not engage in ritual worship but only practice darshan (visual adoration) of the deity. The ritual worship by the priests is restricted to five days each around the Ashadha (June–July) and Kartik (October–November) Ekadashis, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of Varkaris participate in the yatras. In smaller numbers, the Varkaris also visit the temple on two other Ekadashis—in the Hindu months of Magha and Chaitra.|$|E
