50|$|By {{rewarding}} creators {{for their}} efforts, industrial design protection {{also serves as}} an incentive to invest in design activity. One of the basic aims of industrial design protection is to stimulate the design element of production. Industrial design laws therefore usually only protect designs {{that can be used}} in industry, or that can be produced on a large scale. This condition of industrial production is a notable difference between industrial design protection and copyright, since the latter concerns only aesthetic creations. However, in some cases, industrial designs may qualify for protection under copyright, for example where the design can be categorized as a <b>work</b> <b>of</b> <b>applied</b> <b>art.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Keresztény Múzeum {{was founded}} by {{archbishop}} János Simor (1813-1891) who in 1875 established the third public museum of the Kingdom of Hungary by opening his private collection to all visitors. The first exhibition installed on the upper floor of the Cathedral Library included 206 pictures, mainly late medieval and 19th-century works. The Archbishop greatly enlarged his collection in the following years. His most significant purchase {{was that of the}} Bertinelli collection in Rome in 1878, when the Museum acquired sixty, mainly Italian Renaissance paintings. Further important acquisitions were the wooden sculptures and <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>applied</b> <b>art</b> bought in 1884 from the Schnütgen Collection in Cologne. After 1882, the enlarged collection was transferred to {{the second floor of the}} newly rebuilt Primate’s Palace on the Danube bank, where it is still located. In 1887, Simor ensured the future of the collection by entrusting it to the care of the Cathedral chapter of Esztergom. After World War I, the Museum was enriched with two large collections: in 1920 with the collection of Arnold Ipolyi, Bishop of Oradea (1823-1886), which consisted mainly of late medieval Italian, German, Austrian and Hungarian paintings and sculptures, and in 1925 with Count San Marco's bequest, which primarily contained <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>applied</b> <b>arts</b> and paintings.|$|R

While the barrier is usually very low for fine art and protection is granted even for minimal creativity (dubbed [...] "kleine Münze", literally [...] "small coin" [...] or [...] "small change"), there are extremely high standards for <b>applied</b> <b>art</b> to be reached for it to achieve copyright protection. This is so because Geschmacksmuster (design patents) and Schriftzeichengesetz (typeface patents) are seen as lex specialis for <b>applied</b> <b>art</b> such that the threshold of originality must not be assumed low for them. This has been confirmed by courts several times, especially for logos, but also for earrings.|$|R
50|$|Yusupov {{collected}} for himself alongside collecting for the tsars, and thus his own collection of paintings and objets d'art {{evolved from the}} same sources as the Imperial one. His own collection became one of Europe's richest collections and included over 600 paintings (including many landscapes), sculptures, <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>applied</b> <b>art,</b> more than 20,000 books and porcelain, most of which he put on display in his estate. After 1917 his extensive collection was broken up and passed to several different museums, though the bulk of it is kept in Arkhangelskoye, the Hermitage and the Pushkin Museum. In 1804, Nicholas went to Paris and frequently met Napoleon I, who presented him with a gift of three large tapestries. He also commissioned Sappho and Phaon from Jacques-Louis David in 1809.|$|R

25|$|Since the UCC {{prescribed}} {{a minimum}} copyright term of 25 years, chapter IV of the Fundamentals was changed accordingly.

In the Georgian SSR, these kinds <b>of</b> <b>works</b> were copyrighted for 20 years since their publication or creation, in the Moldavian and Uzbek SSR, for 15 years, and in Azerbaijan for ten years. In Kazakhstan, photographic works were protected for ten years and collections of photos for 15 years.

25|$|The western portal is {{decorated}} with special splendour. An important role in its decoration is played by the cantilevered stairs {{that lead to the}} upper level, with profiled butts to the steps. The doorways are framed with broad rectangular plaitbands, with ledges in the upper part, with columns, fillets and strips of various, mostly geometrical, fine and intricate patterns. Between the outer plathand and the arched framing of the openings there are representations of doves and sirens with women's crowned heads. Such reliefs were widely used in fourteenth-century Armenian art and in earlier times in architecture, miniatures and <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>applied</b> <b>art,</b> on various vessels and bowls. The entrance tympanums are decorated with bas-reliefs showing, on the lower tympanium, the Holy Virgin with the Child and Archangels Gabriel and Michael at her sides, and, on the upper tympanium, a half-length representation of Christ and figures of the Apostles Peter and Paul. As distinct from the reliefs of Noravank's vestry, these ones are carved on a plain surface, which gives them greater independence. The figures are distinguished by their plasticity of form, softness of modeling, and accentuation of certain details of clothing.|$|R

50|$|Against the {{background}} of its collections <b>of</b> outstanding <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>applied</b> <b>art,</b> the Museum Angewandte Kunst strives {{to shed light on}} the obscure and create relationships between the events and stories revolving around things of the concluded past, the emerging present and the immanent future. The changing exhibitions tell of cultural values and evolving life circumstances given shape and expression with new forms.With its new presentation formats, the Museum Angewandte Kunst distances itself from the traditional criteria for museological collection and organization dating from the nineteenth century. The approach to the museum’s exhibits solely from the perspective of their history has made way for the negotiation of timely and untimely reflections. This leads in turn to the emergence of issues encountered in thematic exhibitions with ever new object constellations.The presentation Elementary Parts: From the Collections opened in 2014 is a core component of this endeavour. For this “heart chamber of the museum”, objects are selected from the many areas of the collection, regions of the world and eras of the past, and placed side by side in all their dissimilarity. In this way the Museum Angewandte Kunst shows its potential and exposes both the history of its holdings and the point of departure for curatorial praxis.|$|R

5000|$|However, the {{original}} word for sharawadgi {{has been a}} matter of debate. Some had attempted to reconstruct a possible Chinese origin of the word, for example, [...] "sa luo gui qi" [...] (洒落瑰琦) meaning [...] "quality of being impressive or surprising through careless or unorderly grace", another proposed san luan (散亂) or shu luo (疏落), both meaning [...] "scattered and disorderly", in combination with wei zhi (位置, position and arrangement) to mean [...] "space tastefully enlivened by disorder". After reviewing the suggestions, however, Susi Lang and Nikolaus Pevsner concluded that the word cannot be firmly established to be a Chinese term. Michael Sullivan suggested that it is a corruption of a Persian word, while a number of other scholars proposed a Japanese origin. E.V. Gatenby and Ciaran Murray thought that it originated from the Japanese term sorowaji (揃わじ), which means asymmetry, irregular. However, it is argued that this suggestion relies on possible meaning and similarity in sound only, without any other corroboration. Based on history research and linguistic evidence, garden scholar Wybe Kuitert proposes that it stems from the Japanese term shara'aji or share'aji (洒落味、しゃれ味), used to describe decorative motifs in <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>applied</b> <b>art.</b> Although there is no attested usage of shara'aji in the Edo period when the term was first borrowed into English, both its components shara and aji were important aesthetic concepts in the era, and would have been used in tandem by craftsmen of the period. Shara has a number of possible meanings relating to witty wordplay and association, its meaning extending to emblematic word games in applied arts; while aji means [...] "taste". The term shara'aji had been used a few times in literary criticism; and is still in common use for items such as kimonos.|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} {{conceptual}} and artistic transformations in the decorative and <b>applied</b> <b>arts</b> <b>of</b> the Moldavian SSR {{in the period}} 1970 – 1980. Compared to the preceding developments, the <b>works</b> <b>of</b> decorative and <b>applied</b> <b>art</b> <b>of</b> the eighth decade absorbed in themselves {{a wide range of}} stylistic trends characteristic for that period. <b>Works</b> <b>of</b> the following artists have been studied, E.

The article identifies main directions in which the creative inquiries of the artists were carried out. Namely, the use of folk traditions at a more in-depth level than in previous periods, the widespread introduction of figurative images and of the plot performing the main iconographic function of the image, and a monumental generalization of the form aimed at achieving a harmonious relationship with the architecture of that time.

The unique interior design, with numerous <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Fine and <b>Applied</b> <b>Arts,</b> which make the {{integral part of the}} building, gives the Palace the character of some kind of a gallery of Yugoslav 2oth century art. The interior, as well as the exterior design was supposed to reflect the power, the greatness, the stability and the integrity of new Yugoslavia. The interior decoration design included artistic decoration of the walls with the mosaic technique, graffiti and fresco-painting, as well as by placing free-standing sculptures and reliefs, which was the specific assignement given to the special artistic commission. The design of the lounges dedicated to all six of the federal republics of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, located in {{the central part of the}} palace, was based on the accentuation of the traditional motifs, characteristic for every federal unit of the country. The Yugoslav lounge represented the largest and at the same time the most representative room in the palace. The peculiar design of this lounge was seen in the monumental frescoes by Petar Lubarda, and Lazar Vujaklija, as well as the triptych-mosaic The Creation <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, the <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Mladen Srbinović.
