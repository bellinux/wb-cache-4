25|$|Some thinkers {{suggest that}} people are {{motivated}} to prostitute themselves because it is familiar– specifically to victims of child sexual abuse. Other researchers state that, while some {{see it as a}} normal job, the vast majority <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the industry given the potential for disease and dangerous clients.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton's death {{marked the}} end of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, a period of {{discovery}} characterised by journeys of geographical and scientific exploration in a largely unknown continent without any of the benefits of modern travel methods or radio communication. In the preface to his 1922 book The Worst Journey in the World, Apsley Cherry-Garrard, one of Scott's team on the Terra Nova Expedition, wrote: [...] "For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: and if I am in the devil of a hole and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of it, give me Shackleton every time".|$|E
500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of women who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E
