Instead of immediately launching a process improvement effort to determine whether special causes are present, the Quality Engineer may temporarily increase {{the rate at which}} samples are taken from the process output until {{it is clear that the}} process is truly in control. Note that with three-sigma limits, common-cause variations result in signals less than once out of every twenty-two points for skewed processes and about once out of every three hundred seventy (1/370.4) points for normally distributed processes. The two-sigma warning levels will be reached about once for every twenty-two (1/21.98) plotted points in normally distributed data. (For example, the means of sufficiently large samples drawn from practically any underlying distribution whose variance exists are normally distributed, according to the Central Limit Theorem.) ...|$|E

The production process is examined using the two types of charts under three specific control policies which are: Policy 1 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if two successive observations plot within the control limits but beyond the <b>warning</b> <b>limits.</b> Policy 2 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if two out of three observations plot within the control limits but beyond the <b>warning</b> <b>limits.</b> Policy 3 - An assignable cause is sought if a single observation plots beyond the control limits, or if seven successive observations plot within the control limits on any one side of the mean. This is followed by an investigation of the operating curves for the above mentioned policies. Performance of the charts, using these policies, is compared using their operating curves as well as an economic analysis. The results of performance analysis indicate that the two-sided Shewhart chart employing Policy 2 performs the best in terms of operating curves and is also the most economic to adopt, for the particular set of control chart design parameters.

The findings emphasize the need for external QC systems in urine analysis.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a calorimeter is usually evaluated by constructing a Shewhart control chart of its measurement errors for a collection of reference standards. However, Shewhart control charts were developed in a manufacturing setting where observations occur in batches. Additionally, the Shewhart control chart expects the variance of the charted variable to be known or at least well estimated from previous experimentation. For calorimetric assay, observations are collected singly in a time sequence with a (possibly) changing mean, and extensive experimentation to calculate the variance of the measurement errors is seldom feasible. These facts pose problems in constructing a control chart. In this paper, the authors propose using the mean squared successive difference to estimate the variance of measurement errors based solely on prior observations. This procedure reduces or eliminates estimation bias due to a changing mean. However, {{the use of this}} estimator requires an adjustment to the definition of the alarm and <b>warning</b> <b>limits</b> for the Shewhart control chart.

This paper evaluates the viability of an S chart configuration that uses probability limits and a Western Electric-type warning rule by comparing it to a standard S chart scheme that uses only probability limits. A Markov chain analysis using the concept of first passage time is used to define a warning zone on the composite S chart scheme such that the composite S chart has the same "in-control" average run length (ARL) as the non-composite S chart scheme. The performances of the two configurations are then simulated {{in order to obtain}} the ARL profiles as the process standard deviation increases from 1. The results of the simulation corroborate the underlying theory, i. e., the ARL decreases as the process standard deviation increases. Moreover, the simulation indicates that the composite S chart scheme (using <b>warning</b> <b>limits)</b> detects process standard deviation shifts more quickly than the non-composite configuration when the size of the shift is "small.
