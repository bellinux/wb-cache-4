Learning from the spatial experiences of our disabled / differently abled experts, the team wanted to challenge architecture beyond the normative established by the limited “normal ” perception. Taking into consideration the huge number of buildings and cultural institutions that are still lacking an alignment to what the emerging quest for accessibility already encompasses. Not only is architecture not accessible for all. It is the discourse of architecture that has been and still is exclusive. From the very start of architectural theory, architecture was defined as less concerned with housing the human body, but about transfiguring and making visible the contemporary concepts of the human body. Thus, the production of architecture and architectural theory was closely bound to those concepts stemming from philosophy, politics and medical science. The Italian Renaissance is a good example of how closely the concept of an ideal human body was linked to the concept of an ideal architectural body. Throug...|$|E

40|$|The <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> of {{the present}} doctor's {{dissertation}} reads: the mass media in Latvia are passing {{through a process of}} development towards independence and quality, which is based equal on inner conditional factors, not least - on historical developed traditions, on influence from the West and East European abroad, and finally - it depends on the growth level of journalistic infrastructures. System theoretical models, together taken, comprehend the transformational processes as a development from traditional to modern societies and by that as a diversification of social partial systems. In case of the mass media in Latvia it is about the establishment of an independent, from the political system separated media system, because in the real socialist society the media system was a direct part of the political system. The diversification of an independent media system in Latvia and by that the establishment not only of a formal democratic orderliness, but of a high quality and democracy, including the inner press freedom (editorial autonomy) and above all the own infrastructures for the quality ensuring of the mass media, which supplement the free market forces, ? all that has not been realized only by transmission of western institutions. This way of society?s development is steady influenced by the "cultural" factors - by the grown up social structures and specific traditional notions on journalism, politics and economy trade. It appeared soon, that the heritage of the soviet information dictatorship, especially the traditions of media steering, are stronger than the democratic traditions of the first independence in Latvia, and just that became as an important hindrance for the diversification of an independent media system and by that {{for the establishment of a}} real, not only proclaimed press freedom. From the political system diversified, independent media system with own part and functional logic is in Latvia still in the making and dependent on the whole process of transformation, and namely ? at the beginning of the consolidation phase, similarly as in other Middle European countries. In the Latvian case there can be represented above all the western investment companies as such positive working veto actors, which support the independence of the media, while the Latvian investment companies themselves, partially with exception of the regional (local) media, has strongly arranged in the political action. By that on the ground of the dissertation are realized analysis on structural achievements of the media system in the Republic of Latvia and appears just the journalistic professionalizing necessarily as the royal way towards the ensuring of the independence and quality of the contemporary Latvian media and with that, which confirms the <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> by the author, as "a measuring-stick" for the development level of the mass media transformation in Latvia. This "measuring-stick" shows unfortunately a relative low level in comparison to western countries. Out of that the task of the professionalizing results as the main task for the future development, because the possibility of the juridical regulation and institutionalising in sense of professional societies remains extremely limited. It means, it can only be applicable above all to strengthen steady the other journalistic infrastructures - especially the education and the media journalism, and at the same time - the quality ensuring instruments within editorial offices.

The curriculum {{in this project}} blends the traditional lecture model of instruction with a new history lab model, which includes extensive primary source analysis and thesis development. Because many students have little experience with analyzing and evaluating historical documents, this curriculum is teacher-directed to provide the modeling and practice students {{need to develop a}} <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> and the skills needed to support that thesis through document analysis. As students develop their analysis skills, they learn about immigration law in the United States {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century and how it was implemented at two ports of entry ??? Ellis Island in New York City, New York and Angel Island in San Francisco, California. They learn about the impact of these laws on a little-known group of immigrants from the Indian sub-continent as well as the impact this group of immigrants had on immigration and naturalization law in the United States. Students also learn about three common immigration myths and use these myths as the basis for their thesis development. They analyze historical documents relating to the South Asian immigrant experience to determine what parts of the myths held true for these people.

40|$|As an {{essential}} source {{of new products}} and with a large leverage on product and production costs, R&D-areas have substantial influence on enterprise success. However, in industrial practice {{there is a lack}} of closed and practicable instruments to align and improve this important enterprise area strategically. Although, meanwhile Benchmarking is established in many enterprise areas, until now Benchmarking is used in R&D-areas very cautiously. Therefore, a Benchmarking methodology was developed which fundamentally consists of four modules: comparability assessment module, success assessment module, variable model and evaluation module. The comparability assessment module underlies a catalogue with 17 enterprise-, product-, customer- and competitor-describing characteristic criteria. The catalogue encloses characteristic criteria which are not or not within short time influenceable by R&D-areas (exogenous criteria). The criteria are evaluated about individual comparisons, weighted and overlaid to a comparability key figure which serves for the choice of suitable Benchmarking-partners. The <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> for the development of the success assessment module was, that success (failure) of R&D-areas arises in essence from the (not) fulfilment of relevant stakeholder groups demands. Hence, nine stakeholder groups of R&D-areas were identified (among others customer, management, R&D-area itself), their position to each other examined and a method to identify, weight and quantify the demands and their degree of fulfilment. The variable model forms the core of the Benchmarking methodology. It encloses at the highest level seven main variable groups (strategy, project management, organization etc.) which were subdivided in each case into main aspects and partial aspects. All aspects represent endogenous criteria, i. e. criteria to be affected by the R&D-area directly. The aspects of the lowest level of the variable model were operationalized by altogether 228 key figures, which have been arranged to a key figure system. The evaluation of the Benchmarking-data takes place in two different ways. On the one hand strengths and weaknesses can be identified by enterprise-specific comparison of the individual key figures with the successful and less successful Benchmarking-partners. On the other hand, general success factors or successful pattern can be derived by analysing all Benchmarking-data statistically. With the developed Benchmarking methodology an instrument is provided with which R&D-areas can be assessed integrated, benchmarked with other enterprises and precisely improved...|$|E

40|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted that residential submarkets exist, {{this is not the}} case for either their definition or delineation. This study has developed and assessed a methodology for deriving the geospatial dimensions of residential real estate submarkets based on the behaviour of the marketplace with respect to the underlying dimensions of the residential real estate living structure (RLS). Importantly, the methodology makes no prior assumptions about where the spatial boundaries might be. They were empirically derived from the data alone. It is achieved by building on previous work in the field and seeking to identify the fundamental issues in residential real estate market behaviour. The first basic premise of the thesis is that when a dwelling is sold, the commodity traded is a piece of real estate geography comprising a complex bundle of both spatial and structural attributes. The second basic premise is the recognition in the methodology of the importance of ‘location’. The price of the real estate geography varies across geographical space in a continuous fashion and it is this price variability that is defined, in this study, to be the geospatial submarket identifier. The study adopts a two-stage methodology reflecting these two basic premises. Firstly, a complex bundle of attributes is collected for every property in the study area and distilled into its underlying dimensions using principal component analysis. The resulting factors are used in the second stage as independent variables in a hedonic geographically weighted regression model to determine the price variability across geographical space of the underlying residential real estate structure. User-defined breaks in the continuous price surface delineate the geospatial submarket boundaries. The study represents a new approach to the delineation of geospatial submarket boundaries and is yet to be fully assessed by the two major identified users (the planning profession and the valuation profession). However, initial feedback indicates that the ability of the methodology to describe the geospatial submarket boundaries in terms of ‘how’ and ‘where’ location affects the market price of the underlying real estate geography, gives the land professional a better understanding of the submarket structure in which they are <b>working.</b> <b>Thesis</b> (Ph.

40|$|In {{the ongoing}} project of {{adding to the}} {{recently}} built, or more specifically the problem of additions to postwar icons, the issues have proven more slippery. (In this context, I use “project” to mean a larger theoretical endeavor or task of investigation rather than an architectural proposal.) First, what, in this context, is postwar? To focus this thesis, I define it as the period in American architecture {{from the end of}} World War II to the dissolution of the modern movement into the splintered ‘isms’ of the late 1970 ’s and early 1980 ’s that were bubbling up in the decades before. And why icons? Rather than the “low road” buildings of recent heritage – the dysfunctions of which are most often happily mitigated by additions – postwar icons would seem to pose a distinct set of challenges. This premise is born out even anecdotally by the evidence: numerous additions by high profile design talents with sincere intentions that amount to ambiguous results. The particular provocations of the task, in most cases, remain unacknowledged and unmet. In this thesis I mean to investigate the challenges and parameters posed through these types of projects, {{and the degree to which}} the circumstances are unique to ‘their’ (modern) movement and ‘our’ contemporary moment. (While Modernism is an admittedly loaded and imprecise term, I will use it as shorthand for the various ideologies in mainstream architectural practice in the midtwentieth century.) First, how does the consideration of the “recent past” as short temporal distance play a role, and second, how might this be complicated further by modernism’s own ambivalent relationship with history? And then what of our own ambivalent relationship with modernism as history? What are the specific theoretical questions at hand as regards changing conceptions of time, author, and artifact? The <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> of this paper is that, indeed, in the broader spectrum of additions to significant historic buildings, the project of adding to a postwar icon is unique on two levels. The first is that these icons necessitate a sophisticated approach, distinct from the broader addition paradigm as it is now understood in conservation and preservation design. By virtue of the moderns’ era, our era, and the relationship therein, postwar icons stipulate an ‘ethic’ that may prove to have some surprising tolerances but nonetheless demands a unique approach and demonstrable design rationale. The second argument is that a requisite ethic largely remains out of sight, discourse, and widespread use. The paradigms of current practice, through their failures and ambiguities, make the case for a critical reconsideration of this project within our complementary and combined fields of architecture and preservation design...|$|E
40|$|I wasn 2 ̆ 7 t {{raised in}} a {{vegetarian}} household. As a matter of fact, I have spent {{the majority of my}} life on a horse and cattle farm in central Kentucky. As a child, the process of raising our cattle for slaughter didn 2 ̆ 7 t strike me as a disgusting or unholy activity-my parents participated, after all, and they didn 2 ̆ 7 t seem to be adversely affected. Even when I became aware that some of the animals I had seen wandering the fields were slaughtered just down the road from our kitchen table, it never bothered me beyond an initial instant of discomfort. It wasn 2 ̆ 7 t until I happened upon the film Earthlings, a documentary discussing the variety of ways in which human beings utilize animals, that I found myself unable to compartmentalize my feelings of sympathy and disgust away from the dinner table. Images of cows drowning in their own blood stalked me constantly. Not only did I become unwilling to eat meat, I became convinced of the necessity of educating others, of bringing the entire world into this vegetarian lifestyle. As a means to this educational end, I decided to structure my honors thesis around one deceptively simple question: What makes a vegetarian? The idea was fairly rudimentary. I wanted discover what makes vegetarians tick, and to inspire these qualities in others-I wanted to discover the recipe for instant vegetarianism. As my personal feelings on the subject are concerned primarily with animal welfare, as opposed to nutrition or environmental impact, etc., I first wanted to gather research that supported my own murky instincts-instincts that told me that non-human animals are just as capable of feeling pain and loss as we are. Once I knew that the inquiries of scientists and philosophers such as Temple Grandin, Peter Singer, and Marc Bekoff verified my own ideas regarding animal consciousness and the gross mistreatment perpetrated by the food industry, I was able to move forward with constructing my research. As I knew that I had easy access to the population of Butler University, I decided to limit my study to Butler students between the ages of seventeen and twenty-seven. It bothered me somewhat to limit the socioeconomic scope of this project to a population comprised chiefly of middle- to upper-class, white students, but I was quickly convinced that such a study would be more effective in terms of drawing legitimate, structured conclusions. While a person 2 ̆ 7 s economic status may affect the decision to buy mass-produced meat products as opposed to the more natural alternative, identifying this factor was not as important to my research as was discovering how a given subject conceives of the animals that he or she consumes. I wanted to know what people are willing to eat, and why, regardless of the innumerable social, political, and economic classes to which they may belong. The construction and execution of this project was, if nothing else, a fantastic lesson in self-awareness. I was forced many times to re-evaluate the ways in which I asked certain questions, to consider factors that I perceived as irrelevant to my own decisions, and to accept that my initial ideas were largely uninformed. While my primary question seemed simple and my goal obvious, the process itself was complex and required a great deal of flexibility.

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{doctoral}} thesis is {{the establishment of}} a model of intervention which allows for the adaptation and preservation of cultural items situated in natural spaces, as with mountain dolmens in Bizkaia. @@ Dolmenic mountain monuments in the Basque Country comprise about 800 pieces of which approximately 100 are situated in Bizkaia. They are situated in crests, mountain passes and hillsides. Many of them are small (most of them would fit inside a cubic metre). Their current conditions are quite deficient as far as preservation is concerned. @@ Until now, such monuments had only been researched from an archaeological point of view, but the <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> that we assume is that preservation should be extended to any cultural heritage which should be preserved in order to prevent, as far as possible, its complete disappearance. @@ With this purpose in mind, research starts in the development and theoretical application of the pattern of intervention, and once that has been completed, it enters a second stage that is about to start, with practical field research on the dolmens in their natural environment. @@ The sources used are based on new policies of preservation elaborated over the last 10 years in Europe. Experts like N. P. Stanley Price, J. M. Coles, Barclay G. Jones, John Ashurst or Francis G. Dines defend a model of preservation in which the element of prevention prevails through environmental intervention on the vegetal environment. The exhibition of the dolmens in their original environments is therefore conceived to turn them into cultural spaces (museums on site) which are well cared for and well preserved. If reconstruction is deemed necessary, it should be well thought out. @@ Research within this thesis is split in two parts: @@ The development of a structure of analysis which concludes in the pattern of intervention described above. For this purpose, some material about intervention in natural places has been collected, assessing all the tools and applications that could potentially be of use in our work. It is from this information that the pattern of intervention beginning with the assessment of every aspect of the dolmen (use, damage, connection with the environment, etc.), followed by the establishment of the kind of intervention needed, like rehabilitation or cleaning, the elimination of pieces which have been added on, the restitution of structural components, the reinstatement of other elements, demarcation and the preventive post-intervention processes aimed to stabilise and reduce risk. @@ A selection was made of 15 dolmens in Bizkaia, based on the differences in environment: rural, close to great urban concentrations and near industrial areas. @@ The pattern of intervention described previously was applied on them, and the result can be summarised in the following conclusions: @@ Verification of the regrettable conditions of dolmens in Bizkaia. The more serious damage observed was: morphological break-up, loss of lithic material, mimesis, infestation and uncontrolled growth of vegetation in their surroundings. Such damage has made them very difficult to identify, and has made them very vulnerable. @@ Prevention based on environmental intervention is offered as the only valid guarantee for their stability. @@ The best way to maintain a cultural heritage is to put it to some use.

40|$|Superior {{readiness}} {{of the inhabitants}} for the emergency situation caused by radiation accident {{is a very important}} condition for managing these situations, further for trouble-free adoption of measures related to the protection of life and health for each individual. Persons should be conscious of the hazard of emergency situations and within oneself be prepared to help themselves and each other. The objective of this master thesis is to examine the {{readiness of}} the inhabitants of the emergency planning zones of the Nuclear power plants in Czech Republic (Dukovany NPP) and in Slovakia (Jaslovské Bohunice NPP) to the emergency situation and to assess, if the readiness in both countries differs. The Nuclear power plants in Dukovany and in Jaslovské Bohunice were chosen for the particular reason, that both facilities were constructed and put into operation at the time of existence of the common state of Czech and Slovaks. The starting point is a <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> that the readiness of the inhabitants for managing the emergency situation in the planning zones of the Nuclear power plants in Czech Republic and in Slovakia was on the same level. Considering the population differentiation, I analysed separately the answers of respondents in the age group of the 4165 year old. Theoretical part of my thesis initially focuses on the historical development of Nuclear power plants on the territory of the former Czechoslovakia and deals with {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the production of electricity in a fission reaction. The other part deals with safety and operational security of the Nuclear power plants. Here is mentioned the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, including the examples of nuclear facilities accidents. At the conclusion of the theoretical part is a survey of legislative regulations concerning the nuclear safety and protection of the population in both countries and a survey of measures concerning protection of the population in the event of radiation accident. The experimental part of my thesis started in form of questionnaire inquiry by the inhabitants of both emergence planning zones. Half of the 16 questions in total is analysed by the means of descriptive and mathematical statistics, the answers to the other questions refer to behavior, informedness, readiness and differing needs of individuals in case of emergency shelter in place or evacuation from the actual occurrence of radiation accident. The hypothesis was verified by applying the two-selective parametric testing. By means of the t-test it could be proved, that there is no statistically significant difference between the inhabitants readiness in the both emergence planning zones. The hypothesis was therefore accepted. By applying the chi-square test it was elicited, that the empirical distribution of both selective statistical sets can by replaced by a normal distribution, both empirical curves can by therefore replaced by a Gauss curve. This partial research focuses on the age group of the 41 - 65 year old. Also in this case could be proved by means of chi-square test the normality of both statistical sets. Also the application of two-selective parametric testing approved, that the readiness of the population of the age group under investigation do not vary in the both zones. The particular answers were recorded graphically and in the following discussion were commented the differences and specifics with regard to the differing knowledge, behavior and specific requirements of the people in case of evacuation. In context of the results measured in the particular zones of accident planning it could be useful to consider, if in place of the normal distribution of readiness not another for example the Poisson distribution - would be more suitable, that could possibly testify better readiness for emergency accidents.

40|$|The growing {{mobility}} of {{capital in the}} wake of globalization has a major effect on how countries with free-market economies raise their revenues. The focus is clearly shifting from taxation of income onto taxation of consumption and labour. But even though corporate income taxes ("CIT") are becoming less and less important as a source of revenue to finance state expenses, countries do continue to compete on this arena, including on nominal tax rates. Today, multinationals choose to site their projects less on the basis of geography but more in reliance on comparisons of competition drivers, such as internal market, legal and political stability, labour costs, education and, last but not least, business taxation. On the most general plane, this thesis seeks to assess the competitiveness of the Polish system of business income taxation. It is assumed as a starting point that taxation levels across countries cannot be rationally compared unless through the use of effective tax rates because nominal rates do not in themselves reveal much about the actual tax charge on the business bottom line. The present paper analyses a number of well-known methods of calculating the effective CIT rate, used mainly in econometrics and statistics, but finds that none of them is free from weaknesses. Above all, these methods omit deferred taxes, without which any measurement of only current income tax expense will distort the picture of actual tax burden. As a result, the method considered the most authoritative and useful given the purpose of this thesis is the effective tax rate (ETR) method. ETR is computed {{in the same way as}} it is done by thousands of firms in Poland and abroad which use International Financial Reporting Standards to prepare their financial statements. ETR takes account of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, therefore generally eliminating measurement distortions that arise from temporary differences between tax and accounting recognition of income or loss. The main purpose of this thesis is to define the actual relationship between nominal and effective income tax rates on businesses in Poland using the ETR methodology. No such research has been done before. Given the purpose of the work but also its effectiveness, a monographic study of a sample of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange is considered to be the most appropriate research method. The data has been analysed in detail and interpreted, and additional complementary research has been done in the form of interviews with individual representatives of selected companies and a comparative analysis of the results of an independent survey of the effective taxation of 250 medium-sized and large Polish enterprises. The outcome of the research corroborates the author's <b>working</b> <b>thesis</b> statement that the average ETR varies substantially above the nominal CIT rate of 19 %. The average ETR for 194 WSE-listed companies over three consecutive years was 20. 3411 %. The thesis also carefully presents and analyses how different industries and origin of capital display different sensitivities to ETR drivers. The research results are used in an attempt to explain the observed differences between effective and nominal tax rates to the extent their causes are attributable to tax law and accounting law. This analysis focuses in particular on the regulations of the Polish Corporate Income Tax Act. It has also be found out that there is a major factor in accounting law that causes permanent differences to arise between accounting and tax recognition of profit or loss. Taking into account global and European trends in the development of corporate taxation, including the EU proposals for CCCTB and the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting guidelines, the author discusses possible directions for potential future changes of the Polish system of taxation. The thesis winds up with postulates de lege ferenda. Certain changes to Polish tax law are suggested with a primary view to limiting "excessive" differences between effective and nominal income taxation. "Excessive" differences are taken to mean those which harm Poland's competitive position on the international investment market but which do not have a sufficient fiscal or economic justification. Such differences are "excessive" also in the sense that they are more common in Poland than in a number of other European countries that are important competitive benchmarks for the Polish economy. Some foreign tax jurisdictions endorse a rule that the accounting balance sheet is an authoritative source of data for tax purposes. This authoritativeness rule, which is described in more detail in the thesis, brings the tax base closer to accounting profit/loss. The Polish tax system does not have such a rule and, therefore, facilitates overrepresentation of differences between accounting and tax recognition of income, a feature that deteriorates Poland's investment competitiveness. If such differences are not sufficiently justified by important fiscal or systemic considerations, it is advisable to restrict them by making changes to relevant laws and regulations...|$|E
