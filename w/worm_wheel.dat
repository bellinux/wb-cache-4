25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on <b>worm</b> <b>wheels</b> before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of <b>worm</b> <b>wheels.</b> After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R
25|$|Gashing {{was first}} used to rough out <b>worm</b> <b>wheels</b> using a {{universal}} milling machine, but then dedicated gashers were built to rough out other types of gears. Because the processes is carried out on two different machines the process differs.|$|R

50|$|The first are non-throated worm gears. These don't have a throat, or groove, {{machined}} {{around the}} circumference of either the worm or <b>worm</b> <b>wheel.</b> The second are single-throated worm gears, in which the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> is throated. The final type are double-throated worm gears, which have both gears throated. This type of gearing can support the highest loading.|$|E

25|$|Hobbing is used {{to produce}} most throated <b>worm</b> <b>wheels,</b> but certain tooth {{profiles}} cannot be hobbed.

50|$|A {{worm drive}} is a gear {{arrangement}} {{in which a}} worm (which is a gear {{in the form of}} a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and <b>worm</b> <b>wheel.</b> The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term worm gear to refer to the worm, the worm gear, or the worm drive as a unit.|$|E

50|$|The rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear {{consists}} of two admission valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, operated by a camshaft arranged in a box fixed to each cylinder between the valve chambers. The cam boxes are self-contained and detachable, and replacement cam boxes can be fitted at running sheds within a few hours. The camshafts are driven from the return cranks on the driving <b>wheels</b> through <b>worm</b> <b>wheels</b> and universal propeller shafts, arranged so that the camshafts and the coupled wheels revolve at the same speed.|$|R
50|$|Steering is by <b>worm</b> and <b>wheel,</b> both {{back and}} front springs are half {{elliptical}} controlled by Luvax hydraulic dampers, Lockheed hydraulic brakes are fitted {{on all four}} wheels.|$|R
50|$|For {{more precise}} {{position}} control, a worm drive may be used. A <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{fixed to the}} rotating platform and meshes with a worm in the base. Rotation of the worm via a manual control knob causes the platform to rotate {{with respect to the}} base. Index marks on both the control knob and the platform can be used to locate the platform very precisely and repeatably with respect to the base.|$|E
50|$|Slewing drives {{function}} with standard worm technology, {{in which the}} worm on the horizontal shaft acts as the driver for the gear. The rotation of the horizontal screw turns a gear about an axis perpendicular to the screw axis. This combination reduces {{the speed of the}} driven member and also multiplies its torque; increasing it proportionally as the speed decreases. The speed ratio of shafts depends upon the relation of the number of threads on the worm to the number of teeth in the <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> or gear.|$|E
50|$|A {{positioning}} goniometer or goniometric {{stage is}} a device used to rotate an object precisely about a fixed axis in space. It {{is similar to}} a linear stage, however, rather than moving linearly with respect to its base, the stage platform rotates partially about a fixed axis above the mounting surface of the platform. Positioning goniometers typically use a worm drive with a partial <b>worm</b> <b>wheel</b> fixed to the underside of the stage platform meshing with a worm in the base. The worm may be rotated manually or by a motor as in automated positioning systems.|$|E

40|$|A {{description}} is given of a gripper device with a controllable motor whose output shaft drives the worm of {{a worm gear}} which actuates a linear shifting device with gripper jaws attached to it and a spring device which generates a specific gripper force. According to the invention, the characteristic features of the gripper unit are as follows: the worm gear features two <b>worm</b> <b>wheels</b> whose axes of rotation are vertical on the plane clamped by the gripper jaws; the linear shifting device features a feed unit and a separate guide unit for each gripper jaw; each of the gripper jaws are mounted on the movable element such that they can counteract {{the force of the}} spring mechanism...|$|R
