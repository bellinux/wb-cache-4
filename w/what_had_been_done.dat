25|$|After the Jacobean/Caroline era, A Midsummer Night's Dream {{was never}} {{performed}} {{in its entirety}} until the 1840s. Instead, it was heavily adapted in forms like Henry Purcell's musical masque/play The Fairy Queen (1692), which had a successful run at the Dorset Garden Theatre, but was not revived. Richard Leveridge turned the Pyramus and Thisbe scenes into an Italian opera burlesque, acted at Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1716. John Frederick Lampe elaborated upon Leveridge's version in 1745. Charles Johnson had used the Pyramus and Thisbe material in the finale of Love in a Forest, his 1723 adaptation of As You Like It. In 1755, David Garrick did the opposite of <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> a century earlier: he extracted Bottom and his companions and acted the rest, in an adaptation called The Fairies. Frederic Reynolds produced an operatic version in 1816.|$|E
25|$|The {{exhibition}} {{was an enormous}} success in that it served to catalyze anew designers, decorators, artists and architects in France, who prior to the 1910 Salon d'Automne had been lagging behind in the design sector. It also catalyzed public opinion, formerly interested solely in paintings. The fact that the viewers saw first hand, and many for the first time, <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> abroad, opened up a potential {{of what could be}} done in the field of decorative arts at home. Jourdain had successfully staged the German show to provoke French designers into improving the quality of their own work. The effects would be felt in Paris, first with the 1912 exhibition of French decorative arts at the Pavillon de Marsan, then again at the Salon d'Automne of 1912, with La Maison Cubiste, the collaborative effort of the designer André Mare, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and other artists associated with the Section d'Or.|$|E

When the JNA tried to call up reservists, parents and relatives gathered around barracks to prevent their children taking part in the operation. Resistance to conscription became widespread across Serbia, ranging from individual acts of defiance to collective mutinies by hundreds of reservists at a time. A number of Serbian opposition politicians condemned the war. Desimir Tošić of the Democratic Party accused Milošević of [...] "using the conflict to cling to power", and Vuk Drašković, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, appealed to JNA soldiers to [...] "pick up their guns and run".

[...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the}} first guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great.

In March, the Bosnian referendum on independence passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, having been boycotted by most Bosnian Serbs. The SDS, claiming that independence {{would result in the}} Serbs becoming [...] "a national minority in an Islamic state", had used armed irregular units to block the delivery of ballot boxes, and dropped leaflets encouraging the boycott. Despite this, thousands of Serbs in larger cities did participate in the referendum and voted for independence, and several violent incidents were triggered across Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to historian Noel Malcolm the [...] "steps taken by Karadžić and his party – [...] "Autonomous Regions", the arming of the Serb population, minor local incidents, non-stop propaganda, the request for federal army [...] "protection" [...] – matched exactly <b>what</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in Croatia.

Kim recognized that producing a successful game in South Korea generally meant {{it would be}} published globally, and wanted to use his team to create a successful title for personal computers that was following the same model that other mobile games published by Bluehole had found. He had already been excited about making a type of battle royale game after he had played DayZ, in part that the format had not caught on in Korea.
