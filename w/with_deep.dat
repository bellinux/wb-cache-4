5|$|B.menziesiis inflorescences {{resemble}} those of no other banksia; its closest relatives were felt by George to be B.speciosa (showy banksia) and B.baxteri (bird's nest banksia), which differs from B.menziesii in having yellow flowers and leaves <b>with</b> <b>deep</b> triangular lobes. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed its closest relatives to be {{the members of the}} series Crocinae.|$|E

5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the San Joaquin Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind thrust fault (the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' uplift, it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, <b>with</b> <b>deep</b> side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E
5|$|About {{four hours}} after formation, the {{depression}} intensified into Tropical Storm Bret, upon which it attained a minimum central pressure of 1002mbar. Shortly thereafter, its appearance on radar deteriorated, and convection warmed around the center. With a mid-level anticyclone over Texas, Bret tracked steadily to the west-northwest, {{and began to}} re-organize just before moving ashore; at 12:00UTC on June 29, the storm made landfall just southeast of Tuxpan with winds of 65km/h (40mph). After crossing the coast, the storm quickly degenerated to tropical depression status, though Bret retained a well-organized cloud pattern <b>with</b> <b>deep</b> convection. The center turned to the north-northwest, and early on June 30 Bret dissipated inland over Mexico.|$|E

After being interrogated by Henderson, Mulder is detained alongside an eccentric NICAP member named Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), who was also captured in the woods. The next morning, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives to retrieve Mulder, telling him that FBI Section Chief Joseph McGrath is threatening {{to shut down the}} X-Files because of his behavior. She also claims that the wreckage has been identified as a downed Libyan fighter jet; Mulder dismisses this explanation. Meanwhile, the invisible occupant of the UFO passes through an electronic fence set up around the crash site, escaping into the outside world.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope <b>with</b> <b>deep</b> snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, <b>with</b> <b>deep</b> convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye. Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E
