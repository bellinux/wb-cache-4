Moore's use for cigars {{in his early}} films put him {{in contrast to the}} cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|After {{joining the}} fleet, the Wittelsbach class ships <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> I Battle Squadron, where they {{replaced}} the older Brandenburg-class ships. Like the Kaiser Friedrich III-class ships, the Wittelsbachs were withdrawn from active service after {{the advent of}} the dreadnoughts. The five ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. They <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> IV Battle Squadron and deployed to the Baltic. However, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. By 1922, all of the ships had been broken up for scrap, with the exception of Zähringen. She was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1926–27. RAF bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
5|$|All of the E class <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 5th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Home Fleet upon {{commissioning}} during 1934. Following the Italian {{invasion of}} Abyssinia, the entire flotilla {{was sent to}} the Red Sea in August 1935 to monitor Italian warship movements until April 1936. Refitted upon their return, many were deployed to Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39 to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged ships. While the F-class ships <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 6th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, they followed much the same pattern as their E-class sisters. In April 1939 the 5th and 6th DFs were renumbered the 7th and 8th Destroyer Flotillas, respectively. In mid-1939, newly-commissioned J-class destroyers began to replace the E-class ships and they were reduced to reserve for lack of manpower. Increasing tensions with Nazi Germany in August, caused the British to mobilize the Navy's reserves, which allowed the ships to be manned again and assigned to the 12th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews <b>were</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for fuel efficiency and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E

5|$|Between August and September 1941, the Hawaiian Division's {{assets were}} reorganized to form two {{divisions}} {{under the new}} Triangular Division TO.
