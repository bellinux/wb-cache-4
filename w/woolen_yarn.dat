50|$|Woolen (American English) or woollen (Commonwealth English) {{is a type}} of yarn {{made from}} carded wool. <b>Woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> is soft, light, stretchy, and full of air. It is thus a good insulator, and makes a good {{knitting}} yarn. <b>Woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> is in contrast to worsted yarn, in which the fibers are combed to lie parallel rather than carded, producing a hard, strong yarn.|$|E
50|$|<b>Woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> is handspun {{using the}} long draw technique, and the yarn is spun from a rolag. Most handspinners make {{a blend of}} a woolen and worsted yarn, using {{techniques}} from both categories, and thus ending up with a mix. The first step to spin a true <b>woolen</b> <b>yarn,</b> however, is to card the fiber into a rolag using handcarders.|$|E
30|$|For {{the light}} fastness, it was {{observed}} that all the <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> dyed with T. chebula showed very good fastness results to light. The alum-mordanted dyed <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> were found comparatively less tolerable towards light in comparison to control-, iron-, or tin-mordanted dyed <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> (Maulik and Agarwal 2014). This is probably due to weak coordination bonding of alum with dye molecule, and the photolytic degradation happens, {{but in the case of}} iron, strong coordination bonding prevents photolytic degradation by protecting the chromophore with dissipation of energy of absorbed photons to the chelate structure formed with metal ions (Jothi 2008).|$|R

50|$|There are {{completely}} different behaviors {{depending on the}} kind of yarn material. Much is known about the steaming of <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> but more research is needed on the steaming behaviour of artificial fibers and cotton.|$|R
50|$|Long draw is the {{spinning}} technique {{used to create}} <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns.</b> It is spun from carded rolags. It is generally spun from shorter stapled fibers. Long draw spun yarns are light, lofty, stretchy, soft, and full of air, thus they are good insulators, and make good knitting yarns.|$|R
40|$|The {{aqueous extract}} {{obtained}} from the powdered roots of Indian madder (Rubia cordifolia) was used for dyeing of <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns.</b> The effect of pH, dye concentration, and mordants on the colorimetric and fastness properties has been studied. Brilliant shades of bright red to scarlet were obtained with significant variation in hue and tone of shades depending on mordants and dye concentrations used. The color coordinates of the dyed samples {{were found to be}} in the red-yellow quadrant of the CIELab color space. It was found in all cases that mordanting with alum as well as ferrous sulfate has caused decrease in lightness (L*) values and increase in K/S values. All the dyed samples exhibited commercially acceptable fastness to light, washing, and rubbing. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) morphological studies have also been performed on different <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> {{formation}} {{is also very}} common for knitwear, where the resultant garment has some bulk and the requirement for visual aesthetics (of fiber alignment) is minimal.|$|E
50|$|Combing {{is another}} method to align the fibres {{parallel}} to the yarn, and thus is good for spinning a worsted yarn, whereas the rolag from handcards produces a <b>woolen</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|E
25|$|Any yarn can {{be either}} knitted or crocheted, {{provided}} needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties {{should be taken into}} account. For example, lofty, thick <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly spun yarn helps to achieve the firm texture required for Amigurumi crochet.|$|R
30|$|Un-mordanted and mordanted dyed <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> {{were tested}} for dry and wet rub {{fastness}} properties and were found {{more or less}} the same (4 – 5 on the grayscale) for both un-mordanted and mordanted dyed samples. Rub fastness of alum-mordanted samples were relatively found somewhat less than that of un-mordanted and mordanted with iron or tin which was due to weak coordination complexation of aluminum ions.|$|R
50|$|Linen yarns {{and fabric}} {{were used for}} quality and {{commercial}} work, although some early buttons for local use used cheaper <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> from local herds. Most buttons were produced in their natural colour, but could be dyed to match garments. The use of multiple yarn colours is a predominantly modern trend. Dorset buttons were known and traded widely, {{but it was a}} long time before their production was organised into a recognisable industry.|$|R

50|$|Woonsocket Rubber Company Mill is an {{historic}} mill at 60-82 Main Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The mill {{consists of a}} series of 3- and 4-story brick buildings built between 1865 and 1875 by Edward Harris, one of Woonsocket's leading businessmen. These buildings housed the Woonsocket Rubbert Company, one of Rhode Island's first manufacturer of rubber products, principally shoes, boots, and rubberized fabric. In 1910 the complex was purchased by the Falls Yarn Company, which used it for the production of fine <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Woolen is a soft, short-staple, {{carded wool}} yarn {{typically}} used for knitting. [...] In traditional weaving, <b>woolen</b> weft <b>yarn</b> (for softness and warmth) is frequently {{combined with a}} worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie was}} filmed {{in the village}} of Harmony, Maine at Bartlettyarns Inc., the oldest <b>woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> mill in the United States (est. 1821). The {{historic}} Bartlett mill was renamed [...] "Bachman" [...] for the movie, an homage to King's pseudonym, Richard Bachman. The interior shots of the antique mill machinery, and the riverside cemetery, were in Harmony. Other scenes (restaurant interior, and giant wool picking machine) were at locations in Bangor, Maine, at an abandoned waterworks and armory. A few other mill scenes were staged near the Eastland woolen mill in Corinna, Maine, which subsequently became a Super Fund site.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to tinware, ammunition {{was made from}} the local lead mines during the Revolutionary War. East Berlin Milling Co. produced cotton and <b>woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> which was spun into clothing and blankets. Simeon North, manufacturer of pistols, became the first official pistol maker for the United State Government when he developed a system of interchangeable parts for pistols. In the 1800s, business of all sorts thrived in Berlin. Makers of wagons, tableware, hats, clocks, books, combs, woolen clothes and blankets, cabinet and coffin makers, sleighs, muffs, and suits, were all local industries. Berlin was on the direct route from New Haven to Hartford, with taverns and inns, which were regular stagecoach stops for fresh horses, meals and sleeping accommodations.|$|E

30|$|The dye stock {{solution}} was prepared by dissolving 76.5  g of walnut into 3  litres of water. The extracted dye solution {{was divided into}} different concentrations ranging between 1 and 20 % (o.w.f.). The dyeing experiments were performed using M: L ratio of 1 : 40 in separate baths with manual agitation at pH 7 using 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 % (o.w.f.) dye concentrations. <b>Woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> were drenched to dyeing baths containing warm dye solution. The dye bath temperatures were raised to simmering point (91 – 93  °C) and {{at a rate of}} 2  °C per min and maintained at that level for 60  min (Rather et al. 2016 a, b). Finally dyed samples were washed with 5  ml/L non-ionic detergent (Safewash Wipro), rinsed with running tap water, and dried in shade.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to study the}} influence of ammonia after-treatment on color behavior in wool yarns dyed with annatto extract. The dyeing was carried out using 15 % (o. w. f.) dye concentration in presence of stannous chloride as a mordant and then treated with different percentages of ammonia solution. At the same time, color strength, CIE-Lab values and fastness properties of all dyed <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> were also assessed. It was concluded that, in all cases after treatment with ammonia caused a decrease in lightness (L*) values, there was less lightness in the red hue of the wool yarns {{with the increase of}} ammonia percentage in solution. The K/S value of annatto dyed wool was found to increase after treated with ammonia. In addition, it was also observed that dyed wool yarns after post-treatment with ammonia did not return to their original color on acidification...|$|R

5000|$|Whilst woolen laces {{had been}} made from the 17th century onwards, {{it was not until}} the mid 19th century that [...] "yak lace" [...] became popular. Despite the {{difficulty}} of working with naturally elastic <b>woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> which meant that the lace instantly shrank to two thirds of its size once unpinned from the pillow, it was inexpensive, quick and easy to make and became popular and widely used. Yak lace could be produced in various weights, ranging from lightweight trimmings for children's dresses and underwear, to heavier, upholstery-weight lace suitable for curtains. Black yak lace was also widely used for mourning dress. The popularity of woolen lace was boosted by the nineteenth century hygienist Gustav Jäger's promotion of wool fabrics.|$|E
50|$|The Hockanum Mill in Rockville / Vernon CT was {{originally}} constructed in 1814 by Bingham & Nash. They became a leading manufacturer of satinet. The Hockum Mills in Connecticut {{was formed in}} 1836 and constructed a larger mill to produce satinet, a finely woven fabric that resembles satin but is made from wool. They continued to produce satinet until 1869. Satinet was also an important commodity {{for the people of}} West Tisbury, MA, on the island of Martha's Vineyard Ma. The Old Mill Pond property in that town was purchased by David Look in 1809 and he converted what was once a grain mill to textile mill. He installed a carding machine to produce <b>woolen</b> <b>yarn</b> and looms for weaving that wool into fabrics called kersey and Satinet. Needing more power than the river itself could provide, Look installed a dam to raise the pond’s water level. His mill produced Satinet; a waterproof fabric used in whaling and sea-going outerwear. Thomas Bradley bought the property in 1845 and erected a new textile mill which prospered until the 1860s, largely due to the popularity of Satinet’s use in waterproofing Civil War military uniforms. That mill building, now headquarters for the Martha's Vineyard Garden Club, still stands today.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design was}} based on the Spanish tree saddles in wide use in the United States at the time, and which had seen US Army use, {{although}} McClellan claimed that it {{was based on}} Hussar saddles he'd observed in use in the Crimean War. While McClellan did go overseas and observe the Crimean War for the US, the saddle does not closely duplicate any pattern in use by the armies in that conflict, but is very close to the widely used Spanish tree saddle, which was originally a saddle in common use in Mexico. The design underwent modifications over time, although in many ways it remained remarkably unchanged. The saddle was simple and less expensive than existing saddles, light enough not to burden the horse, but sturdy enough to give good support to the rider and his gear. It supported a rawhide-covered open seat, a thick leather skirt, wooden stirrups, and a girth strap of <b>woolen</b> <b>yarn.</b> Added accessories to the saddle sometimes included a nose bag for horse feed, a curry comb to groom the horse, a picket pin and lariat to tether the horse while grazing, saddlebags, and a [...] "thimble" [...] that held the muzzle of the cavalryman's carbine. The McClellan saddle was placed on top of a saddlecloth, shabrack, or saddle blanket.|$|E
40|$|The main physical-mechanical {{properties}} of the yarns are: linear density (Tex), tensile strength, tenacity, elongation at break, twisting and mechanical work of fracture, {{there is a strong}} correlation between them. The tensile properties are the basic characteristics of yarns, influencing how they behave in the technological processes of mechanical processing (preparation for weaving or knitting, proper weaving or knitting) determining the technological parameters of equipment adjusting during the technological processes and also their productivity. The tensile {{properties of}} yarns constitute qualitative characteristics, because their value depends {{on the quality of the}} yarn and also on the finite product obtained from processing yarns. In this paper was done a comparative study of the tensile properties of two batches of mixed <b>woolen</b> <b>yarns</b> (wool with polyester and wool with polyamide), the mixture being in the same proportions, but the yarns have different fineness and have very close twist values, both batches of yarns were designed for knitted products.
