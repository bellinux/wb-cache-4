The <b>wave</b> generator illustrates <b>wave</b> motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the <b>wave</b> takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The <b>wave</b> generator could illustrate <b>wave</b> reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in <b>Wave</b> Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E

The <b>wave</b> nearly developed into a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The <b>wave</b> entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the <b>wave</b> passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development.

The <b>wave</b> crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico.

5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected <b>wave</b> is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident <b>wave,</b> as it proceeds back down the line.

There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident <b>wave</b> has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude.
