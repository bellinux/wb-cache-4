40|$|The S shaped log log {{drawdown}} time curve {{typical of}} pumping tests in unconfined aquifers is reinvestigated via numerical experiments. We examine the {{temporal and spatial}} evolution of {{the rate of change}} in storage in an unconfined aquifer during pumping. This evolution is related to the transition <b>of</b> <b>water</b> release mechanisms from the expansion <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> the porous medium to the drainage <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from the unsaturated zone above the initial water table and initially saturated pores as the water table falls during the pumping of the aquifer. We conclude that the transition <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> release mechanisms and vertical flow are the cause of the S shaped drawdown time. Cross-correlation analysis is then employed {{to examine the relationship between}} hydraulic properties of an unconfined aquifer and pressure observations. The analysis reveals that head observed in the saturated zone at late times along a streamline is positively correlated with the conductivity (K(s)) of the region upstream of the observation location, and negatively correlated with the K(s) of the region downstream of the observation location along the same streamline. Besides, head observations in the saturated zone at the early time are positively correlated with specific storage (S(s)) in a narrow region between the observation and pumping locations. At intermediate and late times, the head positively correlates with the heterogeneity of α (pore-size distribution parameter) in a thin disk-shaped unsaturated region above the pumping and observation locations. Saturated water content θ(s) in the vadose zone directly above the pumping and monitoring locations is found positively correlated with the head observations during the intermediate times and late times. In the end, a stochastic inverse estimation is conducted to jointly interpret a sequential pumping test in a three dimensional unconfined aquifer. K(s), S(s), θ(s) and α are estimated at the same time. The estimated results capture the pattern of the heterogeneous parameters as well as the details with a smooth distribution. The estimated heterogeneous parameter fields produce better head predictions than the traditional homogeneous method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Construction and {{development}} of cities imposes profound modifications on the environment, such as: destruction of forests, reduction <b>of</b> <b>water</b> infiltration, increase <b>of</b> the pluvial <b>water</b> concentration, pollution, etc. These impacts are more intense and serious in developing countries, because the construction/development is made, normally, without planning and considering {{the limitations of the}} environment. Around the cities the problems are more serious because the urban infrastructure is deficient, and this causes the expansion of problems into other areas of the hydrographic basin. The occupation of upstream catchment areas of cities, without adequate planning causes serious problems for the city, such as erosion, siltation, flooding etc. An important factor to be considered is the change in the natural condition <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> <b>of</b> the soil that, as a consequence, can change infiltration and runoff rates, which may result in more erosion, flooding and siltation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} model sandy soils {{in the form}} of silica particle compacts under dynamic compression (0. 2 – 10. 0 Hz) is reported. The solid content ranges from 24 to 28 % by volume, as controlled by compaction. Both viscous and elastic characters are largely governed by the solid part of the compact. The elastic character stems from the stiffness of the silica, while the viscous character stems from the interparticle movement. The elastic character of the solid part (the storage modulus and solid content) is essentially independent of the degree <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> indicating validity <b>of</b> the rule of mixtures. The viscous character of the solid part (the loss tangent and solid content) decreases with increasing degree <b>of</b> <b>compaction,</b> indicating decreasing ease of interparticle movement as the degree <b>of</b> <b>compaction</b> increases.
