5|$|All YouTube {{users can}} upload videos up to 15 minutes each in duration. Users {{who have a}} good track record of {{complying}} with the site's Community Guidelines may be offered the ability to upload videos up to 12 hours in length, as well as live streams, which requires verifying the account, normally through a mobile phone. When YouTube was launched in 2005, it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to upload longer videos, but a ten-minute limit was introduced in March 2006 after YouTube found {{that the majority of}} videos exceeding this length were unauthorized uploads of television shows and films. The 10-minute limit was increased to 15 minutes in July 2010. In the past, it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to upload videos longer than 12 hours. Videos can be at most 128 GB in size. Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so YouTube provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E
5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} {{the river in}} 1792, proved that it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> to cross the Columbia Bar.

5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost his arm in a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Buddhist temples, {{including}} Borobudur, at {{that time}} <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> because Sanjaya's immediate successor, Rakai Panangkaran, granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples. In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 CE. This has led some archaeologists {{to believe that there}} was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; or for a Buddhist king to act likewise. However, it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in Java at the time—the Buddhist Sailendra and the Saivite Sanjaya—in which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the Ratubaka plateau. Similar confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the Prambanan complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor Rakai Pikatan as the Sanjaya dynasty's reply to Borobudur, but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.|$|E
5|$|Definite {{delimitation}} of Huascarán National Park <b>was</b> <b>possible</b> {{through the}} reversion {{of land to}} state control by means of compensated land expropriation.

40|$|What I {{call the}} {{argument}} from almost indiscernibles is an argument, {{put forward by}} Robert Adams in 1979, {{for the possibility of}} indiscernibles based on the possibility of almost indiscernibles. The argument is that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> but since almost indiscernible <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> The argument seems to be an improvement over the mere appeal to intuitions, like that suggested by Max Black, that situations in which there <b>are</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> for the argument purports to give us a reason that indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> In this paper I shall assess the argument by examining whether there is support for the conditional premise that if almost indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible,</b> indiscernibles <b>are</b> <b>possible.</b> I shall argue that there are reasons to think that either the premise lacks support or almost indiscernibles are dispensable. If the premise lacks support, the argument does not establish the possibility of almost indiscernibles; if almost indiscernibles are dispensable, the argument is not needed to establish the possibility of indiscernibles...|$|R
