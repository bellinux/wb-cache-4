500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bayer and I {{were in a}} lunchtime {{where we}} get to think [...] a name. [...] And ... B is, you know ... We were working for Boeing at the time, we couldn't use the name without talking to lawyers. [...] So, there is a B. [...] {{has to do with}} balance, another B. [...] Bayer was the senior author, who [...] several years older than I am and had many more {{publications}} than I did. So there is another B. [...] And so, at the lunch table <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> resolve whether there was one of those that made more sense than the rest. [...] What really lives to say is: the more you think about what the B in B-trees means, the better you understand B-trees." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E

2500|$|Back {{in those}} days [...] it was RCA, our record label then, went over the edge with Virgin Killer. Today {{when you think of}} child {{pornography}} on the net, you would never do something like that. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> this in the sense of pornography, we did it in the sense of art. It is about the song and the label was pushing the idea because they wanted to get the controversy to help the album sale and you cannot get better promotion than that. Looking back from the band point of view it was never an album cover that we took home to our parents and said, [...] "Look what we just released.." [...] There was always mixed feelings about it and even 30 years later it caused a scandal at Wikipedia because the site for that album was blocked and even the FBI was getting involved. All of that after so many years, can you believe that? ...|$|E
2500|$|Geffen {{opted to}} refer to the breakup as an [...] "indefinite hiatus," [...] and label {{president}} Jordan Schur reportedly told Barker that [...] "any press you do, make sure you say everything is cool." [...] Immediately following DeVoe's phone call, Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence, saying [...] "Right now, Travis and I are using the time off to start this project called Plus-44 [...] It's very exciting, like a breath of fresh air." [...] When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. [...] "It was strange to be talking about music that we were just in the very first steps of writing," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "It didn’t feel right to talk about yet." [...] The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. [...] "When we first started talking about ever doing anything outside of blink was on the last European tour where Tom was telling us that he needed to take a year off from the band. [...] <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> anything about it until Tom quit the band, but that's where it first started," [...] said Hoppus. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity. [...] "We were recording and we didn't want the cops showing up at our house at 2 a.m. because we were recording drums," [...] remembered Hoppus.|$|E

5000|$|Magritte {{used the}} same {{approach}} in a painting of an apple: he painted the fruit and then used an internal caption or framing device to deny that the item was an apple. In these [...] "Ceci n'est pas" [...] works, Magritte points out {{that no matter how}} naturalistically we depict an object, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> catch the item itself.|$|R

6000|$|... "But we {{stuck to}} our principles. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> commit murder.

6000|$|To this I agreed. Together we loaned {{him enough}} to make the first payment on a small farm. He was deeply {{grateful}} for this and hope again sprang up in his heart.

60|$|We {{spent as}} much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less miserable, and most of our {{acquaintance}} were in the same condition. There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves, and a skeleton truth that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> To the best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.|$|E
5000|$|According to Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, who {{arranges}} the band's string sections, [...] "Burn the Witch" [...] {{was written}} with strings in mind. He said: [...] "Very rarely for us, {{we managed to}} get strings on near the beginning the A Moon Shaped Pool. We left it unfinished on purpose and left lots of room for the strings and <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that usually. Usually the strings are the icing on top." ...|$|R

6000|$|Also, a {{month or}} two later, Thorn and Steel sought speech with me, the former looking almost uncomfortable when his {{companion}} said: [...] "I've been talking with Haldane about taking up my old place, and don't see how to raise the money, or feel very keen over it. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> much good there since my father went under.
