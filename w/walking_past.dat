The Durban Regional Court saw his bail application on 26 June 2014 where it was alleged that the shooting took place while IFP supporters were <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> an ANC tent. The case was set to continue in July.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of the investigation, a woman living in the nearby village of Little Thetford claimed to have seen two girls whose {{appearance}} and clothing matched those of Wells and Chapman <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> her home on the morning after they were reported missing.

25|$|Public toilets {{are usually}} readily {{available}} all over Japan, {{and can be}} found in department stores, supermarkets, book stores, CD shops, parks, most convenience stores, and in all but the most rural train stations. Some older public toilet buildings lack doors, meaning that men using the urinals are in full view of people <b>walking</b> <b>past.</b> Beginning in the 1990s, there has been a movement to make public toilets cleaner and more hospitable than they had been in the past.|$|E
25|$|The episode {{mainly focused}} on David Hewlett's character, Rodney McKay. Hewlett's real-life sister, Kate Hewlett made an {{appearance}} as Jeannie Miller, McKay's sister. This episode {{was the fourth}} to star Kate Hewlett's character. David Nykl was credited as his role of Radek Zelenka. However, {{by the time of}} the finished product, all of his scenes were cut out. Zelenka was, however mentioned in a scene, and despite having all his scenes cut, he was seen for a few seconds, <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> the camera, where the Czech flag was clearly visible from his arm.|$|E

60|$|As {{the senator}} again {{commanded}} his equipage to move on, he looked anxiously around him, as if once more {{expecting to see}} his strange adherent still lurking near the chariot. He only perceived, however, a man whom he did not know, followed by two other, <b>walking</b> rapidly <b>past</b> him. They were Numerian and the spies.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl had}} no thought of {{doing more than}} getting well out of the camp, and then turning about and <b>walking</b> boldly <b>past</b> the young sentinel, just to show that she had {{defeated}} him, but at Skipping Rabbit's suggestion she {{led the way to}} a neighbouring knoll just to have one look round before going home.|$|R
25|$|Richard Edmonds, at {{the time}} BNP National Organiser, was sentenced to three months in prison in 1994 {{for his part in}} a racist attack. Edmonds threw a glass at the victim as he was <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> an East London pub where a group of BNP {{supporters}} was drinking. Others then 'glassed' the man in the face and punched and kicked him as he lay on the ground, including BNP supporter Stephen O'Shea, who was jailed for 12 months. Another BNP supporter, Simon Biggs, was jailed for {{four and a half years}} for his part in the attack.|$|E
25|$|The board {{also wanted}} to {{introduce}} ten-minute headway and, unlike the other routes, remove the conductor. It was also decided to build the terminus at Ankers gate, based on studies {{of the number of}} people <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> each station. The city engineer consequently recommended building double track along the whole line. The city council approved building the line on 28 October 1926, but without double track all the way. However, the decision of where to place the terminal stop in the city was delayed. In the end, the board voted to build the line to the railway station, in part because the calculations of extra costs were not documented well enough.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October 1984, two of Gandhi's bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, {{shot her}} with their service {{weapons in the}} garden of the Prime Minister's {{residence}} at 1 Safdarjung Road, New Delhi. The shooting occurred as she was <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> a wicket gate guarded by Satwant and Beant. She was to have been interviewed by the British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television. Beant Singh shot her three times using his side-arm and Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh dropped their weapons and surrendered. Afterwards they were taken away by other guards into a closed room where Beant Singh was shot dead. Kehar Singh was later arrested for conspiracy in the attack. Both Satwant and Kehar were sentenced to death and hanged in Delhi's Tihar Jail.|$|E

25|$|With frame {{buildings}} and wood-burning fireplaces and stoves, fire {{was always a}} risk in the city. Chimney fires were frequent. On March 18, 1741, the governor's house in Fort George caught on fire, and soon the church connected to his house was ablaze too. People tried to save it, but the fire soon grew beyond control. The fire threatened to spread to another building, where all the city documents were kept. The governor ordered the windows smashed and documents thrown out to save them. Later the practice was {{to keep them in}} the City Hall. A week later another fire broke out, but was put out quickly. The same thing happened the next week at a warehouse. Three days later a fire broke out in a cow stable. On the next day a person <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> a wealthy neighborhood saw coals by the hay in a stable and put them out, saving the neighborhood.|$|E

500|$|The photo depicts Lennon in {{a doorway}} with three blurry figures <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> him in the foreground. Those figures are George Harrison, Stu Sutcliffe and Paul McCartney. The album's working title had been Oldies But Mouldies; no {{official}} title had been chosen until Lennon saw the neon sign prepared as cover art by John Uomoto, with Lennon's name and the words [...] "ROCK 'N' ROLL" [...] beneath. This struck Lennon in a positive way, and it became the album title.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{the hopes}} of Miss Calthea had been doubly darkened; the pariah with the {{brimstone}} blossoms had not only treacherously deserted Lanigan, but had made Mr. Tippengray treacherously desert her. She had been furiously angry; now she was low-spirited and cross. But one {{thing in the world}} could have then cheered her spirits, {{and that would have been}} the sight of her bitterest enemy and Lanigan Beam driving or <b>walking</b> together <b>past</b> her shop door; but when Lanigan alone entered that shop door she was not cheered at all.|$|R
5000|$|Eurogamer {{described}} the Microsoft Windows version {{as having a}} [...] "complete lack of AI" [...] as units are [...] "compelled to keep moving forwards, {{even if that means}} <b>walking</b> right <b>past</b> an enemy in a shuffling conga line" [...] and that the game is really [...] "about watching construction bars fill up and health bars go down, over and over again". Eurogamer summarized by saying Warhammer 40,000: Storm of Vengeance is a [...] "small and fussy" [...] game that [...] "takes its gameplay pretty much wholesale from Eutechnyx's own 2013 iOS game Ninja Cats vs Samurai Dogs".|$|R
5000|$|Sticky mats are {{typically}} used in cleanrooms and construction sites. [...] Their {{purpose is to}} prevent contaminants from entering the site with personnel, and hazardous materials from exiting.

He orders that the Buffalo Bills {{not win the}} Super Bowl. He further reveals his drugging of a Soviet goaltender to ensure {{the outcome of the}} [...] "Miracle on Ice" [...] hockey match. One of the Smoking Man's subordinates invites him for a family dinner. The Smoking Man politely declines the invitation and states that he is scheduled to visit family.

500|$|A sixteen-year-old {{student named}} Katrina Keller {{reportedly}} saw Morrison entering the school {{before the time}} specified by police. She stated {{that she had been}} <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> a vacant classroom and saw a man inside wearing a hooded sweatshirt, apparently angry. Keller did not report the incident to the school office. Other students reported that they witnessed Morrison sitting in a yellow Jeep in the school parking lot at around 10:45 a.m., almost an hour before he entered the school. Morrison was believed to have been living in the car, camping out near Bailey. Videos taken from security cameras outside show that Morrison was in his Jeep for at least 20 minutes, mingling with students as classes changed, 35 minutes before the siege began. Earlier, Morrison had spoken to a male high school student that day and [...] "asked about the identity of a list of female students." ...|$|E

"Right Round" [...] {{was written}} by Flo Rida, Dr. Luke, Kool Kojak, DJ Frank E, Philip Lawrence, Bruno Mars, Aaron Bay-Schuck, and Dead or Alive, the band whose 1984 song, [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" [...] is sampled in the chorus. The track was {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Kool Kojak and features guest vocals from American pop singer Kesha, (who was not credited on the American release of the single). At the end of 2008, Luke {{was working on a}} track with Flo Rida called [...] "Right Round" [...] and the two decided they needed a female hook. Luke pulled Kesha into the studio to record the vocals. According to Flo Rida, the song is about [...] "a young lady, she might be in the strip club and she's got my head spinning round, [...] Or any young lady that I might see <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> me that's getting my attention. She got it going on! I'm going crazy over her." ...|$|E

The final shot of them is Leo and Piper, old and still very much in love, <b>walking</b> upstairs <b>past</b> pictures of their whole family hanging on the walls, as they make their way to their bedroom to go lie down - they rest in each other's arms, smiling, content with their lives.|$|R
60|$|One evening later I was <b>walking</b> home <b>past</b> Hudson's {{dwelling}} when I {{noticed a}} curious {{cloud of dust}} hanging over the house, and strange sounds proceeding from it. They suggested that somebody was vigorously brushing it, which was certainly unusual. Now Hudson, though he held a quarter-section of Government land, had really no legal claim to it, because he had neither broken sufficient virgin sod nor put the necessary acreage under cultivation. He freely admitted that he was prejudiced against hard work, and, when {{in need of a}} few dollars to purchase actual necessities that he could not borrow, he would drive away with his wagon and peddle German oleographs and patent medicines to the less-educated settlers, returning after several weeks' absence to settle down again to a period of loafing.|$|R
500|$|The Royal Arms of England are the armorials (or coat of arms) first {{adopted in}} a fixed form {{at the start}} of the age of {{heraldry}} (circa 1200) as personal arms by the Plantagenet kings who ruled England from 1154. In the popular mind they have come to symbolise the nation of England, although according to heraldic usage nations do not bear arms, only persons and corporations do. The blazon of the Arms of Plantagenet is: Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or armed and langued azure, signifying three identical gold lions (also known as leopards) with blue tongues and claws, <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> but facing the observer, arranged in a column on a red background. Although the tincture azure of tongue and claws is not cited in many blazons, they are historically a distinguishing feature of the Arms of England. This coat, designed in the High Middle Ages, has been variously combined with those of the Kings of France, Scotland, a symbol of Ireland, the House of Nassau and [...] the Kingdom of Hanover, according to dynastic and other political changes occurring in England, but has not altered since it took a fixed form in the reign of Richard I (1189â€“1199), the second Plantagenet king.|$|E
500|$|The game {{begins on}} the desert world of Far Eden {{as one of the}} colonists Joule Adams (Erika Soto) and her corebot Mack (Jonathan Lipow) are <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> the {{wreckage}} of her cryo-sleep maintenance habitat, or [...] "crawler", from which she previously woke. They venture out to obtain a power core to get the crawler back online. Eventually finding it inside a corebot, Joule pries it out with her extractor tool. Joule and Mack then return to the crawler, switching its power back on. Joule sets out to reactivate a terraforming pylon that she learns has been offline for ninety-six years. After Joule manages to reboot the pylon, she receives a distress signal from a beacon that had until then been obstructed. Once she obtains a prismatic core in order to progress towards the signal, enemy corebots appear. On the order of Victor (Alex Fernandez), the leader of the corebots, they demand that she hand over the core. When she refuses, they become agitated. She defeats the enemies and proceeds to her destination. There, she encounters amputee Kai Brehn (Harry Shum) and his corebot Seth. Kai requests aid for his leg and Joule complies. She reveals the prismatic core, as it might assist him. Kai urges her to travel to the core foundry so that Joule may discover the answers to its potential. Seth accompanies her.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{is based on}} a {{boarding}} school revolt. The video starts off with flash images of the exterior of an old school building. It then cuts to two separate lines of male and female students, the latter being led by Lisa and Jessica, marching down a school corridor. They were led by a teacher with a whip in her hand while being watched on surveillance cameras. The scene then shifts to the male students <b>walking</b> <b>past</b> a sign that says [...] "no girls beyond this point". The first verse then begins and the students are marching into a classroom and sit at individual tables. When the chorus begins, Lisa and Jessica are standing on a stage in front of their band performing for rows of still students who stare back blankly. When the second verse begins the students are in the classroom while guards patrol its perimeter and the teacher hits a blackboard with a pointing stick. During the second chorus Lisa and Jessica get their band members together in a toilet to start their rebellion at the school. When the bridge starts smash cuts are shown of them taking over the school's PA system, and the students getting up from their chairs in the classrooms and throwing objects at a teacher {{standing in front of a}} blackboard. The video ends with everyone running down stairs out of the school, with Jessica and Lisa leading the way. The scenes are inter cut to scenes of Lisa and Jessica holding each other. They are dressed in tartan skirts with the former wearing a black cardigan and an open collared shirt, and the latter a black blazer and a shirt with a tartan patterned skinny tie. Both the cardigan and blazer have a striped crest with a pink [...] "V" [...] in the middle.|$|E

What did she mean?" [...] And taking the little gold hoop out of her pocket, she flung it with all her might into the Square Garden. The action saved her from a breakdown; and she went in calmly. Lunch was long over, but her father had not gone out, for he met her in the hall and drew her into the dining-room.|$|R
