5|$|When bees become {{intoxicated}} from ethanol consumption or poisoned {{with other}} chemicals, their balance is affected, {{and they are}} wobbly <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk.</b> Charles Abramson's group at Oklahoma State University has put inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a stimulus to encourage the bees to move, and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or black in color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color. The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk.</b> They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E

5|$|Back in Scranton, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{are both}} trying to sell girl scout cookies for their daughters. When Toby's {{requests}} clash with Darryl's, Darryl tells him they need their own sections of the office to sell {{to in order to}} not interfere with each other. Darryl takes accounting while Toby gets every other section. Darryl asks for accounting because Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) buys more cookies than everyone else put together. Toby eventually realizes Darryl's plan and the two end up fighting over who sells Kevin cookies, with Kevin coming up with absurd competition ideas. After doing a song and dance for Kevin, Kevin still can not make up his mind, so Darryl and Toby contemplate giving up until Kevin mentions he plans to buy hundreds of boxes of cookies, at which point continue the competition. They finally give up for good when Kevin wants to ride them like a pony, citing they still want to maintain their dignity and will not go beyond the limit to what they would do for their daughters. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> away, Kevin says he will doing any absurd thing for them to continue, kissing Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) to prove it, but they still refuse.|$|E

25|$|In December 2016, {{the first}} Amazon Go store was opened to Amazon {{employees}} in Seattle.

500|$|Elliott and {{his younger}} brother, Pete Elliott, were {{teammates}} at Bloomington High School in 1943 and again at Michigan in 1946 and 1947. [...] After his discharge from the military, Bump joined Pete at Michigan, where Pete played quarterback and Bump was the right halfback for the undefeated 1947 team. [...] Before the 1948 Rose Bowl, one article noted that the two brothers roomed together at Michigan and arranged their programs so that their classes were identical. [...] The article observed: [...] "They look alike, act alike and think alike and in Ann Arbor, Mich., <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> down the street any Michigan student can recognize Bump and Pete, the inseparable Elliott Brothers, Wolverines right half and quarterback respectively." [...] The brothers shared the same distinctive golden red hair, and the two were so close that they told a reporter in 1947 that a girl had to receive [...] "the Bumper stamp of approval" [...] before passing Pete's test.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about {{her love for}} the [...] "huge ego" [...] of her lover. Jay Lustig of New Jersey On-Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé's marriage to Jay-Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, Beyoncé clarified that [...] "Ego" [...] is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is [...] "fun" [...] and very [...] "Sasha Fierce". She further explained that [...] "Ego" [...] reveals the story about someone being [...] "very confident and having [...] swagger <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> and when they talk, and that {{being one of the}} reasons why [...] attracted to them." [...] The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing [...] "I talk like this, cos I can back it up" [...] and consists of a piano breakdown. As Beyoncé sings, she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice. She describes the ego of her love interest as: [...] "It’s too big, it’s too wide, it’s too strong, it won’t fit, it’s too much." [...] The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it. He sings the lines, [...] "Now I’m standing next to Jay, who's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me / That's good for my ego... My ego is my imaginary friend / He was with me when I was only imagining." ...|$|E

Sophie's death has made people think, and I have heard of teenagers, especially girls, modifying the way they dress <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> through certain areas". [...] This led to political developments: [...] "Rossendale MP Janet Anderson and Hyndburn MP Greg Pope are set to request a debate in the Commons to call for the widening of the law to include such an attack under {{the definition of a}} hate crime as soon as possible.

2500|$|After their mother's {{death in}} a {{suspicious}} fire that burns down their house 22 years prior, Sam and Dean Winchester's father goes missing during a [...] "hunting trip". As a result, Dean tracks down Sam at Stanford University. The two brothers live a life on the road, in Dean's black, 1967 Chevrolet Impala with Kansas license plates. However, their father is not a typical hunter: he hunts supernatural creatures like ghosts, vampires, and spirits, and has trained his sons to do the same. Along the way, Sam and Dean save innocent people, fight creatures and ghosts, and collect clues to their father's whereabouts. Sam begins to mysteriously develop psychic abilities and visions as they travel. They also find another man with abilities similar to Sam's, whose mother died the same way. They {{reach out to the}} young man, Max Miller, offering help and seeking answers. But Max has experienced years of physical abuse and neglect and his life ends in a murder suicide which Dean and Sam are unable to stop. They eventually find and reunite with their father, who reveals that the creature that killed their mother years earlier is the demon Azazel (aka [...] "Yellow Eyes") {{and the only thing that}} can kill him is a legendary gun created by Samuel Colt. It is revealed that Azazel, on a baby's six-month birthday, would bleed into their mouth and kill the moms <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> in. This is what gave Sam and Max their powers. The season ends with the brothers and their father involved in a car crash when a truck hits the side of the Impala. They lie inside the car, covered in blood and unconscious.|$|E

50|$|The way an {{individual}} moves can indicate health and even age and influence attractiveness. A study reflecting {{the views of}} 700 individuals and that involved animated representations of people walking, found that the physical attractiveness of women increased by about 50 percent <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> with a hip sway. Similarly, the perceived attractiveness of males doubled <b>when</b> <b>they</b> moved with a swagger in their shoulders.|$|R

60|$|At {{last one}} morning word was brought them, and Ormsgill looked {{about him in}} astonishment <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> into the wide space {{in the midst of}} the straggling village.

60|$|They {{traveled}} for {{the most}} part upon the ground, where it was open, following the path of the great elephants whose comings and goings break the only roads through those tangled mazes of bush, vine, creeper, and tree. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked</b> it was with a rolling, awkward motion, placing the knuckles of their closed hands upon the ground and swinging their ungainly bodies forward.|$|R
60|$|All this time, Lothair hung {{much about}} Lady Corisande; {{he was by}} her side in the riding-parties, always very near her <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walked,</b> and {{sometimes}} he managed unconsciously to detach her from the main party, and <b>they</b> almost <b>walked</b> alone. If he could not sit by her at dinner, he joined her immediately afterward, and whether it were a dance, a tableau, or a new game, somehow or other he seemed always to be her companion.|$|R
60|$|Speaking of negroes, {{recalls the}} looks of {{interest}} with which negro- sailors are regarded <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>walk</b> the Liverpool streets. In Liverpool indeed the negro steps with a prouder pace, and lifts {{his head like a}} man; for here, no such exaggerated feeling exists in respect to him, as in America. Three or four times, I encountered our black steward, dressed very handsomely, and walking arm in arm with a good-looking English woman. In New York, such a couple would have been mobbed in three minutes; and the steward would have been lucky to escape with whole limbs. Owing to the friendly reception extended to them, and the unwonted immunities they enjoy in Liverpool, the black cooks and stewards of American ships are very much attached to the place and like to make voyages to it.|$|E

How lovely goodness is in those who, stepping lightly, go smiling through the world!
