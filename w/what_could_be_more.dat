500|$|Bacon did {{not seek}} to {{illustrate}} the narrative of the tale, however. He told the French art critic Michel Leiris, [...] "I could not paint Agamemnon, Clytemnestra or Cassandra, as {{that would have been}} merely another kind of historical painting... Therefore I tried to create an image of the effect it produced inside me." [...] Aeschylus' phrase [...] "the reek of human blood smiles out at me" [...] in particular haunted Bacon, and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment. In 1985, he observed that Aeschylus' phrase brought up in him [...] "the most exciting images, and I often read it... the violence of it brings up the images in me, 'the reek of human blood smiles out at me', well <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> amazing than that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Just A Man" [...] was {{influenced}} by Chinese classical music, Patton's vocal track being based on the style of Anthony Newley. [...] "Star A.D." [...] makes an appearance on the 2008 compilation The Works. When asked if the song was a reference to Kurt Cobain, Mike Patton stated [...] "God no! It's about a phenomenon. And if that guy happened to be one, I don't know. It's {{one of those things}} that happen; it's a Vegas thing. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> shameful than having to change your colostomy bag on stage?! Vegas is great, though. I love it. Welcome to America". The song [...] "What a Day" [...] includes the line [...] "Kill the body and the head will die", which was taken from Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In a late 1994 interview, Bottum described the penultimate track [...] "The Last to Know" [...] as [...] "Pearl Jam on mushrooms".|$|E

500|$|A {{piece in}} The Times on 5 November 1995, {{coinciding with the}} Glasgow screenings, {{reported}} that the K Foundation had no solid reason for burning the money or view of what, if anything, the act represented, but concluded [...] "The K Foundation may not have changed or challenged much but they have certainly provoked thousands to question and analyse the power of money and the responsibilities of those who possess it. And <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> artistic than that?" [...] In the same issue, the newspaper's K Foundation art award witness, Robert Sandall, wrote that the Foundation's award, million-pound artwork and the burning were all [...] "entertaining, and satirically quite sharp", but [...] "the art world has chosen not to think .... The general view remains that the K Foundation's preoccupation with money, though undoubtedly sincere, simply isn't very original. Although they didn't blow their entire life's savings along the way, other artists, notably Yves Klein and Chris Burden, have been here before." ...|$|E
