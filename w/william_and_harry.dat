5|$|The C5's {{users were}} an eclectic group. They {{included}} holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family â€“ Princes <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry</b> each had one {{to drive around}} Kensington Palace before they {{were old enough to}} drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as The Times reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.|$|E

The film was originally scheduled {{to be released in}} the UK and North America on 7 November; however, Eon pushed forward the British date to 31 October during filming, while the American date was pushed back in August to 14 November, after Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince had been moved to 2009, thereby allowing the distributors to market the film over the autumn blockbuster Thanksgiving holiday weekend. In Australia, the film was moved a week to 19 November, after 20th Century Fox chose to release Australia on Quantum of Solaces original date of 26 November.|$|E

25|$|On 6 January 2009, the Queen granted Harry and William {{their own}} royal household. It has three main staff members, {{supported}} by a small team. Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to Washington, is a part-time adviser to the princes. Previously, William and Harry's affairs had been handled {{by the office of}} their father at Clarence House in central London. The new household released a statement announcing that they had established their own office at nearby St James's Palace to look after their public, military and charitable activities. In September 2009, <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry</b> set up The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to enable the princes to take forward their charitable ambitions.|$|E

During her marriage, Diana was Princess of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Rothesay, and Countess of Chester. The marriage produced two sons, the princes <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry,</b> who were then respectively second and third {{in the line of}} succession to the British throne. As Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions overseas. She was celebrated for her charity work and for her support of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. Diana was involved with dozens of charities including London's Great Ormond Street Hospital for children, of which she was president from 1989. She also raised awareness and advocated ways to help people affected with HIV/AIDS, cancer, and mental illness.|$|E

From 8.15am, the main congregation, governors-general, prime ministers of Commonwealth realms, and diplomats all arrived at the abbey. Princes <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry</b> then left Clarence House at 10.10am in a Bentley State Limousine and arrived at 10.18am, {{followed}} by representatives of foreign royal families, the Middleton family, and, lastly, the Royal Family (the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall; the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence; the Duke of York, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Eugenie; and the Earl and Countess of Wessex). The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to leave Buckingham Palace, as is tradition, arriving at the abbey for 10.48am. The bridal party left the Goring Hotel in the former number one state Rolls-Royce Phantom VI at 10.52am, in time for the service to begin at 11.00am.|$|E
500|$|The {{estate and}} house {{are open to}} the public during the summer months (1 July to 30 August), {{although}} the exhibition centre in the stable block was closed in August 2013.

The items on display have been packed up, with the intention to give them to her sons <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry.</b> All profits made were donated to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund, which closed in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In August 1997, a {{year after}} the divorce, Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris. The Queen was on holiday with her {{extended}} family at Balmoral. Diana's two sons by Charles â€“ Princes <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry</b> â€“ wanted to attend church and so the Queen and Prince Philip took them that morning. After that single public appearance, for five days the Queen and the Duke shielded their grandsons from the intense press interest by keeping them at Balmoral where they could grieve in private, but the royal family's seclusion and the failure to fly a flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace caused public dismay. Pressured by the hostile reaction, the Queen agreed to return to London and do a live television broadcast on 5 September, the day before Diana's funeral. In the broadcast, she expressed admiration for Diana and her feelings [...] "as a grandmother" [...] for the two princes. As a result, much of the public hostility evaporated.|$|E

She pointedly did not invite Camilla Parker-Bowles, to her wedding, apparently as Camilla had been an adversary and had once referred to Tiggy as [...] "the hired help".

2500|$|In 2017, Diana's sons {{commissioned}} {{a statue of}} their mother for Kensington Palace to commemorate the 20th anniversary of her death.

We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy." [...] The money will be raised through public donations, and a small committee consisting of close friends and advisers, including Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, {{are said to be}} working on the project.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, {{shortly after}} Charles, Prince of Wales, {{and his wife}} had separated, Charles hired Legge-Bourke as nanny to their two sons.

Early {{controversy}} came when she said scornfully of the Princess of Wales's attitude towards her sons: [...] "I give them what they need at this stage, fresh air, a rifle and a horse. She gives them a tennis racket and a bucket of popcorn at the movies". It was also considered to be a gaffe when Tiggy referred to <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry</b> as [...] "my babies".|$|E

2500|$|For the male-line grandchildren of Elizabeth II, however, {{there is}} {{currently}} some uncertainty over the correct form of family surname to use, or even {{whether there is a}} surname. The Queen has stipulated that all her male-line descendants [...] "who do not bear the titular dignity of prince" [...] shall use Mountbatten-Windsor as their family surname (although Letters Patent exist stipulating the name Windsor, but with the same caveat). According to their flight suits as seen in television interviews, Princes <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry</b> both used Wales as their surname for military purposes; this continues to be the case for William since his creation as Duke of Cambridge.|$|E
2500|$|Diana was {{a long-standing}} and active {{supporter}} of Centrepoint, a charity which provides accommodation {{and support to}} homeless people, and became patron in 1992. She supported organisations that battle poverty and homelessness. The Princess was a supporter of young homeless people and spoke out on behalf of them by saying that [...] "they deserve a decent start in life". [...] "We, {{as a part of}} society, must ensure that young people â€“ who are our future â€“ are given the chance they deserve," [...] she said. Diana used to take young <b>William</b> <b>and</b> <b>Harry</b> for private visits to Centrepoint services. [...] "The young people at Centrepoint were always really touched by her visits and by her genuine feelings for them," [...] said one of the charity's staff members. Prince William is currently the patron of this charity.|$|E

Uncertain as to whether they should walk behind her coffin during the funeral procession, Diana's sons hesitated. Philip told William, [...] "If you don't walk, I think you'll regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?" [...] On the day of the funeral, Philip, William, Harry, Charles and Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, walked through London behind her bier.|$|E
