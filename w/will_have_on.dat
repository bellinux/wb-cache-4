5|$|John Boscawen of the Act Party {{commented that}} the NZ ETS was a grand experiment, without {{precedent}} in any other nation in the world. Boscawen was critical of {{the effect that the}} ETS <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> households and farmers, stating that the average power bill will rise 10%, fuel bills will rise by 7 cents per litre and dairy farms will face an increase in costs before agriculture enters the scheme of NZ$7,500 per year as a result of associated increases in fuel, electricity and the cost of processing milk products. Boscawen called for the NZ ETS to be scrapped or delayed indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|The state {{historic}} site at the Apple River Fort Site {{was set to}} close October 1, 2008 because of cuts in the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency's budget by Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. Supporters of the {{historic site}} in Elizabeth, led by the Apple River Fort Foundation, appealed in protest to legislators and the governor against the closing, lamenting the economic impact the fort's closing <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the community. After delay, the proposal to close seven state parks and a dozen state historic sites, including Apple River Fort, went ahead on November 30, 2008. After the impeachment of Illinois Governor Blagojevich, new governor Pat Quinn reopened the closed state parks in February. In March 2009 Quinn announced he is committed to reopening the state historic sites by June 30, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Urban renewal {{programs}} are funded {{in part by}} federal grants. The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which created the NRHP, requires that federal agencies give consideration to the opinions of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in assessing the impact their actions <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> listed properties and consider alternatives to any action that would destroy or significantly affect them. The listings of downtown Troy's districts and buildings therefore had the practical effect of preventing their demolition for urban renewal.|$|E
5|$|When Andy tells Nate she {{is going}} to Paris, he is angered by her refusal to admit that she's become what she once ridiculed, and they break up. Once there, Miranda, without makeup, opens up to Andy about the effect Miranda's {{impending}} divorce <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> her daughters. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that he has accepted a job as Creative Director with rising fashion star James Holt at Miranda's recommendation. Andy finally succumbs to Christian's charms and, after spending the night with him, learns from him about a plan to replace Miranda with Jacqueline Follet as editor of Runway. Despite the suffering she has endured at her boss's behest, she attempts to warn Miranda.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like It Hot. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like It Hot was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{can take}} decades of {{studying}} climate change and tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E

40|$|It was {{realized}} {{about ten}} years ago that the scope for increasing fish catch from the coastal waters is limited. Climate change is projected to exacerbate this situation and act as a depensatory factor on fish populations. Warming of water <b>has</b> potential impact <b>on</b> fish diversity, distribution, abundance and phenology, which <b>will</b> <b>have,</b> in turn, effects on the ecosystem structure and function. Global warming and the consequent changes in climatic patterns <b>will</b> <b>have</b> strong impact <b>on</b> fisheries with far-reaching consequences for food and livelihood security of a sizeable section of the population. Acidification of water <b>will</b> <b>have</b> effects <b>on</b> calciferous animals. Increased incidence of extreme events such as storms, floods and drought will affect the safety and efficiency of fishing operations, flow of rivers, area covered by wetlands and water availability and <b>will</b> <b>have</b> severe impacts <b>on</b> fisheries. Sea level rise <b>will</b> <b>have</b> effects <b>on</b> the coastal profile and livelihoods of communities. The potential outcome for fisheries may be decrease in production and value of fisheries, and decline in the economic returns from fishing operations...|$|R

25|$|Institutional {{factors have}} a {{significant}} impact on voter turnout. Rules and laws are also generally easier to change than attitudes, so much of the work done on how to improve voter turnout looks at these factors. Making voting compulsory has a direct and dramatic effect on turnout. Simply making it easier for candidates to stand through easier nomination rules is believed to increase voting. Conversely, adding barriers, such as a separate registration process, can suppress turnout. The salience of an election, the effect that a vote <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> policy, and its proportionality, how closely the result reflects the will of the people, are two structural factors that also likely have important effects on turnout.|$|E

25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the aircraft flight manual of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect this <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
25|$|On November 25, 2008, a {{new federal}} rule was passed that allows states to charge {{premiums}} and higher co-payments to Medicaid participants. This rule will enable states to take in greater revenues, limiting financial losses associated with the program. Estimates figure that states will save $1.1 billion while {{the federal government will}} save nearly $1.4 billion. However, this means that the burden of financial responsibility will be placed on 13 million Medicaid recipients who will face a $1.3 billion increase in co-payments over 5 years. The major concern is that this rule will create a disincentive for low-income people to seek healthcare. It is possible that this will force only the sickest participants to pay the increased premiums and it is unclear what long-term effect this <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the program.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} with manual typesetting, {{the problem of}} justification is easy to solve with a digital system such as TeX, which, provided that good points for line breaking have been defined, can automatically spread the spaces between words {{to fill in the}} line. The problem is thus to find the set of breakpoints that will give the most visually pleasing result. Many line breaking algorithms use a first-fit approach, where the breakpoints for each line are determined one after the other, and no breakpoint is changed after it has been chosen. Such a system is not able to define a breakpoint depending on the effect that it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the following lines. In comparison, the total-fit line breaking algorithm used by TeX and developed by Donald Knuth and Michael Plass considers all the possible breakpoints in a paragraph, and finds the combination of line breaks that will produce the most globally pleasing arrangement.|$|E
