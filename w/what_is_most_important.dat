5|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> for us, {{out of the}} heathen fancy of a {{kidnapping}} man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E

[...] In this statement, Bilheimer requested that people screening previous versions of the film tell their audiences that the presence of Somaly in the film is understandably a distraction, that the film is not primarily about Somaly but rather about the millions of children in slavery in the world, and that this focus is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> about the film.|$|E

Reception to the Maria-sama ga Miteru anime series has been generally positive, although Anime News Network (ANN) noted that the series leaves itself [...] "wide open to cynical sniggering."

[...] Andrew Shelton from AMR found the series to be [...] "fairly unique" [...] compared to other shōjo works, explaining that although the story is [...] "a little basic" [...] and [...] "overly dramatic", <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> is the [...] "response and actions of the character on who the story is focused." [...] Stig Høgset, also from Them Anime, commented that the third season was criticized for being too short, but he personally did not feel [...] "like it was lacking something." [...] Jason Thompson credits Maria-sama ga Miteru with starting [...] "the modern yuri trend." [...] Newer anime titles that Maria-sama ga Miteru is compared to include Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru, Strawberry Panic!, Best Student Council, and Aria. Carlos Ross, writing about the first novel in the series, felt the story was a [...] "classic rags-to-riches tale," [...] but that it was [...] "also sweet, touching and witty when it needs to be." [...] He criticized the lack of teachers and schoolwork in the series, which led to the plot being filled with extracurricular activities, which are common to high school series. He also criticized Yumi's low self-esteem.|$|E

2500|$|The trial {{ended on}} June 28, 1865. Surratt was so ill {{the last four}} days of the trial that she was {{permitted}} to stay in her cell. Both legal teams appeared to have flaws in their cases, and except for Reverdy Johnson, neither team employed highly-skilled attorneys.

Richards whose investigation had had the most success {{in the early days}} of the investigation. The government did not fully investigate Booth's meetings with Surratt at noon or the evening of the murder, and its questioning and cross-examination of witnesses was poorly prepared and weak. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> is that the government had botched the attempt to apprehend John, Jr. The defense's case, too, had a problem.

2500|$|Modern {{historians have}} very {{different}} ideas regarding the authorship of A General History and what this attribution means for historiography. [...] As many historians point out, A General History of the Pyrates {{set the tone for}} every work on pirates that has been written since. [...] Since the attribution, there have been three schools of thought concerning the subject: those who agree with Moore's conclusions, those who do not, and even some who do not think that it matters. [...] Prior to Furbank and Owens' work on Defoe's canon, some scholars accepted that Defoe authored A General History, while others postulated that authorship does not matter. [...] Interestingly, however, some people, still believed that Defoe was the author. Some scholars compared the work to other records and sources from the time and concluded that A General History is highly significant for its amount of accuracy, regardless of attribution.

Dunitz describes how Pauling's first article on the theme in fact shows a left-handed helix, the enantiomer of the true structure.
