The Guardian's John Fordham observed [...] "Contemporary jazz/classical violin might be a bit spiky for some, but the musicianship and the conversational skills are remarkable". PopMatters reviewer Will Layman said [...] "there’s a ton for modern jazz fans to enjoy here, and it is plain that Mark Feldman—having paid his dues a dozen times over—is deserving of the spotlight. ECM has given him a superior opportunity here, with a sparkling but bold trio at his back. The road ahead looks to paved with more good music". JazzTimes reviewer, Mike Shanley commented [...] "What Exit is sequenced to alternate ruminative pieces with more upbeat ones, with variations in structure marking each piece... Throughout, Feldman plays <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>tone</b> that never gets thin or shrill, even as he flies into the upper register of his instrument".All About Jazz reviewer John Kelman said [...] "What Exit is a stunning debut from a group that hopefully won't be just a one-time affair". Billboard's Philip Booth said [...] " [...] it's an engaging, sometimes challenging mix of avant-jazz and new-classical styles".|$|E
5000|$|During the mid-17th century, {{a number}} of sources {{describe}} [...] as being weakened but still present. The English playwright Ben Jonson's English Grammar, published posthumously in 1640, records that [...] was [...] "sounded firme in the beginning of words, and more liquid in the middle, and ends." [...] Little more is said regarding [...] until 1740, when one Mather Flint, writing in a primer for French learners of English, said: [...] "...dans plusieurs mots, l’r devant une consonne est fort adouci, presque muet & rend un peu longue la voyale qui le precede." [...] ("...in many words r before a consonant is greatly softened, almost mute, and slightly lengthens the preceding vowel.") By the 1770s, postvocalic -less pronunciation was becoming common around London even in more formal, educated speech. The English actor and linguist John Walker uses the spelling ar to indicate the long vowel of aunt in his 1775 rhyming dictionary. [...] In his influential Critical Pronouncing Dictionary and Expositor of the English Language (1791), Walker reported, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>tone</b> of disapproval, that [...] "...the r in lard, bard, ... is pronounced so much in the throat as to be little more than the middle or Italian a, lengthened into baa, baad...." [...] Americans returning to England {{after the end of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1783 reported surprise at the significant changes in fashionable pronunciation. By the early 19th century, the southern British standard was fully transformed into a non-rhotic variety, though it continued to be variable as late as the 1870s.|$|E
5000|$|Anthropometamorphosis was Bulwers {{final and}} most popular work, reprinted {{at least three}} times in his lifetime. First in 1650, the second edition of 1653 was much {{enlarged}} and illustrated with woodcuts. A third edition [...] "printed for the use and benefit of Thomas Gibbs, gent" [...] was a reissue of the second edition retitled [...] "A view of the People of the whole World". The title literally means ‘humanity-changing’. It could be seen as another work influenced by Francis Bacon, an Anomatia Comparata, a comparison of all the peoples of the world, and in its attack on the cosmetic it does echo Bacon. It {{is one of the first}} studies in comparative cultural anthropology albeit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>tone</b> of social commentary, [...] "Almost every Nation having a particular whimzey as touching corporall fashions of their own invention" [...] (page 5), Bulwer describes how people modify their bodies and clothes but later commentators have interpreted this ostensible apolitical work as a coded piece of political theory. A political commentary against the artificial (in Bulwers eyes) regicidal State, and a call to the return to the [...] "natural" [...] form of governance with the King as the symbolic head of the body of England. Bulwer’s politics are indivisible from his other thinking, for him Nature was a Monarch, [...] "sovereignty delegated from God". [...] "The beauty of the Universe consists in things perfect and permanent" [...] (p25) ruled over by the monarch, Nature. Although Bulwer does not make any direct reference to the political events in England his approach to the monstrous body echoes the themes of the polemical literature of the time, especially in its focus on the head. The main body of the text consists of 23 sections, of which 15 are concerned with deformations or modifications to the head or face. The book ends with Bulwer stating that he is going to stop writing and return to working as a physician. He writes: Until now obeying the sacred impulse of the genius operating upon our intellectual complexion, while my mind was carrying me into new things, I executed works not of supererogation, but supplemental to the advancement of sciences. In which I seem to have merited something from the republec of letters (i.e. Literary public): [...] "Of the making of many books there is no end, and the reading of them is a weariness to the flesh" [...] (Eccles xii.12): From now on I shall apply myself entirly to providing for my own health and the health of others. Other things will be done by other lovers of human nature. THE END.|$|E

2500|$|As part of {{an effort}} to discern Tonegaru's poetic themes, critic Daniel Vighi {{suggests}} that, at the core, there is a struggle between the banality of existence, depicted in Surrealist touches, and a poetic elation in the classical sense. Vighi detects in this the influence of Romania's avant-garde herald Urmuz. Cristea-Enache also writes: [...] " [...] poetry, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> imaginative <b>tone,</b> <b>with</b> its decompression and the spread of creative fantasy, acts [...] as a compensation factor. The author erases the borders and contours of reality, becomes a character of his own discourse and tirelessly balances between various areas, eras and identities." [...] In this context, Cristea-Enache argues, Tonegaru invents himself as [...] "at once virile and sentimental". Casting himself in historic roles or as a preexisting fictional character, the poet wrote about imagining himself as a troubadour, a French Revolution figure, a Don Quixote, or a Cossack warrior.

Oh, Mr Bankrobber! closely follows the style of Will Hay's comedy films, with Smith filling in as the [...] "Albert" [...] character (played by Graham Moffatt in the originals). Though the title hints at Rebel Without a Cause, the Rebel Without a Tie excerpt parodies pre-war British films, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> moralising <b>tone,</b> and possibly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> touch of The Blue Lamp. Lullaby of London is produced {{in the style of}} a Busby Berkeley musical, and also pokes fun at Hollywood's misinformed ideas about Britain (one lyric is [...] "The Tower of London, where the President of England chopped off the heads of his wives"). Venereal Disease: The Facts is similarly general, spoofing public information films. The [...] "Noël Coward" [...] version of Hamlet, by contrast, was highly specific, parodying Coward's persona as well as the mise-en-scène for Laurence Olivier's 1948 film version of the play. (This spoof had previously appeared in producer Perkins' radio comedy series Radio Active.) The Sudso commercial is a parody of the film Brief Encounter, with Smith in the role played by Trevor Howard.|$|R
