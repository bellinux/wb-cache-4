25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> {{trying to persuade}} {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash and then I noticed that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E

He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, [...] "it's only me." [...] They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.|$|E

Ellen McLain provided {{the voice of the}} antagonist GLaDOS. Erik Wolpaw noted, [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> fishing around for the turret voice, Ellen did a sultry version. It didn't work for the turrets, but we liked it a lot, and so a slightly modified version of that became the model for GLaDOS's final incarnation." [...] Mike Patton performed the growling and snarling voice of GLaDOS's final personality core, named the Anger Sphere.|$|E

Some of the nonsense and hijinks of the first season are gone and we have managed to keep a touch of reality of the second version. As to why the series was not cancelled, Asher remarked, [...] "I can answer that in two words: Paul Lynde." ...|$|E
500|$|The casting for [...] "Signs & Wonders" [...] was [...] "rather unorthodox". In {{order to}} prevent ophidiophobia from hitting the actors {{on the day of}} filming, live rattlesnakes were brought in during the casting sessions. Strangely enough, many of the actors were [...] "thrilled" [...] about holding the snakes, {{according}} to Kim Manners. He later noted that [...] "the funny thing was that the actors couldn't wait to hold the rattlesnakes [...] but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> nervous." [...] In addition, Michael Childers, who portrayed Reverend O'Connor, was actually the son of a real life snake preacher. Manners later noted that [...] "he had gone to church as a child and handled snakes." ...|$|E

500|$|In Clark's book, Winning Modern Wars, {{published}} in 2003, {{he describes his}} conversation with a military officer in the Pentagon shortly after 9/11 regarding a plan to attack seven Middle Eastern countries in five years: [...] "As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed {{as part of a}} five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran." [...] Wesley regards the 2003 invasion of Iraq as [...] "a huge mistake".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the music}} on Ecstasy has been criticised as being [...] "directionless and floundered about within the {{framework}} of songs which appeared to be only half formed ideas," [...] which was due to the band's in-studio experimentation with different aspects of their guitar sound. In hindsight, Shields said that [...] "even when we'd finished it we didn't like half the songs we'd done. The record never came out right and it made us realise that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> too twee". In response to the band's [...] "unwanted reputation for jangly feyness", My Bloody Valentine later incorporated elements of American indie rock music and Shields customised his guitars' tremolo systems, resulting in the band pioneering an alternative rock subgenre known as shoegazing. The term [...] "shoegazing", which was considered derogatory, was coined by Sounds journalists in the early 1990s to describe certain bands' [...] "motionless performing style, where they stood on stage and stared at the floor".|$|E
500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. And there was always the consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main reason is because they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after those. I was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E

500|$|The band, then named Mookie Blaylock, entered London Bridge Studios in Seattle, Washington in March 1991 with {{producer}} Rick Parashar {{to record}} its debut album. After working with Parashar on Temple Of The Dog, Stone and Jeff {{asked him to}} co-produce and engineer Ten. Parashar also contributed piano, Fender Rhodes, percussion, co-wrote vocal harmonies and co wrote the intro/outro of the album. A few tracks were previously recorded at London Bridge in January, but only [...] "Alive" [...] was carried over from that session. The album sessions were quick and lasted only a month, mainly due to the band having already written most of the material for the record. [...] "Porch", [...] "Deep", [...] "Why Go", and [...] "Garden" [...] were first recorded during the album sessions, everything else had been previously recorded during demo sessions at some point. McCready said that [...] "Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were {{along for the ride}} at that time."

[...] "At the time, when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> flying the Macchi C.200, it was a good, if not very good, machine.

2500|$|By 1994 Cheney and Owen {{were writing}} their own {{material}} {{and decided to}} change the band's name to The Living End – {{a reference to the}} film, Rock Around the Clock (1956). According to Cheney [...] "It's an old '50s term, meaning 'far out', 'the greatest' ... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> into the whole '50s thing, but we wanted a neutral name, one that didn't suggest any one style of music". With Cheney on lead guitar and lead vocals, and Owen on double bass and backing vocals, the group settled on Joe Piripitzi as their drummer. Cheney considered Piripitzi to be ideal due to his charismatic appearance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{band members}} had a mixed {{experience}} in Hamburg. Harrison later said that [...] "a lot of ghosts materialised {{out of the}} woodwork – people you didn't necessarily want to see again, who had been your best friend one drunken Preludin night back in 1960." [...] McCartney commented: [...] "It was as if we'd mutated into something different and yet <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> just the boys. But we knew and they knew that we'd got famous in the meantime …" [...] The Beatles had also tired of the generally inane questions put to them at press conferences throughout the German tour, with only McCartney attempting to humour the local reporters. At the between-shows press conference in Hamburg, Lennon's impatience was palpable, leading a female reporter to ask why the band had become [...] "so horrid and snobby". On 27 June, the Beatles and their entourage flew from Hamburg to London's Heathrow Airport, where they boarded a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight over the North Pole to Tokyo.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1975, {{the band}} {{announced}} they were splitting with Jonathan King {{and that they}} had signed with Mercury Records for US$1million. The catalyst for the deal was one song – [...] "I'm Not in Love". Stewart recalled:At that point in time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> on Jonathan King's label, but struggling. We were absolutely skint, the lot of us, we were really struggling seriously, and Philips Phonogram wanted to do a deal with us. They wanted to buy Jonathan's contract. Our manager Ric Dixon invited them to listen to what we've done. Head of A & R Nigel Grainge came up to our Strawberry Studio, heard the album and freaked. He said [...] "This is a masterpiece, it's a done deal!". We did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money. It was Grainge's idea to release 'Life Is A Minestrone' as the first single holding back the big one to give us more longevity for the album.|$|E
2500|$|After Chris Brown {{winning a}} Grammy for his [...] "F.A.M.E" [...] album, in the {{category}} [...] "Best R Album of the Year", Eric Bellinger, who co-wrote [...] "Say it With Me" [...] for the album, admitted he was like, [...] "Wow, I'm actually doing something here. I was doing something right {{because so many people}} get nominated and that's it; but {{to be a part of}} a project that actually won was the moment I realized I was in the right business." [...] Bellinger also told Billboard Magazine that he stayed with Brown in the studio everyday for about two months. Then, RoccStar and PK played the beat and he immediately thought about Michael Jackson. So they said, [...] "Go in the booth and do some Michael-type stuff." [...] In another interview, Bellinger said, [...] "He [...] really, really went back to the days of Sam Cooke, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> able to keep it 2013 at the same time." [...] Bellinger also cited Justin Timberlake as another influence for the song and Brown's upcoming album [...] "X".|$|E

He was cute-looking and tall, over six feet.... I was in my last year at Hunter College; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> dating when Sid went into the service, the Coast Guard. Luckily he was stationed in New York so we were able to continue seeing each other, even though my parents weren't too happy about it. They never thought he would amount to anything, that he'd never have a real career or make any money. But we were married one year after we met, in July of 1943." [...] She also pointed out, [...] "You know, he's not funny all the time. He can be very serious." [...] At the time of the interview, the couple had been married for 66 years.
