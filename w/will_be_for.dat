The townsfolk demand the Doctor turn Jex over, but he reminds them that Isaac's death <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> naught if they do so, and {{has come up with}} a plan from {{learning}} about Jex' society. When the Gunslinger arrives the next day, residents wearing facial markings similar to Jex race through town, confusing the cyborg and allowing Jex to flee to his ship. However, instead of taking off, Jex tells the Doctor he is ready to face justice in the afterlife, and causes the ship to self-destruct.|$|E

Block K will have 27 spaces to be shared between the hotel and the office building; nine of these <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> disabled drivers.
