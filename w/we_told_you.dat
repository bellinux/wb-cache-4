She {{threatened}} to wear black tape {{over her mouth}} on the song's music video due to her disagreement with its message and the choice {{for it to be}} CrazySexyCool lead single, partially because of the group's history of advocating for safe sex since their debut. [...] "I was totally, 100% against 'Creep'. I wasn't down with cheating on your man, you know, for me, it's be faithful. Trust me, I fought against that single coming out. You know, I was like 'If a girl is gonna [...] catch her man cheating,' this was my thing, 'instead of telling her to cheat back, why don't we tell her [...] just leave,'" [...] she shared. In the end, Lopes eventually capitulated, stating: [...] "If some people can creep, and in their minds, they can feel better by going out doing the same thing... Fine. I'm just not one of those people." [...] She instead added her new rap verse on remixed versions of the song, which talks about the consequences of cheating. Thomas later thought the song and the video's choreography routine were [...] "cool" [...] enough to distract people from its lyrical content and [...] "just sing along." [...] "Even the song 'Creep'—not that we creep, but if we did, [...] for a woman that would do such a thing. I say just leave his ass, but if you're not ready to just jet at the moment, then you know, I guess <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> how to [...] We were really happy and we still are really happy to be the voice for so many women in so many different situations in their lives," [...] she told Myspace in 2014. Jon Parales of The New York Times stood by the song's concept, he wrote: [...] "The women sing about infidelity, revenge, status and power plays, not as victims but as contenders; when they're cheated on, they cheat, too." [...] Carol Cooper from The Guardian also described the track as the darker side of their [...] "giddy hedonism." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 20, 2006, Ellison sued {{comic book}} and {{magazine}} publisher Fantagraphics, stating they had defamed {{him in their}} book Comics As Art (<b>We</b> <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> So). The book recounts the history of Fantagraphics and discussed a lawsuit that resulted from a 1980 Ellison interview with Fantagraphics' industry news magazine, The Comics Journal. In this interview Ellison referred to comic book writer Michael Fleisher, calling him [...] "bugfuck" [...] and [...] "derange-o". Fleisher lost his libel suit against Ellison and Fantagraphics on December 9, 1986.|$|E

6000|$|... “Well,” the man said, “it {{was your}} own fault; <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> to stop. Anyhow, {{you had better}} keep still a bit. If you’re here when we come back, we’ll {{see what we can}} do.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{leave the}} {{question}} of ladies and come to matters {{that have to do}} with men. You are here as <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that you would be at a time when you did not believe us, and we here to meet you, as <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that we would be. How we knew that you were coming and how we came do not matter at all. Believe what you will. Are you ready to start with us, O Lord Macumazana, that you may bring to its death the wicked elephant Jana which ravages our land, and receive the great reward of ivory? If so, your camel waits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} very much to know," [...] said the former, [...] "what you intend to do in regard to us. It cannot be that you think of placing that young gentleman and myself {{in the hands of}} the law. Of course, this man," [...] {{pointing}} to the stout burglar, [...] "cannot expect anything but a just punishment of his crimes; but after what <b>we</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> you must certainly be convinced that our connection with the affair is entirely blameless, and should be considered as a piece of very bad luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Spriggs {{cleared his}} throat again.

6000|$|... "Uncle Silas, I am {{sure there}} are some things about our trip that <b>we</b> never <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> How <b>we</b> saw Napoleon and his {{beautiful}} Empress driving in the Bois, and how Eugenie smiled and bowed at the people. I never saw such enthusiasm in my life. And oh, I learned such a lot of French history. All about Francis the First, and Pa took me to see his chateaus along the Loire. Very few tourists go there. You really ought to have gone with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are welcome, white stranger. We rejoice {{to see you}} in our courts.

It is something ethereal, something heavenly, something that we'll only see in Paradise and then only to a certain degree.” [...] Visionary Mirjana, in her autobiography, says that when they asked Gospa, [...] "How {{is it possible that}} you are so beautiful?"

You are exclusive proprietor of this flourishing settlement, and are consequently fabulously rich, and you would be richer still if you didn't grant lands and houses free of rent to all newcomers who will pledge themselves never to smoke cigars.

6000|$|Hetta, {{as soon as}} she had {{dismissed}} her lover, went up at once to her own room.

Hetta was in tears,--or very nigh to tears,-- struggling to repress them, and struggling almost successfully.

6000|$|... "Why, that's {{the moving}} picture play <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about-- {{the one that}} we got into at the Oak Run {{railroad}} station," [...] explained the youth.

5000|$|The {{potential}} ban {{was later}} {{proven to be}} {{as a result of}} a mistake on the part of the United Kingdom's civil service, who forgot to include specifically flavoured crisps when compiling a list of the nation's food items that were to be exempt from the directive.

The story was parodied in [...] "The Thin Blue Line" [...] sitcom where a French EU Commissioner stated [...] "You British insist on eating prawn cocktail crisps, despite the fact <b>we</b> have <b>told</b> <b>you</b> not to". It was also cited during the United Kingdom's referendum on the British membership in the European Union campaign in 2016.|$|R
