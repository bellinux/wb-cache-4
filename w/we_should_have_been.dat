P. Snow and H. G. Wells. When this came to light after the war, Coward wrote: [...] "If anyone had told me at that time I was high up on the Nazi blacklist, I should have laughed... I remember Rebecca West, {{who was one of the}} many who shared the honour with me, sent me a telegram which read: 'My dear – the people <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> seen dead with'." ...|$|E

[...] He later felt the album was not progressive as he had wished: [...] "I'm thinking, 'Why don't we do this? Why don't we create these landscapes?' I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> pushing ourselves, and trying to push the genre forward." [...] Likewise, Barker felt DeLonge wanted their music to be derivative of groups such as U2 or Coldplay, commenting, [...] "For us, we were always like 'Blink is Blink, man. We want to sound like fucking Blink-182.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The alumni {{reported}} that the C response was evasive, deceptive, and employed “stonewalling” tactics.

[...] One alumnus said that [...] "the only way that we could get the Alliance to do anything was through the media. It was only through shaming them by putting the truth out there". Robert Fetherlin, vice president for International Ministries for the C, said [...] "We heard {{as far back as the}} 1980s that there were some questionable events that took place at Mamou.

2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask our young men and women to go over and to fight, {{and if you have a}} deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can you expect them to defend this country? How can you expect them to go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and that this is not a responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Baudelaire {{was educated}} in Lyon, where he boarded. At {{fourteen}} he {{was described by}} a classmate as [...] "much more refined and distinguished than any of our fellow pupils [...] we are bound to one another [...] by shared tastes and sympathies, the precocious love of fine works of literature." [...] Baudelaire was erratic in his studies, at times diligent, at other times prone to [...] "idleness". Later, he attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, studying law, a popular course for those not yet decided on any particular career. He began to frequent prostitutes and may have contracted gonorrhea and syphilis during this period. He also began to run up debts, mostly for clothes. Upon gaining his degree in 1839, he told his brother [...] "I don't feel I have a vocation for anything." [...] His stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead Baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career. His mother later recalled: [...] "Oh, what grief! If Charles had let himself be guided by his stepfather, his career {{would have been very}} different.... He would not have left a name in literature, it is true, but <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> happier, all three of us." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 14 February 1810, {{thousands}} of people crowded onto Gibraltar's walls and bastions to watch the demolitions taking place. As a report in The London Chronicle noted, [...] "every part of the garrison facing the Spanish Lines was crowded with Spectators, to witness the explosion which was truly grand and picturesque... the entire front of [...] being blown into the ditch, and the whole rendered a complete mass of ruins." [...] The line of fortifications between the two forts was also demolished, along with various other Spanish fortifications around the bay. The debris was hauled away by volunteers from Gibraltar, British soldiers and allied Portuguese sailors from ships in the bay. The demolition achieved its desired objectives; the lines {{could no longer be}} used to besiege Gibraltar and they could not be rebuilt by the French without enduring British cannon fire and Spanish guerilla attacks in their rear lines. The French made no attempt to attack Gibraltar and focused their efforts on Cádiz and Tarifa instead. The exiled Napoleon later told Admiral George Cockburn that he had never intended to lay siege to Gibraltar: [...] "Things suited us as they were. Gibraltar is of no value to Britain. It defends nothing. It intercepts nothing. It is simply an object of national pride which costs the English a great deal and wounds deeply the Spanish nation. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> crassly stupid to have destroyed such a combination." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} day he {{recorded}} his decision to set a course to return home {{by way of the}} yet unknown east coast of New Holland (as Australia was then called): being now resolv'd to quit this Country altogether, and to bend my thought towards returning home by such a rout as might Conduce most to the Advantage of the Service I am upon, I consulted with the Officers upon the most Eligible way of putting this in Execution. To return by the way of Cape Horn was what I most wished, because by this rout <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to prove the [...] or [...] of a Southern Continent, which yet remains Doubtfull; but in order to Ascertain this we must have kept in a higher Latitude in the very Depth of Winter, but the Condition of the Ship, in every respect, was not thought sufficient for such an undertaking. For the same reason the thoughts of proceeding directly to the Cape of Good Hope was laid aside, especially as no discovery of any Moment could be hoped for in that rout. It was therefore resolved to return by way of the East Indies by the following rout: upon Leaving this Coast to steer to the Westward until we fall in with the East Coast of New Holland, and then to follow the direction of that Coast to the Northward, or what other direction it might take us, until we arrive at its Northern extremity; and if this should be found impracticable, then to Endeavour to fall in with the Land or Islands discovered by Quiros".|$|E
