5|$|The {{book was}} {{published}} in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury and in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc. Although Rowling found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics, young readers and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes, while others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and on the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person's character {{is the result of the}} person's choices.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{homotopy}} {{groups of}} spheres {{are important in}} singularity theory, which studies the structure of singular points of smooth maps or algebraic varieties. Such singularities arise as critical points of smooth maps from Rm to Rn. The geometry near a critical point of such a map can be described by an element of πmminus&1(S'nminus&1), by considering the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> small m minus& 1 sphere around the critical point maps into a topological n minus& 1 sphere around the critical value.|$|E
5|$|A social {{rational}} for the Hindu {{concept of}} rebirth in Hell {{is evident in}} the metric work of the Manusmrti: a written discourse focused on the “law of the social classes”. A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. For this we turn to the Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences. An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows (such as fasting, water purification rituals, chanting, and even sacrifices). These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in. These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior.|$|E

25|$|Shirov was aggrieved, {{and even}} in 2006 {{maintained}} that Kramnik was not a valid world champion. However, most supporters of Kasparov's title believe that, despite the unsatisfactory <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> challenger was chosen, nevertheless the winner of this match would be the true World Champion. Kramnik had a far better record against Kasparov than Shirov did (a point Kasparov emphasised when the match was announced in April 2000). In the years that followed, Kasparov maintained an overwhelming plus score in his individual games against Shirov.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} the {{individual}} and integral confession and absolution (as opposed to collective absolution) is the only ordinary <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> person conscious of mortal sins committed after baptism can be reconciled with God and the Church. Perfect contrition (a sorrow motivated by love of God rather than of fear of punishment) removes the guilt of mortal sin even before confession or, {{if there is no}} opportunity of confessing to a priest, without confession, but with the intention of confessing when and if the opportunity arrives.|$|E

The IPCC may chose to manage or supervise investigations conducted into complaints and may conduct the investigations themselves in the most serious cases. The Commission sets {{the standards of the}} investigation of complaints against police and also acts as the appeals body in cases where members of the public are dissatisfied with the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> police force has handled their complaint.|$|E
25|$|Jaspers {{thought that}} psychiatrists could {{diagnose}} delusions {{in the same}} way. He argued that clinicians should not consider a belief delusional based {{on the content of}} the belief, but only based on the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> patient holds such a belief. (See delusion for further discussion.) Jaspers also distinguished between primary and secondary delusions. He defined primary delusions as autochthonous, meaning that they arise without apparent cause, appearing incomprehensible in terms of a normal mental process. (This is a slightly different use of the word autochthonous than the ordinary medical or sociological use as a synonym for indigenous.) Secondary delusions, on the other hand, he defined as those influenced by the person's background, current situation or mental state.|$|E
25|$|Many {{careers in}} {{mathematics}} outside of universities involve consulting. For instance, actuaries assemble and analyze data {{to estimate the}} probability and likely cost of the occurrence of an event such as death, sickness, injury, disability, or loss of property. Actuaries also address financial questions, including those involving the level of pension contributions required to produce a certain retirement income and the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> company should invest resources to maximize its return on investments in light of potential risk. Using their broad knowledge, actuaries help design and price insurance policies, pension plans, and other financial strategies in a manner which will help ensure that the plans are maintained on a sound financial basis.|$|E

25|$|As this is {{a sacred}} ceremony, people are {{typically}} reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given {{a long history of}} cultural misappropriation, indigenous people are suspicious that non-Natives may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and medicine men are concerned that the ceremony should only be passed along in the right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. Not talking about this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> respected elder speaks, teaches, and explains a sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.|$|E
25|$|One main <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> {{periphery}} {{country can}} rise to semi-periphery or core status {{is through the}} stabilization of its government. A country with a dictatorship type government {{is much easier to}} exploit and corrupt than one with a well organized, elected government and core countries use this to their advantage. Political unrest is usually a cause for military action from the core countries in order to protect their interests and keep a cooperative dictator or government in power. Once the citizens of these countries become exploited enough, they can stage a coup in order to overthrow their government and put someone who they feel will help the country into power. If this is done successfully and the new leader is stays true to his/her word, the country can take the next necessary step in rising from periphery status and that is to start to industrialize.|$|E
25|$|Salmon(1967) {{also found}} several other {{similarities}} between the campaigns of 343 and later events which he considered to be doublets. Both the First and the Second Samnite War starts with an invasion of Samnium by a Cornelius, the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> Roman army was led into a trap resembles the famous disaster at the Caudine Forks in 321, and there are similarities to the campaigns of Publius Cornelius Arvina in 306 and Publius Decius Mus (the son of the hero of Saticula) in 297. He also thought Valerius Corvus' two Campanian victories could be doublets of Roman operations against Hannibal {{in the same area}} in 215 On the other hand, the entries in the Fasti Triumphales supports some measure of Roman success. In Salmon's reconstruction therefore there was only one battle in 343, perhaps fought on the outskirts of Capua near the shrine of Juno Gaura, and ending with a narrow Roman victory.|$|E

25|$|When {{a coastal}} {{environment}} is in sediment deficit, anthropogenic sediment nourishment is one <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> balanced sedimentary budget can be maintained. This type of coastal erosion management {{has been adopted}} {{all over the world}} in order to preserve and protect. An example of this is at Mount Maunganui beach in the North Island of New Zealand which had been experiencing erosion, resulting in coastal dune retreat of almost 20 metres. When ongoing dredging {{at the entrance to the}} Tauranga Harbour began, it was decided that the sediment removed would be used to re-nourish the Mt. Manganui beach. The sediment was deposited in the nearshore zone promoting beach accretion by offshore berm emplacement. Results show that most of the 80,000m3 of sediment added to the nearshore zone made it to ashore to re-nourish the beach and even out the past sediment deficit. Nourishment of a coast can be regarded as a fast fix option to reversing a sediment deficit; however, it is important that nourishment is on-going in order to ensure the sedimentary budget remains balanced.|$|E
25|$|Because the PSP Go {{does not}} feature a UMD drive, games are {{downloaded}} from the PlayStation Store. While other PSP models {{have included the}} ability to run games and demos downloaded from the PlayStation Store, the PSP Go is the first for which {{this is the only}} means of distribution. The PSP Go has the demo version of Patapon 2 loaded onto the system and it also comes with an ESRB ratings guide, both preloaded into the internal memory in the games section. The removal of the UMD drive effectively region locks the unit due to the <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> PSP must be linked to a single PlayStation Network account. Since each account is locked to a single region, this prevents the user from ever playing games from more than one region at a time (since games from accounts other than the currently linked account cannot be started). There are three ways to access the PlayStation Store. The PSP Go can directly download to itself, or users can also download then transfer the games from a PlayStation 3 or the Media Go software on Windows based computers. All current downloadable PSP and PlayStation games available for older PSP models are compatible with the PSP Go. Sony has also confirmed that almost all UMD based PSP games released after October 1, 2009 will be available for download, and a majority of older UMD-only games will also be downloadable at that time.|$|E
