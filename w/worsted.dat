5|$|The Samian War {{was one of}} {{the last}} {{significant}} military events before the Peloponnesian War. After Thucydides' ostracism, Pericles was re-elected yearly to the generalship, the only office he ever officially occupied, although his influence was so great as to make him the de facto ruler of the state. In 440 BC Samos went to war against Miletus over control of Priene, an ancient city of Ionia on the foot-hills of Mycale. <b>Worsted</b> in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} weaving of fine kersies and later serges was {{introduced}} to the area by weavers from the continent. This was largely a cottage industry and merchants would have premises where the fleeces would be combed and sorted. John Lane {{was one of the best}} known local cloth merchants (see Lane's Aisle in the section on St Andrew's church below). In the seventeenth century, Higher and Lower King's Mills were fulling mills for the local industry. In 1816 Mr Upcott employed 60 weavers and 'many spinners'. The Wellington based firm Fox Brothers had a branch factory built in 1890 and made high quality woolen and <b>worsted</b> cloth until 1977. During World War I, their entire output was of khaki cloth, employing over 200 people. In 1910 Mrs Gidley, wife of Dr Gustavus Gidley, set up a hand-weaving enterprise in the stables of Heyford House with the aim of giving employment to ex-servicemen and disabled people. To manage it she appointed two women, one a granddaughter of Bishop Phillpotts. Later the business evolved into machine knitted garments.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} influential, Pericles, Aspasia {{and their friends}} were not immune from attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Her relationship with Pericles and her subsequent political influence aroused many reactions. Donald Kagan, a Yale historian, believes that Aspasia was particularly unpopular {{in the years immediately}} following the Samian War. In 440 BC, Samos was at war with Miletus over Priene, an ancient city of Ionia in the foot-hills of Mycale. <b>Worsted</b> in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians. When the Athenians ordered the two sides to stop fighting and submit the case to arbitration at Athens, the Samians refused. In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos. The campaign proved to be difficult and the Athenians had to endure heavy casualties before Samos was defeated. According to Plutarch, it was thought that Aspasia, who came from Miletus, was responsible for the Samian War, and that Pericles had decided against and attacked Samos to gratify her.|$|E
50|$|<b>Worsteds</b> {{differ from}} woollens, {{in that the}} natural crimp of the wool fibre is removed {{in the process of}} {{spinning}} the yarn. In 'tropical' <b>worsteds</b> this use of tightly spun, straightened wool combined with a looser weave permits the free flow of air through the fabric.|$|R

"But {{sometimes}} it is a trump, my dear young lady," [...] said the Colonel, with unabated gallantry; [...] "and when yo' mothah uses yarn, it is <b>worsteds.</b> But I respect <b>worsteds</b> even {{under the name of}} yarn: our ladies--my own mothah and sistahs--had to knit the socks we wore--all we could get in the woe." ...|$|R

25|$|The wool {{industry}} {{was divided into}} woollen and <b>worsted.</b> It lagged behind cotton in adopting new technology. <b>Worsted</b> tended to adopt Arkwright water frames which could be operated by young girls, and woollen adopted the mule.|$|E
25|$|Spinning is {{the final}} stage in {{converting}} wool to <b>worsted</b> yarns, the roving being drawn out to its final thickness and twist added for strength. There are three types of spinning machine or frame in common use in the United Kingdom, namely flyer, cap and ring. Another machine used for spinning <b>worsted</b> yarns is the <b>worsted</b> mule. All three types of machine or frame are similar in their method of drawing out or drafting the roving to make the required count or thickness, but differ {{in the way in}} which twist is imparted and the yarn wound onto the bobbin. Drafting takes place between the back and front rollers. The front rollers revolve faster than the back ones, drawing out the roving to the fineness of yarn required. Between the rollers are carriers which support and help to control the fibres as they are being drafted.|$|E
25|$|However, the French Revolution and the {{invasion}} of Flanders in 1793 caused very serious difficulties for Exeter cloth merchants, and in 1794 the Weres were forced to cancel major <b>worsted</b> yarn orders.|$|E
50|$|In Victorian {{dressmaking}} terminology, {{stuff was}} used as a generic term for woven fabrics, with cloth generally reserved for woollens (as opposed to <b>worsteds).</b>|$|R

50|$|In August 1954, Daroff and Sons, a Philadelphia {{clothing}} manufacturer {{which had}} produced <b>worsteds</b> for Botany under contract for several years, purchased a controlling interest in Botany Mills.|$|R
25|$|Combing: Oiled slivers are wound into laps, {{and placed}} in the {{circular}} comber. The <b>worsted</b> yarn gathers together to form a top. The shorter fibres or noils remain behind and are removed with a knife.|$|E
25|$|Other major {{employers}} were Samuel Lister and {{his brother}} who were <b>worsted</b> spinners and manufacturers at Lister's Mill (Manningham Mills). Lister epitomised Victorian enterprise {{but it has been}} suggested that his capitalist attitude made trade unions necessary.|$|E

25|$|A tightly {{spun wool}} yarn made from fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called <b>worsted.</b> It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates <b>worsted</b> yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|E
25|$|An {{inventory}} of 1802 suggests that spinning {{was to be}} carried out on hand-powered spinning jennies, with a waterwheel (costing £450) powering the carding machines. By 1816 the mill contained <b>worsted</b> spinning frames, and in 1822 a new waterwheel costing £1,500 had been installed.|$|E
25|$|What is {{verified}} {{is that in}} 1906, Charles {{moved to}} the United States, where he became a United States citizen, married, and had a son, Charles Emile Bedaux (1909–1993). He would later claim in interviews to have worked as a restaurant bottle-washer, a sandhog, and at the New Jersey <b>Worsted</b> Mills in Hoboken.|$|E

But we can never match our <b>worsteds</b> for that other piece of work, but are obliged to take any colour that comes,--and, therefore, it is that we make such a jumble of it! Here's mamma.

25|$|In 1868 Shepley was {{described}} as a township and chapelry in the parish of Kirkburton, upper division of Agbrigg Wapentake, West Riding County York. The village was also recorded as having 30 tailor's shops in a population of around 1,000. These would have sprung up {{as a result of the}} four mills around the village manufacturing fine woollen <b>worsteds.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Essex Company {{was founded}} in 1845. Before the city of Lawrence was even incorporated, the Essex Company laid plans for turning an area of {{farmland}} on the Merrimack River into the country’s first planned industrial city. The Essex Company built the Stone Mill, then known as the Lawrence Machine Shop from 1846-1848. It {{is one of the}} two oldest mill buildings in the city of Lawrence {{and one of the few}} mills ever built out of stone. It originally housed a forge and a foundry and its purpose was to manufacture and repair the machinery that would be used by the new mill buildings. In the loft of the building, an experimental full set of <b>worsted</b> wool machinery was put together and tested – <b>worsted</b> wool would become one of the signature products of the Lawrence manufacturing industry.|$|E
25|$|On the Gateshead riverbank, a {{few yards}} {{downstream}} of the old bridge, stood the splendid new mill premises of Messrs. J. Wilson & Sons, <b>worsted</b> manufacturers. This large gaslight-lit building had been erected after a fire which destroyed their previous premises, on the same site, three years before the events of this great fire.|$|E
25|$|In the {{historical}} projects, yarn companies provided knitting patterns {{approved by the}} various branches of the armed services; often they were distributed by local chapters of the American Red Cross. Modern projects usually entail the hand knitting of hats or helmet liners; the liners provided for soldiers must be of 100% <b>worsted</b> weight wool and be crafted using specific colors.|$|E
25|$|The fleece is cut in {{one piece}} from the sheep.This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled. It is graded into long wool where the fibres can be up to 15 in, but {{anything}} over 2.5inches is suitable for combing into <b>worsteds.</b> Fibres less than that form short wool and are described as clothing or carding wool.|$|R
25|$|Wool {{comes from}} domesticated sheep. It forms two products, woolens and <b>worsteds.</b> The sheep has two sorts of wool {{and it is}} the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been {{recovered}} from rags. Shoddy is the term for recovered wool that is not matted, while mungo comes from felted wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics.|$|R
50|$|The {{town had}} an {{organised}} planned growth with traditional plot patterns. It was built over a cut-over bog, an extension to the Templetuohy Bog, {{much of which}} has been reclaimed. Urlingford is a linear town around the focused primary axis, the Main Street. In 1837 it was the centre of a manufacture of coarse stuffs, flannels, and <b>worsteds,</b> and carries on an extensive retail trade with the surrounding districts.|$|R
25|$|Symon Weeks, of Devonshire, a <b>worsted</b> weaver born in 1618, who {{emigrated to}} Barbados in February 1634 aged only 16. He is {{currently}} {{known to be}} the first person with the surname Weeks or etymologies of it to travel to the new world thus becoming a common ancestor to many with the name or derivatives of it in North America.|$|E
25|$|In 1825 the wool-combers union {{called a}} strike that lasted five-months but workers {{were forced to}} return to work through {{hardship}} leading to the introduction of machine-combing. This Industrial Revolution led to rapid growth, with wool imported in vast quantities for the manufacture of <b>worsted</b> cloth in which Bradford specialised, and the town soon became known as the wool capital of the world.|$|E
25|$|Cloth {{production}} {{moved away}} from the cottage into manufactories. The first moves towards manufactories called mills were made in the spinning sector. The move in the weaving sector was later. By the 1820s, all cotton, wool and <b>worsted</b> was spun in mills; but this yarn went to outworking weavers who continued to work in their own homes. A mill that specialised in weaving fabric was called a weaving shed.|$|E
50|$|Steep-sided valleys with fast flowing streams {{provided}} {{power and}} {{water for the}} area's early mills and factories. Water-powered corn mills and fulling mills were use in medieval times and more fulling mills were built after the mid-16th century as the woollen industry grew. At {{the end of the}} 18th century, water powered mills were vital for industrial expansion of the textile industry, initially for spinning cotton, but subsequently for woollens and <b>worsteds.</b>|$|R

And Charlie Smith, who delights to romp and play out of doors, and who wanted some new rubber boots to keep his feet dry, {{received}} a sewing box filled with colored <b>worsteds</b> and threads and needles, which made him so provoked that he thoughtlessly called our dear Santa Claus a fraud.|$|R
50|$|Limbach-Oberfrohna is {{situated}} in the manufacturing district of Chemnitz. It has a public park and {{a monument to the}} composer Johannes Pache. Its industries in the past included the making of <b>worsteds,</b> cloth, silk and sewing-machines, dyeing and bleaching. However, these industries collapsed almost completely after the reunification of Germany in 1990. Today, the biggest employers in the town are Siemens VDO, a former branch of the Siemens AG and manufacturer of car-supplies together with other mechanical-engineering firms.|$|R
