They flock together along the cliffs and ridges of Brockway Mountain. The top of the mountain is a semi-alpine climate with strong winds, and guide books advise visitors to bring <b>windbreaker</b> jackets, even in the summer. The peak is also known as an excellent star-gazing location because there are no electric lights to interrupt the darkness. The surrounding mountainsides are privately owned, mostly by Champion International Paper. The company receives reduced taxes in exchange for keeping the land open for recreational uses. The Michigan Nature Association owns [...] of property on Brockway Mountain itself. There are over 700species of flowers including trillium and orchids. The peak bloom is in June, and some of the wildflowers on display are not found elsewhere in the state. Motorcycle Cruiser magazine featured a piece on Copper Harbor in February 2010 that suggested visiting Brockway Mountain at dawn saying that [...] "the vista at the peak is amazing and it's worth the early morning rise." [...] The area is renowned as a fall foliage destination; color season starts by the second week of September and ends in October.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} current state of {{selected}} wind breaking types, looking at their species composition, condition and functionality. 	One of the most efficient precaution against wind erosion are wind breaking swathes of woodland, <b>windbreakers.</b> These woodlands protect adjoining land against wind erosion of topsoil, blowing away snow cover as well as lowering water evaporation. The right position in the landscape, species composition and a good state are important for <b>windbreakers</b> to fulfil the above mentioned function. In the Czech Republic, 29 % of farmland is badly affected by wind erosion. The most affected areas are situated in the South Moravian region. For the purpose of this dissertation work, two areas were chosen. Both of them are situated in the district of Znojmo, where the highest level of wind erosion is found. Area 1 lies in the districts of Břežany, Čejkovice and Božice. Area 2 lies in the districts of Velký Karlov, Hrádek and Křídlůvky. In order to investigate suitability of current <b>windbreakers,</b> the state of potential natural vegetation, climate, geological, paedological and hydrological conditions will be investigated in both of these areas. 	For the assessment of the effect of <b>windbreakers,</b> methodology after Podhrázská (2008) was used. This methodology allows assessment of these trees as individual linear elements, but also as a part of a network of these elements. The assessed criteria will be, for example: position in the landscape, species composition, age, functional type, height, width and the number of rows. Furthermore, horizontal and vertical parameters will also be investigated. For the evaluation of the functionality of the network of elements, it is also crucial to look at the tree orientation, their position in relation to the terrain and the direction of the wind. Moreover, the distance between individual woodlands also plays a significant role. The effect of <b>windbreakers</b> on the landscape will be further assessed using classification system after Kolařík (2005). 	Over the course of this project, 22 <b>windbreakers</b> were selected for evaluating their functionality and a proposal for their re-establishment in the future was suggested...|$|R

2500|$|A typical {{trench coat}} is a ten-buttoned, {{double-breasted}} long coat made with tan, black, khaki, or beige fabric. Trench coats often have cuff straps, raglan sleeves, shoulder straps and a belt. The trench coat was typically worn as a <b>windbreaker</b> or as a rain jacket, {{and not for}} protection from the cold in winter or snowy conditions (although many come with removable wool liners for additional warmth, they are usually not as warm as an overcoat). [...] Period advertisements from World War I reveal that the trench coat was sized to wear over the British Warm, to offer water protection when the temperature was cold enough to require the heavier coat, which explains the traditionally generous sizing of trench coats; however, makers {{in recent years have}} resized trench coats downwards to conform more closely to overcoat sizing, as the two coats, trench and overcoat, would rarely if at all be worn together today.|$|E

Minsky denied any involvement and local authorities declined to prosecute based partially on the victim's previous false police reports, according to local authorities. On December 7, 1996, Minsky was arrested in Boston, Massachusetts and charged with three counts each of attempted extortion and assault, and one count of failing to register as a sex offender. Minsky was wrapped in a <b>windbreaker</b> to hide his identity during a court hearing where his bail was set at $13,000. Boston Police detective William Hartford stated that Minsky spent over 90 minutes at a payphone with a bag of dimes at the Copley Plaza Hotel, randomly calling women from the Boston and Cambridge phone books. Minsky told the women that he was holding their friends or family hostage and demanded sex as ransom. One of the callers contacted the police from her car phone. He was convicted of indecent assault and battery. He was released from a Massachusetts Correctional Institution in June 1998, but again failed to register as a sex offender and skipped probation. Within two weeks, Minsky struck again in Los Angeles and was sought for parole violations in connection with crimes against eleven women in Southern California and stealing approximately $50,000. Metcalf sought help in finding Minsky by profiling him on Fox Files in April and June 1999. According to Metcalf, during this time Minsky shared photos of two of his puppies with an acquaintance by mail. In the background of photo of the puppies were a newspaper and the apartment building of Minsky's residence. Cindy Smith, a producer with America's Most Wanted, recognized the newspaper as from Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. Copies of the photos containing the picture of the apartment building, believed to be Minky's residence, were sent to the Raleigh-Durham Police Department and there an officer recognized it as an apartment he had lived at. Officers responding to the location discovered that Minsky had abandoned the unit after America's Most Wanted had profiled him again on July 31. When officers arrived, they discovered he had left behind his belongings and puppies and the television was still turned to the station that showed America's Most Wanted.|$|E
