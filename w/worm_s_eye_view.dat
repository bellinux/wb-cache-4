40|$|Purpose: To {{obtain a}} contrasted {{image of the}} tumor region during the setup for proton therapy in lung patients, by using proton {{radiography}} and x-ray computed tomography (CT) prior knowledge. Methods and Materials: Six lung cancer patients 2 ̆ 7 CT scans were preprocessed by masking out the gross tumor volume (GTV), and digitally reconstructed radiographs along the planned beam 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>view</b> (BEV) were generated, {{for a total of}} 27 projections. Proton radiographies (PR) were also computed for the same BEV through Monte Carlo simulations. The digitally reconstructed radiograph was subtracted from the corresponding proton image, resulting in a contrast-enhanced proton radiography (CEPR). Michelson contrast analysis was performed both on PR and CEPR. The tumor region was then automatically segmented on CEPR and compared to the ground truth (GT) provided by physicians in terms of Dice coefficient, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: Contrast on CEPR was, on average, 4 times better than on PR. For 10 lateral projections (± 45 ° off of 90 ° or 270 °), although {{it was not possible to}} distinguish the tumor region in the PR, CEPR offers excellent GTV visibility. The median ± quartile values of Dice, precision, and accuracy indexes were 0. 86 ± 0. 03, 0. 86 ± 0. 06, and 0. 88 ± 0. 02, respectively, thus confirming the reliability of the method in highlighting tumor boundaries. Sensitivity and specificity analysis demonstrated that there is no systematic over- or underestimation of the tumor region. Identification of the tumor boundaries using CEPR resulted in a more accurate and precise definition of GTV compared to that obtained from pretreatment CT. Conclusions: In most proton centers, the current clinical protocol is to align the patient using kV imaging with bony anatomy as a reference. We demonstrated that CEPR can significantly improve tumor visualization, allowing better patient set-up and permitting image guided proton therapy (IGPT) ...|$|R
40|$|These {{personal}} essays are meditations and speculations; in this sense, they partake equally (in {{spirit and}} metaphorical resonance) of both poetry and prose, written {{over the last}} few years with the encouragement of my mentor and adviser Judith Slater, their subject matter is wide and often strange: abandoned shopping carts, transcribing tapes for an insurance firm, a homeless woman who talks to debris in the street, another woman killed by a trash compactor while inspecting garbage, a child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>view</b> of the sky from a snow bank, a troublesome toaster, the haunting presence of crows in winter, a keen sensitivity to noise, gravel roads, the shot-out windows of a church. As Annie Dillard once said of the essay, “The essay can do everything but fake it”—and these, too, try to come to grips with both lived experience and what those experiences have come to signify through the cleansing rigors of prose. They attempt to illuminate the deep mysteries of the commonplace, that which is right in front of our eyes in every day experience. Only the emergent field of creative nonfiction allows for such gambols of the heart and mind, and the possibility of epiphany and redemption in the commonplace only the essay is capacious enough in its variety to look at experience from so many different angles. ^ The settings where these essays “happen” are mostly urban or on I- 80 between Omaha and Lincoln. Although they inevitably draw on memory, the import of their assertions has implications for the present in just how these collective experiences have impinged on my sense of the world. The circuits of thought here are open loops, and raise many questions regarding certain felt omens and signs intuited about American culture at large. The “I” behind them, then, is merely a part of a broader and richer tapestry, one which weaves a contexture toward a deeper understanding—via prose—of the complex relations between the individual and his or her given place in the world. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of law is changing. Lawyers who act solely as advocates and zealous representatives of clients in legal matters still represent the core of what lawyers do and of how many lawyers see their work, but other trends are filtering into 2 ̆ 2 on the ground 2 ̆ 2 practice. Increasing numbers of lawyers are mediating, consulting on traditionally non-legal issues, and approaching clients 2 ̆ 7 needs 2 ̆ 2 holistically 2 ̆ 2 by associating with and integrating other professional services. These trends cut across virtually all segments of the profession, from prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers, to lawyers whose practices involve, among other things, public interest work, personal injury, family law, and business law. All indications — sociological, legal, and economic — suggest that these transformations of what lawyers do will continue. The purpose of this Article is to offer a bird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>view</b> of an evolving profession, a kind of 2 ̆ 2 Practice 20002 ̆ 2 examination of where the profession has been and where {{it appears to be}} going.

In this regard, a key thesis of this Article is that these trends interlock and represent shifts in {{what it means to be}} a lawyer. The Article will approach this topic at a number of levels. It will first address the traditional notions of practice undergirding the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and, more generally, how lawyers traditionally conceived what they do.

Third, while the existing regulatory framework under which lawyers practice largely retains traditional norms, the seeds for reconceptualizing the {{practice of}} law have been planted in amendments to and interpretations of the Model Rules. Finally, the Article will explore the degree to which regulatory changes are necessary to reflect and facilitate these developments...|$|R
40|$|Matching of {{disparate}} views has gained significance in computer vision {{due to its}} role in many novel application areas. Being able to match images of the same scene captured during day and night, between a historic and contemporary picture of a scene, and between aerial and ground-level views of a building facade all enable novel applications ranging from loop-closure detection for structure-from-motion and re-photography to geo-localization of a street-level image using reference imagery captured from the air. The goal of this work is to develop novel features and methods that address matching problems where direct appearance-based correspondences are either difficult to obtain or infeasible {{because of the lack}} of appearance similarity altogether. To address these problems, we propose methods that span the appearance-geometry spectrum in terms of both the use of these cues as well as the ability of each method to handle variations in appearance and geometry. First, we consider the problem of geo-localization of a query street-level image using a reference database of building facades captured from a bird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>view.</b> To address this wide-baseline facade matching problem, a novel scale-selective self-similarity feature that avoids direct comparison of appearance between disparate facade images is presented. Next, to address image matching problems with more extreme appearance variation, a novel representation for matchable images expressed in terms of the eigen-functions of the joint graph of the two images is presented. This representation is used to derive features that are persistent across wide variations in appearance. Next, the problem setting of matching between a street-level image and a digital elevation map (DEM) is considered. Given the limited appearance information available in this scenario, the matching approach has to rely more significantly on geometric cues. Therefore, a purely geometric method to establish correspondences between building corners in the DEM and the visible corners in the query image is presented. Finally, to generalize this problem setting we address the problem of establishing correspondences between 3 D and 2 D point clouds using geometric means alone. A novel framework for incorporating purely geometric constraints into a higher-order graph matching framework is presented with specific formulations for the three-point calibrated absolute camera pose problem (P 3 P), two-point upright camera pose problem (Up 2 p) and the three-plus-one relative camera pose problem. ...|$|R

That is the main reason why it takes a bird 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>view</b> on the development and its causes. After outlining some of the activities on the global, European, and national level it pleads for a more in depth analysis and less hasty actions because for the preventive measures a sufficient amount of time is available. Starting from the observation that at the origin of the crisis there has been a threefold failure, a failure of the economic sciences, a failure of the markets, and a failure of government and law, the analysis concentrates on the third type of failure discarding two major factors: monetary policy and mis-selling of financial products to end users. Following this approach a major finding is the total failure of the regulatory framework. Thousands of rules did not serve their purpose. They did not prevent a crisis of the type we are experiencing right now but that is what they were made for. Furthermore, it was not some specific clauses which did not fulfil their objective. It was the system as a whole which did not function properly. Deficiencies in executing the law might also have been an important factor but the design of the rules appears to be crucial...|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{investigates the}} ability to {{generate}} social and architectural sustainability from the surrounding context of a specific site- Power Town. A thorough analysis of the changing social conditions, cultural values and natural processes are done to be part of, and inform, this hypothesis. My architectural interventions are thus informed by the existing {{and will be a}} reflection of Power Town's vernacular. The first part of the document introduces Power Town to the reader, where it is situated and how it came to be, and why it is an unproductive settlement. Part two, 'a landscape enthused architecture', explores cultural, productive and responsive landscapes and their implication in architecture. Methods are investigated that help to uncover the complex layers of site and landscape. This thorough understanding Bird' <b>s</b> <b>eye</b> <b>view</b> of Power Town (Wildlife Expressions, Power Town) of the landscape will inform the design proposal. It will illustrate that Power Town has much potential to develop and evolve within its environment. In part three, 'adaptability', I discuss the potential of reusing structures, as they are, instead of demolishing them, clearing the site, and constructing new architecture. In many situations, manmade structures already exist {{in the context of a}} site and the adaptive reuse of them will be a productive addition to the context. New architecture must also be able to adjust and accommodate the unpredictable needs of the future. The fourth part, 'sustainable materials', is an investigation of a productive use of materials. Using materials originated from the context is the key initiative here. It makes for a sustainable construction that reflects the context and blends in with the landscape. This includes possibilities such as materials produced or harvested on site and the reuse of demolition- and industrial waste. All topics are discussed as interrelated issues that could contribute to the restoration of Power Town's dignity. Part five, 'design', is the synthesis of all these opportunities. A site making strategy that allows for unpredictable incremental phasing is designed initially. A number of design principles are implemented in this place making that would contribute to ascertaining social and architectural sustainability. The main idea here is to exploit the existing farming, fishing and construction abilities in the community and initiate a productive landscape. The place making plan lays the foundation for the design of a production centre. I propose to adapt and reuse the existing derelict power station. This new public building will form the heart of Power Town's productivity. It will house a number of facilities that offer, mainly; skills development workshops in different forms of production; a multi-usable auditorium; a production nursery; as well as flexible market, storage and work space for the processing and distribution of foodstuff in the community...|$|R
