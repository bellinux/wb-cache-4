2500|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, El Al {{has been the}} only {{commercial}} airliner to fit its planes with systems to defend against anti-aircraft missiles. In 2014, El Al began to fit some of its planes that fly on more sensitive routes with an updated missile approach warning system (MAWS) that employs an infrared missile-tracking camera, an “infrared (IR), ultra-violet (UV), or radar missile-approach <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> to detect a missile launch in the very early stages of an attack” and a laser system to act as a counter-measure. In November 2014, under the Israeli government's SkyShield programme, Elbit's Commercial Multi-Spectral Infrared Countermeasures (C-MUSIC) system was adopted by El Al. [...] "C-MUSIC {{is one of the biggest}} and most complex projects ever undertaken at Elbit and in Israel".|$|E

50|$|Each Akash battery has {{a single}} Rajendra radar which is linked to up to 4 Akash launchers, each with 3 {{missiles}}. Each Rajendra radar can guide up to 2 of these missiles against a single target, with 8 missiles {{in the air at}} the same time. 4 Akash batteries make up a group in the Indian Army configuration, with a central 3D CAR radar acting as the early <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> for the entire group.In 2007, the Indian Air Force ordered 2 Akash squadrons to begin with. Each squadron consists of a minimum of two batteries, and hence at least 4 Rajendra radars are on order. Many more orders are expected to come over time, as the Indian Air Force phases out its older Pechora systems. The IAF had 30 Pechora squadrons of which 9 were to be replaced by the DRDO-IAI LRSAM project. The rest were to be replaced by the Akash, over time. As of May 2008, the LRSAM project is on hold on account of Indian Government investigations over the earlier Barak SAM deal with the Indian Navy. This is expected to put more emphasis on orders for the Akash SAM, as the Indian Air Force moves towards revamping its SAM inventory.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the relationships between automation false alarm rate, human trust in automation, and human use of automation, specifically under conditions of simulated high risk. The experiment involved military pilots flying combat and non-combat missions while employing a missile <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> with two levels of automation. The experiment was performed in a high fidelity F- 16 simulator with U. S. Air Force F- 16 pilots as test subjects. Three sensor false alarm rates were tested. The results showed that the level of missile <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> automation preferred by the pilots was strongly dependent on the false alarm rate of the automation. The data demonstrated that as false alarm rate increased, pilot trust of the missile <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> decreased, resulting in the pilot preferring a lower level of automation. However, the results also showed that even when pilots expressed little trust in the system, they preferred to use some level of automation rather than turn the system off. This result was attributed to the cost/benefit tradeoff of using the automation, as well as the extreme difficulty and hazard associated with the task. Analysis of the pilot mean reaction time in response to a missile <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> alert showed that reaction time increased as the false alarm rate increased, although this effect appeared to be less significant the higher the false alarm rate. Missile hit data indicated that as false alarm rate increased, the number of missiles that hit the pilot’s aircraft also increased, demonstrating a degradation in pilot survivability. Missile hit results also indicated that using a higher level of automation improved pilot survivability for the scenarios tested. This study was funded by the United States Air Force (USAF) Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) program office (ASC/LNWP) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an all-digital on-chip {{abnormal}} temperature <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> (ATWS) {{which can}} tolerate process and voltage variations after four-point calibration is presented.

Thus, the proposed ATWS can use a linear model to compute the chip temperature even with voltage variations. The proposed ATWS is implemented in a 90 nm CMOS process, and the active area is 0. 0625 mm 2. It can achieve temperature error smaller than ± 3. 66 °C within the range of 40 °C to 70 °C, and 0. 9 V to 1. 1 V. The power consumption is 530 μW at 4 k sample/s...|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{interest}} and controversy has arisen over the potential effects of seismic surveys carried out during exploration {{for oil and}} gas deposits. Regarding fish, there is a concern that intense sound sources, such as seismic airguns, may injure their auditory system. Salmonid cDNA microarrays, reciprocal suppression subtractive hybridization libraries and quantitative reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction were used to identify and study a responsive gene set in the inner ear of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) following seismic airgun exposure. Taken together results point to seismic noise exposure altering salmon ear transcripts that likely play important roles in a variety of processes, including sensory perception of sound. Also, initial results demonstrate that genomics has the potential to greatly enhance our understanding of the impact of seismic airguns on gene and molecular pathways involved in hearing, and provide valuable molecular biomarkers that can act as an early <b>warning</b> <b>sensor</b> to acoustic stress.
