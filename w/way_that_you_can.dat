2500|$|Swift uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) {{to manage}} memory. Apple used to require manual memory {{management}} in Objective-C, but introduced ARC in 2011 {{to allow for}} easier memory allocation and deallocation. One problem with ARC {{is the possibility of}} creating a strong reference cycle, where objects reference each other in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> reach the object you started from by following references (e.g. A references B, B references A). This causes them to become leaked into memory as they are never released. [...] Swift provides the keywords weak and unowned to prevent strong reference cycles. Typically a parent-child relationship would use a strong reference while a child-parent would use either weak reference, where parents and children can be unrelated, or unowned where a child always has a parent, but parent may not have a child. Weak references must be optional variables, since they can change and become nil.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most children know that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They know that these words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. If a child is able to master this skill, called phonological awareness, {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> teach children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another way to teach a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E

60|$|I had {{had enough}} of this grisly place by this time, and wanted to leave, but I couldn't, because I had {{something}} on my mind that my conscience kept prodding me about, and wouldn't let me forget. If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn't have any conscience. It {{is one of the most}} disagreeable things connected with a person; and although it certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot be said to pay, in the long run; it would be much better to have less good and more comfort. Still, this is only my opinion, and I am only one man; others, with less experience, may think differently. They have a right to their view. I only stand to this: I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I know it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started with. I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we prize anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so. If we look at it in another way, we see how absurd it is: if I had an anvil in me would I prize it? Of course not. And yet when you come to think, there is no real difference between a conscience and an anvil--I mean for comfort. I have noticed it a thousand times. And you could dissolve an anvil with acids, when you couldn't stand it any longer; but there isn't any <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> work off a conscience--at least so it will stay worked off; not that I know of, anyway.|$|E
