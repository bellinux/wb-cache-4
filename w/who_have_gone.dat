For boys' sports, some Malvernians would consider the College to be {{best known as a}} football school although its cricket sides have also produced players <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> on to play at international level.

Colours were awarded for each major sport, as appropriate. After 1995, the distinction between 'major sport' and 'minor sport' was removed. The girls' main sports are hockey and lacrosse in the winter, lacrosse and netball in the Lent Term and tennis and rounders in the summer.|$|E
