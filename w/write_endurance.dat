5000|$|A {{new type}} of {{magnetic}} storage, called magnetoresistive random-access memory or MRAM, is being produced that stores data in magnetic bits based on the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Its advantage is non-volatility, low power usage, and good shock robustness. The 1st generation that was developed was produced by Everspin Technologies, and utilized field induced writing. [...] The 2nd generation is being developed through two approaches: thermal-assisted switching (TAS) which is currently being developed by Crocus Technology, and spin-transfer torque (STT) on which Crocus, Hynix, IBM, and several other companies are working.

Solid-state storage typically uses the NAND type of flash memory, which may be written and read in chunks {{much smaller than the}} entire size of the storage device. The size of a minimal chunk (page) for read operations is much smaller than the minimal chunk size (block) for write/erase operations, resulting in an undesirable phenomenon called write amplification that limits the random write performance and <b>write</b> <b>endurance</b> of flash-based solid-state storage devices. Another type of solid-state storage devices uses volatile random-access memory (RAM) combined with a battery that allows the contents of RAM to be preserved for a limited amount of time after the device's power supply is interrupted. As an advantage, RAM-based solid-state storage is much faster compared to flash, and does not experience write amplification.|$|E
40|$|The phase-change {{random access}} memory (PRAM) {{technology}} is fast maturing to production levels. Main advantages of PRAM are non-volatility, byte addressability, in-place programmability, low-power operation, and higher <b>write</b> <b>endurance</b> than that of current flash memories. However, the relatively low write bandwidth and the less-than-desirable <b>write</b> <b>endurance</b> of PRAM remain room for improvement. This paper proposes and evaluates Flip-N-Write, a simple microarchitectural technique to replace a PRAM write operation with a more efficient read-modify-write operation. On a write, after quick bit-by-bit inspection of the original data word and the new data word, Flip-N-Write writes either the new data word or the “flipped ” value of it. Flip-N-Write introduces a single bit associated with each PRAM word to indicate whether the PRAM word has been flipped or not. We analytically and experimentally show that the proposed technique reduces the PRAM write time by half, more than doubles the <b>write</b> <b>endurance,</b> and achieves commensurate savings in write energy under the same instantaneous write power constraint.

5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced <b>write</b> amplification, increased <b>endurance,</b> and increased performance.|$|R
