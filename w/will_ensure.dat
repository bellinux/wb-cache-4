5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that given its proportion of the waste stream and the lack of distinct collections, food waste is not currently being targeted appropriately. However proposals by the European Union, which would require local authorities to provide separate collection of food and garden waste, have been met with opposition; critics of the proposals argue that local authorities understand the specific needs of the areas they serve, and that they should decide waste policy. Advocates of the proposals say that it <b>will</b> <b>ensure</b> energy is not wasted in sorting biodegradable waste from other materials.|$|E

Marge confronts Homer and locks him in the pantry until he has calmed down.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant bit rate, something that <b>will</b> <b>ensure</b> a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

Danny and McGarrett hastily drive to the docks. They then proceed to assault the freighter, where they {{dispatch}} several of Hesse's guards. McGarrett confronts Hesse, and shoots him off the boat. At the end of the episode, the new team settle into their new office space, and cannot settle on a name for their new unit.|$|E

5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This <b>will</b> <b>ensure</b> sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the general surgery ward, making a poor first {{impression}} by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her superior <b>will</b> <b>ensure</b> her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states that it was just a one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the general surgery ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist <b>will</b> <b>ensure</b> that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
