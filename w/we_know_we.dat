[...] The first leg, played at Stamford Bridge ended in a draw with Guðjohnsen and Pirès scoring for their respective clubs. Arsenal were unable to take advantage of Marcel Desailly's dismissal in the second half, but Wenger felt his team were in a good position to progress: [...] "Our main aim will be to win the game at Highbury and <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> can do that." ...|$|E

Manager Gérard Houllier congratulated his players on their achievements: [...] "I must congratulate the players for what they achieved in these six months. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are not perfect and we will continue to improve.

500|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{announcement}} made {{prior to the}} start of the season was the return of the Romulans to Star Trek. They had not previously been seen on Enterprise, and Braga was well aware that they would have to carefully consider the continuity as the crew of James T. Kirk's Enterprise were the first to see a Romulan in the episode [...] "Balance of Terror". He said [...] "The continuity is airtight. Believe me. <b>We</b> <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> know...". The species were due to make their first appearance in the Star Trek timeline in the episode [...] "", which was written by former The X-Files writer John Shiban.

While in Detroit, Michigan, for a concert tour, the band was listening to [...] "Sing" [...] in their dressing room. Once they went on stage for a soundcheck, they thought of writing a song based from it. According to guitarist Jonny Buckland, [...] "We recorded some of it in a church up the road that's now a studio. In a huge room with a piano and organ going at the same time." [...] In an interview with The Sun, Martin said, [...] "The line in this song 'Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost' is what the whole record came out of because we were feeling {{down at the end of}} the last tour. That line arrived and it was, 'OK, that's how we kinda feel. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> can improve." [...] The ensuing track evolved in different versions.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season with a 2–0 home victory against {{promoted}} Birmingham City; goals from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord extended the club's winning run to fourteen matches – a new top-flight record. A late equaliser by Wiltord in their next match at West Ham United earned Arsenal a point, having trailed 2–0 in the first half. Three days later, a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion moved Arsenal {{to the top of the}} league table. Although they drew to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, having lost captain Vieira through a sending-off, a win against Manchester City meant Arsenal leapfrogged local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to first position. A 3–0 win at Charlton Athletic on 15 September 2002 pleased Wenger, who indicated after the match the league was theirs to lose: [...] "We know we can win the league. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> can be stronger. At this stage last season we were not as good as we are now." [...] Striker Kanu scored a stoppage time winner against Bolton Wanderers to win their eleventh successive home game.|$|E
500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other times this year, but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> got them tight." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> ... <b>we</b> have an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E

Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the singers [...] "have fun with the grand soap-operatics" [...] of the song adding that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] has [...] "cultural as well as musical resonance, furthering Beyonce's bilingual agenda". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is a minor letdown; Shakira's voice is too like Beyoncé's for a truly complementary tango". On April 26, 2011, Gary Trust of Billboard magazine listed [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] at the fourth position on his list of the 10 All-Female Hit Collaborations, calling it a [...] "female-bonding boy-bashing anthem". Erika Ramirez and Jason Lipshutz of the same publication ranked the song at number 22 on their list of [...] "Beyonce's 30 Biggest Billboard Hits". In 2014, Emily Exton of VH1 placed the track on her list of Shakira's best duets, calling it a [...] "sexy ode to the men <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> can't trust" [...] and praising both singers for their complementing vocal performance.|$|E
