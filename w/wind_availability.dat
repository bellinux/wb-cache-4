40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{design a}} well {{ventilated}} environment for densely populated areas {{has always been}} a challenge for urban planners. The <b>wind</b> <b>availability</b> at pedestrian level is especially crucial in hot and humid climate. Given the same <b>wind</b> <b>availability,</b> the urban microclimates within the same region of the city could be very different due to various urban morphologies. Planners could control a number of design parameters like building bulk, building alignment and site coverage to prevent wind blockage and increase the <b>wind</b> <b>availability.</b> This paper aims to provide urban design guidelines for future development in order to increase the pedestrian level <b>wind</b> <b>availability</b> in congested hot and humid urban situations based on real examples in Hong Kong. Our study focused on how different urban morphologies would affect the pedestrian level air ventilation in the city and resulted in different microclimates.

40|$|Offshore {{wind turbine}} reliability, {{one of the}} industry's biggest sources of {{uncertain}}ty, {{is the focus of}} the present paper. Specifically the impact of uncertain component failure distributions at constant failure rates has been investigated with respect to its implications for <b>wind</b> farm <b>availability.</b> A fully probabilistic offshore wind simulation model has been applied to quantify results; effects shown in this paper underline the significant impact that failure probability distributions have on asset performance evaluation. It was found that <b>wind</b> farm <b>availability</b> numbers may vary in the range up to 20 % just by changing the distributions of failure to a different pattern; in particular those scenarios in which extensive failure accumulation occurred led to significant losses in production.

30|$|A {{limitation}} of these analyses {{is that they}} do not answer the question of what exact loads respond to <b>wind</b> <b>availability.</b> Instead they assume that some portion of the load is flexible and responds to price or other signals indicating <b>wind</b> <b>availability.</b> A natural source of load flexibility is plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging. A PEV owner is typically only concerned with having energy recharged into the PEV’s battery before the next vehicle departure. Thus, there is potentially flexibility in when and the rate at which a PEV is recharged between its arrival to and subsequent departure from a charging station. Properly controlled PEV charging can, therefore, provide demand response to accommodate wind variability.|$|E
30|$|We {{find that}} the full-charging-control cases do {{schedule}} peaks in the PEV-charging profiles midday in hours  11, 14, and  15. These peaks in the PEV-charging profiles are driven by <b>wind</b> <b>availability.</b> Contrasting the PEV-charging profiles with and without perfect foresight of wind shows the impacts of imperfect wind information. For instance, the model schedules more PEV-charging load in hours  11 and  14 when using forecasts (compared to having perfect foresight), because the model anticipates less wind being available in the future. For instance, the hour- 11 forecast anticipates a total of 22.8 GWh of wind being available between hours  11 and  18 as opposed to 27.0 GWh actually being available. As such, the model schedules PEV-charging loads earlier than when it is optimal to do so with perfect information. Such an effect is also observed in hour  14. The hour- 14 wind forecast anticipates hour  14 having the peak <b>wind</b> <b>availability</b> of the afternoon. As such, a peak in the PEV-charging load is scheduled in hour  14. In reality, however, <b>wind</b> <b>availability</b> increases in hour  15 and delaying PEV charging an hour longer reduces system cost.|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong is a {{high density}} city {{both in terms of}} urban {{development}} and population. Owing to its sub-tropical monsoon climate, winds in the dense urban area are crucial to human comfort. The existing urban planning mainly considers “development density ” and neglects the healthy environment of the city. The experience of SARS in 2003 compelled the government to improve the current situation and introduce the Air Ventilation Assessment (AVA) [1]. Accordingly, {{it is important to understand}} the site <b>wind</b> <b>availability</b> so as to provide a basis for design.

However, potential for urban ventilation will be lessen for urban areas that receive low annual mean wind velocity. Mean flow around heterogeneous built form of Kuala Lumpur was analyzed numerically by using RNG k-Ɛ model as means to assess urban ventilation. Three built forms were used in present study, which are low-dense built form of Kampung Baru, medium-dense built form of Taman Keramat and high-dense built form of Pantai Dalam, and their density were characterized based on packing density of frontal area ratio. Since highly dense built form is characterized with deep street canyon, the mean flow pattern around the built form is dominated by skimming flow. Also, turbulence fluctuation was found to play important role in exchange processes to remove pollutant at UCL height as the flow turn becoming fully developed. Urban ventilation for the built form is assessed by using two ventilation indices of wind velocity ratio (VR) to evaluate the <b>wind</b> <b>availability</b> for pedestrian wind environment and normalized flow rates (Q*) to examine the wind permeability across the UCL volume. Magnitude of VR at pedestrian-level was found to decline as the packing density of the built form increases. Low magnitude of VR signified inadequate <b>wind</b> <b>availability</b> for pedestrians, especially in high-dense built form of Pantai Dalam since VR for most regions at the built form is below 0. 12. An exponential equation to predict VR that was derived from rectangular block arrays was verified to be unsuitable for built form.
