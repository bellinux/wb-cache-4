5|$|In 1981, {{around the}} time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were {{questioning}} the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outsider.|$|E
5|$|SPFC hired Andjar Asmara, {{a former}} {{journalist}} and stagewriter {{who had been}} active with The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct Djaoeh Dimata; he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name. However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acting and dialogue coach; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product. Max Tera served as assistant cinematographer on this black-and-white film.|$|E
5|$|Begley {{obtained}} approvals {{to carry}} out excavations at the site {{in collaboration with the}} University of Pennsylvania and the University of Madras; she and K.V. Raman were the directors of operation from 1989 to 1992. Steven Sidebothom of the University of Delaware, who had back ground knowledge of Roman Egypt, {{was in charge of the}} trenching at the site. Further excavations were done during six working seasons from 1989 to 1992, which led to a contradictory view that the brick structures and the wells investigated by Wheeler were of poor quality as they were founded on poor sandy foundations. The wood work was also noted to be of poor quality and the houses had no waterproofing. The excavations also lead to a view that Arikamedu's Roman trading link <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inference. The excavations have now established that the trading with Rome extended to a period beyond that assessed by Wheeler; that trading continued from the second century BCE to the seventh or eighth century CE.|$|E

For this reason, game mechanics <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engineering concept while gameplay <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> design concept.|$|R

25|$|Wood {{soon became}} {{involved}} in {{an affair with a}} wealthy woman named Henriette McCrea Metcalf (1888 – 1981), which effectively caused Barnes to end her relationship with Wood. When Wood moved to Greenwich Village in New York City in 1928, Metcalf followed. Wood continued to write and visit Barnes, to whom Wood still professed her love, and the two did occasionally have sexual encounters during that time, but Barnes refused to become involved with Wood on a regular basis. By 1932, Wood <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unofficial courtesan to Metcalf, and Metcalf supported Wood's art studies in Florence. In 1934, they moved to Sandy Hook, Connecticut. In Westport, Connecticut, Wood tried (with Metcalf's financial assistance) to run a gourmet catering business that failed. Her relationship with Metcalf was complicated by Wood continuing to seek out drinking and sexual companions of both sexes, and Wood became increasingly unfaithful.|$|E
25|$|Completing his {{compulsory}} {{military service}} as an enlisted soldier, Psichari found he enjoyed the discipline {{so much that he}} re-enlisted into the 51st Infantry Regiment in 1904, a move that outraged his friends. Rising to the rank of sergeant but growing impatient with the life of a garrison soldier in the metropolitan army, he arranged a transfer to the Troupes coloniales as an artilleryman. Psichari undertook a tour of duty in the Congo in 1907 under Lieutenant Lenfant, an officer whom he came to idolise. Returning to France in 1908, he published an account of his experiences as Terres de soleil et de sommeil (Lands of the sun and sleep). This <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> autobiography than a work of travel writing or history and some claim that the writings contain homo-erotic references. He had by now rejected thoroughly the anti-militarism of his youth and praised his army and his nation, becoming an idol of the nationalist right.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Street Gang {{were mostly}} positive. [...] Most reviewers were {{impressed}} by Davis' research and attention to detail, but some {{felt that it was}} too episodic and <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oral history than a dispassionate history of the show's history. [...] One reviewer predicted that the book would become the definitive source of Sesame Street. [...] Street Gang was made into an audio book, narrated by Caroll Spinney, the same day it was published. [...] A second edition was published later that year.|$|E
500|$|Toxic {{reactions}} {{have been}} known {{for at least a}} hundred years. Experts speculated the reaction <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> allergic one specific to the consumer, or a misidentification, rather than innate toxicity of the fungus, due to the wide range in effects seen. Some would suffer severely or perish while others exhibited no symptoms after eating similar amounts of mushrooms from the same dish. Yet others would be poisoned after eating Gyromitra esculenta for many years without ill-effects. [...] However, the fungus is now widely recognized as potentially deadly.|$|E
500|$|Overall, reviewers saw Flow {{as being}} more akin to an art piece than a game. Navarro called it an [...] "arty piece of gaming", and complimentarily said that it had the [...] "vibe of an art-school project". Leadbetter {{believed}} that it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> experiment than a traditional game, and {{described it as a}} [...] "trippy ornament". Freeman called it the PlayStation 3's [...] "first art-house title". Roper summarized Flow as [...] "not so much a game as it is an experience", and Mitchell claimed that it [...] "tries to do something entirely unique and experimental, and on that level, it succeeds".|$|E
50|$|Consumer {{neuroscience}} {{is similar}} to neuroeconomics and neuromarketing, but subtle, yet distinct differences exist between them.

Neuromarketing focuses {{on the study of}} various marketing techniques and attempts to integrate neuroscience knowledge to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of said marketing strategies. Consumer neuroscience is unique among the three because the main focus is on the consumer and how various factors affect individual preferences and purchasing behavior.|$|R
500|$|Upon {{signing with}} Arsenal, club manager Wenger likened the player to former club player Patrick Vieira. Wenger {{compared}} the two {{primarily because of}} the similarities between each player's physical appearance and positional preference. While the two are similar in appearance, Diaby has admitted that there are huge differences, stating, [...] "I think maybe I <b>am</b> <b>more</b> attack-minded, a more technical player," [...] and, [...] "Vieira <b>is</b> much <b>more</b> aggressive. He makes <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> physical impact in a game, in midfield. He is amazing. I don’t think I have this quality yet. I think I can develop in that way but he is much stronger." [...] In 2009, Wenger echoed Diaby's sentiments, stating, [...] "I believe Vieira <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passer <b>of</b> the ball. Diaby <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dribbler, <b>more</b> offensive and makes more penetrating runs. Vieira <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> constructor. They have a similar elegance and type of play but are not completely comparable".|$|R

[...] Adams stated that [...] "'I Don't Remember' is not the next single without reason—it does everything you expect a Powderfinger single to, perhaps a more appropriate 'ad' for this album." [...] Sputnikmusic contributor James Bishop described [...] "I Don't Remember" [...] as unoriginal, {{but at the same}} time said that it proved Powderfinger [...] "haven't forgotten how to write a good song".|$|E
500|$|Loves of a Blonde {{sold out}} in theaters {{throughout}} Czechoslovakia, and its extraordinary success has been attributed, at least in part, to its {{being one of the}} first eastern European films to include an extended sex scene that involved nude performers. [...] The film was the recipient of the Order of Klement Gottwald, an award that recognized exemplary works [...] "for building of socialist homeland". Forman was later to say: [...] "The award from the first communist president of the land and a legendary boozer <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> embarrassment than anything else. The only good thing about it was the fat envelope that came with the ribbon. It contained 20 000 CZK (800 EUR), nearly a year's salary".|$|E
500|$|The {{band was}} soon {{declared}} the official [...] "musical ambassadors" [...] for the year, although, according to Linnell, it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> informal arrangement.

In support of the designation, the logo for ISY is included on the back cover of the album. The band was scheduled for concerts to endorse ISY, and mentioned in promotional material from NASA, which headed the celebration in the United States. Commenting {{on the success of}} the designation of International Space Year, however, Linnell pointed out that he [...] " [...] think most people have heard that this is International Space Year".|$|E
