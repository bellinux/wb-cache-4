50|$|In words, {{to count}} the number of {{elements}} in a finite union of finite sets, first sum the cardinalities of the individual sets, then subtract the number of elements <b>which</b> <b>appear</b> in more than one set, then add back the number of elements <b>which</b> <b>appear</b> in more than two sets, then subtract the number of elements <b>which</b> <b>appear</b> in more than three sets, and so on.

5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, <b>which</b> <b>appears</b> static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E

5|$|Lady Wilkinson (1858), who {{provides}} an extensive {{discussion of the}} etymology of the various names for this plant, suggests a very different origin, namely the Old English word affodyle (that which cometh early), citing a 14th-century (but likely originally much earlier) manuscript {{in support of this}} theory, and <b>which</b> <b>appears</b> to describe a plant resembling the daffodil. Ellacombe provides further support for this from a fifteenth century English translation of Palladius that also refers to it.|$|E

5|$|NGC 2613 is {{a spiral}} galaxy of {{magnitude}} 10.5 <b>which</b> <b>appears</b> spindle-shaped {{as it is}} almost edge-on to observers on Earth. Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy which lies some 30 million light-years away. It is notable for having a black hole around a million solar masses at its centre.

5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, <b>which</b> <b>appears</b> directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
