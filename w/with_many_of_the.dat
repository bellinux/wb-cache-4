5|$|A major {{branch of}} the Tsugaru clan was founded in 1656, which was first given hatamoto rank, before being {{promoted}} to daimyo status in 1809; this became the ruling family of the Kuroishi Domain, which immediately bordered its parent family's domain.

The main Tsugaru family's funerary temple in Hirosaki was located at Chōshō-ji.

Another unusual vehicle in the Kelvin fleet was the only Leyland Lynx bought by Scottish Bus Group, which was delivered new in 1989.

5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions to determine how to best rebuild structures in the country. <b>With</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.|$|E
