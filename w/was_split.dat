30|$|Ao (1992) {{proposes that}} the {{ambiguity}} in segmentation {{can be solved}} by reference to morphophonemic alternation. For example, the plural suffix in English creates the alternation between cat-cats; therefore, [ts] ought to <b>be</b> <b>split</b> into two sounds. In contrast, the onset [ts] in Chinese {{is not based on}} morphology, and so it should not <b>be</b> <b>split.</b> There <b>are</b> questions for Ao’s proposal though. First, in German, the onset [ts] is not based on morphology, and word-final [ts] is sometimes based on morphology and sometimes not. Should all [ts] <b>be</b> <b>split</b> in German? Should initial [ts] be kept intact and final [ts] <b>be</b> <b>split?</b> Or should final [ts] <b>be</b> <b>split</b> only if there is a morphological boundary in the middle? Similarly, in Beijing Chinese, the “diminutive” suffix creates 袋-袋儿 [tai]-[taɚ] 'bag' and so [ai] ought to <b>be</b> <b>split</b> to [a+i]. However, in Chengdu Chinese, the diminutive alternation creates 袋-袋儿 [tai]-[tɚ] 'bag' instead. Should [ai] <b>be</b> <b>split</b> in Chengdu? Clearly, morphophonemic alternation alone is insufficient to solve the non-uniqueness problem.|$|R
