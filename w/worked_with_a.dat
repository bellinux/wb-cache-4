In the 1910s and 1920s, attempting to expose purported clairvoyants became one of Sadler's favorite pastimes and he regularly <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Northwestern University psychologist and Howard Thurston, then a prominent magician, while investigating psychics.

Lewis <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of guest musicians and wrote the album with boyfriend Johnathan Rice. Lewis, Rice, Jason Lader, and Dave Scher produced the album. Acid Tongue features musical styles ranging from indie rock to alternative country and Americana.|$|E

5|$|Cannibal is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Kesha, released on November 19, 2010. The EP is a follow-up companion to her debut album, Animal. Originally, the record {{was thought to}} be released as a deluxe edition of Animal, but was instead sold and released as both an EP and a deluxe edition of Animal. Kesha <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of producers and writers such as executive producer Dr. Luke, Benny Blanco, Ammo, Max Martin, Bangladesh and others. Musically, the songs on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, with some songs incorporating elements of electro and electropop in their production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders is prominent. Lyrically, the songs on Cannibal speak of ignoring judgement or hate and experiences based on love and heartbreak.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Brulé <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sports {{psychologist}} {{to address}} the mental aspect of his game, including his confidence. Near {{the end of the}} Oilers' training camp, on October 2, 2011, he was placed on waivers for the purpose of being assigned to the team's AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. While the departure of Andrew Cogliano in July 2011 made room for Brulé to move up the Oilers' depth chart at centre, the performance of Oilers rookies Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Anton Lander helped make him expendable. Regarding the move, Oilers General Manager Steve Tambellini described Brulé as having lacked consistency. Brulé cleared waivers two days later; an Edmonton Sun article suggested that he would have likely been picked up by another team if not for his $1.85 million salary.|$|E
5|$|Emotions is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It was released on September 17, 1991 by Columbia Records. The album deviated from the formula of Carey's 1990 self-titled debut album, as she had more creative control over the material she produced and recorded. Additionally, Emotions features influences {{from a range of}} genres such as gospel, R, soul and 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry infusion. On the record, Carey <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of producers and writers, including Walter Afanasieff, the only hold over from her previous effort. Additionally, Carey wrote and produced the album's material with Robert Clivillés and David Cole from C+C Music Factory and Carole King, with whom she wrote one song.|$|E

Bobcat wrote a couple of songs “Crazy Hispanic” & “Too Many Pleitos”, which both are now considered Classic Gospel Hip Hop.|$|R

5|$|For {{her next}} project, Moore {{actively}} looked for another comedy. She had {{a supporting role}} in Crazy, Stupid, Love, playing the estranged wife of Steve Carell, which was favorably reviewed and earned $142.8 million worldwide. Moore was not seen on screens again until March 2012, with a performance that received considerable praise and recognition. She starred in the HBO television film Game Change, a dramatization of Sarah Palin's 2008 campaign to become Vice President. Portraying a well-known figure was something she found challenging; in preparation, she conducted extensive research and <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dialect coach for two months. Although {{the response to the}} film was mixed, critics were highly appreciative of Moore's performance. For {{the first time in her}} career, she received a Golden Globe, a Primetime Emmy, and a SAG Award.|$|E
5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

On 21 April 2011, his son, Ivan, then 20, was kidnapped for a $4.4 million ransom. Kaspersky <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend at the FSB and Russian police to trace the ransomer's phone call. They set up a trap for the ransomers, where they rescued his son and arrested many of the kidnappers. The incident had an influence on Kaspersky's sense of personal security.

5|$|Manne's {{father and}} uncles were drummers. In his youth he admired {{many of the}} leading swing drummers of the day, {{especially}} Jo Jones and Dave Tough. Billy Gladstone, a colleague of Manne's father and the most admired percussionist on the New York theatrical scene, offered the teenage Shelly tips and encouragement. From that time, Manne rapidly developed his style in the clubs of 52nd Street in New York in the late 1930s and 1940s. His first professional job with a known big band was with the Bobby Byrne Orchestra in 1940. In those years, as he became known, he recorded with jazz stars like Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Shavers, and Don Byas. He also <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> number of musicians mainly associated with Duke Ellington, like Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Lawrence Brown, and Rex Stewart.|$|E
5|$|Marcus Lindblom is an American {{video game}} {{developer}} {{known for his}} English localization of the 1995 video game EarthBound. Lindblom spent his youth in the United States, and {{dropped out of college}} to move to Japan with his wife. After four years, he returned to college in the United States and began to work at Nintendo of America's call center. He eventually worked on Japanese-to-English game localization projects such as Wario's Woods and EarthBound. Lindblom <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> translator and a writer to accurately translate the game for a Western audience. He sought to stay true to Shigesato Itoi's script, but was given latitude to make the script as weird as he wanted, and so added in American cultural allusions. Lindblom considers the localization his highest achievement.|$|E
5|$|Mariah Carey is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Mariah Carey, {{released}} on June 12, 1990 by Columbia Records. Its music incorporates {{a range of}} contemporary genres {{with a mix of}} slow ballads and up-tempo tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. While altered and partially re-sung after being signed to Columbia, all four songs made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. Mariah Carey featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, all of whom were top record producers at the time.

5|$|Njai Dasima was {{directed}} by Bachtiar Effendi for Tan's Film, a production company owned by the Tan brothers. With this {{he became the first}} native Indonesian film director in the Indies. It starred Momo and Oesman. The story was adapted from G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima, which Tan's had already adapted in 1929 with the same name for their first release. The story was already well known in Batavia (now Jakarta), in part because it was a popular part of stage performers' repertoires. To ensure the quality of the story, Effendi <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> scenario and, later, shooting script– two items which had, until then, never been used for a domestic production.|$|E

The singer <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of producers such as Alle Benassi, Benny Benassi, Demolition Crew, Free School, Michael Malih, Indiigo, William Orbit and Martin Solveig on the album. An electronic album, MDNA lyrically explores themes such as partying, love for music, infatuation, {{as well as}} heartbreak, revenge and separation.

Upon its release, it debuted at number one in many countries worldwide, including Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
