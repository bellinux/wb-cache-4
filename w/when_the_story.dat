5|$|It {{is unclear}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> first emerged, but similar stories, {{possibly}} inspired by medieval Arthurian legends, exist {{at the nearby}} locations of Hexham and the Eildon Hills. Matthew Lewis wrote a poem, Sir Guy the Seeker, popularising the story in 1808, with subsequent versions produced by W. G. Thompson in 1821 and James Service in 1822.

5|$|Episode 232 of the anime series had a {{defamatory}} {{depiction of}} a character that referenced a specific politician, the current Minister for Government Revitalisation Renhō Murata, {{which resulted in the}} cancellation of its rerun on AT-X. Series supervisor Shinji Takamatsu explained that TV Tokyo cancelled the rerun on its own. Renhō's representative denied having objected to the episode although a report from the Mainichi Shimbun paper stated the affected party contacted TV Tokyo. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> arc the episode belonged to was completed, Takamatsu expressed doubts about the arc's release in DVD format.|$|E

5|$|Maria-sama ga Miterus story {{revolves}} around the students of the Lillian Girls' Academy and is character-driven, focusing on interactions between the characters rather than any sort of ongoing plot or goal to attain. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> begins, Yumi Fukuzawa, a first-year student at Lillian, is praying {{in front of the}} Virgin Mary statue near the school entrance when she is suddenly approached by a cold second-year student named Sachiko Ogasawara who straightens Yumi's uniform neckerchief. This seemingly simple act of kindness stays with Yumi the rest of the day, and she speaks of her meeting with Sachiko to her friends during class and lunch.|$|E
5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E
5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu reviewer Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu reviewer stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A reviewer for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> was told from their perspective.|$|E

5|$|Little Busters! story {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Riki Naoe, a young male high school student. When Riki was a child, his parents died, leaving him hopeless and depressed. He was saved by a group—three boys and a girl, all his age—who referred to themselves as the Little Busters, a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice. The leader of the group was Kyousuke Natsume who had a younger sister named Rin. The other two members were Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa, who were friends despite being rivals. They took Riki out and played together with him during his time of need, making him the fifth Little Busters member. In time, Riki enjoyed playing with them, and his grief over his parents gradually faded away. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> begins, Riki and his friends are seemingly in their second year of high school, except for Kyousuke {{who is in his}} third year. They still hang out together, and enjoy their school life.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} Clamp had some {{difficulty}} adjusting from their typical style after deciding to publish with Weekly Shōnen Magazine. Because their typical thinner lines {{did not give}} the desired impact, Ohkawa expressed the group's desire to make their lines thicker, and to use simpler layouts similar to the other stories already present in Shōnen Magazine. She stated that they used their original artistic style to attract initial readers and then slowly transitioned to a new style. Sometime around <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> arc focused on the Country of Ōto took place, their art style had gradually been changing again; at this point they were thinking of returning to their original style. They were still adjusting to a weekly schedule; many of their previous works were on a monthly schedule. Sugawara expressed concerns about the strain on the artists of concurrently doing a weekly issue of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle linked with xxxHolic, {{but in the end}} he whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The main idea was connecting these two series was to have protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and designs. However, during the ending they would be stated to share the same existence, and had to go on different paths. As Tsubasa is connected with xxxHolic, the characters' designs are also meant to be similar; Like xxxHolic, the artwork is sometimes influenced by Ukiyo-e art style which leads to the characters have longer limbs. When asked if another series influenced Tsubasa in the concept of parallel worlds, Ohkawa replied that she was not a fan of sci-fi series and pointed that all worlds shown in the series were other works from Tsubasa. At the same time, she wanted to segregate Tsubasa from previous works. She also explained that while some characters are the same, their traits and personalities were modified due to different backstories.|$|E

25|$|The Romans usually treated their {{traditional}} narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. <b>The</b> <b>stories</b> are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates {{to his or}} her responsibility to the community or Roman state.
