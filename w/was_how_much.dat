5|$|The {{concept for}} Eternal Punishment {{emerged during the}} writing for Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Halfway through writing the latter's script, Tadashi Satomi felt that the draft gave him the {{impression}} of needing an alternate point of view {{to that of the}} main hero. This concept formed the basis for Eternal Punishments plot. To foreshadow this, the team showed the main characters from Eternal Punishment through minor roles in Innocent Sin. Eternal Punishment began full development after the release of Innocent Sin. Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment both used the same game engine and structure. Kouji Okada, Innocent Sins producer, returned in the same role. When developing Eternal Punishment, the development team took what they learned from Innocent Sin and used it to improve the gameplay and the Rumor system. One of the biggest concerns when making Eternal Punishment <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the development staff wanted to include, which went well beyond their original plans.|$|E

The main issue of contention in the Constitution review process <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> power should be vested in the Kenyan Presidency. In previous drafts, those who feared a concentration {{of power in the}} president added provisions for European-style power-sharing between a ceremonial President elected via universal suffrage and an executive Prime Minister elected by Parliament. The draft presented by the Attorney General Amos Wako for the referendum retained sweeping powers for the Presidency.|$|E
25|$|Liberal {{or republican}} ideas were and would {{continue}} to be embraced by creoles outside the Mexico City elite. These came out of Bourbon reforms in Europe that were based on the Enlightenment. Attacks on the Church by liberals in Spain and elsewhere in Europe would be repeated in Mexico during the La Reforma period. Ideals of the Constitution of Cadiz would find expression in the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. An interesting fact is that this constitution would influence political thought {{on both sides of the}} Mexican political spectrum, with even Iturbide bending to it when he created the first congress of an independent Mexico. After Iturbide, there was wide general consensus, even among the landed elite, that some form of representative government was needed. The question <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> power would be in legislative hands and how much in an executive.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{producers}} kept the film factual, they debated {{how much to}} include. Details on the bureaucracy were removed. Kondracki said, [...] "It was too much information and, frankly, people were bored." [...] Another concern <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> violence against the sex-trafficking victims should be depicted in the film. Kondracki chose to bluntly portray the inhumane treatment of the young women, which she described as accurate representations of what happened. This included a graphic scene, in which Raya is raped with a lead pipe after her escape and recapture. Weisz thought the reality had been toned down, [...] "In real life there were girls doing this as young as 8 years old."

500|$|The Constructor of the Navy, Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps, devised {{an ambitious}} design that packed {{powerful}} armament and thick armor onto the small hull. He believed that future naval battles would involve fleets rather than single-ship actions, and {{so while the}} wing turrets so common in European designs were useful in the latter role for putting a maximum amount of firepower in any given direction, they were less so when operating {{as part of a}} line of battle. [...] From this, Capps theorized that the principal concern of battleships <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> shell weight they could fire per broadside. The arrangement of superfiring turrets placed on the centerline would allow the hull to be as short as possible while still having the most powerful broadside possible. A ship with its main battery placed along the center of the ship can focus the same amount of fire to port or starboard during a broadside. This is juxtaposed against wing turrets, which had significant shortcomings: their location on the left or right of a ship's superstructure led to smaller possible broadsides, and the extreme weight placed {{on the sides of the}} ships led to torsional stress and rolling inertia.|$|E
500|$|On 24 October 1942, both Aflaq and al-Bitar {{resigned}} from their teaching positions, now determined to devote themselves fully {{to the political}} struggle. In 1941 the Syrian Committee to Help Iraq was established to support the Iraqi Government led by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani against the British invasion during the Anglo–Iraqi War. Al-Arsuzi, {{the leader of the}} other Arab Ba'ath movement, was skeptical of the new committee, and opposed helping the Iraqis on the ground that they would lose anyway. In 1941 the movement began publishing documents under the name the [...] "Arab Ihya Movement". Later, in 1945, Aflaq and al-Bitar asked the French Mandate authorities to grant the movement a party license. The Arab Ba'ath movement did not become an official party until 1947, when it merged with al-Arsuzi's Arab Ba'ath Movement to found the Arab Ba'ath Party. The Arab Ba'ath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, drew supporters from al-Arsuzi's Ba'ath Movement; during the 1940s, al-Arsuzi started to seclude himself from the public eye, he developed a deep distrust of others and became, according to some of his associates, paranoid. When the two Ba'ath movements merged and established the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947, the only subject discussed <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> socialism to include; Wahib al-Ghanim and Jalal al-Sayyid from the al-Arsuzi led Ba'ath movement wanted Aflaq and al-Bitar to adopt more radical socialist policies.|$|E

500|$|On May24, 2012, NOAA {{released}} their {{forecast for}} the season, predicting a near-normal season, with nine to fifteen named storms, {{four to eight}} hurricanes, and one to three major hurricanes. NOAA based its forecast on higher wind shear, cooler temperatures in the Main Development Region of the Eastern Atlantic, and the continuance of the [...] "high activity" [...] era – known as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation warm phase – which began in 1995. Gerry Bell, lead seasonal forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, added the main uncertainty in the outlook <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> below or above the 2012 season would be, and whether {{the high end of}} the predicted range is reached dependent on whether El Niño develops or stays in its current Neutral phase. That same day, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) issued a forecast of a below-average season. They predicted 10named storms with a 70% chance that the number would be between 7 and 13. However, they do not issue forecasts on the number of hurricanes and major hurricanes. They also predicted an ACE index of 90 with a 70% chance that the index would be in the range 28 to 152. On May30, 2012, the Florida State University for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (FSU COAPS) issued its annual Atlantic hurricane season forecast. The organization predicted 13named storms, including 7hurricanes, and an ACE index of 122.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{and historians}} hold various {{opinions}} {{as to how}} deep Anne's commitment to the Reformation <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> she was perhaps only personally ambitious, and how much {{she had to do}} with Henry's defiance of papal power. There is anecdotal evidence, related to biographer George Wyatt by her former lady-in-waiting Anne Gainsford, that Anne brought to Henry's attention a heretical pamphlet, perhaps Tyndale's [...] "The Obedience of a Christian Man" [...] or one by Simon Fish called [...] "Supplication for Beggars," [...] which cried out to monarchs to rein in the evil excesses of the Catholic Church. She was sympathetic to those seeking further reformation of the Church, and actively protected scholars working on English translations of the scriptures. According to Maria Dowling, [...] "Anne tried to educate her waiting-women in scriptural piety” and is believed to have reproved her cousin, Mary Shelton, for “having 'idle poesies' written in her prayer book.” If Cavendish is to be believed, Anne's outrage at Wolsey may have personalised whatever philosophical defiance she brought with her from France. Further, the most recent edition of Ives's biography admits that Anne may very well have had a personal spiritual awakening in her youth which spurred her on, not just as catalyst but expediter for Henry's Reformation, though the process took a number of years.|$|E
500|$|Development {{began in}} 1993, {{just after the}} release of the Mega Drive version of the first game. The release date was set at November 1994, and, {{according}} to Williamson, there was pressure to meet it. Early decisions focused on vehicle physics such as heavier vehicles being slow. According to Williamson, slow vehicles were considered [...] "boring" [...] and that the team [...] "made the game for ourselves". He stated that the team wanted more variety and depth than the original, so variables such as tyre friction and wheel lock were programmed to modify the behaviours of the vehicles. These additions increased the size of the game to double that of the original, but compression techniques were used to avoid the need for high capacity storage. This also allowed the production of the J-Cart, enabling four controllers to be plugged in without extra hardware. Williamson believed that increasing the number of players would make the game more fun, and stated that the J-Cart {{played a major role in}} establishing it as a [...] "party game". David and Richard Darling came up with the idea of the J-Cart. Although not initially involved with it, Supersonic Software's team were excited on hearing about the J-Cart because they thought it had potential. Richard was also the project manager, and visited Supersonic Software's offices weekly. His primary concern <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> fun the game was. David also thought of the idea of players sharing controllers, increasing the total number of players supported to eight. Williamson said that the team were not concerned with the difficulty increasing too quickly, or having a target audience.|$|E

500|$|Three {{days after}} Frederick was {{confirmed}} to {{be suffering from}} cancer, his father Kaiser William I died aged 90 at 8:22 a.m. on 9 March 1888, upon which Frederick became German Emperor and King of Prussia. His son Wilhelm, now Crown Prince, telegraphed the news to his father in Italy. Later the same day, Frederick wrote in his diary that he had received the telegram upon returning from a walk, [...] "...and so I have ascended the throne of my forefathers and of the German Kaiser! God help me fulfill my duties conscientiously and for the weal of my Fatherland, in both the narrower and the wider sense." [...] Germany's progressive elements hoped that William's death, and thus Frederick's succession, would usher the country into a new era governed along liberal lines. Logically, Frederick should have taken as his regnal name either Frederick I (if the Bismarckian empire was considered a new entity) or Frederick IV (if it was considered {{a continuation of the}} old Holy Roman Empire, which had had three emperors named Frederick); he himself preferred the latter. However, on the advice of Bismarck that this would create legal problems, he opted to simply keep the same regnal name he had as king of Prussia. The new Kaiser reached Berlin at 11 p.m. on the night of 11 March; those who saw him were horrified by his [...] "pitiful" [...] appearance. The question now <b>was</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> longer the mortally ill emperor could be expected to live, and what, if anything, he could hope to achieve. In spite of his illness, Frederick did his best to fulfill his obligations as Emperor. Immediately after the announcement of his accession, he took the ribbon and star of his Order of the Black Eagle from his jacket and pinned it on the dress of his wife; he was determined to honor her position as Empress. Too ill to march in his father's funeral procession, he was represented by Wilhelm, the new Crown Prince, while he watched, weeping, from his rooms in the Charlottenburg Palace.|$|E
