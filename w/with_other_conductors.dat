50|$|The Vienna Philharmonic {{has never}} had {{principal}} conductors. Each year they chose an artist to conduct all concerts of the respective season at Vienna's Musikverein. These conductors were called Abonnementdirigenten (subscription conductors) as they were to conduct all the concerts included in the Philharmonic's subscription at the Musikverein.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) and graphene {{are potential}} candidates for future interconnect materials. CNTs are promising on-chip via interconnect materials {{due to their}} readily formed vertical structures, their current-carrying capacity, which is much larger than existing on-chip interconnect materials such as copper and tungsten, and their demonstrated ability to grow in patterned vias with sub- 50 nm widths; meanwhile, graphene is suitable for horizontal interconnects. However, they both present the challenge of having high-resistance contacts <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>conductors.</b> An all-carbon structure is proposed in this paper, which can be formed using the same chemical vapor deposition method for both CNTs and graphene. Vertically aligned CNTs are grown directly on graphene with an Fe or Ni catalyst. The structural characteristics of the graphene and the grown CNTs are analyzed using Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy techniques. The CNT-graphene interface is studied in detail using transmission electron microscopic analysis of the CNT-graphene heterostructure, which suggests C-C bonding between the two materials. Electrical measurement results confirm the existence of both a lateral conduction path within graphene and a vertical conduction path in the CNT-graphene heterostructure, giving further support to the C-C bonding at the CNT-graphene interface and resulting in potential applications for all-carbon interconnects.

40|$|Disasters to {{transmission}} lines due to wet snow events motivate researchers {{to carry out}} advanced dynamic analysis {{in order to understand}} and predict the line transient response to complex dynamic loads. The interest of numerical modeling of the effects of snow shedding phenomena is to check whether the amplitude of the induced motion is within the design limits of electrical clearances with the ground or <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>conductors.</b> This paper aims to develop a numerical model to consider wet snow adhesion on transmission line cables, and consequently, to predict snow shedding from cables due to dynamic effects. The finite element analysis software ADINA is used to simulate the nonlinear dynamic response of a snow-covered cable to the application of periodic loads and subsequent effects of snow shedding. Comparison of model results and small scale experimental simulations is used to validate the model. The model predicts cable rebound height following the application of different periodic loads as well as different snow shedding scenarios. It is found that for highest adhesion, snow sheds only at high excitation frequencies, whereas the inverse occurs for low adhesion. Cohesion force between the snow particles is greater than its adhesion strength to the cable. For large snow thickness, it is rather difficult to obtain snow shedding comparing to the small thickness...|$|E

30|$|Recently, {{graphene}} {{becomes a}} novel kind of two-dimensional (2 D) carbon allotrope {{with a unique}} band structure, which shows outstanding thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties [16]. Besides, {{it is well known}} that graphene has high transmittance and high electron mobility [15, 16]. There have been efforts to utilize the outstanding properties of graphene for transparent electrodes [17]. Synthesis or deriving process of graphene is one of the most important issues in electrode fabrication. Several methods have been reported [18]. Currently, graphene films prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method have been recognized as the most promising materials for flexible transparent electrode. However, owing to the high resistance value of graphene films, the stacked multilayer graphene films are required for electrodes, which are fabricated by complicated multiple growth and transfer processes [15]. Combining graphene <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>conductor</b> to achieve transparent flexible electrodes is an effective way, owning to its outstanding electrical and optical properties [19]. Previous works of combining CVD-grown graphene with metal microstructure has been done. For instance, the combination of Ag nanowires and graphene for use as flexible transparent electrodes has been reported [20]. While the difficulty of precisely controlling Ag nanowire distribution on film limits the further development. The above studies show that hybrid electrodes not only reduce resistance but also improve flexibility effectively. Moreover, transparent conductive oxide films are widely used in electrodes, such as ITO and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO). The rigidity of these materials could be enhanced by the introduction of graphene with excellent mechanical properties. However, to our knowledge, the properties of these hybrid electrodes have not been systematically researched.|$|R
