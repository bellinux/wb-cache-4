5|$|The Checkers {{speech or}} Fund speech was an address made on September 23, 1952, by the Republican {{candidate}} {{for vice president}} of the United States, California Senator Richard Nixon. Nixon had been accused of improprieties relating to a fund established by his backers to reimburse him for his political expenses. With his place on the Republican ticket in doubt, he flew to Los Angeles and delivered a half-hour television address in which he defended himself, attacked his opponents, and urged the audience to contact the Republican National Committee (RNC) to tell it whether he should remain on the ticket. During the speech, he stated that regardless of <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> said, he intended to keep one gift: a black-and-white dog who had been named Checkers by the Nixon children, thus giving the address its popular name.|$|E

She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people.

McCarthy clarified, [...] "Although [...] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will no doubt be noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of Kazuo Ishiguro writing The Remains of the Day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{came along}} {{late into the}} {{production}} of Fearless. Swift wrote [...] "Love Story" [...] {{about a man who}} was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him. [...] "His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care", said Swift. Swift also felt like {{it was the first time}} she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, [...] "The only people who wanted them to be together were them." [...] She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: [...] "I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it matters—it's not simple or easy but it's real'." [...] She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the [...] "Love Story"'s second refrain. All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy." [...] Instead, she chose to write a happy ending. She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved. She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself. [...] "You want a guy who doesn’t care <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> thinks, <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> says." [...] Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about. Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished.|$|E
500|$|Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network {{declined}} to post {{commentary on the}} preview announcement for the second season, claiming [...] "we assume if you loved School Rumble, you're gonna check out the sequel regardless of <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> says, so why bother reviewing it?" [...] David F. Smith from IGN gave {{the first part of}} season two a rating of 6/10, with lower scores for the Funimation extras and higher ones for the plot and story. Specifically, Smith praised the anime for never taking itself seriously, and the studio for not cutting its budget for sight gags—something he notes that other companies do. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found the second season funny and nonrepetitive, and Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network praised the second season for not conforming to the conventions of reality. She complimented it for focusing more on the other students and their relationships than on the main love triangle. Chris Beveridge claimed that, although it comes across well, the season should not be watched in a marathon sitting. He was more critical of Funimation's packaging, preferring the first season's metal locker boxart to the packing for the half-season sets.|$|E

During the photo shoot for Charmbracelet at Capri, Carey happened to listen to Def Leppard's greatest hits album [...] (1995), which contains the song, and decided to cover it. In an interview with Billboard, Carey said that the song is [...] "an example of her musical diversity". Jackson also worked on [...] "My Saving Grace", which Carey said describes her thoughts about the writing, recording and mastering process. While working in Capri, Carey's father became ill with cancer and she returned to New York {{to spend some time with}} him; he died soon after. In his memory, Carey wrote and produced the song [...] "Sunflowers for Alfred Roy". Carey said that the song represents [...] "his side of the family and is kind of hard to talk about." [...] The song proved to be [...] "very emotional" [...] for Carey, and she sang it only once in the studio. DJ Quik also produced songs for the album, but none of them were included.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way.

And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

[...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> says." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Breakout" [...] {{was written}} by Ted Bruner, in {{collaboration}} with Trey Vittetoe and Gina Schock of the Go-Go's. It was first recorded by American pop singer Katy Perry, for her second album One of the Boys (2008), though it was never included for the album and was passed on to Cyrus, on whose version Perry sings backing vocals. Like most songs on Breakout, Cyrus wrote [...] "7 Things" [...] while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour, reflecting on her numerous emotions about an ex-boyfriend. She claimed her {{use of the word}} [...] "hate" [...] demonstrated how furious she was, at the time. Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. She decided to record a cover version of Cyndi Lauper's [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] from the album She's So Unusual (1983), after speaking with Lauper at the 50th Grammy Awards. The two singers were conversing about music, when Lauper stated, [...] "Well, don't be scared of anything. People waste their lives being scared. Lasso the moon. But don't do it because someone tells you it's the right idea." [...] Cyrus believed Lauper's saying encompassed the direction she wanted to take Breakout, ergo she covered [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun". However, she desired for the cover to be completely different from other covers of [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] she heard. She described the process as [...] "almost [...] to relearn the song." [...] About the finished product, Cyrus said, [...] "When you listen to the song, it's, like, you're not even sure what it is. It's something completely new." [...] "Full Circle" [...] was co-written by Cyrus, Scott Cutler, and Anne Preven about Cyrus' relationship with Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers. [...] "It's about two people. They're always gonna come back together no matter <b>what</b> <b>anyone</b> says, the bad people that try to keep you apart", Cyrus said of the song's concept.|$|E
