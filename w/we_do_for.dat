500|$|The ways {{in which}} the plant {{variation}} resulting from human activity is named and classified remains contentious. The replacement of the expression [...] "cultivated plant" [...] with the word [...] "cultigen" [...] is not universally accepted. The debate continues concerning the notions of ranks and taxa as applied to cultigens. Is it appropriate to call the highly modified transgenic products of human artificial selection [...] "taxa" [...] in the same way <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> the products of natural selection in the wild? To overcome this difficulty the term culton (pl. culta) has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about cultigens.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|The Boston Globe's Tom Russo had varied {{reactions}} to the film. Russo pointed out that Zombie attempted to be more inventive with Halloween II, but only achieved mixed results for his efforts. Russo referred to the dream sequences of Deborah Myers and the white horse as [...] "pretentiously silly", but agreed that the scenes did help {{to break up the}} standard genre violence and {{even went so far as}} to compare the sensation created by those scenes to [...] "Tim Burton doing straight horror". In the end, Russo claimed that [...] "only the most hardcore fans" [...] would want the film series to continue. Joe Neumaier, of the Daily News, stated that Zombie has found himself with Halloween II. Neumaier describes the film as a successful [...] "'character-based' monster-flick". Zombie's use of music from the 1970s, like The Moody Blues' [...] "Nights in White Satin" [...] and 10cc's [...] "The Things <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> Love", is [...] "terrifically odd" [...] throughout the film. Neumaier also said that the imagery of Deborah Myers and the [...] "ethereal white horse" [...] were a [...] "nice visual relief" [...] from Michael's violent attacks.|$|E

As well as the title track, [...] "Solitaire", which was successfully covered by Andy Williams (UK Top 5 singles chart) and the Carpenters (US Top 20), it included two UK Top 40 singles, one of which ("Beautiful You") also charted briefly in America, Sedaka's first US chart appearance in ten years. However, the album's minor performance generated little interest in restarting Sedaka's career.|$|E

He points to the Last Judgment scene in Gospel of Matthew as proof of how God judges: what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> the poor, the hungry, the indigent, the outcast, those who suffer and are alone, Jesus regards as done to himself (25:37-40). And he points to the Beatitudes as showing what gives deep happiness, what we should strive to live up to every day: being poor in spirit and meek and humble of heart, merciful and peacemakers, hungering and thirsting for righteousness.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{departure}} of Godley and Creme, Stewart and Gouldman opted to continue as 10cc, working with drummer Paul Burgess, who had {{up to that point}} been their tour backup drummer. Their first album as a three piece band was Deceptive Bends (1977), named after a sign on the Mickleham bends on the A24 between Leatherhead and Dorking in Surrey. The album, recorded at the newly completed Strawberry South Studio in Dorking, Surrey, reached No.3 in Britain and No.31 in the US and also yielded three hit singles, [...] "The Things <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> Love" [...] (UK No.6, US No.5), [...] "Good Morning Judge" [...] (UK No.5, US No.69) and [...] "People in Love" [...] (US No.40). Stewart later said he and Gouldman felt vindicated by its success: [...] "I was out to prove also that we could write a hit album without Kevin and Lol... we did!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{she covered}} the 10cc song [...] "The Things <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> Love" [...] for the Mr. Wrong soundtrack, Behind the Eyes was {{released}} in September 1997. The album struck a much darker note, leaning more towards downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs, with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics. She called it her [...] "razor blades and Prozac" [...] album. Although [...] "Takes a Little Time" [...] was a moderate hit single, the album failed to sell like the previous two albums, which had both gone multi-platinum. Behind The Eyes was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA. The video for [...] "Takes a Little Time" [...] was a new direction for Grant; with a blue light filter, acoustic guitar, the streets and characters of New York City, and a plot, Grant was re-cast as an adult light rocker. She followed up [...] "Behind The Eyes" [...] with A Christmas To Remember, her third Christmas album, in 1999. The album was certified Gold in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Sickert's {{fascination with}} urban culture {{accounted}} for his acquisition of studios in working-class sections of London, first in Cumberland Market in the 1890s, then in Camden Town in 1905. The latter location provided {{an event that}} would secure Sickert's prominence in the realist movement in Britain. [...] On 11 September 1907, Emily Dimmock, a prostitute cheating on her partner, was murdered in her home at Agar Grove (then St Paul's Road), Camden. After sexual intercourse the man had slit her throat open while she was asleep, then left in the morning. The Camden Town murder became an ongoing source of prurient sensationalism in the press. For several years Sickert had already been painting lugubrious female nudes on beds, and continued to do so, deliberately challenging the conventional approach to life painting—"The modern flood of representations of vacuous images dignified {{by the name of}} 'the nude' represents an artistic and intellectual bankruptcy"—giving four of them, which included a male figure, the title, The Camden Town Murder, and causing a controversy which ensured attention for his work. These paintings do not show violence, however, but a sad thoughtfulness, {{explained by the fact that}} three of them were originally exhibited with completely different titles, one more appropriately being What Shall <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> <b>for</b> the Rent?, and the first in the series, Summer Afternoon.|$|E
