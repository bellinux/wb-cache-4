Cultures throughout Europe and Asia Minor saw {{the killing of a}} boar as proof of one's valor and strength. Neolithic hunter gatherers depicted reliefs of ferocious wild boars on their temple pillars at Göbekli Tepe some 11,600 years ago. Virtually all heroes in Greek mythology fight or kill a boar at one point. The demigod Herakles' third labour involves the capture of the Erymanthian Boar, Theseus slays the <b>wild</b> <b>sow</b> Phaea, and a disguised Odysseus is recognised by his handmaiden Eurycleia by the scars inflicted on him by a boar during a hunt in his youth. To the mythical Hyperboreans, the boar represented spiritual authority. Several Greek myths use the boar as a symbol of darkness, death and winter. One example {{is the story of the}} youthful Adonis, who is killed by a boar and is permitted by Zeus to depart from Hades only during the spring and summer period. This theme also occurs in Irish and Egyptian mythology, where the animal is explicitly linked to the month of October, therefore autumn. This association likely arose from aspects of the boar's actual nature. Its dark colour was linked to the night, while its solitary habits, proclivity to consume crops and nocturnal nature were associated with evil. The foundation myth of Ephesus has the city being built over the site where prince Androklos of Athens killed a boar. Boars were frequently depicted on Greek funerary monuments alongside lions, representing gallant losers who have finally met their match, as opposed to victorious hunters as lions are. The theme of the doomed, yet valorous boar warrior also occurred in Hittite culture, where it was traditional to sacrifice a boar alongside a dog and a prisoner of war after a military defeat.|$|E

6000|$|Increased {{fertility}} from domestication, {{without any}} reference to crossing, may be here briefly considered. This subject bears indirectly on two or three points connected with the modification of organic beings. As Buffon long ago remarked (16/31. Quoted by Isid. Geoffroy St. Hilaire 'Hist. Naturelle Generale' tome 3 page 476. Since this MS. has been sent to press a full discussion on the present subject has appeared in Mr. Herbert Spencer's 'Principles of Biology' volume 2 1867 page 457 et seq.), domestic animals breed oftener in the year and produce more young at a birth than wild animals of the same species; they, also, sometimes breed at an earlier age. The case would hardly have deserved further notice, had not some authors lately attempted to show that fertility increases and decreases in an inverse ratio {{with the amount of}} food. This strange doctrine has apparently arisen from individual animals when supplied with an inordinate quantity of food, and from plants of many kinds when grown on excessively rich soil, as on a dunghill, becoming sterile: but to this latter point I shall have occasion presently to return. With hardly an exception, our domesticated animals, which have been long habituated to a regular and copious supply of food, without the labour of searching for it, are more fertile than the corresponding wild animals. It is notorious how frequently cats and dogs breed, and how many young they produce at a birth. The wild rabbit is said generally to breed four times yearly, and to produce each time at most six young; the tame rabbit breeds six or seven times yearly, producing each time from four to eleven young; and Mr. Harrison Weir tells me of a case of eighteen young having been produced at a birth, all of which survived. The ferret, though generally so closely confined, is more prolific than its supposed wild prototype. The <b>wild</b> <b>sow</b> is remarkably prolific; she often breeds twice in the year, and bears from four to eight and sometimes even twelve young; but the domestic sow regularly breeds twice a year, and would breed oftener if permitted; and a sow that produces less than eight at a birth [...] "is worth little, and the sooner she is fattened for the butcher the better." [...] The amount of food affects the fertility of the same individual: thus sheep, which on mountains never produce more than one lamb at a birth, when brought down to lowland pastures frequently bear twins. This difference apparently is not due to the cold of the higher land, for sheep and other domestic animals are said to be extremely prolific in Lapland. Hard living, also, retards the period at which animals conceive; for it has been found disadvantageous in the northern islands of Scotland to allow cows to bear calves before they are four years old.

40|$|International audienceSwine Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can be {{transmitted}} from pigs to humans causing hepatitis. A high prevalence of HEV in wild boar populations is reported for several European countries, but actual data for Germany are missing. During the hunting season from October to December 2007 liver, bile and blood samples were collected from wild boars in four different German regions. The samples were tested for HEV RNA by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and anti-HEV IgG antibodies by two different ELISAs and a Line immunoassay. A seroprevalence of 29. 9 % using ELISA and 26. 2 % in the Line immunoassay was determined. The seroprevalence rate varied greatly within the analysed regions. However, qPCR analysis revealed a higher prevalence of 68. 2 % positive animals with regional differences. Surprisingly, also adult <b>wild</b> <b>sows</b> and <b>wild</b> boars were highly HEV positive by qPCR. Compared to liver and serum samples, bile samples showed {{a higher rate of}} positive qPCR results. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a 969 nt fragment within ORF 2 revealed that all isolates clustered within genotype 3 but differed in the subtype depending on the hunting spot. Isolates clustered within genotypes 3 i, 3 h, 3 f and 3 e. Within one population HEV isolates were closely related, but social groups of animals in close proximity might be infected with different subtypes. Two full-length genomes of subtypes 3 i and 3 e from two different geographic regions were generated. The wild boar is discussed as one of the main sources of human autochthonous infections in Germany...|$|R

40|$|For a few decades, {{the wild}} boars are {{established}} over large areas in southern and central Sweden.

Along with {{the growing number of}} wild boars the rate of car accident with wild boars has also increased. Here I examined the daily rests of wild boar (Sus scrofa) sows in southern Sweden, to determine the factors which the <b>wild</b> boars <b>sows</b> choose for daily rest. By determining what factors are important in this selection of daily rests, {{we may be able to}} make management measures to reduce the damage wild boars make in the agriculture landscape by attracting them to places where they do less economic damage and accidents on roads. In this study I have examined 123 daily rest positions from 14 different individual <b>wild</b> boar <b>sows</b> fitted with GPS collared in Southern Sweden, Skåne County in Christinehof, Högestad Kronovalls estate. Data was collared over the years 2004 - 2006 during the period from June 1 to September 30. My field data consists of quantifying various habitats, tree species (regeneration) at different altitudes, shrub layer, grass density, fallen trees and bush heap, soil type, light intensity and exposure. Apart from the daily rests I also have a control position per boar position, 30 m from the current daily rest to determine the differences / similarities in the factors above, for sites which were not daily rests. Based on these inputs, I used Wilcoxon signed-rank test to see if there are differences between the daily rests and the control positions. The results from these daily rests shows that <b>wild</b> boar <b>sows</b> seems to want to expose themselves as little as possible in their daily rests, requiring the protection of vegetation from 0 - 2 feet. Areas with shrubs that are 1 - 4 feet high are increase the chance that wild boars chose to put their daily rest there. Wild boars also showed and my analysis a tendency to put their daily rests by fallen trees and bush heap/logging remained after harvesting and it clearly shows that the light intensity is a depending factor for the wild boars in the choice of daily rest. This study recommend further research whether these factors can control wild boars and confine to areas which can tolerate the damage by wild board, and where they are of less economic threat...|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{selection}} affects phenotypes differently {{by natural}} selection. Domestic traits, which {{pass into the}} wild, are usually negatively selected. Yet, exceptionally, this axiom may fail to apply if genes, from the domestic animals, increase fertility in the wild. We studied a rare case of a wild boar population under the framework of Wright's interdemic selection model, which could explain gene flow between wild boar and pig, both considered as demes. We analysed the MC 1 R gene and microsatellite neutral loci in 62 pregnant wild boars as markers of hybridization, and we correlated nucleotide mutations on MC 1 R (which are common in domestic breeds) to litter size, as an evaluation of fitness in <b>wild</b> <b>sow.</b> Regardless of body size and phyletic effects, wild boar sows bearing nonsynonymous MC 1 R mutations produced larger litters.

Tennyson was naturally shy, retiring, indifferent to men, hating noise and publicity, loving to be alone with nature, like Wordsworth. Browning was sociable, delighting in applause, in society, in travel, in the noise and bustle of the big world.|$|R

60|$|Ah, {{that is a}} long story; and {{one that}} shows our forefathers (though they knew nothing about railroads or electricity) were not such simpletons as some folks think. The way {{it must have been}} done was this. Men watched the natural {{pastures}} where cattle get fat on the wild grass, as they do in the Fens, and many other parts of England. And then they saved the seeds of those fattening <b>wild</b> grasses, and <b>sowed</b> them in fresh spots. Often they made mistakes. They were careless, and got weeds among the seed--like the buttercups, which do so much harm to this pasture. Or they sowed on soil which would not suit the seed, and it died. But at last, after many failures, they have grown so careful and so clever, that you may send to certain shops, saying what sort of soil yours is, and they will send you just the seeds which will grow there, and no other; and then you have a good pasture {{for as long as you}} choose to keep it good.|$|R
