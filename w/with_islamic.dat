5|$|The {{roots of}} Shakta Tantrism are unclear, {{probably}} ancient and {{independent of the}} Vedic tradition of Hinduism. The interaction between Vedic and Tantric traditions trace back to at least the sixth century, and the surge in Tantra tradition developments during the late medieval period, states Geoffrey Samuel, were a means to confront and cope <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> invasions and political instability in and after 14th-century CE.|$|E
5|$|A {{school was}} founded in Deir Ghassaneh in 1925. Prior to the British Mandate period, boys would {{normally}} receive education in a kuttab, an elementary-type school <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> law and tradition having {{a major influence on}} the curriculum. Today, there is one elementary school (Bani Zeid Elementary School) and one secondary school (Bashir al-Barghouti Secondary School) in the town of Bani Zeid, both run by the government. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education and Higher Education, in the 2010-2011 academic year there were 26 classes occupied by 691 students, both male and female. There was 45 teaching staff. There are no kindergartens in Bani Zeid. The closest institution for higher learning is Birzeit University in the village of Bir Zeit to the southeast.|$|E

5|$|Female {{homosexual}} {{behavior may}} be present in every culture, although {{the concept of a}} lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false facial hair, but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E
5|$|For the 2004–05 {{academic}} year, Abdulmutallab {{studied at}} the San'a Institute for the Arabic Language in Sana'a, Yemen, and attended lectures at Iman University.

During those years, he {{came to the attention of}} MI5, the UK's domestic counter-intelligence and security agency, for radical links and connections <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> extremists.

5|$|On October 7, 2001, the War in Afghanistan {{began when}} U.S. and British forces {{initiated}} aerial bombing campaigns targeting Taliban and al-Qaeda camps, then later invaded Afghanistan with ground {{troops of the}} Special Forces.

Conflict in Afghanistan between the Taliban insurgency and the Afghan forces backed by NATO Resolute Support Mission is ongoing. The Philippines and Indonesia, among other nations with their own internal conflicts <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> terrorism, also increased their military readiness.|$|E

According to Carlotta Gall, a Pakistani official (to whom she later clarified {{that she did not}} speak, the information coming through a friend), told her that a senior U.S. official had told him that the United States had direct evidence that Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, but ISI, Pasha and officials in Washington all denied this.|$|E

5|$|During the 16th {{century and}} {{onset of the}} early modern period, {{military}} alliances with the Portuguese Empire were made, the Jesuit Catholic missionaries arrived, and prolonged warfare <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> foes including the Adal Sultanate and Ottoman Empire, {{as well as with}} the polytheistic Oromo people, threatened the security of the Ethiopian Empire. These contacts and conflicts inspired works of ethnography, by authors such as the monk and historian Bahrey, which were embedded into the existing historiographic tradition and encouraged a broader view in historical chronicles for Ethiopia's place in the world. The Jesuit missionaries Pedro Páez (1564–1622) and Manuel de Almeida (1580–1646) also composed a history of Ethiopia, but it remained in manuscript form among Jesuit priests of Portuguese India and was not published in the West until modern times.|$|E

5|$|During the Norman reign, several {{different}} religious communities coexisted in the Kingdom of Sicily. They were: Latin Christians (Roman Catholics), Greek-speaking Christians (Eastern Orthodox), Muslims and Jews. Although local religious practices were not interrupted, {{the fact that}} Latin Christians were in power tended to favor Latin Christianity (Roman Catholicism). Bishops of the Eastern Orthodox rite were obliged to recognize {{the claims of the}} Latin Church in Sicily, while Muslim communities were no longer ruled by local emirs. Greek-speaking Christians, Latin Christians, and Muslims interacted on a regular basis, and were involved in each other's lives, economically, linguistically, and culturally. Some intermarried. Christians living in an Arabic-speaking area might adopt Arabic or even Muslim names. In many cities, each religious community had its own administrative and judicial order. In Palermo, Muslims were allowed to publicly call for prayer in mosques, and their legal issues were settled by qadis, judges who ruled in accordance <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> law.|$|E
5|$|In early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni visited India, {{lived with}} Hindus for 16 years, {{and with their}} help {{translated}} several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali's Yogasutras. Al Biruni's translation preserved many of the core themes of Patañjali 's Yoga philosophy, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> monotheistic theology. Al Biruni's version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD. Later, in the 16th century, the hath yoga text Amritakunda was translated into Arabic and then Persian. Yoga was, however, not accepted by mainstream Sunni and Shia Islam. Minority Islamic sects such as the mystic Sufi movement, particularly in South Asia, adopted Indian yoga practises, including postures and breath control. Muhammad Ghawth, a Shattari Sufi {{and one of the}} translators of yoga text in 16th century, drew controversy for his interest in yoga and was persecuted for his Sufi beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula {{during the}} 7th and 8th centuries AD {{following}} the Hegira, or Hijra, of Muhammad in 622 AD. By 630 AD, their influence expanded across the Middle East and into western North Africa. By 711 AD, the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and controlled {{most of the}} Iberian peninsula by 720. Their mounts were of various oriental types, including the North African Barb. A few Arabian horses may have come with the Ummayads who settled in the Guadalquivir valley. Another strain of horse that came <b>with</b> <b>Islamic</b> invaders was the Turkoman horse. Muslim invaders travelled north from nowadays Spain into France, where they were defeated by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD.|$|E

The family was abangan Muslim, and Soegija's {{grandfather}} Soepa was a kyai; Soegija followed their religion. Soegija– whose name {{was derived from the}} Javanese word , meaning rich– was the fifth of nine children. The family later moved to Ngabean, Yogyakarta. There, Karijosoedarmo began to serve as a courtier at the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat to Sultan HamengkubuwonoVII, while his wife sold fish; despite this, the family was poor and sometimes had little food. Soegija was a daring child, quick to fight, skilled at football, and noted for his intellect from a young age.
