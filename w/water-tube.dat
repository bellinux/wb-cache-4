5|$|The main {{improvement}} in engine performance during the pre-dreadnought period {{came from the}} adoption of increasingly higher pressure steam from the boiler. Scotch marine boilers were superseded by more compact <b>water-tube</b> boilers, allowing higher-pressure steam to be produced with less fuel consumption. <b>Water-tube</b> boilers were also safer, with less risk of explosion, and more flexible than fire-tube types. The Belleville-type <b>water-tube</b> boiler had been introduced in the French fleet as early as 1879, but it took until 1894 for the Royal Navy to adopt it for armoured cruisers and pre-dreadnoughts; other <b>water-tube</b> boilers followed in navies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Battle of Tsushima, Kasuga was {{assigned}} to the 3rd Fleet) for the invasion and occupation of Sakhalin in July–August. On 2 September 1911, the ship escorted the ex-Russian torpedo depot ship Anegawa to Vladivostok to be returned to the Russians. At the start of 1914, Kasuga was overhauled with her boilers replaced by 12 Kampon Type 1 <b>water-tube</b> boilers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} battle, Nisshin was {{assigned}} to the 3rd Fleet for the invasion and occupation of Sakhalin in July–August. On 2 September 1911, the ship escorted the ex-Russian hospital ship Anegawa to Vladivostok to be returned to the Russians. In November 1912, a boiler exploded aboard the ship, killing 20 crewmen. At the start of 1914, she was overhauled with her boilers replaced by 12 Kampon Type 1 <b>water-tube</b> boilers.|$|E
50|$|Their larger {{locomotives}} used a {{range of}} boiler designs, but all with <b>water-tubes.</b>|$|R
25|$|His {{conclusion}} was thus that straight <b>water-tubes</b> were acceptable, and had obvious advantages for manufacture and cleaning in service.|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler {{design is}} characterised by {{its use of}} {{straight}} <b>water-tubes,</b> without downcomers. Circulation, both upwards and downwards, occurs within this same tube bank.|$|R
5|$|As {{with most}} of the Great White Fleet ships, Kentucky was modernized on her return. She was {{decommissioned}} at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 28 August 1909, and her modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of $675,000. The ship received cage masts, new <b>water-tube</b> boilers, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders. On 4 June 1912, she was recommissioned in the Second Reserve, and on 31 May 1913 she was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The Canopus-class {{ships were}} {{powered by a}} pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam {{provided}} by twenty Belleville boilers. They were the first British battleships with <b>water-tube</b> boilers, which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube boilers used in previous ships. The new boilers led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the Majestics.|$|E
5|$|Captain Imai Kanemasa assumed {{command of}} the ship on 14 June, as Tōgō was reorganizing the fleet for future operations. As the IJN was {{preparing}} to invade Sakhalin Island in early July, Kamimura's 2nd Division, now reduced to Iwate, Izumo, and Tokiwa, was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted troops that made an amphibious landing in northeastern Korea. In mid-August, the division covered the landing at Chongjin, closer to the Russian border. In 1910, Tokiwas boilers were replaced by Miyabara <b>water-tube</b> boilers and her six-inch guns were replaced by Japanese-built models. In December 1911, Iwate and Tokiwa were deployed to Port Arthur to keep order there during the Chinese Revolution.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, {{internal}} {{access to}} components {{is good for}} cleaning and maintenance. In particular, {{it is possible to}} replace individual <b>water-tubes,</b> without needing to dismantle an entire bank.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{heating surface}} is {{provided}} by <b>water-tubes</b> in this squared section. These tubes are short, straight and pass between the flat faces of the squared section in a grid pattern. There are eight layers of tubes, four banks of six each way.|$|R
50|$|Flow in {{the first}} bank is upwards as the tubes are heated, {{encouraged}} by their almost vertical position. Cooler water in the later <b>water-tubes</b> descends. Circulation is completed by the link pipes between the steam drums. Circulation is more active in the earlier, hotter circuits.|$|R
5|$|On 23 October 1908, Fuji {{hosted a}} {{dinner for the}} American Ambassador and the seniormost {{officers}} of the Great White Fleet during their circumnavigation of the world. In 1910, her cylindrical boilers were replaced by Miyabara <b>water-tube</b> boilers and her main armament was replaced by Japanese-built guns. Fuji was reclassified as a first-class coast defence ship that same year, and was used for training duties in various capacities until disarmed in 1922. She spent all of World War I based at Kure. Her hulk continued {{to be used as}} a floating barracks and training center at Yokosuka until 1945. Fuji was damaged by American carrier aircraft during their 18 July 1945 attack on Yokosuka and capsized after the end of the war. The ship was scrapped in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. <b>Water-tube</b> boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E
50|$|Sentinel's best-known flue {{design was}} the square-section, but {{at one time}} they also used a {{circular}} corrugated design, with the <b>water-tubes</b> arranged in a spiral. Manufacture of these was sub-contracted to the well-known boilermakers Galloway of Manchester. When Galloway closed in 1932, Sentinel switched back to their square pattern.|$|R
50|$|Designed by the American firm of Babcock & Wilcox, {{this type}} {{has a single}} drum, with {{feedwater}} drawn {{from the bottom of}} the drum into a header that supplies inclined <b>water-tubes.</b> The watertubes supply steam back into the top of the drum. Furnaces are located below the tubes and drum.|$|R
2500|$|To {{provide a}} lighter boiler for smaller vessels, the [...] 'Express' [...] types were developed. These used smaller <b>water-tubes</b> of around 2" [...] diameter, giving a greater ratio of heating area to volume (and weight). Most {{of these were}} of the three-drum pattern, {{particularly}} of the Du Temple and Normand designs. This gave a more vertical arrangement of the <b>water-tubes,</b> thus encouraging thermosyphon circulation in these narrow tubes. The previous problems of tube expansion were still a theoretical concern and so the tubes were either curved, or even convoluted into hairpins and S shapes, so as to increase heating area. In practice these shapes gave rise to two more practical problems: difficulty in cleaning the tubes and also difficulty in forming a reliable joint into the water drums, particularly where tubes entered the drum {{at a variety of}} angles.|$|R
5|$|The IJN {{made several}} {{changes to the}} ship as she was repaired. Her {{fighting}} top was removed and her boilers were replaced by 16 Miyabara <b>water-tube</b> boilers. She retained her main guns, but their breeches were replaced by Japanese-built ones. Her secondary armament of eight 152 mm guns in twin turrets were retained, while her four casemated 152 mm guns were replaced by six Japanese-built 15 cm/45 41st Year Type guns; her light armament was revised to ten QF 12-pounder 12 cwt and four 37mm guns. Four 18-inch above-water torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament. Her crew now numbered 668 officers and crewmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} of a similar design to other local power {{stations}} at Carville and Lemington, and was a large triple-gabled brick building. However Dunston A was built several years after the other local stations, and so because of advances in power station design, was larger {{and was able to}} produce more electricity than the others. The station was originally equipped with two turbo-alternators rated at 7.2megawatts (MW), made by AEG of Germany, and two turbo alternators rated at 6.25MW and 13.2MW, made by Brown Boveri of Switzerland, for a total generating capacity of 33.85MW. The turbo alternators were supplied with steam from 24coal burning Babcock & Wilcox marine <b>water-tube</b> boilers.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the Great White Fleet ships, Kearsarge was modernized on her return. She was {{decommissioned}} at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 4 September 1909, and the modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of US$675,000. The ship received cage masts, new <b>water-tube</b> boilers, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders. She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915, and operated along the Atlantic coast. On 17 September she left Philadelphia to land a detachment of US Marines at Veracruz, Mexico, remaining there from 28 September 1915 to 5 January 1916. She then carried the Marines to New Orleans, Louisiana, before joining the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 4 February. Until the United States joined World War I, she trained naval militia from Massachusetts and Maine. During the war she was used to train Armed Guard crews and naval engineers during cruises along the Atlantic seaboard. On 18 August 1918 Kearsarge rescued 26 survivors of the Norwegian barque Nordhav which had been sunk by , bringing them to Boston.|$|E
25|$|Yarrow {{recognised}} {{that the}} temperature of the <b>water-tubes</b> was held relatively low and was consistent amongst them, provided that they remained full of water and boiling was not allowed to occur within the tubes themselves, i.e. they would remain as drowned tubes. High temperatures and variations only arose when tubes became steam filled, which also disrupted circulation.|$|R
50|$|Fire-tube boilers {{sometimes}} have <b>water-tubes</b> as well, {{to increase the}} heating surface. A Cornish boiler may have several <b>water-tubes</b> across {{the diameter of the}} flue (this is common in steam launches). A locomotive boiler with a wide firebox may have arch tubes or thermic syphons. As firebox technology developed, it was found that placing a baffle of firebricks (heat-resistant bricks) inside the firebox to direct the flow of hot flue gasses up into the top of the firebox before it flowed into the fire tubes increased efficiency by equalizing the heat between upper and lower fire tubes. To hold these in place, a metal bracket was used, but to prevent these brackets from burning and eroding away they were built as water tubes, with cool water {{from the bottom of the}} boiler moving upwards by convection as it heated, and carrying the heat away before the metal reached its failure temperature.|$|R
50|$|Circulation in boilers {{is largely}} due to the {{thermosyphon}} effect, which is encouraged by the vertical rise of the <b>water-tubes.</b> As the simple cross-tube boiler has near-horizontal tubes, circulation is poor. To improve this, designs such as the Clarke Chapman 'Tyne' boiler used steeply angled main tubes and small vertical tubes at the sides. This improved circulation, although it made washout difficult.|$|R
5|$|Sinop {{was named}} after the Russian victory in the Battle of Sinop in 1853. She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 1 June 1887, and completed in 1889. Sinop began her trials {{in the middle of}} 1889 and she had a boiler accident the following year that killed eight and severely burned 10 more. Her machinery was upgraded between 1899 and May 1904 with 20 new Belleville <b>water-tube</b> boilers, but the ship suffered a boiler explosion in 1903 that left seven sailors badly burned. Plans for a radical reconstruction were made to be done while she was docked for replacement boilers. It involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun turrets equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the turrets in an armored citadel that used Krupp armor. However, this proved to be too expensive and was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two funnels. The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow <b>water-tube</b> boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Nikolai I {{was named}} after the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia. She was built by the Franco-Russian Works at Saint Petersburg. She was laid down on 4 August 1886, {{launched}} on 1 June 1889, and completed in July 1891, although her trials lasted until the spring of 1892. She sailed in June 1892 for New York City {{to participate in the}} celebration honoring the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Upon her departure she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and visited Toulon in October 1893 with the Russian Squadron to reinforce the Franco-Russian Alliance. She was then commanded by Captain Richard Dicker. She sailed for the Pacific Ocean during the First Sino-Japanese War and arrived at Nagasaki, Japan on 28 April 1895, before sailing for Chefoo in China. She remained in the Pacific until late 1896, when she returned to the Mediterranean Squadron and supported Russian interests during the Cretan Revolt. She returned to the Baltic in April 1898 for an extensive, multi-year, refit. Her machinery was replaced with Belleville <b>water-tube</b> boilers and vertical triple expansion steam engines. Her after superstructure was cut down one deck abaft the mainmast and most of her 47mm and 37mm revolving cannon were removed. Only two 37mm revolvers were retained and she received sixteen 47mm and two 37mm single-barreled guns in their place.|$|E
25|$|The heated <b>water-tubes</b> were a {{large number}} of small {{diameter}} tubes mounted between large drums: the water drums below and steam drums above. Fairbairn's studies had already showed the importance of tube diameter and how small diameter tubes could easily withstand far higher pressures than large diameters. The drums could withstand the pressure by virtue of their robust construction. Manholes fitted to them allowed regular internal inspection.|$|R
25|$|The Yarrow boiler {{design is}} {{characteristic}} of the three-drum boiler: two banks of straight <b>water-tubes</b> are arranged in a triangular row with a single furnace between them. A single steam drum is mounted at the top between them, with smaller water drums {{at the base of}} each bank. Circulation, both upwards and downwards, occurs within this same tube bank. The Yarrow's distinctive features were the use of straight tubes and also circulation in both directions taking place entirely within the tube bank, rather than using external downcomers.|$|R
50|$|The thimble-tube boiler {{has some}} similarities, in that its <b>water-tubes</b> are also single-ended. The simpler thimble tube {{does not have}} the inner tube of the field-tube, {{therefore}} its flow is mixed, turbulent and dependent on random boiling. For this reason, thimble tubes can only be short, so are used in large numbers, and usually horizontally as their flow is not coherent enough to benefit from a gravity gradient. Field tubes are however more complex and expensive to manufacture. Field-tube boilers therefore use fewer and longer tubes (giving the same heating area for a reduced number of tubes).|$|R
25|$|A <b>water-tube</b> boiler {{is a type}} of boiler {{in which}} water circulates in tubes heated {{externally}} by the fire. <b>Water-tube</b> boilers are used for high-pressure boilers. Fuel is burned inside the furnace, creating hot gas which heats up water in the steam-generating tubes. The <b>water-tube</b> boiler was co-invented and co-patented by George Herman Babcock and Stephen Wilcox in 1867.|$|E
25|$|The earlier Thornycroft-Marshall {{design of}} <b>water-tube</b> boiler used {{horizontal}} hairpin water-tubes fitted into sectional headers. It has little {{relation to the}} types described here.|$|E
25|$|A {{more serious}} {{modification}} {{was performed to}} L1s #2861, which was fitted with an experimental Emerson <b>water-tube</b> firebox at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's Mount Clare Shops.|$|E
5000|$|The Sentinel boiler was {{designed}} to cope with these problems, and to permit easy cleaning of the waterspace. As well as the usual blow-down cock for daily use, the entire boiler could be dismantled easily. The outer shell was in two sections, inner and outer drum, and were joined by a bolted ring joint at top and bottom. Regular servicing (depending on water conditions) was to separate the <b>water-tubes</b> in their drum from the boiler outer shell, {{so that they could}} be cleaned. Sludge dropped free on opening the shell and the short, straight tubes could easily be cleaned with brush or scraper.|$|R
50|$|The tubes {{themselves}} are seamless-drawn steel and mostly straight, with gently curved ends. The {{setting of the}} boiler is a large brick-built enclosure, but the steam drums are suspended from a separate girder framework inside this, so as to allow for expansion with heat. The tubes, and the water drums in turn, are hung from the steam drums, again to allow free expansion without straining the tube ends. Owing to their curved ends the <b>water-tubes</b> may enter the drums radially, allowing easy sealing, but this was also a feature considered, according to the fashion of the time, to be important on account of expansion.|$|R
5000|$|This type of boiler {{was used}} on {{virtually}} all steam locomotives in the horizontal [...] "locomotive" [...] form. This has a cylindrical barrel containing the fire tubes, {{but also has}} an extension at one end to house the [...] "firebox". This firebox has an open base to provide a large grate area and often extends beyond the cylindrical barrel to form a rectangular or tapered enclosure. The horizontal fire-tube boiler is also typical of marine applications, using the Scotch boiler. Vertical boilers have also been built of the multiple fire-tube type, although these are comparatively rare; most vertical boilers were either flued, or with cross <b>water-tubes.</b>|$|R
