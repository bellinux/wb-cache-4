Describing the fan following of the books, the Phoenix New Times wrote, [...] "Meyer's fandom {{is reminiscent of}} Harry Potter mania." [...] The Daily Telegraph described Twilight as the [...] "spiritual successor to Harry Potter". Rebekah Bradford of The Post and Courier stated that the series has a [...] "huge crossover appeal much like the Harry Potter books before them." [...] According to the Daily Telegraph, [...] "Stephenie Meyer, in particular, has achieved incredible success across all the English-speaking nations and Europe and many will say that her Twilight series has filled the hole left by Harry Potter." [...] Meyer has responded to such comparisons, saying, [...] "It's terribly flattering to be compared to her, but there's {{never going to be}} another J. K. Rowling; that's a phenomenon that's not gonna happen again", however noting that [...] "you can compare my fans to her fans more easily [...] I do think that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> people who are just really really enthusiastic, and will come miles to see you and be involved, and everybody really cares about our characters." ...|$|E
500|$|Nagy {{realized}} she would [...] "pass {{time in a}} different way" [...] to the novel, eliminating elements that were unnecessary and slowed down {{the story in the}} screenplay. She had [...] "great freedom" [...] developing the screenplay in England while no studio or director was attached and it was just her and the producer. Over the years, five [...] "proper" [...] drafts of the screenplay materialized. Nagy said that after all the previous collaborations on the script, [...] "working for Todd was easy and quick. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> an interest in restraint." [...] Haynes and Nagy collaborated on honing the screenplay. When Haynes came on board they had discussions about [...] "what became the framing device"; the story reminded Haynes of the 1945 classic film Brief Encounter and he proposed a framing device {{similar to that of the}} classic film, which Nagy [...] "then ran with in a certain way". [...] "He was interested in the same things, tonally, that the script was interested in – which isn't always the case", she noted. [...] "We were able to keep that restraint going". Working with Haynes, Nagy made the story more enigmatic, pruning some of the backstory in light of a significant line that Carol says to Therese early in the film: [...] "What a strange girl you are, flung out of space." [...] Nagy and Haynes were comparably determined not to make [...] "an agenda film" [...] or a [...] "look how far we've come" [...] film.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2011 Stone {{began working}} on his second solo album, Broken Brights. He told Surfing World Magazine, “ecording with Julia is cool but <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> our hands on the wheel. This was an {{opportunity}} to grab the wheel and do some burn-outs". It was released in Australia on 13 July 2012 which peaked at No.2. The title track from the album was released as the lead single in March that year as a free download on Triple J’s Home and Hosed. The second single, [...] "Bird on the Buffalo", is a metaphor for a musing relationship between lovers. and the video features the actress Isabel Lucas. According to Indie Londons Jack Foley, the third single, [...] "Wooden Chair" [...] is [...] "mesmerising in a low-key, effortlessly brilliant manner that also manages to include an intoxicating background whistle. It’s breezy and romantic without really even trying to be". It was featured in the US TV show, Private Practice, in Season 6, Episode 3 [...] "Good Grief". The fourth single, [...] "Monsters", had its video premiered on The Huffington Post.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1979, Ted and Kenneth Gärdestad had {{a fourth}} attempt at Melodifestivalen {{and this time}} they won with the song [...] "Satellit", a mid-tempo rock track whose {{arrangement}} bore resemblances to Toto's 1978 hit [...] "Hold the Line". The similarities caused speculation of plagiarism in the Swedish media and disqualification from the contest. The {{connection between the two}} songs was that the song's producer Janne Schaffer had heard four of the future Toto members, Steve Porcaro, Jeff Porcaro, David Hungate and Steve Lukather, experimenting with a guitar and bass riff during the Blue Virgin Isles sessions in Los Angeles, which eventually evolved into [...] "Hold the Line". Schaffer was inspired by what he had heard when he wrote the arrangement for [...] "Satellit", but at that point neither [...] "Hold the Line" [...] nor Toto's debut eponymous album had been released. Jeff Porcaro told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet in February 1979: [...] "No, it's not a rip-off, Ted did not steal our song. Those piano triplets and that bass and guitar line go back to the 1950s and the fact that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>have</b> happened to use variations on the same theme in our songs right now is purely coincidental." [...] Consequently, Ted represented Sweden at the Eurovision Song Contest held in Jerusalem in March 1979. After having competed four times in the pre-selections before winning and with his personal connection to ABBA, [...] hopes and expectations were high. The song scored eight points and finished seventeenth out of nineteen participating entries, making it Sweden's then-second-lowest placing in the contest. The Swedish-language single became a Top 10 hit back home in Sweden and [...] "Satellit" [...] is regarded as one of Ted's signature tunes. The English-language version of the track never charted and neither did the re-issue of Blue Virgin Isles, which included both versions, making it clear that Ted's Scandinavian audiences favoured his Swedish-language material.|$|E
