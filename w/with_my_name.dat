Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, {{but like many}} talented singers of the day, she found herself out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album Stoney End in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a major hit for Streisand.|$|E

500|$|... "Miss Alli" [...] from Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A–" [...] rating. Dan Phillips of IGN named [...] "Dwight's First Day Late" [...] as the tenth {{greatest}} prank on the show. He noted, [...] "Seeing a disheveled, unshaven Dwight run desperately towards {{the office in}} hopes of saving his perfect performance record was enough to land this prank on the list despite its lack of complexity." [...] Diane Holloway of the Austin American-Statesman wrote positively of the episode, and cited it {{as an example of}} how The Office, along <b>with</b> <b>My</b> <b>Name</b> is Earl, has [...] "restored the comedy hour to NBC". Michael Sciannamea of Huffpost TV wrote that he [...] "liked the idea of having a continuation of a storyline" [...] from [...] "The Client", but that the subplot of Dwight mistaking a Thursday for a Friday [...] "really didn't go anywhere." [...] He also noted that [...] "Dwight's behavior was over the top again", a fact which [...] "can really be disconcerting." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon named the entry the ninth best episode of the series, [...] praising the comedic confrontation between Michael and Jan, as well as being a [...] "strong Dwight episode". Furthermore, Seitz praised the cold opening, calling it [...] "a classic Jim prank".|$|E

500|$|By {{choosing}} a market as the {{location for the}} sale, the couple ensured a large audience, which made their separation a widely witnessed fact. The use of the halter was symbolic; after the sale, it was handed to the purchaser as a signal that the transaction was concluded, and in some instances, those involved would often attempt further to legitimate the sale by forcing the winning bidder to sign a contract, recognising that the seller had no further liability for his wife. In 1735, a successful wife sale in St Clements was announced by the common cryer, who wandered the streets ensuring that local traders {{were aware of the}} former husband's intention not to honour [...] "any debts she should contract". The same point was made in an advertisement placed in the Ipswich Journal in 1789: [...] "no person or persons to intrust her <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>name...</b> for she is no longer my right". Those involved in such sales sometimes attempted to legalise the transaction, as demonstrated by a bill of sale for a wife, preserved in the British Museum. The bill is contained in a petition presented to a Somerset Justice of the Peace in 1758, by a wife who about 18months earlier had been sold by her husband for £6 6s [...] "for the support of his extravagancy". The petition does not object to the sale, but complains that the husband returned three months later to demand more money from his wife and her new [...] "husband".|$|E

(laughs) I later found out that he'd sold the story idea to a producer (Sergio Martino), but, in view of our past friendship, I decided not to sue him. I just broke off all relations with him. He is indeed a very good scriptwriter though." ...|$|E
2500|$|Manchester City {{fans have}} also been characterised by their yellow {{inflatable}} bananas since the late 1980s and are often seen at Manchester City cup games; for a while, the fans of many other English clubs began to parade inflatable bananas in the crowd at matches. In 1988 when City played against West Brom, during which City fans called for the introduction of City striker [...] "Imre Banana", or Imre Varadi as his real name was. Varadi said after his career, [...] "I remember running out at Manchester City and someone threw a banana and just called me 'Imre Banana!', it didn't even rhyme <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>name.</b> The inflatable craze just swept the country {{and there was a}} banana craze." [...] Indeed, Varadi was affectionately known as 'Banana' from then on and in the 1988–89 season inflatables soon become commonplace at many English football matches. In 1989, Manchester City travelled to play Hull City with City fans bringing hundreds of inflatable bananas amongst a veritable assortment of inflatables such as a six-foot crocodile, a toucan and a spitfire.|$|E
