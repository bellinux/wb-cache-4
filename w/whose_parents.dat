5|$|Labor {{was always}} in short supply. The most common {{solution}} was indentured servitude of young whites.

The great majority became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% of the population of New York.

5|$|Michelle Cedillo v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, {{also known}} as the omnibus autism {{proceeding}} (OAP), was a court case involving the family of Michelle Cedillo, an autistic girl <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> sued the United States government because they believed that her autism was caused by her receipt of both the measles-mumps-and-rubella vaccine ({{also known as}} the MMR vaccine) and thimerosal-containing vaccines. The omnibus proceeding required the petitioners to present three test cases for each proposed mechanism by which vaccines had, according to them, caused their children's autism; Michelle was the first such case for the MMR-and-thimerosal hypothesis.|$|E

She wanted to lead a useful life independent of her parents and considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi. She continued to paint and draw, and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six designs of humanised animals to a greeting card publisher.|$|E
5|$|Scholar M. Daphne Kutzer {{points out}} that Mr. McGregor's role is larger in The Flopsy Bunnies than in the two {{previous}} rabbit books, but he inspires less fear in The Flopsy Bunnies than in Peter Rabbit because his role as fearsome antagonist is diminished when he becomes a comic foil in the book's final scenes. Nonetheless, for young readers, {{he is still a}} frightening figure because he has captured not only vulnerable sleeping bunnies but bunnies <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> have failed to adequately protect them.|$|E
5|$|The archdiocese assumed {{control of}} the orphanage in 1920, and began {{accepting}} orphans from the Juvenile Court of Cook County, most of whom came from broken homes <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which {{was at that time}} still combined with the college.|$|E

5|$|The clause's meaning {{with regard}} to a child of legal {{immigrants}} was tested in United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying on business in the United States—and <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was {{a citizen of the}} United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Scully is intrigued after a young boy with cancer, <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> don’t believe in medical treatment because it is against God’s will, recovers miraculously. What she soon discovers is that his cure is not miraculous, but scientific. Eager, if wary, to learn of the truth behind his secrets, Scully agrees to travel with the Smoking Man to get the cure to all mankind’s diseases.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe, <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> {{were both}} half Caucasian, was raised as an American Indian. His accomplishments {{occurred}} {{during a period}} of severe racial inequality in the United States. It has often been suggested that his medals were stripped because of his ethnicity.* Elfers. pg. 18 While it is difficult to prove this, the public comment at the time largely reflected this view. At the time Thorpe won his gold medals, not all Native Americans were recognized as U.S.citizens. (The U.S.government had wanted them to make concessions to adopt European-American ways to receive such recognition.) Citizenship was not granted to all American Indians until 1924.|$|E

5|$|When parents die of HIV/AIDS, {{extended}} family members usually become the children's primary caregivers: in Malawi, 44% of double orphans are adopted by grandparents or other close relatives. Extended family members often provide crucial support to HIV/AIDS orphans; however, some sources indicate that {{extended family}} members mistreat orphans <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> {{have died from}} HIV/AIDS. For example, family members {{who are unable to}} support adopted children often arrange early marriages for female orphans, who may then become victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse.|$|E
5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> could not provide them health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Rinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, {{a suburb}} of {{northern}} Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish <b>whose</b> <b>parents</b> were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.|$|E
