5|$|Although Duke Andrew {{made every}} effort to capture Queen Constance and King Ladislaus before they could escape, they were able to reach Vienna, Austria. Duke Leopold VI, who was King Emeric's and Duke Andrew's cousin, was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> shelter to King Ladislaus, {{although}} Duke Andrew threatened him with an invasion. Ladislaus abruptly died on 7 May 1205. His body was carried to Székesfehérvár, and buried in the Székesfehérvár Basilica.|$|E

5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback. Wolverton {{agreed to give}} Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, in an attempt to find a team <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a chance at a comeback. He worked out with Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.|$|E
5|$|During {{research}} on his dissertation, Arrington found a manuscript from 1946 by Feramorz Fox about Mormon communitarianism. Arrington found the manuscript fascinatingly free of Marxist thought and together with Dean L. May, revised and expanded the manuscript {{under the title}} Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation among the Mormons. Deseret Book published the book in 1976. The book was received poorly at LDS Church Headquarters; Deseret Book {{was not allowed to}} reprint the book and Church News was not permitted to review it. Fellow historians found the book well-researched but too <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Mormonism credit for modern welfare programs.|$|E
5|$|Hathaway wrote {{extensively}} about {{her relationship with}} her first husband in her 1961 autobiography. Dudley Beaumont, who served in the British army as an officer during the First World War, died on 24 November 1918 during the Spanish flu pandemic. His death left her a pregnant widow deprived of most of her income. Neither her father nor her father-in-law, the army officer William Spencer Beaumont, were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> financial support to the widow and her six surviving children. She learned German and started working for the YMCA in Cologne. She also worked for the British Army of the Rhine and raised prize cattle.|$|E

5|$|The {{couple were}} to spend {{three years in}} Jerusalem. On arrival, Manning {{approached}} the Palestine Post for a job, and was soon appointed a reviewer. Between 1943 and 1944 she served as press assistant at Jerusalem's Public Information office, and then moved to the same position at the British Council office in Jerusalem. Manning continued to work on her book about Stanley and Emin Pasha, and took advantage of army drivers who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> lifts to civilians; she visited Palestine, Petra and Damascus, gathering material for future works.|$|E
5|$|After {{the trade}} Chamberlain {{found himself on}} a {{promising}} Sixers team that included guards Hal Greer, a future Hall-of-Famer, and talented role players Larry Costello, Chet Walker and Lucious Jackson. Cherry remarks {{that there was a}} certain tension within the team: Greer was the formerly undisputed leader and was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his authority, and Jackson, a talented center, was now forced to play power forward because Chamberlain blocked the center spot; however, as the season progressed, the three began to mesh better. Chamberlain did not care for the Sixers' coach, Dolph Schayes, because Schayes, according to him, had made several disrespectful remarks when they were rival players in the NBA.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged into recession. Parliament was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> more money to railways, and the country had {{to make do with}} a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E

Now that the contestants know about the map, the Viscount decides to reveal his true intentions: the Super Big Power Crystal can grant a single wish who whoever obtains it, and the Viscount is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> a large sum of money to those who help him find it. Finding the Power Crystal is impossible without the Final Key, so the Viscount boards his plane to travel to the North Atlantic Ocean in search for the Final Key. But the plane is full, and only a select number of the contestants are able to board. Propelled to the skies by an explosive volcano, the contestants are able to board the Viscount's plane.|$|E
5|$|The Football Association bought Aker's {{share of}} the stadium during the 1930s, and in 1945 also part of Lyn's share. From 1948, the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal, and has been held there since. Other {{activities}} held during the first decades included boxing, and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40,000 people in 1955. In 1960, NFF bought more shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50.7%, while Lyn retained 44.2%. The reason was the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong tie to a single club, but the state was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation. In 1967, a new South Stand was opened, and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes toward them ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E

5|$|The {{attempts}} {{to relieve the}} citadel ended in farce. Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in fear of the Ottomans, and their {{attempts to}} re-board their boats at Solin Bay caused many vessels to sink. Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape. Kružić himself– who had left the fortress {{to make contact with}} the reinforcements- was captured and executed; the sight of his head on a stick overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Klis, who were now <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the fortress in return for safe passage north. After Kružić's death, and with a lack of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on 12 March 1537. Many of the citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the battle, the Spanish troops and local militia increased their pressure on Castellfollit's garrison. On 5 April, the Catalan miquelets, supported by five companies of dragoons and several peasants, defeated a party of French troops from Berga and Castellfollit, killing 60 soldiers and taking 200 prisoners. Noailles, then ill of rheumatism, ordered Lieutenant-general Saint-Sylvestre to assemble a supply convoy to relieve Castellfollit, which he put under an escort of 2,000 infantry and 600 cavalry. A corps of miquelets, Spanish dragoons and peasants led by Blai de Trinxeria attacked and defeated the convoy on 15 April. After that, the French garrisons of Castellfollit and Hostalric fell under an effective blockade. On 19 May, Saint-Sylvestre assembled an army of 8,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry and relieved Hostalric, but Castellfollit remained blockaded. Noailles and his second in command were not in good terms: if Saint-Sylvestre advocated for demolishing and abandoning both Hostalric and Castellfollit, Noailles was not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> ground.|$|E
5|$|The series {{premiere of}} The Playboy Club was {{initially}} broadcast on September 19, 2011 in the United States on NBC. It was watched by 5.02 million viewers, despite airing simultaneously with Hawaii Five-0 on CBS and Castle on ABC. That {{was the lowest}} viewership among the major networks in its 10 p.m. timeslot, with Castle drawing 13.28 million households and Hawaii Five-0 attaining 12.19 million households. The episode gradually shed viewers from the first half to the next, {{with an average of}} 5.36 million households tuning in for the first half-hour and an average of 4.69 million households for the second. The debut earned a 1.6 rating/4 share among viewers in the 18-49 demographic, according to the Nielson ratings, indicating it was viewed by four percent of those in the demographic who were actively watching television during the broadcast, which represented 1.6 percent of the total demographic. This was considered a disappointing result for a coveted demographic. Speculations regarding the possible cancelation of the series immediately surfaced, but NBC officials told Deadline.com that such a decision would not be rushed because NBC Chairman Bob Greenblatt wanted to send a message that the network was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> all their new shows the necessary time to find an audience and succeed. Similarly in Canada, the pilot episode was viewed by 485,000 viewers.|$|E
