5|$|The game {{features}} a changing weather system, which will vary from every hour and will provide obstructions for various forces and installations. For example, fog will close runways whereas storms will temporarily disrupt bombing runs and dogfights. Over time, RAF squadrons <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of ammunition or fuel, and thus must replenish {{at the nearest}} RAF station, which will render them vulnerable to a Luftwaffe bombing run. In between turns, the player {{has the opportunity to}} request reinforcements from RAF reserves, however the longer the campaign progresses, the quality of the reserves will diminish.|$|E
5|$|When {{the main}} attacking Japanese force has been located, the player must send all {{available}} air units to engage them in combat. Air combat takes place over real time, and may {{take up to}} a minute of travel time once launched from an aircraft carrier.

The game contains elements of arcade gameplay, which will automatically enable once the player comes {{into contact with the}} enemy. The arcade sequences involves the player utilising an anti-air machine gun in order to shoot down Japanese aircraft. The game ends once all four Japanese aircraft carriers have been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} {{to build the}} infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles {{is illustrated by the}} decision of Car2Go in San Diego, California, that due to insufficient charging infrastructure decided to replace all of its all-electric car fleet with gasoline-powered cars starting on 1 May 2016. When the carsharing service started in 2011, Car2Go expected 1,000 charging stations to be deployed around the city, but only 400 were in place by early 2016. As a result, an average of 20% of the carsharing fleet is unavailable at any given time because the cars are either being charged or because they don’t have enough electricity in them to be driven. Also, many of the company’s 40,000 San Diego members say they often worry their Car2Go <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> of charge before they finish their trip.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the late 2000s global economic crisis, Russia's state budget went into deficit {{for the first time in}} years. Kudrin has said that the projected budget deficit is to total 3.6% in 2011, 3.1% in 2012 and 2.9% in 2013. The deficit will be covered primarily through expanded market borrowing. Russia conducted its first international debt sale since 1998 in April 2010, raising $5.5bn on the international markets. According to Kudrin, the government's aim is to attain a deficit-free budget by 2015, based on projected $75–78 oil prices per barrel. Kudrin has said that the Reserve Fund, accumulated before the crisis, <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> in 2011. Consequently, Kudrin warned that Russia will soon have to adjust to being a country, just [...] "like everyone else" [...] and called for a more effective use of state funds.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{possibility}} of having a [...] "retirement" [...] became real as people lived longer, and believed the elderly {{should not have to}} work or rely on charity until they died. The law maintain an income in retirement in three ways (1) through public social security created by the Social Security Act of 1935, (2) occupational pensions managed through the employment relationship, and (3) private pensions or life insurance that individuals buy themselves. At work, most occupational pension schemes originally resulted from collective bargaining during the 1920s and 1930s. Unions usually bargained to have employers across a sector to pool funds, so that employees could keep their pensions if they moved jobs. Multi-employer retirement plans, set up by collective agreement became known as [...] "Taft-Hartley plans" [...] after the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 required joint management of funds by employees and employers. Many employers also voluntarily choose to provide pensions. For example, the pension for professors, now called TIAA, was established on the initiative of Andrew Carnegie in 1918 with express requirement for participants to have voting rights for the plan trustees. These could be collective and defined benefit schemes: a percentage of one's income (e.g. 67%) is replaced for retirement, however long the person lives. But more recently more employers have only provided individual [...] "401(k)" [...] plans. These are named after the Internal Revenue Code §401(k), which allows employers and employees to pay no tax on money that is saved in the fund, until an employee retires. The same tax deferral rule applies to all pensions. But unlike a [...] "defined benefit" [...] plan, a 401(k) only contains whatever the employer and employee contribute. It <b>will</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> if a person lives too long, meaning the retiree may only have to rely only on minimum social security. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 §902 codified a model for employers to automatically enroll their employees in a pension, with a right to opt out. There is no right to an occupational pension, but the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 does create a series of rights for employees if one is set up. It also applies to health care or any other [...] "employee benefit" [...] plan.|$|E
