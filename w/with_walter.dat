When the Emperor in January 1194 called a meeting of the imperial magnates to debate King Philip II of France's offer to pay the Emperor to keep Richard captive, Longchamp attended along <b>with</b> <b>Walter</b> of Coutances and Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother.

5|$|Daydream is {{the fifth}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey, released on October 3, 1995, by Columbia Records. The follow-up to her internationally successful album Music Box (1993) and holiday album Merry Christmas (1994), Daydream differed from the two by leaning increasingly towards hip hop and urban music. Throughout the project, Carey collaborated <b>with</b> <b>Walter</b> Afanasieff, with whom she wrote and produced most of her two previous albums. With Daydream, Carey took {{more control over the}} musical direction as well as the album's composition. Carey said she considered Daydream the beginning of her musical and vocal transformation, a change that became more apparent in her sixth album Butterfly (1997). During the album's production, Carey endured many creative differences with her label and husband Tommy Mottola.|$|E
5|$|Reginald {{was elected}} Bishop of Bath in late April 1173, and was consecrated 23 June 1174. However, Henry the Young King {{challenged}} the election, {{on the grounds}} of illegitimacy and an uncanonical election. Reginald went to Rome in the company of Richard of Dover, who had just been elected Archbishop of Canterbury and was facing a challenge from the Young King to his election. Reginald was confirmed by Pope Alexander III on 18 April 1174 <b>with</b> <b>Walter</b> Map alleging bribery as the only reason the election was confirmed. Ralph de Diceto, however, states that Reginald swore an oath that he was uninvolved in the death of Becket and that his birth took place before his father became a priest. During the dispute, Reginald's friend Peter of Blois wrote him a letter, which is still extant, encouraging him to persevere.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais {{managed the}} king's case against Anselm at Rockingham in 1095, when Anselm wished {{to go to}} receive his pallium from Pope Urban II. At that time St-Calais opposed Anselm's attempt to appeal to Rome over the issue, and steadfastly {{maintained}} the king's position against Anselm, even advocating that the archbishop be deprived of his lands and sent into exile. Later, when the king was negotiating <b>with</b> <b>Walter</b> of Albano, the papal legate sent by Urban to convey the pallium to Anselm and to secure the king's recognition of Urban as pope, St-Calais was the king's chief negotiator. The clerical reformers, Eadmer among them, who supported Anselm in these quarrels, later tried to claim that St-Calais had supported the king out {{of a desire to}} succeed Anselm as archbishop if Anselm was deposed, but it is unlikely that St-Calais seriously believed that Anselm would be deposed. St-Calais secured grants from the king in return for his services. His efforts on behalf of the king earned him hostile accounts in Eadmer's later writings.|$|E

50|$|<b>With</b> <b>Walters</b> {{entering}} {{into the final}} year of his contract, Stoke rejected a bid from Norwich City {{at the start of the}} 2015-16 season. Walters vented his frustration with contract talks claiming the club were undervaluing him. This led to him handing in a transfer request but despite this he failed to secure a move away from the club. Walters then scored in back-to-back matches against Leicester City and Bournemouth. Chief executive Tony Scholes stated that he hoped the club could reach a 'compromise' <b>with</b> <b>Walters</b> over his contract. His contract dispute was resolved and he signed a new two-and-a-half-year deal with Stoke on 7 November 2015. Walters played 33 times in 2015-16, scoring eight goals as the Potters again finished in ninth position.|$|R
