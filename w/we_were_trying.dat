These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally {{the luck of the}} draw whether that person is into us or not. It just seems wildly unfair, I think.|$|E
25|$|B {{were very}} strong characters, {{with a very}} {{specific}} type of humor and very loyal fans, {{and of course they}} were instantly identifiable. I felt that referencing them in Daria, while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to establish the new characters and the different type of humor, ran the risk of setting up false expectations and disappointment in the viewers – which could lead to a negative reaction to the new show and its different tone. So we steered clear of B in the early going, and once the new show was established, there was really no need to harken back to the old one.|$|E

According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we felt like he was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E

The album {{was released}} by Harvest in the UK, while in the US it was issued by Capitol Records. It sold 6,000 copies {{in the first few}} months and reached number 40 in the UK and was fairly well-reviewed by music critics. Upon release, Gilmour said: [...] "Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to show what Syd was really like. But perhaps <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to punish him..." [...] While Barrett admitted that [...] "I don't think it would stand as my last statement", Waters was more optimistic, declaring Barrett a [...] "genius".

40|$|In {{this thesis}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to {{discover}} a method {{that allows us to}} attribute a painting to a particular artist with the help of image analysis. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> testing two methods. In the first one, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to identify the style of a painter by analysing the way in which he translates a human face from a photograph into a painting. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> testing whether the differences on facial proportions in photographs and paintings are statistically significant. With the other method, we describe every painting with a set of features. The features look at the image color, texture and dimensions to form a feature vector. We test this on 10 pictures for each of the 3 painters with different styles. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>trying</b> to test, whether we can correctly attribute these paintings to a painter just with these feature vectors. ...|$|R

500|$|The {{praise for}} the album {{overwhelmed}} the band; Greenwood felt the praise had been exaggerated because The Bends had been [...] "under-reviewed possibly and under-received." [...] They rejected links to progressive rock and art rock, despite frequent comparisons made to Pink Floyd's 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon. Yorke responded: [...] "We write pop songs... there was no intention of it being 'art'. It's a reflection of all the disparate things we were listening to when we recorded it." [...] He was nevertheless pleased that listeners identified the album's influences: [...] "What really blew my head off {{was the fact that}} people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to create." ...|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{recording}} Spiritual Machines, percussionist Jeremy Taggart suffered a serious ankle injury during a mugging while walking his dog. While he recovered, Taggart's friend Matt Cameron, former drummer for Soundgarden and current drummer for Pearl Jam, filled in for Taggart on the tracks [...] "Right Behind You (Mafia)" [...] and [...] "Are You Sad?", which Taggart had already written the drum parts for. When the final tracks were ready for mixing, the band shopped around before finding a producer they wanted. The album was mixed in Atlanta, Georgia by Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam's long time producer.

Athletic {{director}} Deborah Yow wanted to play one of the University of Maryland's five academic peer institutions, and to take a two-year hiatus from the 28-year series against West Virginia. She said, by adding California, [...] "We weren't trying to add to the degree of difficulty <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to substitute for West Virginia."

500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I {{think we did}} a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>trying</b> to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on.
