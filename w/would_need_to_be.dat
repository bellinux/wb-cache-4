5|$|However, Larson's {{streak of}} hitting his marks every time {{stretched}} {{the length of}} the episode well past the usual thirty minutes and the producers were unsure how to proceed.

5|$|In autumn 2001, CalPERS and Enron's {{arrangement}} was discovered, which required the discontinuation of Enron's prior accounting method for Chewco and JEDI. This disqualification revealed that Enron's reported earnings from 1997 to mid-2001 <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reduced by $405 million {{and that the}} company's indebtedness would increase by $628 million.|$|E

5|$|On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations}} in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that they <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer. Both were designed by Sydney Smirke, who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding {{the branch}} to Abertillery, {{to replace the}} shuttle bus service, has been planned. The {{proposal}} for a new station and track (which <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> re-laid for miles (3km) between Aberbeeg and Abertillery), {{is not included in}} the Welsh Assembly Government's National Transport Plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclave}} remained deadlocked {{until the}} electors were informed of Charles II's death in November. The electors present understood that with Charles' death, the next pope <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> politically impartial, so {{a member of}} the zelanti was preferred. Giovanni Albani, who had drafted the bull outlawing nepotism, soon became the leading candidate for the papacy.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Australia's {{military}} forces were focused upon the militia and what Regular forces existed were mostly serving in the artillery or engineers and were assigned in most part to the task of coastal defence. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903, which precluded sending conscripts overseas, upon the outbreak of war it was realised that a totally separate, all volunteer force <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).|$|E
5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E

5|$|In July 2016, the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan {{announced}} the South Circular would {{become part of}} the London Ultra-Low Emission Zone boundary in 2020, meaning a daily charge of £12.50 for cars/vans/motorcycles and £100 for coaches/HGVs/buses, <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid by vehicles not meeting key exhaust emission standards. The boundary had originally been proposed by Johnson the previous year, but covering a narrower area.|$|E
5|$|Neither U-10 {{nor any of}} {{her sister}} boats were {{complete}} when World War I began in August 1914. With the boats under construction at Kiel, the Austrians became convinced {{that it would be}} impossible to take delivery of the boats, which <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> towed into the Mediterranean past Gibraltar, a British territory. As a result, U-10 and her four sisters were sold to the Imperial German Navy on 28 November 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to run up to four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E

5|$|The Thin Man gun-type {{design was}} at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the Hanford production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 obtained was found to have a high rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|E
5|$|The {{calculations}} given above produce {{dates in}} radiocarbon years: i.e. dates {{that represent the}} age the sample {{would be if the}} / ratio had been constant historically. Although Libby had pointed out as early as 1955 the possibility that this assumption was incorrect, it was not until discrepancies began to accumulate between measured ages and known historical dates for artefacts that it became clear that a correction <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> applied to radiocarbon ages to obtain calendar dates.|$|E
5|$|The line winds {{south from}} Llanhilleth for miles (4.5km), past {{the village of}} Crumlin, to the next station at Newbridge, at {{the eastern end of}} Newbridge town centre.

To enable the additional service between Ebbw Vale and Newport to begin dual track <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> laid and second platforms constructed at Llanhilleth and Newbridge stations, allowing trains to pass each other.|$|E
50|$|Currently, college {{football}} bowl games are played from mid-December to early January. As {{the number of}} bowl games has increased, the number of games a team <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> win <b>to</b> <b>be</b> invited <b>to</b> a bowl game has decreased.

5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted that serious demolition work would be required and a number of roads <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> closed.|$|E
5|$|Although Jupiter <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about 75 {{times as}} massive to fuse {{hydrogen}} {{and become a}} star, the smallest red dwarf is only about 30 percent larger in radius than Jupiter. Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it {{is similar to the}} total solar radiation it receives. This additional heat is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism through contraction. This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 2cm each year. When it was first formed, Jupiter was much hotter and was about twice its current diameter.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope <b>would</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
