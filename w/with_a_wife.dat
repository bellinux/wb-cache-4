5|$|Christopher Tärnström, {{the first}} apostle and a 43-year-old pastor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China. Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a {{tropical}} fever on Côn Sơn Island the same year. Tärnström's widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling.|$|E
5|$|Fauxlivia (Anna Torv), still {{posing as}} the prime universe's Olivia (Torv), informs Newton of this development. Newton {{contacts}} a second shapeshifter, Ray (Marcus Giamatti), to infiltrate the secured location where Van Horn's body is being held to remove the data disc that Walter will ultimately find. Ray regrets the possibility of having to leave his current identity, a police officer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and son. Meanwhile, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Fauxlivia discover that Van Horn has acquired a number of records on the personnel of the Fringe team, and likely has used the information to aid the parallel universe's Walternate (Noble).|$|E
5|$|He {{spent some}} {{of his time in}} Missouri visiting Dent's family and became engaged to Dent's sister, Julia, in 1844. Four years later on August 22, 1848, they were married at Julia's home in St. Louis. Grant's {{abolitionist}} father Jesse, who disapproved of the Dents owning slaves, refused to attend their wedding, which took place without either of Grant's parents. Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates, all dressed in their blue uniforms, including Longstreet, Julia's cousin. At the end of the month, Julia was nevertheless warmly received by Grant's family in Bethel, Ohio. They had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr. ("Buck"), Ellen ("Nellie"), and Jesse. After the wedding, Grant obtained a two-month extension to his leave and returned to St. Louis when he decided, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> to support, that he would remain in the army.|$|E

5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E

After two weeks of starvation, Kolbe and three other inmates remained alive; they were then executed with injections of phenol.|$|E

There was some evidence of neglect, humiliation, and abuse but the court concluded that this was exaggerated. On appeal, the court was very conscious of the Samoan culture in New Zealand in restricting {{the power of the}} wife to act independently of her husband and reduced her sentence for manslaughter to five years.|$|E
25|$|On a {{business}} trip to his hometown, Tetsuji reminisces on a childhood incident involving Kazuya Ikeuchi, an effeminate boy who liked to cross-dress. Ikeuchi lived in a household with four sisters, {{and because he was}} the only male after his father's death, his family would pressure him to succeed. After Ikeuchi didn't go to school for three days, Tetsuji visited him and found him dressed as a woman. Later that day a fire erupted in Ikeuchi's house and killed his mother. While waiting for the bus, Tetsuji spots Ikeuchi <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and child.|$|E
25|$|Holbein had deftly {{survived the}} {{downfall}} of his first two great patrons, Thomas More and Anne Boleyn, but Cromwell's sudden arrest and execution on trumped-up charges of heresy and treason in 1540 undoubtedly damaged his career. Though Holbein retained his position as King's Painter, Cromwell's death left a gap no other patron could fill. It was, ironically, Holbein's portrait of Anne of Cleves which largely led to Cromwell's downfall: furious at being saddled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> he found entirely unattractive, the King directed all his anger at Cromwell, whereas {{there is no evidence}} that he blamed Holbein for supposedly flattering Anne's looks.|$|E

Lydia arrived penniless in Seattle to testify on Maynard's behalf; he and Catherine let her stay in their mansion on friendly terms. As Bill Speidel has written, Maynard was seen strolling around town, the only man in Seattle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> on either arm.|$|E
25|$|Farah has a twin brother, Hassan, {{who lives}} in Somalia. They were {{separated}} at eight years old, when Mo, his two younger brothers, and his mother joined their father {{who had been working}} and studying in the UK; however, Hassan was unwell and unable to travel, so stayed behind with family in Djibouti. When Farah's father returned to collect Hassan, the family he was living with had moved and couldn't be found. Farah and his twin ended up being separated for twelve years. Hassan is now a telecoms engineer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> and five children. Farah has a third younger brother who was also born after the family's move to London.|$|E
25|$|In 464, Remismund, an {{ambassador}} who had travelled between Galicia and Gaul on several occasions, became King. Remismund {{was able to}} unite the factions of Suevi under his rule, {{and at the same}} time restore peace. He was also recognized, perhaps even approved of, by Theodoric, who sent him gifts and weapons along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife.</b> Under the leadership of Remismund, the Suevi would again raid the nearby countries, plundering the lands of Lusitania and the Conventus Asturicense, whilst still fighting Galician tribes like the Aunonenses, who refused to submit to Remismund. In 468 they managed to destroy part of the walls of Conimbriga, in Lusitania, which was sacked and then mostly abandoned after the inhabitants fled or were taken back to the north as slaves. Next year they even managed to capture Lisbon, which was surrendered by its leader, Lusidio. He later became ambassador of the Suevi to the Emperor. The end of the chronicle of Hydatius in 468 doesn't let us know the later fate of Remismund.|$|E

25|$|In {{trouble because}} {{he lacked the}} means to live decently, and because his lack of a {{university}} degree meant he could not become a lawyer or a professor, Rosetti sought a professional job relatively safe from the vicissitudes of politics. At the time, the Foreign Affairs Ministry formed one such oasis. He applied there, and in April 1898, when Sturdza was both Prime and Foreign Minister, he was hired as the archivist's assistant, again helped by Bianu. His other supporter was Gheorghe Văsescu, {{a friend of the}} PNL factional leader Ion I. C. Brătianu. Although this new job was low in the ministerial hierarchy, his fluent knowledge of several languages (itself a precondition for working in the ministry) and his penchant for historical exegesis helped Rosetti advance. Nevertheless, the promotions came with a humiliating slowness and, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wife,</b> three sons and a daughter to support, he found the salary insufficient. Although the Conservatives returned to power in 1899, their new leader was Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino—Rosetti's patron, Catargiu, died suddenly the same year, leaving him virtually without friends in the party.|$|E
