We propose formulating the L 1 regularized linear fixed point problem as a linear complementarity problem (LCP). This formulation offers several advantages over the LARS-inspired formulation, LARS-TD. The LCP formulation allows the use of efficient off-theshelf solvers, leads to a new uniqueness result, and can be initialized with starting points from similar problems (<b>warm</b> <b>starts).</b> We demonstrate that <b>warm</b> <b>starts,</b> {{as well as the}} efficiency of LCP solvers, can speed up policy iteration.

We analyze the computational speed of iterative reconstruction algorithms for such large systems. We compare a total of 15 different scalable methods, including multigrid, preconditioned conjugate-gradient, and several new variants of these. Simulations on a 128 × 128 square sensor/actuator geometry using Taylor frozen-flow dynamics are carried out using both open-loop and closed-loop measurements, and algorithms are compared on a basis of the mean squared error and floating-point multiplications required. We also investigate the use of <b>warm</b> <b>starting,</b> where the most recent estimate is used to initialize the iterative scheme. In open-loop estimation or pseudo-open-loop control, <b>warm</b> <b>starting</b> provides a significant computational speedup; almost every algorithm tested converges in one iteration.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{an enhanced}} transportation planning framework by augmenting the sequential four-step planning process with post-processing techniques. The post-processing techniques are incorporated through a feedback mechanism and aim {{to improve the}} stability and convergence properties of the solution, thereby improving {{the reliability of the}} planning process. There are three building blocks of the proposed post-processing module: slope-based multi-path algorithm or SMPA, perturbation assignment, and O-D prioritization technique. SMPA is {{the most important part of}} the module and it can be used as both a post-processing algorithm and an independent static traffic assignment algorithm. In addition to SMPA, the post-processing module consists of perturbation assignment and O-D prioritization schemes. Perturbation assignment provides <b>warm</b> <b>start</b> and the O-D prioritization improves the rate of convergence by deciding the sequence in which the O-D pairs are brought into the flow update process. A detailed implementation procedure for perturbation assignment is developed along with six different criteria for O-D prioritization. Computational experiments using the Sioux Falls, Anaheim and Borman Corridor networks provide insights on these techniques. Results of the computational experiments show that SMPA has a superior rate of convergence compared to state-of-the-practice algorithms even without O-D prioritization and <b>warm</b> <b>start.</b> Results of computational experiments further reveal that a <b>warm</b> <b>start</b> using perturbation assignment and O-D prioritization provides significant benefits in improving the convergence properties and obtaining a more stable solution...|$|E

However, mathematical optimization of the solution algorithm is difficult because of discretized space and time, and as a result solution algorithm computation times measured in hours or even days can discourage use. This work compares and analyzes experimental results from two types of potential techniques for reducing computation time: a static traffic assignment (STA) <b>warm</b> <b>start</b> to DTA, and existing and novel heuristics from variations on the iii method of successive averages to gradient-based methods similar to those used in STA. <b>Warm</b> <b>start</b> results indicate the potential for increases in time and possibly solution convergence.

Such {{problems arise}} in parametric value-at-risk minimization, portfolio optimization, and robust optimization with ellipsoidal objective uncertainty; {{and they can}} be solved by polynomial interior point algorithms for conic quadratic optimization.

We test the simplex-based quadratic programming algorithms to solve convex as well as discrete instances and compare them with the state-of-the-art approaches. The computational experiments indicate that the proposed algorithms scale much better than interior point algorithms and return higher precision solutions. In our experiments, for large convex instances, they provide up to 22 x speed-up.
