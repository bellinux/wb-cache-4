It is not as from [...] "the meadows" [...] a view of the cathedral only, but of the whole town, amidst its circle of vast green downs. It has a beautiful aspect from that point: a red-brick and red-tiled town, set low on that circumscribed space, whose soft, brilliant green is in lovely contrast with the paler hue of the downs beyond, the perennial moist green of its water-meadows. For many swift, clear currents flow around and through Salisbury, and doubtless in former days there were many more channels in the town itself. Leland's description is worth quoting: [...] "There be many fair streates in the Cite Saresbyri, and especially the High Streate and Castle Streate.... Al the Streates in a maner, in New Saresbyri, hath little streamlettes and arms derivyd out of Avon that runneth through them. The site of the very town of Saresbyri and much ground thereabout is playne and low, and as a pan or receyvor of most part of the waters of Wiltshire." ...|$|E

If, for instance, you have a thoroughly rascally couple making a living by infamous means and bringing up their children to their trade, the king's proctor, instead of pursuing his present purely mischievous function of preventing couples from being divorced by proving that they both desire it, might very well intervene and divorce these children from their parents. At present, if the Queen herself were to rescue some unfortunate child from degradation and misery and place her in a respectable home, and some unmentionable pair of blackguards claimed the child and proved that they were its father and mother, the child would be given to them {{in the name of the}} sanctity of the home and the holiness of parentage, after perpetrating which crime the law would calmly send an education officer to take the child out of the parents' hands several hours a day in the still more sacred name of compulsory education. (Of course what would really happen would be that the couple would blackmail the Queen for their consent to the salvation of the child, unless, indeed, a hint from a police inspector convinced them that bad characters cannot always rely on pedantically constitutional treatment when they come into conflict with persons in high station).|$|E

In the theoretical part I will explain the basic elements of drawing, that will later function as a platform for understanding complex artworks and try to explain the process of becoming through following the development of drawing from modernism to contemporary art. Margret Davidson said, in the introduction to her book Contemporary Drawing: Key concepts and Techniques (2011), that drawing has in fact changed and that anyone could notice it even at a cursory glance. Drawing has become an autonomous practice, and does not exist solely as a sketch anymore. My Bachelor Thesis also contains the practical part, that consists of my personal explorations into the subject as well as realizations, and documentations of my pedagogical practice. ...|$|R

5000|$|Williams later wrote: I became Swamp Dogg in 1970 {{in order}} to have an alter-ego and someone to occupy the body while the search party was out looking for Jerry Williams, who was mentally missing in action due to certain pressures, mal-treatments and failure to get paid {{royalties}} on over fifty single records.... Most all of the tracks included were recorded in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and Macon, Georgia, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> how the name Swamp Dogg came about. Jerry Wexler, Atlantic Records v.p. and producer/innovator second to none, was recording in the newly discovered mecca of funk Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He coined the term [...] "Swamp Music" [...] for this awesome funk predominately played by all white musicians accompanying the R'n'B institutions e.g., Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, King Curtis... I was also using the same [...] "swamp" [...] players. I was tired of being a jukebox, singing all of the hits by Chuck Jackson, Ben E. King, etc., and being an R'n'B second banana. I couldn't dance as good as Joe Tex, wasn't pretty like Tommy Hunt, couldn't compare vocally to Jackie Wilson and I didn't have the sex appeal of Daffy Duck. I wanted to sing about everything and anything and not be pigeonholed by the industry. So I came up with the name Dogg because a dog can do anything, and anything a dog does never comes as a real surprise; if he sleeps on the sofa, shits on the rug, pisses on the drapes, chews up your slippers, humps your mother-in-law's leg, jumps on your new clothes and licks your face, he's never gotten out of character. You understand what he did, you curse while making allowances for him but your love for him never diminishes. Commencing in 1970, I sung about sex, niggers, love, rednecks, war, peace, dead flies, home wreckers, Sly Stone, my daughters, politics, revolution and blood transfusions (just to name a few), and never got out of character. Recording in Alabama and sincerely singing/writing about items that interested me, gave birth to the name Swamp Dogg.|$|E

At this time we had a girl in the house, whose sweet face is one of a little group of half a dozen which I remember most vividly. She was a niece of our shepherd's wife, an Argentine woman married to an Englishman, and came to us to look after the smaller children. She was nineteen years old, a pale, slim, pretty girl, with large dark eyes and abundant black hair. Margarita had the sweetest smile imaginable, the softest voice and gentlest manner, and was so much loved by everybody in the house that she was like one of the family. Unhappily she was consumptive, and after a few months had to be sent back to her aunt. Their little place was only half a mile or so from the house, and every day my mother visited her, doing all that was possible with such skill and remedies as she possessed to give her ease, and providing her with delicacies. The girl did not want a priest to visit her and prepare her for death; she worshipped her mistress, and wished to be of the same faith, and in the end she died a pervert or convert, according to this or that person's point of view.|$|R

In the theoretical part I will explain the basic elements of drawing, that will later function as a platform for understanding complex artworks and try to explain the process of becoming through following the development of drawing from modernism to contemporary art. Margret Davidson said, in the introduction to her book Contemporary Drawing: Key concepts and Techniques (2011), that drawing has in fact changed and that anyone could notice it even at a cursory glance. Drawing has become an autonomous practice, and does not exist solely as a sketch anymore. My Bachelor Thesis also contains the practical part, that consists of my personal explorations into the subject as well as realizations, and documentations of my pedagogical practice...|$|R
60|$|This {{is already}} the third time I have taken up pen to write to you, but, having nothing but misfortune to recount, I hesitated, {{awaiting}} better days. Indeed, I have been so profoundly discouraged that if I had not thought it my duty {{to let you know}} of my fortunes I know not even now if I should have found the necessary spirit. 'Les choses vont de mal en mal'. From what I hear there has never been so bad a season here. Nothing going on. All the same, I am tormented by a mob of little matters <b>which</b> <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> not sufficient <b>to</b> support my life. I know not what to do; one thing is certain, in no case shall I return here another year. The patron of this hotel, my good employer, is one of those innumerable specimens who do not forge or steal because they have no need, and if they had would lack the courage; who observe the marriage laws because they have been brought up to believe in them, and know that breaking them brings risk and loss of reputation; who do not gamble because they dare not; do not drink because it disagrees with them; go to church because their neighbours go, and to procure an appetite for the mid-day meal; commit no murder because, not transgressing in any other fashion, they are not obliged. What is there to respect in persons of this sort? Yet they are highly esteemed, and form three quarters of Society. The rule with these good gentlemen is to shut their eyes, never use their thinking powers, and close the door on all the dogs of life for fear they should get bitten.|$|R
6000|$|I {{find your}} {{beautiful}} tragic wail on my {{return from a}} wondrous, miraculous motor tour of three weeks and a day with these admirable friends of ours, who so serve one up all the luxuries {{of the season and}} all the ripe fruits of time that one's overloaded plate will hold. We got back from--from everywhere, literally--last night; and in presence of a table groaning under arrears and calendars and other stationery I can but, as it were, fold you in my arms. You talk of sad and fearful things ... and I don't {{know what to say to}} you (at least in this poor inky, scratchy way.) What I should like to be able to say is that I will come down to Rome and see you even now; but this alas is not in my power without my altering all sorts of other pressing arrangements and combinations already made. I do hope to go to Rome for a little--a very little--stay later; but not before the middle or 20th of May; a time--a generally emptier, quieter time--I greatly prefer there to any other. It is of extreme importance <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be (to remain) in Paris till May 1st--I haven't been here for years and shall probably never once again be here (or [...] "come abroad" [...] once again, like you) for the rest of my natural life. Ergo I am taking what there is of it for me--I can't afford, as it were, not to. And I have made my plans (if they hold) for approaching Italy by South Germany, Vienna, Trieste, Venice &c.--all of <b>which</b> will <b>bring</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Rome by the 20th of May about, when, I fear, you will well nigh--or certainly--have cleared out altogether. From Rome and Florence ... I shall return straight home--where at least, then, I must infallibly see you. Or shall you pass through this place--homeward--before May 1st? The gentlest of lionesses bids me tell you what a tenderest welcome you would have from them. Hold up your heart, meanwhile, and remember, for God's sake, that there is a point beyond which the follies and infirmities of our friends and our proches have no right to ravage and wreck our own independence of soul. That quantity is too precious a contribution to the saving human sum of good, of lucidity, and we are responsible for the entretien of it. So keep yours, shake yours, up--well up--my dearest friend, and to this end believe in your admirable human use. To be [...] "crushed" [...] is to be of no use; and I for one insist that you shall be of some, and the most delightful, <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Feel everything, tant que vous voudrez--but then soar superior and don't leave tatters of your precious person on every bush that happens to bristle with all the avidities and egotisms. We shall judge it all sanely and taste it all wisely and talk of it all (even) thrillingly--and profitably--yet; and I depend on your keeping that appointment with me. This is all, dearest Howard, now. I almost blush to break through your obsessions to the point of saying that my three weeks of really seeing this large incomparable France in our friend's chariot of fire has been almost the time of my life. It's the old travelling-carriage way glorified and raised to the 100th power. Will you very kindly say to Maud Story for me, with my love, that I am coming to Rome very nearly all to see her. I bless your companions and am your tout dévoué ...|$|R
